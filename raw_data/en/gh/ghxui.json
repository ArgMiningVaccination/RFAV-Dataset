Welcome to Twenty-Eighth Cubeta UBRP Director UBRP Assistant Director UBRP, for 28 years, has taught students to apply the scientific method to address unanswered questions--to establish truth by developing hypotheses, testing the hypotheses and collecting data, and accepting or rejecting the hypotheses based on data. The point is to establish an accurate, reliable, consistent, and non-arbitrary representation of the world. While the scientific method is essential to advancing our scientific knowledge, it can be applied in making decisions more broadly in society. In this era of fake news, scientific method is an invaluable tool. Today we all have an opportunity to hear from the students about what they discovered about the problem they are studying, about the conduct of science, and about themselves. The conference provides the opportunity to celebrate successes and to discuss failures. Ask any student presenting today what s/he learned by doing research and every one of them will have something to say about the things that didn't work. Perseverance is a trait that all of them cultivate. Part of the scientific process is finding a way to move forward even if the initial approach to a problem didn't yield the expected results. Research also relies on objectivity - the willingness to see things for what they are--which is not always what one hypothesized. These lessons in perseverance and objectivity are valuable in realms beyond science. More than 130 students are presenting their work today. Some did research on the UA campus, others did research in other countries (science is an international endeavor), and still others were involved at the Barrow Neurological Institute and the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoneix, Northern Arizona University, and Arizona Western College. A broad range of topics is represented. Today's presenters spent weeks designing and conducing experiments, collecting data, interpreting findings, and developing posters to explain what they have learned. The abstracts of posters being presented appear in this booklet and on the UBRP website at www.ubrp.arizona.edu. To get the complete story though, talk to the students! You will not only learn some really interesting things, but you will develop an appreciation for the value of inquiry-based learning in the education of undergraduate students! Enjoy the conference!

You are not expected to be an expert in science; we invite our visitors to simply be curious and to ask questions! Can you walk me through your poster? How did you get involved in research? What excites you about doing research? What is the 'take home' message from your poster? Our students will be happy to share their research experiences with you! Along with the list of abstracts located in this booklet, you can use the Topical Guide to UBRP Conference Posters handout to help you identify posters of interest. To give our own students a chance to see each others' work, half of our students will be presenting their posters from 2:00pm to 3:15pm and the other half will be presenting from 3:15pm to 4:30pm.

PAGEL, JULIO CARDENAS-RODRIGUEZ Measuring the pH of a tumor is an essential part of diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The current method of measuring pH involves a complex MRI scan protocol and contains limitations on the contrast agents that can be used in the scans. Our goal was to develop a method that is more clinically accessible and allows for a more broad use of contrast agent molecules. The method will rely upon the chemical exchange of water with the agent molecule and T2 exchange. Using machine learning, we implement the data acquired through MRI to create a computer program that accurately predicts the pH of a system independent of agent concentration. UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT 3-DIMENSIONAL GENOME ORGANIZATIONS SOPHIA AGUIRRE, GREGORY ROGERS Recent studies identified the condensin II subunit Chromosome-associated Protein H2 (CapH2) as a master-regulator (CT) formation in melanogaster. non-degradable Cap-H2 interphase cells disrupts homologous chromosome pairing, inducing chromosome individualization and the formation of distinct CTs. By manipulating this new regulatory pathway, it is now possible to investigate the function of different 3-dimensional chromosome organizations in cells by comparing the expression patterns of cells containing paired chromosomes to those with CTs. To obtain cells containing CTs we generated stable, inducible Schneider 2 (S2) cell lines that express wild-type (WT) Cap-H2. Cells were scored for the formation of normal, weak, and strong CTs over a six-day time course. We also conducted cell viability counts on CapH2-expressing cells to determine the effect of CTs on cell health. We found that strong CT formation was most prevalent after six days of Cap-H2 expression. However, cell cultures expressing WT Cap-H2 displayed a reduced number of viable cells over the six day time course. Taken together, we conclude that it requires almost a week of WT Cap-H2 induction for most stable cells to form CTs and cause reduced cell health. At present, we are making stable lines expressing non-degradable Cap-H2 in order to induce faster genomic reorganization so that we can examine CT function. This research was supported by the NIH MARC Training Grant T34 GM08718. AGE-RELATED ATTENTIONAL CONTROL AND SET SHIFTING IMPAIRMENTS ARISE INDEPENDENTLY IN MACAQUE MONKEYS KATHERINE ANDERSH, D.T. GRAY, A.C. SMITH, S.N. BURKE, A. GAZZALEY, C.A. BARNES Goal-directed behaviors provide the behavioral flexibility necessary for selecting appropriate responses when similar stimuli are encountered in different contexts. The cognitive processes that provide this flexibility have been collectively described under the category of executive functions. Executive function can be segregated into at least 3 separate components: inhibition of prepotent responses, set shifting, and attentional control and monitoring. In humans, partially non-overlapping neural networks in the prefrontal cortex underlie the different components of the executive function network. For example, orbitofrontal and striatal networks have been shown to underlie set shifting, while dorsolateral prefrontal and medial prefrontal networks have been shown to underlie attentional control processes. At the behavioral level, age-related impairments in inhibition, set shifting, and attentional control arise independently of one another, suggesting that the separate neural networks that underlie these behaviors are also altered independently with age. To test whether different executive 18 functions are similarly affected independently in the macaque, young (n = 6) and aged (n = 7) monkeys were tested on a set shifting and attentional control task in a Wisconsin general testing apparatus. The results show that aged monkeys were deficient on both tasks, but the impairments scores between the two paradigms did not correlate, suggesting that set shifting impaired animals were not necessarily impaired on the attentional control task and vice versa. These results suggest that, like in humans, executive functions in aged monkeys are impacted by normative aging independently. Furthermore, these data argue against the suggestion that the age-related deficits in attentional control seen in aged humans arise due to differences in exposure to technology, relative to young, which may negatively impact their ability to perform computerized tasks. All monkeys in the current study were exposed equally to all aspects of the task environment, suggesting that the detrimental effects seen in the aged individuals are in fact due to differences in attentional control processes. This work was supported by the MARC Training Grant T34 GM 08718, NIH Grant R01 AG050548, and by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation. INCREASING SENSITIVITY FOR KISSPEPTIN ACTIVATION OF BETA-CELL INSULIN SECRETION BY LINKING TO GLP-1 ADAM ARAGAKI, SABINE HARRINGTON, CRAIG WEBER, RON LYNCH Kisspeptin, a neurotransmitter, has previously been implicated in reproductive signalling and energy balance. Recent evidence suggests that kisspeptin may be involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells. However, as concentrations required for effect are so high (uM), it is unlikely that it would act as an endocrine agent. GLP-1 also modulates insulin secretion from -cells, yet requires only nanomolar concentrations. We hypothesized that by physically linking these two agents together, we could increase the local concentration of kisspeptin, bringing it into therapeutic concentrations. In these experiments, we used insulin secretion as a functional marker for agent activity on INS 832/3 -cells. kiss-5 and kiss-10 were utilized as functional 5 and 10 amino acid fragments from the N terminus of kisspeptin, respectively. Though both exhibited similar effective concentrations, kiss-10 showed propensity for a larger maximal response. Moreover, both Kiss-5 and Kiss-10 exhibited additive activity to that of GLP-1, at both agents' maximal monomeric concentrations. Due to the clear additive relationship between Kisspeptin with GLP-1 (which implies the presence of two distinct downstream signaling pathways), we constructed a Kiss-10/GLP-1 dimer and compared this to monomeric GLP-1, and the combination of both monomers. Potentiation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was observed at 10 nM with a saturation point at ~50 nM, and there was no significant difference in response when compared to GLP-1 alone at 100 nM. Overall, this work sets a basis for the design and testing of a unique bivalent ligand composed of a high affinity domain (GLP-1) linked to a much lower affinity domain (Kiss-10) which demonstrates an additive effect on insulin secretion and therefore may show enhanced specificity and activity for modulating -cell function.

LUKAS, PAUL WHITEAKER Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is one of the most common causes of mental deterioration in the elderly. Several studies have correlated the cognitive severity of early-onset AD with a loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. However, the precise mechanisms underlying cholinergic neurodegeneration and subsequent memory impairments remain unknown. Recently, a novel nAChR, containing only 7 and 2 subunits, has been identified on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. This subtype is highly sensitive to functional blockade by amyloid-beta (A). As demonstrated in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, A/72-nAChR interactions lead to neuronal homeostatic instability and subsequent hyperexcitation (Liu et al. 2009). In an ongoing effort, this project will delineate the relationship between A/72-nAChR interactions and level of 2 expression through a combination of neuropharmacological and electrophysiological techniques. We have used two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing either 7 or 72 nAChR. We tested several concatenated 72-nAChR subtypes to understand the relationship between A as it relates to the structural 19 and functional characteristics of 7 and 72 nAChR. To characterize the differences between 7-containing and 72-containing nAChRs, we tested the maximal current responses of these receptor subtypes with the endogenous 7 nAChR ligands acetylcholine (ACh) and choline. Using an EC100 concentration of ACh (10 mM), we observed open-channel block of the 72-containing nAChR. This effect was identified using an alternative depolarization protocol. Therefore, an EC100 concentration of choline (10 mM) was used to characterize the maximal function of these receptors without producing open-channel block. Future studies will delineate the structure/function relationship between A isoforms (monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar) and concatenated 7 and 72 nAChR. Moreover, we will characterize the stoichiometries that confer high-affinity A interactions using choline as the primary nAChR agonist. This research is relevant to prevention or treatment of AD. For example, it will provide a set of novel therapeutic targets that may disrupt critical A/72-nAChR interactions and/or stabilize neuronal hyperexcitation directly. This work was supported by an ASPET SURF grant to the University of Arizona. OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING IN EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER OLIVIA AUSTIN, FAITH RICE, JEN KOEVARY, CAITLIN HOWARD, JENNIFER BARTON Ovarian cancer is currently the fifth deadliest cancer type among women. Since it is relatively silent, presenting few or no symptoms, ovarian cancer is often not caught in patients until it has advanced significantly. This study focused on using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to detect this cancer earlier than is currently possible in the clinic. The produced images are high resolution cross-sectional views of tissue that facilitate in catching smaller lesions that traditional imaging methods such as pelvic ultrasound would not catch. The OCT method was tested by first using a mouse model to mimic the development of ovarian cancer in humans. The two groups of mice tested were genetically engineered MISIIR-TAg mice, which spontaneously develop bilateral epithelial ovarian cancer over time, and wild type mice, which do not. Both groups of mice were imaged at four weeks and eight weeks old. In this way, normal ovaries can be observed next to ovaries that may or may not develop cancer, giving a reliable way to track the cancer's development in various mice since the baseline for how healthy ovaries should appear is known. The mouse model also allows control over the disease, providing a definitive timeline dictating when the transgenic mice will get ovarian cancer. Thus, another aspect that can be observed using the mouse model is whether the images at the first time point are indicative of eventual disease development by the second time point or further in the future. To access and image the ovaries, they either removed and imaged ex vivo, or surgically externalized by making a small incision through the abdomen and gently holding the ovaries outside the body. Initial OCT images show enlargement of the ovaries and loss if normal follicular structure in the transgenic animals. Moving forward, a new OCT imaging system that will be capable of faster in vivo imaging is being programmed.

MEDINA, STEPHANIE J. MUNGER, JULIE E. MILLER 20 THERMOREGULATION INFLUENCE ON BODY SIZE IN BUMBLE BEES GILDA BARBOSA, ANNA DORNHAUS Size variation was tested in worker bumble bees through thermal analysis of their nest. Although, members of the Hymenoptera have fixed body shape & size, size variation is present in Bombus impatiens leading up to a tenfold in difference. Here, we focus on their ability to thermoregulate and maintain temperatures in their nests. INVESTIGATING EFFECTS OF TDP-43 ON METABOLIC GENE EXPRESSION IN A DROSOPHILA MODEL OF AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS JORDAN BARROWS, O'CONNER, ARCHI JOARDAR, DANIELA C. ZARNESCU Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons, disrupting muscle function, which eventually leads to death by respiratory failure. TDP-43, a DNA/RNA binding protein that plays numerous roles in RNA processing, has been associated with RNA stress granule pathology in over 95% of ALS cases. TDP-43 has also been linked to dysregulation of specific mRNA targets at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Metabolomic analyses demonstrated that several metabolites in glycolysis and the TCA cycle are altered in Drosophila larvae expressing human TDP-43 compared to controls, suggesting that enzymes within these metabolic pathways are being affected in ALS. To confirm this hypothesis, we are using the GAL4-UAS system in Drosophila to express TDP-43 specifically in the motor neurons or glia. Indeed, transcriptional profiling shows expression levels are altered in the context of TDPWT or disease associated TDPG298S. These findings are consistent with increased glycolysis and high levels of pyruvate identified using metabolomics in TDP-43 expressing flies. Current experiments are aimed at identifying additional transcriptional and translational alterations in metabolic pathways that control cellular energetics. Next, we will use genetic approaches to reduce (in the case of upregulation) or increase (in the case of downregulation) the expression levels of metabolic genes in the context of TDP-43. These experiments will determine whether restoring specific targets can rescue TDP-43 dependent phenotypes. This combination of molecular and genetic analyses will establish physiologically significant targets of TDP-43 that can be used for developing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.

USING ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY TO CONTRAST THE DIFFERENCE IN STROKE VOLUME BETWEEN A DIABETIC AND NON-DIABETIC HEART DURING EXERCISE LYLE BECENTI, CHRIS BALDI, GENEVIEVE WILSON There are previous studies that have utilized echocardiogram imaging tests to measure the stroke volume of a diabetic heart at rest, but few have addressed the stroke volume in a type 2 diabetic heart during exercise. We focused on the values of echocardiography and measuring the stroke volume between two groups, type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic under three conditions, 1.) at rest, 2.) 40% maximum heart rate, and 3.) 60% maximum heart rate during low- to moderate-intense cycling. We hypothesized that a type 2 diabetic heart will have a smaller increase in stroke volume during exercise in comparison to a non-diabetic heart. The ECG images were collected from ten participants, five type 2 diabetic and five non-diabetic controls. Echocardiogram images at the different conditions, were uploaded on the EchoPAC program, a clinical software that investigates ultrasound images, and analyzed to measure the stroke volume of the left ventricle. The data collected using 2DE tracings and biplane disk summation measuring, were visualized on an excel spreadsheet to exemplify the difference in stroke volume between diabetic and non-diabetic participants. There was a statistically significant difference between the non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic groups based upon their stroke volume p=0.0122. At rest, the diabetes group averaged 30.2 mL per 21 beat, while the control group averaged 51.2 mL. At 40% of maximum heart rate, the diabetes group averaged 37.6 mL, while the control group 48.6 mL. At 60% of maximum heart rate, the diabetes group averaged 45.2 mL, while the control group averaged 59.2 mL. Thus, the average stroke volume in a type 2 diabetic heart has a small increase in comparison to a non-diabetic heart. Echocardiogram imaging tests are advanced diagnostic tools that has proven to screen for serious complications and poor exercise intolerance in a diabetic heart. It has the potential to investigate a diabetic heart during low- to high-intense exercise and provide possible indications for cardiac improvement whilst the heart is under stress. RELATION OF MEAN ARTERIAL AND PULSE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS TO COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS MARISA BECERRA, GENE ALEXANDER Understanding the factors that contribute to successful aging has long been of interest to the scientific community. Blood pressure in adults represents one factor thought to impact differences in their cognitive function as they age. This study evaluated, in 208 healthy, older (50-89) adults the potential associations between mean arterial pressure or pulse pressure and cognition. We also examined the possibility of an interaction between gender and blood pressure measurements. The subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that included measures of global cognitive function, memory, processing speed, executive function, and language. After controlling for age, education, and hypertension status, mean arterial pressure showed a positive association with performance in measures of language and processing speed, but no association with memory, executive function, or global cognitive function. Though pulse pressure measurements showed no significant effects, there was a trend for higher pulse pressure resulting in poor performance on global cognitive function. In addition, we observed significant gender differences in all of the tested cognitive domains, except for language, but no interactions between gender and blood pressure measurements. Females did exhibit a significant relationship between mean arterial pressure and scores on language and processing speed tasks, whereas males showed no relationship. Overall, these findings provide preliminary support for the importance of mean arterial pressure and gender as factors that may influence observed differences in cognitive aging.

AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WORKSHOPS FOR NAVAJO NATION LILLIAN BEDONIE, CINDY BECKETT Does providing the Navajo Nation law enforcement providers and community members comprehensive domestic violence prevention training as compared to current practices of incident management only impact domestic violence occurrences and outcomes within a 12-month period? Currently there are limited to no training provided for law enforcement and healthcare provider, and no refresher courses or awareness offered. After reviewing the literature, we can use the information to create workshops that would consist of: Creating a classroom setting with presentations: power point and videos Case Studies that will be role played for better practice Descriptive and Par T-Test Statistics Pre and Post tests My hope for this project is to help providers gain a better understanding and to have empathy for victims and to not only give awareness through a job setting but also community awareness. 22 CREATING AND DISSEMINATING NAVIGATION MATERIALS FOR THE TOHONO O'ODHAM CANCER PROGRAM MELANIE BEGAYE, MARY KOITHAN In comparison to the general U.S. population, cancer mortality risks are higher in Native American populations. Primary causes of this disparity include delayed diagnosis and treatments which is a consequence of multiple factors, including health literacy. The purpose of this project was to translate introductory overviews of common cancers into the Tohono O'odham (TO) language in the form of video productions. The cancer education materials translated into TO were written evidence-based overviews created at the University of Arizona College of Nursing. Tohono O'odham translators worked in pairs to ensure standardized terminology during translations. After audio translations were recorded and edited by project staff for clarity, the audio tracks were integrated with title cards, captions, and culturally appropriate images to create video files. TO translators reviewed the video file drafts to check for accuracy and suggest changes. Once finalized, the videos were burned onto DVDs for dissemination. A final video was shown at a Tohono O'odham Cancer Partnership (TOCP) meeting for material usability evaluation by TOCP staff. The usability questionnaire used to evaluate the videos contained 11 Likert items and 5 open ended questions. Responses were analyzed using basic descriptive statistics and content analysis. Questionnaire responses were generally positive, with 100% of present TO speakers understanding the video narration. The first usability evaluation results will be used to improve future navigation material creation for patients and Community Health Representatives. Having introductory materials readily available in their native language should improve health literacy and, as a result, promote cancer prevention and early detection on the TO Nation. UA Grant # 2U54CA143924. A NOVEL PEPTIDE APTAMER type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic disease characterized by tumors in the nervous system, neurological disorders and by chronic pain. Rats with loss of neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the Nf1 gene, showed increases in voltage-gated calcium and voltage-gated sodium currents in sensory neurons, as well as behavioral hyperalgesia. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) regulates activity of these channels, and also binds to the C-terminus of neurofibromin suggesting a possible mechanism driving NF1 pain. The present work describes the characterization of a novel tool - CRMP2 Neurofibromin Regulating Peptide 1 (CNRP1) - a small peptide from CRMP2 that is useful for studying the role of the CRMP2/Neurofibromin complex in sensory neurons from rats. Using constellation pharmacology, a paradigm for functional fingerprinting of neurons, we chronicle the activity of this novel peptide. This research was supported by a Neurofibromatosis New Investigator Award from the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Military Medical Research and Development Program (NF1000099) to R.K and a Young Investigator's Award from the Children's Tumor Foundation to A.M. CHARACTERIZATION OF A MOUSE ABP KNOCKOUT LINE: EXPRESSION OF THREE SALIVARY PROTEIN GENES PHILLIP BELONE, AMANDA G. CHUNG, ROBERT C. KARN, CHRISTINA M. LAUKAITIS Androgen Binding Protein (ABP) is thought to mediate mouse preference to mate with its own subspecies rather than with a foreign one. In this capacity, it apparently produces incipient reinforcement on the European mouse hybrid zone. We have recently created a line of knockout mice with the goal of further elucidating the function of ABP. This line has Abpa27 and Abpbg27, two of the three genes expressed in mouse saliva, knocked out leaving only Abpbg26 potentially expressed in that serous fluid. We have characterized this line using histology and anti-ABP immunostaining to detect ABP proteins and qPCR to 23 detect Abp transcripts. Across the three genotypes of mice (+/+, +/- and -/-, where + represents the normal alleles and - the knockout alleles), we found no differences in tissue architecture, fecundity of -/- mice, viability of offspring from +/- intercrosses, or their growth. In our studies of knockout (-/-) submandibular cDNA libraries, we found no evidence that the a27 and bg27 genes are transcribed. We also immunostained electrophoretically separated salivary proteins electroblotted onto PVDF membranes no evidence of the A27:BG27 and A27:BG26 dimeric protein products of these genes. However, we have evidence that -/- animals still express the bg26 transcripts in the cDNA libraries, and we are currently pursuing experiments to determine whether these are translated to produce the BG26 subunit protein. If BG26 is produced, we wish to determine if it is secreted from the submaxillary glands into saliva. LOOKING AT TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS ANTS AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SUCROSE GABRIELA BENAVIDES, NICOLE FISCHER, ANNA DORNHAUS Eusocial hymenoptera (e.g. ants, wasps, bees) show division of labor, which is a system in which individual ants in a colony specialize in differing tasks, and each task is completed by a specific set of individual ants. Overall the question being asked is what is the mechanism of division of labor? Are ants eclosed with the capabilities of choosing their tasks? Do ants have intrinsic differences or are they all the same and choose their task after seeing it? These intrinsic differences would also be known as the Response Threshold Mechanism. Response threshold refers to the chance or likelihood of reacting to a certain task that is associated with a certain stimuli. A low threshold ants will perform a task at a lower level of stimuli that a high threshold ant. This experiment specifically tests if touching an ants antennae with a different stimuli, this being different concentrations of sucrose, will support the ants having different response thresholds. We hypothesize that either the individual ants will have differences in Response Threshold to sucrose or they will not. DEFINING MECHANISMS OF SENSITIVITY AND RESISTANCE TO HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS IN DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Histone deacetylases have a large role in cancer cell survival due to their anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative functions and can be targeted therapeutically for cancer treatment. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been recently approved as anti-cancer therapeutics. However, as monotherapy, their therapeutic efficacy against B-cell derived lymphomas, such as DLBCL, is low. As a result, research efforts have shifted to using HDACi in combination therapies. Efficient use of HDACi in combination treatments against these lymphomas is hindered by a poor understanding of their mechanisms of action. To address this, we developed a pre-clinical model system of sensitivity and resistance to the pan-HDACi, belinostat, using DLBCL cell lines. Cell lines sensitive to belinostat undergo mitotic arrest, followed by apoptosis. Cell lines resistant to belinostat are delayed in mitotic progression, but complete mitosis and arrest in G1. To force mitotic arrest in HDACi-resistant cell lines, we used a microtubule targeting agent, vincristine, in combination with belinostat and observed cytotoxicity downregulated expression of anti-apoptotic factor MCL-1 and upregulated pro-apoptotic factor BIM. To understand the role of individual HDACs in DLBCL cell cycle progression, we assessed the responses of DLBCL cell lines to selective HDAC inhibitors in comparison to belinostat, which targets both class I and class II HDAC complexes. HDAC1 & 2 inhibition resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest in belinostat-resistant and sensitive cell lines, indicating that HDACs 1 and 2 promote G1 progression to S phase. HDAC3 inhibition resulted in the induction of DNA damage, increased S phase cell population, and the induction of apoptosis in belinostat-resistant cells, suggesting that HDAC3 plays a role in DNA replication and damage repair. In combination with vincristine, all selective inhibitors increased apoptosis beyond vincristine alone in a synergistic manner, although less potently than the belinostat-vincristine combination. Lastly, we tested two class I selective inhibitors, CI-994 and apicidin, that target HDACs 1-3. Our results suggest that all class I HDAC-containing complexes must be targeted to observe maximal cytotoxicity in combination with vincristine in belinostat-resistant cell lines. 24 ALTERATIONS IN GROWTH, MORPHOLOGY AND -SYNUCLEIN IN HUMAN DERMAL L. MADHAVAN Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects around 2% of the aging population worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of PD are not well understood, and remain an active area of investigation. In our lab, we are using human dermal fibroblasts from persons diagnosed with late-onset sporadic PD and age-matched control (AMC) individuals as a model to study PD mechanisms. The advantage of this cell-type is that it can be relatively easily obtained, and reflects the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic modifications occurring during the age-associated progression of the PD in a patient-specific manner. In our studies, we have found differences between the PD and AMC fibroblasts in terms of their growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, PD fibroblasts grew faster and in organized streams in culture, and were also observed to be smaller and rounder, compared to AMC fibroblasts. We have also found that the PD fibroblasts immunocytochemically express greater levels of the protein Alpha-Synuclein (-Syn), a PD relevant protein, in comparison to AMC cells. Given that -Syn can affect cytoskeletal dynamics, we are currently exploring its potential contribution to the growth and morphology changes observed in the PD fibroblasts in culture. First, we are systematically characterizing the actin and tubulin network structure in the patient cells. Initial results using Phalloidin, a stain for F-actin, indicate differences in actin organization between the PD and AMC cells. We are also analyzing the tubulin structure using - and -tubulin antibodies, and studying the localization of -Syn as it relates to actin and tubulin. Overall, we expect these studies to shed light on cytoskeletal alterations in the context of -Syn and its role in PD.

BEE LEARNING MADALENA BIRR, DAVID KIKUCHI, ANNA DORNHAUS Bombus impatiens are a species of bumblebees known to change their behavior in situations based on past experiences- or learn. There are costs for bees to learn- either energetic or time. For example, if a bee were to visit an unfamiliar flower it could reap a higher or lower amount/quality of nectar, if it gained from the visit, it could benefit from the new knowledge of knowing this flower was better than the ones it had visited, but if the flower was worse it would have wasted energy and time that it could have spent foraging its normal flowers. Depending on the weight of these costs, bees will either learn, or not adjust their behavior. This experiment will focus on training bees to associate good and bad resources with a certain color and then testing them to see if they continue to use that knowledge when faced with ambiguous resources by training each bee with fur training trials using two colored flowers for sucrose and two colored flowers for water or quinine. After the four training trials, they were out into the arena with flowers containing colors from both the good and bad flower combinations. While the bees that were tested did show a slight learning curve for the colors, what we found was that they relied more on tasting the nectar first by dipping their tongues in to decide whether or not to begin to forage. The bees used a predator behavioral adaption described by the Go Slow Hypothesis which reduced the cost it would take for the bees to fully learn the flower colors. This research was able to be done thanks to the PERT grant from the NIH. 25 FIBRILIN-1 EXPRESSION IN ARSENIC EXPOSURE JONATHAN BLOHM, BINH CHAU, R. CLARK LANTZ Arsenic, a natural occurring metalloid found in our Earth's crust and soil, has been found to be a prime suspect for the onset of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases later on in life. We used C57BL/6 Mice exposed to arsenic through drinking water at 100 ppb or less, through development over a duration of 4 weeks. Drinking water with arsenic levels at 50 ppb or greater was studied in correlation with the EPA's old water safety standards. After exposure, lungs were harvested to identify changes in epithelial protein expression. In reference to previous studies in R. Clark Lantz PhD's lab at the University of Arizona, several genes corresponding to collagen and elastin, which are part of smooth muscle tissue in lung epithelium were found to have been irreversibly altered following exposure to arsenic in drinking water. As a continuation of these studies, using morphometric protein expression analysis, FBN1, known as fibrilin-1 gene was analyzed for relative expression in lung epithelial tissue of the mice exposed to arsenic. FBN1 gene coding for fibrilin-1 binds to form filaments known as microfibrils that specifically correlate to tissue elasticity and structural support throughout the body. Therefore, the FBN1 gene expression may further demonstrate a connection between arsenic exposure and changes in pulmonary function of the mice. R25 Bombus impatiens and other social insects experience size variation as a result of evolutionary selection on the colony as a combined unit. Commonly, size variation is thought to improve the efficiency of the colony through the use of division of labor but it could also improve the robustness of the colony through different individuals being adapted to different environments. When bumblebee colonies experience random starvation periods, smaller bees, who appear less efficient than larger bees but more resistant to starvation, could potentially survive and therefore keep the colony alive. We tested the hypothesis that variation improves colony efficiency or colony robustness. We manipulated the size distributions (wide and narrow) of bumblebee colonies to see the effect it had on the amount of worker biomass produced by the colony on a weekly basis. The amount of biomass was measured to determine if a wide body size distribution would increase, decrease, or not affect the ability of the colony to produce more worker biomass. The size distribution of workers didn't improve colony performance under constant or variable conditions as the amount of biomass produced by either distribution did not differ (p=0.945 and p=0.378 respectively). Thus, body size variation appears to improve neither colony efficiency nor colony robustness. If the pattern holds true after additional data collection, this would mean that there's no selection against variation, and suggest that variation in other systems should not always be assumed to be adaptive. Funding for this research comes from the University of Arizona (Research and Funding Grant). EFFECTS OF PERINATAL NICOTINE EXPOSURE ON CHOLINERGIC SIGNALING IN THE AIRWAY EPITHELIUM NATHAN BORRERO, RALPH F. FREGOSI, SCOTT BOITANO Up to 20% of pregnant women in the USA smoke or use nicotine delivery devices (e-cigarettes, water pipes, nicotine patches or gum). While addictive, many believe nicotine to be otherwise safe, causing the use of nicotine delivery devices to double between 2008-2012. However, there is growing evidence that nicotine can alter development of the lungs and airways, as well as pulmonary immune function and brainstem neurons that control breathing and heart rate. In this study, we propose to test the hypothesis that in utero exposure to nicotine leads to alterations in cholinergic signaling in the airway that are evident at 26 birth and persist into adulthood. Importantly, dysfunction of acetylcholine (ACh) signaling in the airway epithelium can result in compromised airway surface liquid and subsequent loss of innate immune function in the airways. This signaling is mediated primarily by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), both of which may be affected by developmental nicotine exposure. We have used rat neonate tracheal mounts and primary cultured rodent airway epithelium in Ussing Chamber studies to evaluate airway epithelial cholinergic signaling in animals with and without developmental nicotine exposure. Initial results show that transtracheal resistance (TTR), transepithelial resistances (TER), and short circuit current (Isc) responses to apical application of ACh are not altered by nicotine exposure. However, airway epithelial signaling is dominated by mAChRs-dependent signaling. When preparations are exposed to nicotine, unexposed rat trachea and primary mouse cultures demonstrate limited, but clear responses. These responses appear to be altered in animals exposed to nicotine in utero. Our data suggest that perinatal nicotine exposure adversely affects the development of cholinergic signaling in the airway epithelium. Funding from R25 ES025494. GENETIC TESTING WITH THE KINO HERITAGE FRUIT TREE PROJECT EUNICE BORUNDA The Kino Heritage Fruit Tree Project aims to recreate Spanish mission era orchards and gardens using fruit trees that can be traced back to the 17th and 18th century, possibly brought by the Spanish. My goal is to find out if current locally grown trees could potentially be related to plants brought in by the Spanish essand pomegranates. The methodology of this project is to create a phylogenic tree of fruit trees that are found within the Sonoran Region. I am using DNA sequencing of genes from pomegranates that have been grown locally for many years to try to find unique differences that distinguish these varieties. This will help us determine how related these varieties are to each other and to European and Middle Eastern varieties. THE ROLE OF THE TYPE SIX SECRETION SYSTEM IN THE INSECT PATHOGENIC BACTERIUM XENORHABDUS BOVIENII (GAMMA-PROTEOBACTERIA: ENTEROBACTERIACEAE) CHRISTINE BRADSHAW, S. PATRICIA STOCK, REBECCA MCQUADE, JOHN G. MCMULLEN III The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a one-step mechanism widely used by gram-negative bacteria to inject effector proteins and virulence factors into a target cell. T6SS has been shown to plays a key role in pathogenesis of host cells and in the competition with other bacteria. Xenorhabdus bovienii (XB) is a gram negative bacterium that exhibits an unusual dual lifestyle, living in a symbiotic relationship with Steinernema nematodes and killing a wide range of insects. The T6SS in XB has not yet been studied. Therefore in this study we considered a homologous recombination approach to generate a XB mutant lacking hcp, a crucial structural gene of the T6SS, and conducted bioassays to assess the role of this secretion system in XB. Specifically, we evaluated insect melanization and mortality, as well as competition with other bacteria. Preliminary results show a decrease melanization in insects infected with the T6SS mutant compared to those infected with wild-type XB, suggesting a different immune response to the mutant strain. To determine whether the T6SS plays a role in bacterial competition, we GFP labeled a XB strain naturally lacking the T6SS (prey), mixed it with the XB wild-type or T6SS mutant (predators), and observed GFP fluorescence. Both wild-type and mutant XB decrease fluorescence of the prey strain, suggesting that factors other than the T6SS allow some strains of XB to outcompete others. We are currently investigating whether the T6SS contributes to the symbiosis between XB and the nematode host.

Once exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), TLR4 becomes activated on keratinocytes. Over-activation of this receptor and its downstream effectors such as transcription factors NF-B (nuclear factor kappa B) and AP-1 (Activator Protein-1), have been linked to NMSC. Previously, we explored the ability of two TLR4 pharmacological inhibitors to block LPS and UV-induced TLR4 signaling in mouse immortalized JB6+ keratinocytes. Here we another inhibitor, Ibudilast, to the library of TLR4 pharmacological inhibitors, and examine the ability of these agents to block UV-induced TLR4 signaling. The pharmacological inhibitors Resatorvid (TAK-242), ST-2825, and Ibudilast are designed to inhibit TLR4 pathway activity, resulting in reduced activity of NF-B and AP-1 transcription factors, and other TLR4 pathway components. NF-B is linked to inflammatory responses. AP-1 is linked to apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. We used HaCaT NF-B luciferase reporter, respectively. We show that Resatorvid effectively blocks NF-kB and AP-1 activation after UV exposure with Luciferase Reporter Assays. ST-2825 and Ibudilast also showed inhibition of these transcription factors in both cell lines. RNA transcription levels of IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3) in JB6+ cells showed inhibition with Resatorvid after SSL (solar-simulated light) Western HaCaT cells showed inhibition of p-p38 with ST-2825 after UVB treatment. The phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of the NF-B transcription factor showed inhibition with Resatorvid and ST-2825. Finally, we examined the expression and activity of TLR4 in the epidermis of mice chronically treated with SSL and resatorvid (or vehicle). Epidermal samples collected after 14 weeks of SSL exposure show induction of TLR4 protein expression compared to no-SSL controls. This induction is attenuated by topical treatment with resatorvid. Together, our data indicate that TLR4 may be a good target for pharmacological chemoprevention of NMSC.

MODELING AND IMAGING ACOUSTOELECTRIC SIGNALS IN A BRAIN PHANTOM ALEX BURTON, RUSSELL S. WITTE, YEXIAN QIN, CHARLES P. INGRAM Acoustoelectric (AE) Imaging uses a pulsed pressure wave (ultrasound) to transiently change the electrical properties in a local region. With the local change in resistivity, our goal is to map activated regions in the brain at higher spatial resolution than traditional electroencephalography (EEG). Computer simulations of a 15cm diameter brain phantom made with a 0.9% saline solution were modeled in Comsol. Platinum electrodes were placed in different locations of the brain phantom with different orientations. In this study, patterns of current densities were observed and compared with experimental tests to determine accuracy of acoustoelectric brain imaging (ABI). Bench-top experiments were conducted in an adult human head phantom. The brain phantom was formed by filling the cavity with 1% agarose gel and 0.9% saline solution to have similar conductive properties as human brain tissue and included surface recording and imbedded electrodes for generating current. A 1-MHz transducer with a peak pressure of 3.4 MPa was used to generate an AE signal and image time-varying current flow in the brain phantom. Stimulating electrodes in the brain were connected to a function generator that produced a three-cycle, 8V sinosoidal wave at 200Hz. Both the simulation and experimental models had highest current densities at the peak of each wave. After validating the measured current densities of a simple model, we tested more complex electrode configurations, including a neuron-like polymer tube structure containing stimulating wires. The current density (60 mA/cm2) was confined to the inside of the tube (I.D. = 0.58mm). We were able to remotely image the confined current inside the tube and as it exited through a pinhole to a referene electrode in the surrounding gel. In the simulations, a 1 cm2 area was used to match the transducers focal area, producing a peak current densities of ~3mA/cm2. Experimental tests revealed a similar current density of 2.8mA/cm2. This study demonstrates potential benefits of a novel ABI system capable of high-resolution (<3 mm), non-invasive brain imaging of neural currents. Such a system would have diverse applications ranging from rapid and accurate electrical brain mapping during treatment of epilepsy to early diagnosis of depression. 28 THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY VIA HIGH ERROR RATES AND BENIGN CRYPTIC SEQUENCES EMANUEL BUSTAMANTE, PAUL NELSON, JOANNA MASEL Selection can act on genetic variation to increase the frequency of traits that make individuals more fit in their immediate surroundings. The ability to generate potentially adaptive genetic variation, or evolvability, is itself a heritable trait. Populations with high evolvability can adapt more rapidly to environmental change than less evolvable populations, potentially providing a selective advantage in a rapidly changing environment. We look to cryptic sequences as a source of variation affecting evolvability. An example of cryptic sequences involves sections of genes translated on the rare occasion that a ribosome reads through a stop-codon. Because cryptic sequences are rarely expressed, selection on them is fairly weak, so changes in cryptic sequences are often driven by genetic drift and mutation bias. The expression of deleterious mutations in cryptic sequences results in maladaptive variation while the expression of benign mutations in cryptic sequences results in potentially adaptive variation. As a result, benign cryptic sequences contribute to evolvability while deleterious ones do not. We seek to determine if pressure to adapt to a changing environment can drive a population toward evolving more benign cryptic sequences and therefore becoming more evolvable. To do so, we developed an agent-based model of evolution with sexual recombination.

SYRINGAE ETHAN CARLSON, DAVID BALTRUS, KEVIN HOCKETT Pseudomonas syringae is a ubiquitous, bacterial plant pathogen, of which there exists a multitude of pathovars capable of causing disease in a variety of agricultural crops. As part of its lifestyle, P. syringae grows on the surface of leaves, as a saprophyte, only causing disease after entering into the leaf interior through natural openings. Pseudomonas syringae is known to produce bacteriocins\u2014known as syringacins\u2014which are proteinaceous toxins that inhibit the growth of closely related strains of bacteria and likely aid in competing for resources within the plant environment. We are interested in the dynamics of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions in the context of evolutionary pressures imposed through competition for resources and resistance to bacteriocins. Previous work done in the lab has allowed us to recover and characterize different isolates of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph), harboring spontaneous syringacin-resistance mutations. We are interested in determining whether such spontaneous mutants exhibit fitness trade-offs in either their growth potential in broth culture or in virulence towards their host plants, when compared to the wild type strain (WT) as well as discovering the genetic basis of these mutations and how the resistance is conferred. Funding for this project was made possible by a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute HHMI 52006942.

A ROLE OF BDNF IN LONG-TERM POTENTIATION AT THE JENSEN, PABLO CASTILLO The cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation include activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength, in the form of long-term potentiation and depression (i.e. LTP and LTD). These forms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied in the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for learning and memory. Information enters the hippocampus via entorhinal cortex inputs that excitatory cells (MCs), which then project back onto DGCs forming a positive feedback loop within the DG. Although 29 previous studies implicated this associative circuit in higher order pattern separation and its dysregulation linked to epilepsy, synaptic plasticity of this circuit remains unclear. Our lab recently discovered a novel form of LTP at MC-DGC synapses however, several knowledge gaps remain about the rules that governs this LTP. Previous work revealed a high concentration of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, in the inner molecular layer (IML), the MC-DGC synaptic field in the DG. In addition, preliminary results suggest that BDNF-TrkB signaling could be involved in MC-DGC LTP. Here, we test the hypothesis that BDNF is sufficient to induce MC-DGC LTP. To this end, we performed whole cell recordings from DGCs and stimulated the MC inputs of the IML. We locally puffed BDNF (8 nM) onto the MC-DGC synapse for 5 minutes at 0.5 Hz while monitoring excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results indicate a significant increase in EPSC amplitude after BDNF application compared to our control (p<.011). Although, preliminary and require more experiments, our data show that BDNF in the absence of repetitive presynaptic activity is sufficient to induce LTP. This study supports the notion that synaptic stimulation releases BDNF, which is necessary and sufficient to induce MC-DGC LTP.

EFFECTS OF CHANGING MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETIC PARAMETERS ON TISSUE OXYGENATION AND HYPOXIA JOSE CELAYA-ALCALA, TIMOTHY SECOMB The dependence of oxygen consumption in tissue on partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. One of the parameters in this equation, the Michaelis constant P0, gives the tissue PO2 at half-maximal consumption. The literature contains disparate estimates of P0. Tissue that is not receiving enough oxygen is called hypoxic. In this study we used theoretical simulations to investigate the effect of varying the assumed value of P0 on the predicted amount of hypoxia in tissue. Tissue whose PO2 is less than P0 was considered hypoxic. Utilizing a Green's function approach, we simulated oxygen transport in a small region of tissue in a rat tumor. The value of P0 was varied from 1 to 10 mmHg while all other parameters were held constant, with oxygen demand set to 0.0005 cm3O2/cm3/s. The distribution of PO2 was computed for each P0 value. When P0 was increased from 1 to 10 mmHg, the computed mean PO2 in the tissue increased from 5.4 to 11.4 mmHg, while the amount of hypoxia in the tissue increased by 13.41%. In conclusion, we found that the value of P0 has a significant effect on the predicted amount of tissue hypoxia. Increasing the value of P0 causes an increase in mean tissue PO2 because oxygen consumption at a given PO2 is decreased, but the hypoxic fraction of tissue increases because more tissue is below the level at which consumption is half-maximal.

BARTON According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and the third most common cancer in men and women. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal dosing pattern of sulindac, a proven chemopreventive agent for CRC, in order to minimize negative side effects while maintaining efficacy. This time-serial study utilized optical coherence tomography (OCT), a minimally invasive imaging tool, to quantify the tumor count and tumor burden over seven time points in four dosing groups. 58 azoxymethane (AOM) and saline treated mice were given no dose of sulindac (Sulindac-None), sulindac for 10 weeks then no dose for the 30 remaining 10 weeks (Sulindac-10), sulindac for 2 weeks then no dose for 2 weeks with the cycle repeated 5 times (Sulindac-2) and doses of sulindac daily for 20 weeks (Sulindac-Daily). By the final time point, 92% of all AOM-treated mice developed adenomas, with an OCT imaging sensitivity of 68%. Sulindac-2 and Sulindac-Daily had statistically significantly lower tumor counts when compared with Sulindac-None, while Sulindac-10 did not. All of the treatment groups had statistically significantly lower tumor burdens when compared with Sulindac-None, but there was a significant difference between the on and off stages of treatment within Sulindac-10. These results show that, while daily doses of sulindac provide the most optimal effects, intermittent doses of sulindac in a 50% duty cycle with an overall four-week period, as shown by the Sulindac-2 treatment model, may provide highly effective chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. However, regular treatment with sulindac appears to be necessary to show prolonged chemopreventive effects.

A NOVEL DROSOPHILA MODEL OF FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA (FTD) BASED ZARNESCU Alzheimer's is a deadly disease that affects ~ 5 million Americans and is projected to grow in subsequent decades. The features of Alzheimer's are known including the development of neurofibrillary tau tangles and the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques, but there is currently no treatment or means of slowing down the progression of the disease. We have been working to develop a novel Drosophila melanogaster or fruit fly model of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). This is important because the Drosophila is a model organism for the study of genetic and neurological disorders including other forms of dementia beyond Alzheimer's that has yet to be explored further. To accomplish this we generated transgenic flies, using the GAL4-Upstream Activating Sequence (GAL4-UAS) expression system, and expressed human Tar DNA Binding Protein-43 (TDP-43) protein (wild-type or disease-associated mutant, TDPG298S) in the mushroom body, the center for learning and memory in the insect brain. We then aged these transgenic flies and used courtship assays to quantify learning and memory in adult males. Our recent work has shown that the assay is fully functional and can measure learning and memory in OregonR control flies after experimental setup adjustments. From our preliminary analysis it appears that there are severe deficits in learning and memory for our transgenic flies: OK107 x TDPG298S9 and OK107 x TDPWT. An additional exciting development in our ongoing work is the fact that we have obtained and tested a fly stock from the Fly Light collection (Janelia Research Campus). This is a very precise expression system using a split GAL4 promoter that will only be activated in specific regions where the two enhancers overlap to constitute a fully functional GAL4 promoter. This allows for us to overexpress our UAS TDP-43 protein specifically in the mushroom bodies. The two lines we have obtained have been tested in our lab through ventral nerve cord (VNC) dissections and have been shown to direct expression predominantly in the mushroom bodies with very little background expression offering a mushroom body specific driver for future investigation. Funding was provided in part by NIH grant P30 AG019610. A NOVEL PEPTIDE THERAPEUTIC FOR CHRONIC PAIN LINDSEY MOUTAL, JENNIFER FRANK PORRECA, RAJESH KHANNA N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) play a key role in the transmission of pain signals, and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) interacts with CaV2.2 to increase cell surface trafficking and enhance its functional activity. We have previously shown that the CRMP2-derived peptide (CBD3) is antinociceptive in rodent models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Here, we investigated the effects of an improved mutant CBD3 peptide (R9-CBD3-A6K): a CBD3 peptide with a mutation at position 6 (A6K) fused to a nona-arginine (R9) cell penetrating sequence. R9-CBD3-A6K inhibited the CaV2.2-CRMP2 interaction in a concentration dependent manner as well as depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx in acutely dissociated rat dorsal root ganglia Using constellation subpopulations of dorsal root ganglia neurons preferentially affected by treatment with R9-CBD3-A6K. Our results provide compelling evidence for R9-CBD3-A6K's selective action through inhibition of calcium influx through CaV2 channels. Complementing these in vitro studies, continuous 31 subcutaneous infusion of R9-CBD3-A6K to Spraque-Dawley rats with tibial nerve injury, which produces long-lasting tactile allodynia and pain when untreated, reversed both conditions without tolerance over a 24- to 72-hour period. Together, these results converge to support further exploration and targeting of the CaV-CRMP2 axis in pursuit of therapeutic alternatives for neuropathic pain.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MOTOR-COORDINATION ASSAY FOR DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER TIFFANY CHO, LINDA L. RESTIFO CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN ADIPOSE-DERIVED STROMAL/STEM CELL POPULATIONS RENEE SZIVEK, stromal vascular fraction (SVF) extracted from adipose tissue has become a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration, in large part because it provides an abundance of viable MSCs that are easily accessible. However, minimal data about the expression profile of these cells exists. Better characterization and segmentation of the SVF may lead to more reproducible tissue regeneration. As such, we characterized the biomarker expression of the SVF in order to gain an understanding about what cell types remain in cell cultures after a common, published MSC isolation technique is used. We also compared those results to measurements collected after a new, secondary process was carried out to further isolate MSCs from the SVF. In order to do this, we extracted the SVF from the infrapatellar fat pad of human patient surgical discards and used RT-qPCR and flow cytometry to identify biomarkers that signify the presence of specific cell types. We showed that the common, published MSC isolation technique removes many types of leukocytes, and that MSC biomarkers are highly expressed in the extracted cell populations. Our data demonstrates that dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, and progenitor cells committed to transforming into only one specific cell type are also present. Moreover, we have shown that the secondary isolation process extracts a population of cells that express significantly fewer hematopoietic biomarkers compared to cell populations extracted only with the common, published MSC isolation technique. Although the advantage of using a purely homogenous MSC population compared to a heterogeneous cell population in regenerative medicine is still being explored, a detailed characterization of biomarker expression in SVF populations provides a prediction of how these cells may behave in regenerative applications. We are currently working towards identifying existing cells types in more detail, and are characterizing the biomarker expression in osteoblasts and chondrocytes differentiated from these stromal/stem cell populations. 32 MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF SGC, A KEY PROTEIN FOR NO-DEPENDENT ANGIOGENESIS ROSLYN CURRY, WILLIAM MONTFORT The protein guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the primary receptor for nitric oxide and plays a critical role in blood pressure regulation, wound healing, and memory formation. sGC is also an important mediator in tumor vascularization, which enables cancer growth and metastasis. Knowing the structure of the protein will help in understanding how sGC functions, and in designing compounds/drugs that control sGC activity. sGC is a multidimensional heterodimeric protein with a single ferrous heme group, but mostly unknown structure. To elucidate the protein's structure, we experimented with truncation of several domains of sGC, since the full length protein is very unstable. Multistep protein purification and dynamic light-scattering experiments were conducted to test for homogeneity of the protein and will be followed by crystallization experiments. Screening for crystallization of several mutants and fragments of sGC should result in microcrystals under various conditions which can be further optimized to grow larger crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. BEE ALLOMETRY JAZMIN DAGNINO, EVAN KELEMAN Organisms have a finite amount of resources to allocate to the growth of different body parts, and may exhibit size specific strategies suggested by allometric growth. Allometric growth is where changes in relative proportions of body parts occur within a species with respect to size. Bumblebees exhibit a large amount of size variation, in which the size specific tradeoff in the growth strategy may suggest that the changes in size benefit the colony. We measured the length of body parts of 20 individuals from 10 different colonies and analyzed the slope of the regression line on a log x log plot. All extremities exhibited a slope less than one when there was a regression against their thorax width. By identifying a deviation from one, signified that bees do not grow isometrically (in proportions) and we have allometric growth. This relative increase in extremities in smaller bees means that smaller bees have relatively larger pollen baskets for collecting pollen if they are forced to forage with a larger relative surface area for thermoregulation. This study will allow for more understanding of size specific trade-offs within the colony and how these trade-offs may favor variation with a group. INHIBITION OF OPIOID INDUCED REWARD VIA GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MANIPULATIONS RACHEL DAVIDSON-KNAPP, ALEXANDER J. SANDWEISS, MARY I. MCINTOSH, AUBIN MOUTAL, JACKIE ASWINI GIRI, YAMAMOTO, VICTOR RAJESH KHANNA, TALLY M. LARGENT-MILNES, TODD W. VANDERAH Chronic pain affects approximately 100 million Americans for which opioids are the mainstay therapy. While physicians and patients alike are apprehensive about using opioids due to their side effects including respiratory depression and addiction, 259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012. Although opioids are the best available analgesics, they increase both positive and negative reinforcement, ultimately leading to addiction. The pro-nociceptive or pain promoting, neurotransmitter Substance P (SP) and its corresponding receptor (NK1R) are found associated with dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Evidence exists suggesting that SP potentiates positive reinforcement of opiates leading to reward. Using in vivo microdialysis, we show that systemic morphine significantly increases SP release in the VTA, an effect mediated by inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons. SP administered in the VTA significantly increases levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a reward processing center in the ventral striatum. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of NK1R in the VTA, we show this prevents the activation of opiate reward, corroborating the results from a conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Finally, we 33 developed a novel opioid agonist/NK1R antagonist, TY032, which was shown to inhibit acute and chronic pain in male rats. Importantly, our study found TY032 microinjection into the VTA did not result in an increase in extracellular dopamine release in the NAc. These data support targeting the dopamine reward circuitry and pain pathways with multifunctional opioid-NK1R compounds could be a path to developing analgesics that lack the potential for abuse.

A QUALITATIVE EXAMINATION OF FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS IN COCONINO COUNTY COLETTE DAVIS, JULIE BALDWIN Native American populations are at high risk for behavioral health issues, such as substance use and co-morbid mental illnesses, such depression, anxiety and suicide ideation. To address these and other health disparities, the Health Equity Research Group at NAU is conducting a regional community needs and assets assessment. My internship focused on assisting the team in identifying behavioral health concerns and solutions for Native American populations in Coconino County. By using a qualitative research approach, such as focus groups and interviews with health care providers, community leaders, and community members, we are determining the perceived health needs and priorities of people in northern Arizona. Our visioning groups thus far have indicated that better access to mental health services and health insurance and improving linguistic and cultural approaches using a more holistic approach will help to address the gaps concerning substance abuse and mental illness. I have also identified current behavioral health programs in Coconino County that meet best practice standards. Our results highlight the importance of Native American communities taking ownership in the development of culturally relevant, community-based mental illness and substance abuse prevention programs. INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS AND NEURONAL SPIKING DUE TO SUB-ANESTHETIC KETAMINE IN A MODEL FOR DYSKINESIA BENJAMIN DAVIS, TONY YE, STEPHEN COWEN Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure. Recently, a common anesthetic, ketamine, has been found to help with depression and pain in PD patients, and help patients with Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which causes a new set of automatic involuntary movements. This study looks at how repeated sub-anesthetic ketamine injections affect local field oscillatory activity and neuronal spiking in the LID rat model. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions were used in Sprague-Dawley rats as an animal model for Parkinson's Disease. Subsequently, these animals were treated with Levodopa (L-Dopa) to develop LID symptoms. Continuous electrophysiological recordings were performed over the 11-hour period from two 32-channel electrode arrays, hippocampus, Rats (i.p.) injections of ketamine or saline (three ketamine sessions and one saline session, counterbalanced) every two hours, starting after a one-hour baseline recording. We hypothesized that high-frequency oscillations induced by sub-anesthetic ketamine injections will be phase-coupled with spiking of single units found in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Preliminary results suggest that neuronal spikes from interneurons in the dorsolateral striatum may be coupled with high-frequency oscillations induced by sub-anesthetic ketamine. However, spikes do not increase as high frequency power increases. Analyzing more cells from the dorsolateral striatum would be required to determine if the neurons firing are significantly coupled with high-frequency oscillations, or if the increase of high frequency power correlates with neuronal spiking. 34 HOW DOES SPIDER PERSONALITY INTERACT WITH WEB STRUCTURE IN BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS (LATRODECTUS HESPERUS) TANNER DOLBY, ANNA DORNHAUS, NICHOLAS DIRIENZO I believe animal personalities can have benefits or consequences that extremely affect their foraging success. The black widow spider can build structures similar to a 3D cone shaped web, constructed primarily for foraging or predation. In black widow spiders, (L. Hesperus) cobwebs are made up of distinctive elements serving to support foraging success (gumfooted lines) or protection (structural lines). The relationship between web constructions and behavior decide the aggression of each spider, which help to determine foraging success. We quantified the overall weight of each spider's web and the number of gumfooted/structural lines. Behavior was quantified by the number of times each spider attacked our simulated prey cue, along with the relationship to web structure and spider size. We used field caught mature female black widow spiders during this study, each spider is given an individual plastic container to live in for the remainder of the experiment. The spiders receive Acheta domesticus crickets once weekly to equalize satiation and keep feeding standardized. Individual's display variation in number of gumfooted lines constructed for capturing prey and web density. This data shows a relationship of higher foraging success when spiders construct less dense webs with a higher number of gumfooted lines. Although, some spiders decide to construct webs more effective at capturing prey, but suffer greatly from predation. There are trade-offs to constructing certain types of webs and this may contribute to animal personalities amongst black widow spiders. Overall, aggressive spiders produced more gumfooted lines and showed higher tendencies to attack the simulated prey cue and capture more prey. The amount of structural lines did not show as much variation in relationship to prey capture. However, spiders that build denser webs constructed with more structural lines offer greater protection for the individual, but also reduce their foraging success. In this case, there may be a stable relationship between an individual's web construction and behavior. In conclusion, the female black widow spiders display variation in types of webs built, these differences have significant implications for the individual's foraging success and predator avoidance. EXAMINING RESPONSE TO LEXICAL RETRIEVAL TREATMENT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LOGOPENIC AND SEMANTIC VARIANTS OF PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE RISING, CHELSEA BAYLEY, PELAGIE BEESON Aphasia is a language disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate. Individuals with aphasia can have a variety of symptoms including problems speaking, reading, writing, and recalling the names of objects or people. Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a form of aphasia that develops over time and will eventually cause complete deterioration of the language centers of the brain as the syndrome progresses. At the Aphasia Research Project at the University of Arizona, thirteen PPA participants received the Boston Naming Test (BNT), a semantic picture-naming test, before and after lexical-retrieval treatment. Scores from each naming test include how many items they named spontaneously, how often they self-cued and used phonemic, semantic, and/or orthographic information to help name the object or describe the object to someone else. These methods taught to patients during treatment were quantified using a Meaningful Information Score (MIS) rating scheme. Participant's scores showed that while they are struggling with progressive anomia and their raw BNT scores are declining, their MIS scores are improving. The lexical-retrieval treatment is providing them with tools to increase their functional communication. 35 EVALUATION OF GALLERIA MELLONELLA (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALLIDAE) AS A COMPLEMENTARY MODEL ORGANISM TO STUDY ENTEROPATHOGENIC E. COLI ISABEL FORLASTRO, REBECCA MCQUADE, V. K. VISWANATHAN, S. PATRICIA STOCK Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common diarrheal pathogen that affects approximately 0.8 million children per year in developing countries. EPEC uses a complex bacterial structure called the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to inject bacterial effector proteins directly into intestinal epithelial cells, manipulating the cells' behavior and causing disease. Rabbits are a commonly used model to study EPEC. However, rabbits have several limitations as hosts including expense, specialized handling, ethical concerns and federal regulations regarding the use of laboratory vertebrates. Insects are potential complementary models for studying bacterial pathogenesis in vivo. Benefits of using insect hosts include low-cost, ability for mass infections, and analogous immune strategies to vertebrates. We hypothesize that larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (GM) can serve as an effective model in studying the EPEC T3SS. In order to determine if EPEC can infect GM we injected EPEC into the body cavity (hemocoel) of the insects. We observed that live wild-type EPEC kills GM and that heat-killed EPEC does not kill, indicating that EPEC actively infects GM. To explore the mechanism of killing, we also considered EPEC mutant strains that lack different components of the T3SS. These mutants were defective in killing GM, indicating that EPEC kills these insects in a T3SS-dependent manner. We are currently adapting this model to test potential T3SS inhibitors and to study individual T3SS effectors. We are also attempting to model oral infections in insects to more closely represent human infection. This project is being funded by the University of Arizona Center for Insect Science Seed Award. UTILIZING STRAIN-SPECIFIC TOXOPLASMA GONDII INFECTION TO INVESTIGATE APP PROCESSING PATHWAYS JENNA FRANCO, CARLA M. CABRAL, WES R. MCDONALD, ANITA A. KOSHY Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. AD is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and the presence of amyloid-beta (A) plaques\u2014protein aggregates that form when the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by the -secretase enzyme. Despite extensive research, much is still unknown about the underlying cellular mechanisms implicated in AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, one key to elucidating mechanisms of AD pathology may lie with an intracellular, ubiquitous parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. Through co-evolution with the host, Toxoplasma has gained the unique ability to establish a chronic, asymptomatic CNS infection by modulating host pathways. Several recent studies demonstrated that in human APP (hAPP) AD mouse models, chronic infection with type II Toxoplasma led to a >80% reduction in A plaque burden compared to uninfected controls. To determine if all strains of Toxoplasma offered protection against A, we infected a different hAPP mouse model with the 3 genetically distinct, canonical strains of Toxoplasma (type I, II, or III). We found that the type I strain (acute infection only) mirrored uninfected controls in all tested parameters. Conversely, both the type II and III strains established a chronic CNS infection and provoked changes within the CNS, but only the type II infection was protective against A. Having established these Toxoplasma strain-specific effects on A, we hypothesized that by comparing the CNS effects of type II and type III infection, we could distinguish changes linked to protection from those linked simply to infection. To establish the baseline effect of type II and III infection on proteins relevant to A generation and processing, we measured protein levels of APP, ADAM10, PEN2, BACE1, neprilysin, and IDE in C56BL/6 mice at 3 weeks post infection (wpi). We found that type II infection was associated with a ~2-fold increase in ADAM10, a marker for -secretase. No other protein levels differed significantly between type II and III infection. This finding suggests that type II infection protects against A by increasing the activity in the non-amyloidogenic APP processing pathway. Current work is focused on confirming these results in infected hAPP mice, funded by the WAESO grant. 36 ANALYSIS OF HY5 PHOSPHORYLATION AND UPSTREAM SIGNALING USING PHOSPHOMIMETICS AND DOUBLE MUTANT ANALYSIS VIRGINIA FRIEDRICH, F.E. TAX, RACHEL WELLINGTON ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a transcription factor that coordinates nitrogen uptake in the roots with carbon fixation in the shoot in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a part of the research my lab is performing on receptor kinases that coordinate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, I will be studying two identified phosphorylation sites whose role has not been tested in order to learn how they relate to the functioning of HY5. I am using site-directed mutagenesis to replace the phosphorylated amino acid at two independent phosphorylation sites. After substituting either an amino acid that mimics phosphorylation or one that makes phosphorylation impossible I will test the resulting mutants to determine whether the change had any phenotypic effects. I have completed the first step of site-directed mutagenesis by successfully piecing together DNA of the gene with the substituted amino acid. In addition, I will determine connections between HY5 and the CLV1 and XIP1 receptors that the lab studies by analyzing double mutants of these receptors and HY5 mutants. I have crossed hy5 knockout plants and XYLEM INTERMIXED WITH PHLOEM (XIP1) mutants and will observe the phenotypes of the double mutants. I have generated crosses of hy5 mutants with each of the three other genes to be studied and am analyzing the progeny. This study will reveal information about the signaling pathways that regulate HY5, a gene involved in the vital process of nitrogen uptake. This research is supported by NSF IOS 1257316. THE IMPACT OF FAMILY HISTORY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ON WHITE MATTER TRACT HEALTH NATHANIEL GALLEGOS, ARIANA STICKEL, LEE RYAN Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease with many risk factors that are not well understood. Having a family history (FH) of AD is a risk factor that may impact the brain even before the diagnosis of AD. The uncinate fasciculus is a white matter tract that may be sensitive to Alzheimer's-related damage: Those with AD had poorer white matter integrity than those with mild cognitive impairment. Our study sought to extend these findings to determine whether white matter integrity within the uncinate in older adults (ages 53-86 years) with no signs of dementia differed between those who have a FH of AD (n=31) and those without a FH (n=30). FH groups were matched on age, education, APOE status, and gender. DTI-tk was used to extract fractional anisotropy (FA; a measure of white matter integrity) from diffusion images in the left and right uncinate fasciculus. General linear models controlling for age and education were performed to determine if FH status predicted white matter integrity. Our results showed no significant differences between FH groups. Further analysis examined the interaction between education and FH status on uncinate white matter integrity, controlling for age. FH groups were divided based on education level-- low-moderate education (an Associate's or lower degree) and high education (more than an Associate's degree). Those with FH of AD and low-moderate education had lower FA than both education groups without a FH and even compared to those with a FH who had higher education. The latter three groups did not differ in uncinate white matter integrity. These results suggest that education has a protective effect for white matter integrity in those with a FH of AD. Our sample would benefit from adding more people to the low education groups to test the robustness of our findings. Analysis of other tracts is needed to determine if the interaction between FH and education has broad or specific impacts on white matter tracts. Our funding included the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities, Neuroscience and Cognitive Summer Research Program, Undergraduate Biology Research Program, McKnight Brain Institute, and the AZ Alzheimer's Association. 37 EFFECT OF ESTROGEN ON EXPRESSION OF SODIUM-PROTON EXCHANGERS IN THE CONTEXT OF MIGRAINE EMILY GALLOWAY, KARISSA COTTIER, JOHN KIM, TODD VANDERAH, THOMAS DAVIS, TALLY LARGENT-MILNES An estimated 38 million people in the United States suffer from migraines, 28 million of whom are women. Female reproductive hormones, namely estrogen, are thought to play a crucial role in this debilitating neurological disorder. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that estrogen increases susceptibility to an electrical phenomenon in the brain called cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is theorized to be associated with migraine with aura; however, its mechanism is unknown. Dysregulation of pH in the brain is also known to occur in CSD and potentially aura, however it is unknown if estrogen influences brain pH. NHE1 is a ubiquitously expressed Na+/H+ exchanger involved in maintaining cellular pH. Both increases and decreases in NHE1 expression may affect neuronal excitability and meningeal nociception, which have implications in migraine. In vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats were conducted to compare NHE1 expression in male and female rat whole-brain tissue. NHE1 expression was significantly higher in male brains compared to females, approximately a four-fold difference. Additionally, whole-brain tissues from rats at different points in their estrous cycles, in which E2 levels fluctuate at regular intervals, were analyzed. Results indicate that NHE1 expression was highest at the cycle point that corresponds with the lowest estrogen level, which is consistent with our findings. To determine if these outcomes could be recapitulated in vitro, we administered physiologically-relevant 17--estradiol (E2) concentrations in multiple cell types expressed in the brain, including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Western blotting data illustrated a strong negative relationship between E2 concentration and NHE1 expression levels. We also treated brain endothelial cells with an estrogen receptor antagonist called ICI 182,780, in addition to E2, to determine if the effect of E2 on NHE1 expression was regulated through estrogen receptors. This ICI 182,780 + E2 treatment trended toward restoring NHE1 levels to those exhibited in the control group, demonstrating that the results found in our concentration response were estrogen receptor-mediated. These studies clearly show that estrogen influences NHE1 expression in vitro, as well as in vivo, which in turn may contribute to the molecular mechanisms driving migraine susceptibility.

EXPRESSION OF CLAUDIN-4 TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN IN RENAL MEDULLA MICHAEL GEE, THOMAS PANNABECKER Claudins are a group of proteins that play key roles in the epithelial, paracellular pathway in the mammalian kidney. Previous studies have shown that claudins may interact with each other and with other proteins at the epithelial tight junction to form channels, which provide selective pores or act as barriers, restricting solute permeability. The goal of this study is to examine Claudin-4 localization patterns and degree of Claudin-4 expression within the inner and outer renal medulla of rats. Using immunohistocehmical staining and epifluorescence microscopy, we have found the protein Claudin-4 to be weakly expressed in the aquaporin 1-positive descending thin limbs (DTLs), ascending thin limbs (ATLs), and aquaporin 1-negative DTLs of the Loop of Henle and the collecting ducts of the rat kidney. Expression appeared to be higher in the inner medulla sections than either the sections of the outer medulla or cortex. The relative concentration of Claudin-4 in the inner and outer renal medulla will be measured using western blotting to quantify any differences in protein expression between the two regions. The results can then be used to guide further studies on Claudin-4 and other claudins that may play key roles in the urine concentrating mechanism as well as renal pathology and physiology. This study is funded by NSF Grant 1263943. 38 IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF AROMATASE-INHIBITOR INDUCED JOINT BRIAN MIHRA CHALASANI, KENT KWOH, JESSICA MARTINEZ Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AI) tend to discontinue the supplement when to painful side effects appear. It is believed that women with AI-induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS) have specific physiological conditions that differentiate them from women with normal aging-related inflammatory processes (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or RA). Ultrasound shear wave elastography (USWE) provides a real-time, quantitative assessment of the elastic modulus of soft tissue, which is a potential biomarker that is altered in women with AIMSS. Because USWE is a completely noninvasive technique available on state-of-the-art clinical ultrasound scanners, it can be readily applied to study patients who undergo AI treatment and help predict adverse effects during therapy. A Siemens s3000 clinical scanner and 9 MHz linear probe were used for USWE of the hands and wrists in postmenopausal women on AI, with RA, and healthy women. The scans included an evaluation of major wrist tendons, nerve, and joints with shear wave velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 m/s, which are directly related to the local shear modulus -- an absolute measure of tissue stiffness. The ultrasound images and raw shear wave data were then analyzed in MATLAB-TM using a custom graphical user interface to calculate the distribution of velocities (or shear moduli) in a user-defined region of interest. The results were exported to Excel for further analysis among the different groups. Initial results suggest the shear wave velocity and estimated Young's modulus () were =642 \u00b1 =174 \u00b1 42 kPa) patients. These values suggest that the mechanical properties of tendons in the wrist may change during AI-therapy and contribute to joint pain. As a potential biomarker of AIMSS and associated pain, USWE may help predict which patients are most susceptible to these side effects, promote early intervention to reduce or eliminate symptoms, and help increase adherence to AI-therapy.

BLUM, CHRIS M. COX, JEAN M. WILSON Epithelial cells play an important role in preventing disease by excluding undesirable molecules, such as pathogens and toxins, from entering the bloodstream from the lumen of the intestine. They selectively allow or deny the passage of macromolecules using specialized protein complexes called tight junctions. Occludin, one of the main components of the tight junction protein complex, has previously been shown to be vital in maintaining appropriate intercellular permeability, as well as tight junction assembly. However, the method by which occludin traffics to the cell membrane from the cytoplasm was not yet fully elucidated. Endotubin, an integral membrane protein localized to specialized endosomes, has been shown to be critical for tight junction assembly. We hypothesized that endotubin may traffic occludin from endosomes to the cell membrane via transport vesicles. To better understand how endotubin impacts tight junction assembly, we assessed the interaction between endotubin and occludin. We transfected cells with phosphorylation by cell lysis and co-immunoprecipitation of occludin. We then performed a Western blot for endotubin, which allowed us to determine the affinity of endotubin for the various phosphorylation mutants of occludin. We found that phosphorylation of occludin affects the binding of endotubin, suggesting that occludin trafficking may be controlled by differential interaction with endotubin that is regulated by phosphorylation. This research was made possible by grants from the National Institutes of Health (MARC Program NIH T34 GM 8718, Wilson Lab RO1 DK84047). 39 EXAMINING EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEINS IN HEALTHY AND FIBROTIC KIDNEY SCAFFOLDS JEFFRY GRANADOS, JOSEPH S. UZARSKI, CAROL A. DEATON, HEATHER H. WARD, ANGELA WANDERING-NESS, WILLIAM M. MILLER, JASON A. WERTHEIM End stage renal disease (ESRD) has been increasing at an alarming rate. There are two options for people with ESRD: dialysis or kidney transplantation. Kidney transplantation is the preferred option because of the improved quality of life, longer post-operative survival rates, and lower long-term healthcare costs. There are 107,647 people currently on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, and in 2015, only 17,878 kidney transplants were performed. Bioengineering presents a potential solution to the growing shortage of kidneys. This study explored whether discarded, non-transplantable kidneys could be transformed into functional kidneys by decellularization and repopulation using patient-derived cells. Using perfusion of detergents through the renal vasculature, the native cells were removed to create a decellularized scaffold. We found that decellularized kidneys maintained the extracellular matrix macrostructure and retained essential proteins and growth factors that can serve as a scaffold for repopulation. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the presence of collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin in the healthy and normal native, decellularized, and recellularized kidneys, confirming that important parts of the extracellular matrix are preserved following decellularization. Results indicate that decellularized kidneys may serve as scaffolds that can be repopulated with patient-derived cells that may differentiate into functional kidney cells.

EMIGRATION SPEED AND ACCURACY TRADEOFFS IN THE ANT TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS GALEN GUDENKAUF, DANIEL CHARBONNEAU, ANNA DORNHAUS Social animals must make decisions together both fast enough to not be subject to predation, but also accurate enough to not require splitting of the group or future risk involvement. In this study, we determine whether there are speed and accuracy tradeoffs evident in the decision making processes of ant emigrations to new nesting cavities. Here we test whether group composition in three treatments (created by removing lazy ants in one group, removing active ants in the second group and removing random ants in a third control group) affects the speed or accuracy of decisions. We predict that groups with more inactive ants might make slower but more accurate decisions and that groups with more active ants make faster but less accurate decisions. We initiate an ant emigration and give the ants a binary decision of two possible nest cavities consisting of two different entrance sizes (one that has more risk potential-a large entrance, and one that is more secure- a small entrance). We measure the speed at which first brood are transported into a new nest and the speed at which first queen is brought into a new nest, and then perform a Kruskal-Wallis Test on both measurements across treatments. We then measure the accuracy of decisions according to choice of nest entrance size by using a Fisher's Exact Test. Our results show no significant relationships between the speed of decisions and group composition, and no significant relationship between the accuracy of decisions and group composition. However, we do find that there is a significant relationship between colony size and speed of decision across groups. We would like to give thanks to NSF grant no.

Various anti-tick interventions are being investigated in hopes of diminishing the spread of infections from ticks to their hosts. The primary objective of this study was to examine the scavenger receptor - serine protease IrSRP1 from the major European Lyme disease vector tick Ixodes ricinus and its role in tick gut physiology. This enzyme was shown by comparison of primary and in-silico modeled tertiary protein structures to belong to the HGF/plasminogen-like family. Antibodies prepared by the injection of rabbits with recombinant expressed partial IrSRP1 protein sequences localized the protein to hemocytes and gut-digestive cells. The investigation questioned whether IrSRP1 undertook a neural or humoral pathway to stimulate the tick's digestive system to initiate the rapid engorgement phase conditioned by female mating; leading to extensive egg production and rapid multiplication of ticks. An in-vivo knockdown of the IrSRP1 was prepared by the microinjection of interfering ds-RNA to the tick hemolymph and the phenotypization was tested in comparison to GFP ds-RNA off-target control. Phenotype changes were monitored as effects on the expression and activity of the individual enzymes of the multi-enzyme complex of tick digestive peptidases using qPCR, Western blotting, and fluorescent peptidyl substrate assays. Monitoring of global phenotype markers displayed a dramatic decrease in tick weight and relative survival rates. Upon completed functional characterization, this enzyme will be tested as a suitable recombinant vaccine against ticks that could find usage in medicine. LOCALIZATION OF THE HEME SYNTHESIS PATHWAY IN C. VELIA LAURA HACKER, JITKA KRUCINSKA, NASIHA AHMED, MATT ROLLINS, JACOB SCHWARTZ Ewing's sarcoma is a devastating pediatric cancer of the bone. The overall survival for patients with metastatic disease is rather low (30%), and only small improvements in treatment measures for Ewing's patients have been made over the last thirty years. That being said, there is a need for new, targeted treatment options for this disease. Unlike the majority of cancers, the genomes of Ewing's sarcoma cells are remarkably stable. There is only one recurrent mutational event: the EWS-FLI1 translocation. The fusion protein that results can regulate the expression of certain oncogenes and tumor suppressors and thereby promote tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that EWSR1, the wild type copy of one the genes incorporated into the fusion protein, plays a role in this regulation. In order to test this hypothesis, A673 patient-derived Ewing's sarcoma to EWS-FLI1 and/or EWSR1. RNA is from these cells after a three-day incubation period; cDNA is then synthesized from the extracted RNA samples. These cDNA samples are then used in real time RT-PCR experiments in order to determine if the expression of genes previously indicated as direct targets of EWS-FLI1 changes after knockdown of EWSR1 and/or EWS-FLI1. Surprisingly, our results indicate that there may be multiple mechanisms by which EWS-FLI1 activates certain oncogenes. It was expected that, after EWSR1 knockdown, the expression levels of genes activated by EWS-FLI1 would decrease. This is not the case for all genes assayed. Surprisingly, the expression levels of two of the three genes (NKX2-2 and CCND1) chosen as activated targets of EWS-FLI1 increased after EWSR1 knockdown. The expression level of the third gene assayed (VRK1) decreased after EWSR1 knockdown. These results are encouraging not only because of the fact that they indicate that EWSR1 likely plays a role in the function of EWS-FLI1, but also because they imply that there may be more than one mechanism used by EWS-FLI1 to regulate the expression of certain genes. These results are also important to Ewing's sarcoma treatment as establishing the role of EWSR1 in this cancer may provide a new target for therapeutic intervention.

It has been linked to the formation of congenital heart defects in humans. Studies in mice, rat, and chick models have also shown that TCE exposure at a critical window of development alters gene transcription in the embryonic heart. Microarray data of chick hearts exposed to 8 ppb of TCE, identified the transcription factor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha (HNF4a) as a highly effected target of TCE. As little research has been done on the transcription factor HNF4a in the embryonic heart, we examined embryonic chick hearts for the expression of HNF4a mRNA. Additional embryos were examined for altered gene expression in the presence of TCE or the HNF4a agonist, Benfluorex, by injecting these reagents at varied doses in ovo during a window of heart development and TCE sensitivity. HNF4a mRNA was found to be uniquely expressed for a brief period in the embryonic heart during the developmental stages that coincide with valve formation and myocyte development. TCE and Benfluorex both altered expression of a series of developmental markers in the heart including HNF4a and Cytochrome P-450 2C45 (CYP2C45). Although Benfluorex is agonist at higher doses, both Benfluorex and TCE were antagonistic to marker expression at low levels and similar molarity. Echocardiographic analysis of intact stage 19-20 embryos confirms an effect of TCE (10ppb) and an equivalent concentration of Benfluorex on early cardiac function as cardiac contraction was reduced by 29% and 23% respectively. The data shows the expression of HNF4a during the window of sensitivity to TCE and supports the suggestion that TCE acts on HNF4a to alter critical gene expression during both valve and myocyte development.

JONATHAN KRAKOFF, KARYNE VINALES In rats, brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates cold-induced energy expenditure (EE) via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). BAT ability to burn calories for thermogenesis may provide preventative and therapeutic relief for obesity-related disorders, however the role of cold-induced BAT activity (CIBA) in humans remains controversial. Few studies have looked at catecholamine stimulation of BAT activity, those of which provide conflicting information. We investigated the relationship between CIBA measurements and body composition, EE, and urinary catecholamines. We also examined if BAT activity or urinary catecholamines predicted body composition changes at six months. 16 healthy volunteers with normal glucose regulation had 24 hour EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) measured by whole-body indirect calorimetry during energy balance (EB), where 24h urine was collected. Body composition was measured by full body DXA scan. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans were performed after cold exposure (16\u00b0 C) for 2 hours to determine CIBA, defined as the average standardized uptake value (SUV) of the collection of voxels showing a SUV2.0g/mL in adipose tissue areas (Hounsfield units between -250 and -10). DXA scan was repeated at 6-month follow-up. BAT activity was higher in healthy volunteers with lower fat-free mass and BAT volume was higher in subjects with higher fat mass. We noticed that people with higher BAT activity and volume had in general lower levels of urinary catecholamines during energy balance. At 6 months, weight, fat mass and fat free mass remained stable, but with significant variability. Lower urinary metanephrine during energy balance was associated with loss of fat mass. Although BAT measurements did not predict weight change, it did affect body composition, therefore weight change may be more evident at long-term follow ups. Contrary to previous studies, brown fat activity was higher in healthy volunteers with lower fat-free mass and higher fat mass. In general, people with higher BAT activity and volume had lower levels of urinary catecholamines during energy balance, which may reflect a lower threshold for SNS cold-induced BAT activation. Although BAT measurements did not predict weight change, it did affect body composition; therefore weight change may be more evident at long-term follow-ups. 42 DEVELOPING AN AGED STROKE MOUSE MODEL OF MIXED DEMENTIA MEGAN HAYES, THUY-VI V. NGUYEN, JENNIFER B. FRYE, KRISTIAN P. DOYLE Mixed dementia is a condition in which abnormalities characteristic of more than one type of dementia occur simultaneously in an individual, and is more likely to develop with age. The most common form of mixed dementia is the co-existence of vascular pathology characteristic of vascular dementia (VaD) alongside neuropathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet despite the frequent co-existence of VaD and AD, little is known about how these diseases influence each other, in part due to the lack of an adequate animal model. Therefore, the goal of this study is to untangle causality in mixed dementia by determining if stroke can cause neuropathological characteristics of AD in wildtype (wt) mice. With immunostaining and behavioral tests, we present significant preliminary data showing that ischemic stroke induces the accumulation of b-amyloid (Ab)42, alongside overt cholinergic neurodegeneration and brain atrophy (i.e., cortical tissue loss and ventricle enlargement), but only in aged wt mice. This neuropathology is accompanied by a delayed cognitive decline that is accelerated in comparison to adult mice, and a lack or delay of motor recovery. Our findings support evidence from human studies suggesting an association between stroke and AD, and we believe that our aged stroke mice may serve as a novel model of mixed dementia. Near future studies include further validating and authenticating this model by increasing our animal sample size, using both sexes, an additional mouse strain, and an additional stroke paradigm. AUTO-DATA COLLECTING AND AUTO-FEEDING ROBOTIC SYSTEM FOR BEHAVIORAL STUDIES STEVEN HSU, DAVID KIKUCHI, ANNA DORNHAUS Automation of data collection and maintenance is crucial in an era where electronics could be easily designed to satisfy such need. In my research, I attempt to design a robotic flower system that could automatically record bee's foraging duration with infrared sensor and periodically refill nectar holders with servo. The most basic units in the entire system are the robotic flowers that uses servo to refill nectar and infrared sensor to collect data. Those flowers are connected to a control unit (arduino mega 2560) that organizes data transmission, commands, and voltage. The control unit is connected to a computer that output the data into an excel spreadsheet. The specific application of such system is behavioral studies where we examine foraging decision and duration. The University of Arizona's Dornhaus lab. Funding from NSF grant IOS-1455983. USING DUAL X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY SPINE SCANS TO DETERMINE TOTAL ABDOMINAL FAT ASHLEE IRVING, ROB BLEW, VINSON LEE, SCOTT GOING, JENNIFER W. BEA Obesity is associated with chronic diseases, including cancer. Body mass index (BMI) is typically used as a proxy for total body fat but visceral fat is presumed to be more involved in the etiology in most chronic diseases in the U.S. Analyzing the spine region using the iDXA machine to estimate total abdominal fat could be used to identify those at higher risk of heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. Objective: To determine if spine fat fraction can be used to estimate total abdominal fat. Methods: A convenience sample ranging in age and body habitus (N=50) completed total body scans and AP spine scans on the same day using the GE/Lunar iDXA machine. The typical regions of interest (ROIs) to quantify total abdominal fat are the second to the fourth lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4) and L2-Illiac Crest (IC). ROIs were manually selected using the total body DXA scan. A randomly selected subset of participants (N=20) were analyzed twice on different days to evaluate intra-rater reliability. Results: Study population was 84% female (n=42) and 16% male (n=8). Average age, and were 38.5\u00b117.4 yrs, kg/m2, 63.44\u00b111.4 and 1.66\u00b10.4 m respectively. Intra-rater coefficients of variation (CV%), using the 20 participants that were analyzed twice were 0.5% and 0.3% for L2-L4 and L2-IC respectively. Conclusions: The two regions of interest for total abdominal fat on the total body scan were strongly correlated with the spine fat fraction. This study should be replicated with a larger and diverse sample. 43 TIME-LOCKED MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SIGNALS IN RESPONSE TO PAIN ONSET AND TO PAIN OFFSET BOJAN ISAKOV, CHRISTOPHER ATCHERLEY, TAYLOR GEE, EDITA NAVRATILOVA, MICHAEL HEIEN, FRANK PORRECA Relief of aversive states, including pain, is rewarding and associated with an increase in dopamine (DA) release in the mesolimbic reward circuit. Measurement of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is usually accomplished with microdialysis but this method does not allow determination of the temporal relationship to pain, and to its relief. In this study, we used isoflurane anesthetized rats to measure NAc DA release on a millisecond to second timescale using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Our approach was to standardize the depth of anesthesia by a reflexive pain response to noxious heat, the tail-flick test. The depth of anesthesia was standardized to this biological response of approximately 5.0 sec latency. FSCV involves the application of a specific triangular waveform at a high scan rate, allowing for oxidation and reduction of dopamine detected by a specialized electrode previously implanted in the NAc shell. Application of noxious heat to the tail was accompanied by a decrease in the DA signal that peaked at the time of the tail-flick. Following the tail-flick, there was a rebound increase in DA signal that peaked after 2.9 s. The data show a time-locked DA response to pain onset, and to pain offset, likely related to the negative and positive components of pain and its relief. Supported by DA034975 from the NIH. SEMANTIC PRIMING INFLUENCES OBJECT DETECTION BARNES JANNUZI, RACHEL M. SKOCYPEC, KIMBERLEY D. ORSTEN-HOOGE, MARY A. PETERSON Does having knowledge about the meaning of an object that might be present in a scene (its semantics) aid object detection? We utilized a figure-ground assignment paradigm to measure object detection. Participants viewed a 90-ms exposure of a display that was divided into two equal-area regions by a central border. One region depicted a portion of a familiar object that was either in its upright or inverted orientation. To activate semantics, we presented masked words that either denoted the basic level name of the familiar object or named an unrelated object from a different superordinate category (natural/artificial). Participants reported which region of the display appeared to have a definite shape and/or appeared closer to them in space (i.e., which side they perceived as the figure/object). Results indicate that when participants were given an upright display, they were more likely to perceive the figure on the familiar side of the border when it was preceded by a basic level prime than by an unrelated prime (p < .01). Critically, comparison to a control (no prime) condition revealed that this effect was driven by interference from the unrelated prime and not facilitation from the basic level prime. We posit that this interference effect stems from competition between predictions set up by the primes and a hypothesis driven by the familiar region of the display. In a second experiment, display exposure durations were increased to 120 ms.This allowed more time for the competition to be resolved. Consistent with the competition hypothesis, unrelated primes no longer reduced reports of the figure on the familiar side of the border. These results show that activating the basic level semantics of an object does not facilitate object detection, at least as measured by figure assignment. In contrast, activating the semantics of an object in another superordinate category can hinder object detection. Research funded by the Office of Naval Research.

TEMPORAL POLYTHEISM AND DIVISION OF LABOR IN TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS WES JOHNSON, DANIEL CHARBONNEAU, ANNA DORNHAUS Many social insect workers change task with age. We explore whether this characteristic is observed in the ant species Temnothorax rugatulus. Through video analysis of several colonies with multiple groups of younger ants with a known age, and older ants emerged sometime before we began identifying the ants by age, we observe the percent duration of the video a worker spends doing a task: foraging, broodcare, and overall activity. To analyze the results, we employ r statistics and compare 44 the average percent amount of time a worker of the old group or worker of the younger groups spends doing a task and identify if there is a significant difference between the groups: possibly suggesting that worker's tasks and overall activity may depend on age, as it has in other species of social insect. Preliminary results do suggest that temporal polyethism exists in the species Temnothorax rugatulus inasmuch that overall activity levels seem to decrease with worker age. NSF IOS 3014230. DROSOPHILA ASTROCYTES SPAN FUNCTIONAL NEURAL DOMAINS WITH D. GARC\u00cdA, LESLIE P. TOLBERT, LYNNE A. OLAND Glia and neurons are the two main types of cells in the brain. Recent research indicates that in both vertebrates and invertebrates, glial cells serve important roles such as helping to shape the nervous system, promoting neuronal cell death, and modulating ongoing neuronal function. Drosophila melanogaster, with its extraordinary genetic toolkit, can be exploited to explore the contribution of astrocytes, a glial subtype, to neuronal circuit function. With the goal of determining the physical relationships between astrocytes and between astrocytes and neuronal circuits, we asked in this study how individual astrocytes interface with neighboring astrocytes and also asked whether astrocytic arbors map specifically onto functional neuronal domains (e.g., sensory, motor) or more broadly span across domains. To facilitate this analysis, we reconstructed fiducial markers in the neuropil to provide physical context when studying adjacent cells. To target astrocytes, we employed two genetic tools. Flp-out (Ito et al., 1997) and MultiColor FlpOut (Viswanathan et al., 2015) are genetic constructs that specifically label astrocytes to their distalmost tips, generating high-resolution, detailed images. MultiColor FlpOut allowed us to generate astrocytes in a variety of colors so that we could visualize the interdigitation pattern of neighboring cells. Our examination of the processes of individual astrocytes as well as the interfaces between adjacent astrocytes revealed that (1) astrocytic branches have convoluted spatial domains, in which the finest distal branches of adjacent astrocytes interweave with a variable, but small, amount of interdigitation and (2) arbors of individual astrocytes span multiple functional neural domains. These findings suggest several functional consequences: Because astrocyte arbors span functional domains and astrocytes also can be dye-coupled (MacNamee et al., 2016), astrocytes may have the role of integrating neuronal activity across disparate neural circuits. Alternatively, there may be functional sub-compartments in astrocytes that are differentially active in response to local synaptic activity; this possibility remains to be explored. The limited overlap between astrocytes indicates that electrical coupling among astrocytes is likely to occur at the distal-most tips. Finally, any given synapse is likely to fall exclusively within the domain of a single astrocyte. This research was supported by NSF 1353739 to LAO. BEHAVIORAL RECOVERY FOLLOWING INCOMPLETE SPINAL CORD INJURY (ISCI): MEASURING LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE USING A RAT MODEL PAREENA KAUR, DEREK O'NEILL, VLADIMIR TURKIN, THOMAS M. HAMM Spinal Cord Injury afflicts approximately 17,000 people in the U.S. each year (NSCISC, 2016). Most of these injuries are clinically incomplete as some sensorimotor function is retained. In this study, we are examining spinal cord plasticity, recovery of locomotion, and the effects of exercise following incomplete spinal cord injury in rats. To measure performance over time, we conduct weekly behavioral tests including the open field locomotion and grid walk. The combination of these tests provides a comprehensive picture of recovery of basic and skilled locomotion necessary for weight-bearing stepping and fine motor movements respectively. Our observations show that while the injured rats improve substantially, they do not fully recover their pre-injury abilities. Exercise does not have a substantial effect on this process. In open field testing, they reach a plateau in performance at which 45 point they exhibit consistent weight bearing stepping, with deficits in paw placement and balance. In grid walk testing, the injured rats have deficits in fine motor control as indicated by how often the hind-paws miss the grid. Over time, the number of misses per step decreases though performance does not reach the same level as seen in the control rats. To compensate for this loss in ability, they seem to adapt their stepping pattern to prevent errors. This work was funded by an NIH RO1 grant, along with support from the Barrow Neurological Institute and the University of Arizona Undergraduate Biology Research Program (UBRP). NHE1 EXPRESSION IN NAIVE RATS: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEXES JOHN KIM, KARISSA COTTIER, EMILY GALLOWAY, TODD VANDERAH, THOMAS DAVIS, TALLY LARGENT-MILNES Progressive research in pharmacology and neurology has recently centered around the molecular constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective semipermeable barrier in the central nervous system (CNS) known for its restrictive properties as a passageway between the brain and contents of the extracellular fluid. The BBB's restrictive properties, while a novel research topic, are required information for development of effective treatments for neurological disorders such as migraine headaches - a prevalent neurological disorder affecting nearly 15% or approximately one billion people worldwide. Recent studies in migraine physiology show implication of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), a membrane solute carrier regulating homeostasis of intracellular pH and Na+ expressed ubiquitously throughout the central and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown a tripled rate of migraine onsets in women over men in America and an approximately doubled rate worldwide, indicating sex hormones as a regulator of NHE expression and function. We carried our experiment via molecular and behavioral techniques utilizing naive rats grouped by gender. We specifically investigated the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) isoform of NHE due to its shown property of inducing CNS hyperexcitability and potential meningeal nociceptor activation when deviating from its normal expression level. Our three areas of interests were the brain and brainstem in the CNS and the trigeminal nerve - the cranial nerve involved in sensation of the head and face - in the PNS. We obtained the tissue via encephalectomy from female and male rats after monitoring their behaviors prior to and during the surgical procedures for Western blot analysis of NHE1 protein. The results showed a higher NHE1 expression in male brains than female brains overall. Follow-up experiments will utilize tissue obtained from rats with induced migraine to show differences in NHE1 expression to determine the role of NHE1 in the sex differences in migraine presentation.

AUTOPHAGIC ALTERATIONS IN DERMAL FIBROBLASTS FROM a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 1.5 million people in the US and greater than 2% of the population worldwide. However, the etiopathological, cellular, and molecular basis of PD still remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) isolated from skin biopsies of individuals diagnosed with late-onset idiopathic PD, as well as healthy age-matched control (AMC) subjects, as a model to study PD mechanisms. Although fibroblasts are not a neuronal cell type, they provide a unique model for PD because they encompass the biological and chronological alterations found in an aging environment, and due to their patient specificity. While idiopathic PD is thought to be multifactorial, recent studies suggest one potential cause to be the impairment of a cellular process known as autophagy: a recycling mechanism that breaks down old or damaged cytoplasmic content to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Specifically, we examined autophagy in the patient fibroblasts by assessing three particular proteins involved in the pathway: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and p62 46 to explore this mechanism in the context of PD. Experiments were conducted under both basal and stress conditions, and the proteins were measured via western blotting. Additionally, we used electron microscopy (EM) to visualize the autophagic differences between PD and AMC lines at an ultrastructural level. Our results indicate that autophagy is already upregulated under basal conditions in the PD cells with increased LC3 and p62 degradation, and dysregulated under stress as indicated by increased LC3 as well as decreased p62. EM data supported the western blotting results and showed increased autophagic vacuoles in PD cells. Our future efforts look towards further solidifying this data and also investigating another major type of autophagy, namely chaperone-mediated autophagy, to further understand the role of this process in PD.

SYNTHESIS OF CYCLIC PEPTIDES FOR PREFERENTIAL BINDING TO MELANOCORTIN 4 RECEPTOR MAJ KRUMBERGER, SAGHAR MOWLAZADEH, YANG ZHOU, JONATHON SAWYER, MINYING CAI, VICTOR J. HRUBY MCR's are a family of G-coupled Protein Receptors (GPCR's) and extensive research has thus far shown 5 functionally different MCR's. The GPCR family is one of the major targets in the pharmaceutical industry, and since MCR's fall into this category developing potent ligands for them can be very advantageous. The issues that arises with most GPCR targeting pharmaceuticals is that they lack both efficacy and specificity for the receptor subtypes. The functional differences, as well as the location and possible ligand binding preferences are the differentiating characteristics for the five MCR's. The area of interest for my studies in the past couple of months, and in the future lies primarily in MC4R. In humans, this receptor - hMC4R - is expressed in virtually all brain regions, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem and the spinal cord. Guarini et. al. recently showed that activation of MC4R, in mice models with medium AD severity, counteracts cognitive decline via induced neuroprotection and improved synaptic transmission. Selective binding to hMC4R and other MCR's can be controlled by a core sequence that is present in all ligands binding to these receptors, the sequence is HFRW (Histidine, Phenylalanine, Arginine, Tryptophan). In addition, it is crucial that the melanocortin analogs are selective for the MC4R. The four natural agonists for MCR's are all linear, however they lack in selectivity, hence it is our goal to produce potent exogenous ligands that will aid either as agonist or antagonists for MC4R. The major change that we are introducing in the novel peptides is the KPV sequence which is normally found in -MSH, the most potent of the natural ligands - we hope that this will increase the binding to the receptor. Another way to potentially increase bio-selectivity, is to constrain the linear sequence into a cyclized structure. The cyclization leads to a lower number of possible configurations that the peptide can have, hence increasing the possibility of binding to the active site of an MC4R.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HOST CNS IMMUNE RESPONSE CAUSED BY protozoan parasite that establishes an asymptomatic, chronic infection in most mammals, including humans and mice where it can persist in the brain. Though asymptomatic in most infected individuals, in developing fetuses or the immunocompromised, Toxoplasma infection causes a wide range of symptoms- from mild fever to symptomatic chorioretinitis to seizures and even death. It is unclear what determines this outcome variability, but recent data suggest the distinct strain of Toxoplasma might influence the clinical outcomes. Toxoplasma has three different canonical strains; type I, type II and type III. A prior study suggested that these different strains had gross differences in the CNS immune response in mice. Thus, we hypothesize that distinct Toxoplasma strains provoke different CNS immune responses, which may contribute to different disease severities. To better define Toxoplasma strain-specific immune responses, mice were 47 injected with 10,000 type II or III parasite and the CNS immune response was evaluated at 3 weeks post infection (wpi) using immunohistochemistry. A computer program (Simple PCI) was used to quantify two key immune cell types in stained tissue sections: macrophages/microglia (Iba-1+) and T (CD3+) cells. We observed that type III-infected mice had a stronger T cell and macrophage/microglia CNS response as compared to type II-infected mice. The brain cytokine environment was also evaluated using a Luminex assay, which showed type III-infected mice had a stronger pro-inflammatory response as compared to type II-infected mice. Finally, using flow cytometry to define the types of immune cells found in the brain and periphery (spleen) at 3wpi, we found that type II-infected mice had a higher proportion of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs), and regulatory T cells as compared to type III-infected mice. However, during acute infection, type III-infected mice had higher AAMs as compared to type II-infected mice. Taking these data together, we propose that: 1) the CNS immune response is reflective of the peripheral immune response and 2) during acute infection, the type II strain provokes a robust pro-inflammatory response, which generates a compensatory anti-inflammatory response which will, ultimately hinder the parasite clearance. On the other hand, the type III strain infected mice provokes a less pro-inflammatory response early on which avoids the compensatory response, and thus will lead to improved parasite clearance. We are currently working on testing this model. This project is supported by the American Heart Association and the March of Dimes via grants #16PRE30990019 (ST) and #5-FY15-45 (AAK). IDENTIFICATION OF REGULATORS OF LYSOSOME FORMATION GLORIA LE, N. JACKSON, N. SHAIKH, A. SHEARON, H. FARES Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that serve as the major degradative compartments for endocytic, phagocytic, and autophagic materials targeted for destruction in eukaryotic cells. This degradation is critical to many physiological processes, including processing endocytosed nutrients, down-regulating signaling receptors, presenting antigens, killing pathogenic organisms, and degrading normal and abnormal cellular proteins. In addition, lysosomes mediate some cell death pathways and repair damage to the plasma membrane. Lysosomes are formed in complex eukaryotes by the budding of a small nascent lysosome from a late endosome/hybrid organelle, movement of the nascent lysosome away from the hybrid organelle while maintaining a membrane bridge, and scission of the membrane bridge to release a discrete primary lysosome. We had previously identified the Mucolipidosis type IV protein TRPML1 as a regulator of the scission step during lysosome formation. Here, we describe the identification of additional regulators of this process, including actin that provides the force for moving nascent lysosomes away from late endosomes/hybrid organelles. NECTAR ROBBING AND POLLINATION IN A CHANGING ALPINE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY TREVOR LEDBETTER, SARAH RICHMAN, JUDITH BRONSTEIN Changes in pollinator communities due to anthropogenic influences, including land use changes, climate change, and chemical use, have been characterized extensively in recent years. However, the effects of these changes on alpine and subalpine floral communities remain poorly understood. Aquilegia caerulea is a perennial, herbaceous, flowering plant that occurs in alpine and subalpine habitats from 2,600-3,700m. Studies performed in Colorado in the 1970's listed several Bombus (bumble bee) species as the primary visitors to A. caerulea, with Bombus occidentalis as the most common. While most Bombus visitors are unable to reach the nectar of A. caerulea due to its long nectar spurs, opting instead only to gather pollen for use as food for larvae, B. occidentalis is capable of primary-robbing the flowers. In this behavior, foragers bypass the floral opening by cutting into a flower at its base to retrieve nectar, usually without transferring pollen between flowers. Robbing rates in A. caerulea at this time were reported to be as high as 64%, with B. occidentalis robbers oftentimes outnumbering those foraging for pollen. 48 More recent studies of A. caerulea have noted low overall Bombus visitation, with B. occidentalis being nearly absent, a decline that coincides with its general decline throughout the western United States. In their place, high Muscidae (fly) visitation has been observed instead, and while present in the past, their presence and abundance has increased and is now more widely observed. These changes mean that A. caerulea populations have lost both Bombus pollen collectors and a prominent nectar robber in B. occidentalis. It is known that both pollen- and nectar-collecting pollinators can influence the evolution of A. caerulea flowers via both male and female functions. However, it is not known how flies factor into overall plant fitness for A. caerulea, and it is possible that they may serve as effective pollinators. This study documents current nectar robbing rates, describes the current pollinator community for A. caerulea, and quantifies how effective flies are as pollinators in the absence of bee visitation. These data are explicitly contrasted with those at the same site in the 1970's, capturing the changes that occurred in conjunction with anthropogenic change in the past forty years. This study was generously funded through the Spirit of Inquiry Grant through the UA Honors College and was performed near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colorado. EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION-INDUCED SICKNESS BEHAVIOR EMILY LONG, R. WILSON, M.F. O'CONNOR Last time you were sick, were you more socially withdrawn, anxious, or distracted? This sickness behavior stems from increased immune (proinflammatory cytokine) activity circulating throughout the body and crossing the blood-brain barrier, inducing widespread neurochemical changes. Sickness behaviors shift the body's energetic prioritization toward immune recovery, therefore shifting away from other motivations like curiosity or invested decision-making. Decision-making tendencies can be determined as an exploitative (directive) determination of the best option, or a more exploratory (random) selection. Adaptive gain theory mechanistically explains these different decision-making methods; modulatory locus rest alters gain modulation in cortical processing, and could therefore be a potential mechanism for the predicted influence of inflammation on exploratory/ exploitative decision-making. Little is known of the extent or mechanistic underpinnings of inflammation's influence on exploration. We therefore used a within-subject design, testing participants once with heightened inflammation induced by an influenza vaccination, and once without the vaccine. Tests include a novel virtual-reality adaptation of the open-field test to determine motivation to explore virtual space, the Horizon Decision-Making Task to assess exploratory versus exploitative tendencies, and pupillometric measures to identify LC-NE activity. Increased inflammation was hypothesized to correlate with less exploration of the virtual field, more random decision-making in the Horizon task, and less modulatory LC-NE activity, all due to an advantageous disengagement of cognitive resources in conjunction with immune activation. Preliminary findings show that upon receiving the vaccine, participants reported decreased attentional and self-control impulsivity on the BIS-11 scale. Participants traversed less in the virtual-reality open-field test when vaccinated, indicating inflammation's influence on motivational/ rewards neural pathways. Participants post-vaccination were also more random in their decision-making. These findings support goals of sickness behavior: less curiosity to explore virtual-reality and more random decision-making strategies are less cognitively expensive, so energy otherwise invested in pursuing curiosities or deliberating options can focus on immune recovery instead. Further studies on how inflammation changes behavior could improve patient quality of life through better diagnosis and management of inflammation-induced side effects such as depression.

Endosperm is a tissue that provides nutrients to the developing embryo or seedling. Additionally, endosperm of cereal grains, including that of maize, rice and wheat, make up a great portion of the human diet and is a source of various industrial products. Early in maize kernel development, endosperm cells undergo two critical processes: a rapid proliferation and an associated differentiation into multiple cell types. Our preliminary studies have identified the teosinte branched 1 cycloidea proliferating cell factor (TCP) transcription-factor (TF) protein family as a potential regulator of endosperm proliferation. We set out to understand how interaction among TCP proteins and other co-expressed TFs may regulate the expression of genes involved in endosperm proliferation. Utilizing both yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction complementation (BiFC) assays, we identified specific TCP-TF interactions. This data will be used to further analyze how these proteins may interact in a heterologous system to regulate gene transcription using transactivation assays. Altogether, this study helps us to understand the nature of gene regulatory networks that regulate early endosperm development in flowering plants. The NSF-Plant Genome Research Program (ISO/MCB-1444568) provided funding for this project. DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF NANOBODIES ON THE METNI ABC TRANSPORTER KYLE LOPEZ, PHONG NGUYEN, DOUGLAS REES MetNI, a high affinity methionine uptake ABC importer, is highly conserved among bacteria, including pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. This import system is necessary for cell survival and bacterial virulence, and therefore important to study. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of this transporter due to lack of biochemical and structural characterizations. Our goal is to analyze various structural changes of the MetNI transporter during the transport cycle and to use nanobodies to improve crystallization of the outward facing conformation of the MetNIQ complex. We use antibody-like proteins called nanobodies that we hypothesis stabilize either the inward or outward facing conformation. In this study, we characterize the effect of the nanobodies on the MetNI transporter using ATPase assays, size-exclusion crystallography. MetNI and inhibit ATPase activity ~10 fold. Inhibition of activity suggests stabilization of either the inward or outward facing conformations. Finally, we identified several conditions that grow crystals of the MetNI-nanobody complex. These conditions tend to contain mid-range molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEG) at lower concentrations (5-15% w/v), 0.1 M salt, and pH between 4.5 and 7. Results from this study will aid future structural studies of the MetNIQ transport system. EFFECT OF HEAVY ATOM SUBSTITUTION IN FORMATE DEHYDROGENASE JUSTIN LOPEZ, CHETHYA RANASINGHE, AMNON KOHEN Studies on vibrational coupling between protein motions and enzymatic bond activation are of contemporary interest in enzymology as they lead to evolutionary discoveries in drug and biomimetic catalyst design. Mass modulation of the model protein formate dehydrogenase (FDH) by isotopic enrichment enables us to study the role of femtosecond protein dynamics on enzyme catalysis. Temperature dependence of intrinsic KIEs was carried out to investigate the correlation between covalent bond activation and fast protein vibrations. Activated tunneling model was used to interpret the KIE data. According to the data that have been obtained so far, the Ea(T-H) for 15N FDH lies in between those for light and half heavy FDHs done previously as 50 expected following the mass effect. But the interesting thing is that the average donor acceptor distance denoted by the magnitude of the KIE values suggests the largest for 15N FDH: A possible explanation might be due to significant alterations to the local electrostatics. To make more accurate predictions about the donor acceptor distance distribution at the transition state of the hydride transfer reaction, we need to further analyze the KIE data and obtain a complete KIE plot which will be comparable to the previous data. AGE POLYETHISM IN TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS DOMINIQUE LUND, DANIEL CHARBONNEAU, ANNA DORNHAUS The purpose of this study is to investigate age polyethism, which is the concept that different age groups within a social group perform different tasks. We studied this form of division of labor in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. Specifically, we investigated whether ant inactivity, or laziness occurs in a specific age group more often than others. We hypothesized that the young ants would be more inactive, that the older ants would be more inactive, or that there is no correlation between age and inactivity. To test this, we marked newly eclosed ants with different wire belts so that they could be identified by their age. Then, we analyzed videos of the colonies and tracked each ant's behavior. A linear regression will be performed once all data is collected to determine whether ants spend more time inactive at a certain age. INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESPONSE THRESHOLDS AND DIVISION OF LABOR COLIN LYNCH, NICOLE FISCHER, ANNA DORNHAUS The ecological success of social insects is often attributed to their division of labor, wherein workers in a colony specialize in different task and each task is performed by a different set of individuals. What is the underlying mechanism controlling such task specialization? One of the leading models of division of labor proposes that specialization arises because individuals have different response thresholds to task-associated stimuli. However, there is little direct evidence to support this model. As a first step in uncovering how task specialization arises, we test the hypothesis that variation in response thresholds underlying task specialization. To this end, we test sucrose thresholds of Temnothorax rugatulus ant workers and explore the relationship between worker thresholds and task specialization. We find that response thresholds do not drive division of labor. However, sensitivity to sucrose can predict division of labor. Specifically, we find that all workers who respond to sucrose spend some amount of time taking care of the brood. Workers who do not respond to the sucrose, or only respond to a water control, spend no time taking care of the brood. CRE RECOMBINASE SYSTEM IN A TOXOPLASMA GONDII BRADYZOITE MUTANT WES is an obligate, intracellular parasite that infects up to a third of the world's population. An intriguing aspect of the Toxoplasma life cycle is the ability of the parasite to persist for the life of the host. Its asexual cycle has two forms, the acute stage, which consists of actively replicating tachyzoites, and the chronic stage, in which bradyzoites encyst and growth 51 slows. Bradyzoite development is of particular interest because while acute infections of Toxoplasma can be treated, there are currently no treatments for chronic infection. Bradyzoites are also a major source of transmission to humans via consumption of contaminated food. A previous study focused on identifying bradyzoite development genes through the use of insertional mutagenesis discovered a bradyzoite development mutant, N28E2. This mutant exhibited incomplete and abnormal bradyzoite morphology, where only 1-2 bradyzoites were found per cyst (as opposed the usual 100-1000 bradyzoites). The aim of the current project is to introduce our previously established Cre-reporter system into the N28E2 mutant strain to track and study host-parasite interactions. Our Cre-reporter system causes the cells which have interacted with the parasites, in cell culture or in Cre reporter mice, to undergo Cre-mediated recombination and express GFP allowing us to permanently track these host cells. Parasites are also easily identified as they express RFP. Engineering N28E2-Cre parasites will allow us to study host-parasite interactions of this mutant at the level of the single interacted host cell in vivo. IS LEARNING IN BOMBUS IMPATIENS THE RESULT OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT OR BOTH? ANDREA MASON, DAVID KIKUCHI, ANNA DORNHAUS In foraging, the ability to differentiate between rewarding and non-rewarding food sources and accurately choose correctly can minimize cost for the individual. An individual makes decisions as to which food sources to visit through their past experiences. We investigate whether negative or positive experiences or both most drives learning using Bombus impatiens as a model. Bees were trained to associate different flower color combinations as rewarding with sucrose or unrewarding with quinine; some bees were trained with only positively reinforced flowers while other bees were trained with both positive and negatively reinforced flowers. How well bees learn is measured by the proportion of the flower colors visited. Preliminary data shows bees learn to discriminate between rewarding and unrewarding flowers when trained to both positive only flowers and positive and negative flowers.

THE FUNCTION OF IL-1 FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE REGULATION OF TH2 IMMUNITY MONICA \"NIKKI\" MASTRUD, DOMINIK SCHENTEN, NICOLE CONGROVE Type 2 immune responses involve the differentiaton of naive T cells into Th2 cells that are central for the host immune response against helminths and other extracellular parasites. The accidental generation of autoreactive Th2 cells is suppressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs). How parasite-specific Th2 cells can escape Treg-mediated suppression while autoreactive T cells remain suppressed is currently unclear. Previous work suggested that Th1 cells responding to intracellular pathogens become inert to the suppressive effects of Tregs through the activity of the cytokine IL-1 that is secreted by cells of the innate immune system. In analogy, Th2 cells may therefore also escape Treg-mediated suppression through the activity of a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, most notably IL-33, which is known for its importance in type 2 immune responses. We are currently testing this hypothesis in protein immunizations of mice carrying a T cell-specific deletion of MyD88, the essential signaling adaptor of all receptors for the IL-1 cytokine family, using the protease papain as a Th2-inducing adjuvant. Our work will provide important insights into the regulation of Th2 responses and their pathological manifestations such as allergies and asthma. 52 THE RELATIONSHIP FOR BIASES BETWEEN COMPLEX FLOWERS AND UNICOLOR FLOWERS IN BUMBLE BEES SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN, DAVID KIKUCHI, ANNA DORNHAUS Innate biases toward a stimulus in the environment is important for initial learning when the cost of learning is high. In this study we try to determine whether bumblebee preference for single color flowers predict their preferences for two color flowers. Bees foraged in an arena with wooden colored flowers and their color preference was observed. Two different sets of colored flowers were used. One set was with 4 different solid single colored flowers lined up in a row. The other set had 2 colors on each flower in different color combinations using the same initial colors in the single colored flowers. Single color flower results showed bees having no significant preference for any single color flowers (p=0.147). However, bees foraged on more blue and grey flowers over green and cyan. The results of preference for combination colored flowers was also not significant (p=0.061). EFFECT OF ESTROGEN ON CIRCADIAN TEMPERATURE RHYTHMS IN FEMALE MICE JESSI MCMINN, SALLY KRAJEWSKI-HALL, NAOMI RANCE Body temperature regulation in women is altered by changes in circulating gonadal steroids during the menstrual cycle and estrogen withdrawal in postmenopausal women. Estrogen also alters temperature regulation in the rat, an animal model that has been used to elucidate the mechanism of hot flushes. During the rat estrous cycle, there is a decrease in tail-skin temperature (TSKIN) on proestrous night when circulating gonadal hormones are high. TSKIN is also decreased during the night when ovariectomized (OVX) rats are treated with 17-estradiol (E2). In contrast to the numerous studies in the rat, there is limited information on the effects of estrogen on body temperature regulation in the mouse. The present studies were designed to measure circadian rhythms of core temperature (TCORE) and TSKIN in the mouse using a novel method for temperature recording in freely-moving animals. In experiment one, 10 female Hsd:ICR (CD-1) mice were implanted with an intraperitoneal temperature probe to measure TCORE and a small temperature probe was attached to the tail to measure TSKIN. Daily vaginal smears were taken to assess estrous cycle stage and TCORE and TSKIN were measured continuously for 14 days. In experiment two, the mice were OVX and temperature measurements were repeated for seven days. Fifteen and 29 days after ovariectomy, animals were implanted subcutaneously with E2 capsules (360 g/mL; low E2 and 720 g/mL; high E2, respectively) and the temperature measurements were repeated for seven days. We report that the circadian rhythms of TCORE and TSKIN were not affected by the day of the estrous cycle in cycling female mice. There was also no significant effect of estrogen replacement on TSKIN during the night, regardless of the dose of E2. However, both low E2 and high E2 significantly decreased TCORE in OVX mice during the day. These studies reveal a significant species difference in the way estrogen modulates temperature regulation in the rat and mouse. Future studies will use transgenic mice to elucidate the central nervous system pathways involved in the estrogen modulation of body temperature and reproduction.

IDENTIFYING NETWORK ELEMENTS THAT MAKE OR BREAK A BISTABLE RB-E2F CELL PROLIFERATION SWITCH MATTHEW MILLER, GUANG YAO, HELEL HAO ZHANG Proper control of cell proliferation is fundamental to the health of our body. A retinoblastoma (Rb)-E2F gene pathway plays a pivotal role in determining whether cell proliferation occurs. Our lab has previously created a computer model to represent this Rb-E2F pathway. The model predicted that the Rb-E2F pathway functions as a bistableswitch to control the start of cell proliferation, which has been validated by our follow-up experiments. The outcome of the Rb-E2F computer model is controlled by 24 parameters, which describe the production and degradation of each protein in the pathway. We want to explore what 53 parameter features make or break the Rb-E2F bistable switch, which may help us understand how mutations disrupt this important switch in diseased cells. To determine this, we simulated the Rb-E2F model with 10,000,000 randomly generated parameter sets. From these 10M simulations, we acquired 7,162 good bistable switches. We are currently analyzing the corresponding good parameter sets in the 24-dimension space to identify key controlling features of the Rb-E2F cell proliferation switch. MYXOZOA: MICROSCOPIC JELLYFISH PARASITES FATIMA MOLINA, INGA MEYER-WACHSMUTH, IVAN FIALA, ASTRID HOLZER A relatively new field of study, Myxozoa are identified as metazoan parasites that are located in both freshwater and marine habitats around the world. Overall, there are approximately 2,200 known species from the Cnidaria phylum and researchers have completed a total of fifty life cycles to date. Currently, the Laboratory of Fish Protistology located at the Institute of Parasitology in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic is researching the prevalence of Myxozoa within specific aquatic ecosystems with the goal of discovery new species from both freshwater and marine niches. In addition, the two distinct life cycles of Myxozoa that incorporates both vertebrates and invertebrates is being studied with vigor to describe additional complete life cylces. Phylogeny and taxonomy is also being addressed and reconstructed to meet the findings of new species through the new process of extraction and analysis by environmental DNA (eDNA), in regards, to soil and water samples. Designated primers are implemented to capture potential Myxozoa DNA within water, soil, and meiofauna samples. Current and future research findings will ultimately lead to the discovery of new hosts, infection mechanisms, myxozoan diversity, complete life cycles, a new taxonomic system of identification, and the possibility of detrimental effects caused by Myxozoa within ecological environments.

POTENTIALLY NEURODEGENERATIVE FACTORS PRESENT IN THE CIRCULATION AND INFARCT LEAK INTO THE BRAIN FOR MONTHS FOLLOWING STROKE THROUGH THE GLIAL SCAR JUSTINE MONA, JACOB C. ZBESKO, MAJ KRUMBERGER, VIVIAN NGUYEN, JENNIFER B. FRYE, KRISTIAN DOYLE Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States, affecting more than 795,000 people annually. Within the affected brain, the blood brain barrier (BBB), a network of tight junctions between endothelial cells, that separates the circulating blood from the extracellular brain fluid, is disrupted at the site of damage. New blood vessels form following the disruption of the BBB. Immune cells travel through these newly formed blood vessels to participate in the clearance of dead tissue. Furthermore, astrocytes proliferate and migrate to form the glial scar to separate the lesion from the remaining brain tissue. A function of the scar is to stop neurodegenerative factors from migrating from the lesion into the surviving brain tissue. We hypothesize that these newly formed blood vessels are unable to fully mature into blood vessels with full BBB competency. In addition to this, we also hypothesize that the glial scar is porous and factors present within the lesion can infiltrate into the surviving brain tissue causing continued damage. This damage could be one reason why approximately one third of stroke survivors develop dementia following stroke. Therefore, to extend our knowledge about the restoration of the BBB and the integrity of the glial scar, we experimented on C57BL/6 mice that underwent the distal hypoxic model of stroke. We assessed the integrity of the blood vessels within the lesion following stroke and the permeability of the glial scar at various time points. 54 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN NAVAJO CANCER SURVIVORS JENILLE MONTELONGO-RODRIGUEZ, CHRIS REPKA, BRIAN KINSLOW, JENNIFER HENDRICK DEHEER Introduction: Native Americans have the lowest five-year cancer survival rate of any group in the US. Studies have shown that physical activity can help improve the survivor's quality of life, physical functions, reduce fatigue and risk of recurrence. No studies about exercise in cancer survivors have been done with the Navajo. Purpose: To evaluate what programs and resources Navajo cancer survivors need to improve health and quality of life and reduce recurrence risk Methods: A literature review about Native Americans, physical activity, and cancer was conducted. Additionally, interviews and focus groups with 34 Navajo cancer survivors and 5 family members (16 males, 23 females, average age 56 years old) were done to assess current physical activity habits, barriers, and preferences. Outcomes: The most common cancers were cancers of the colon (30%), breast (27%), gallbladder/gastric (13%), reproductive system (10%) and other (20%). The qualitative data illustrated that late diagnosis was common, challenges with access to care in rural areas and a general lack of Navajo speaking providers. Survivors reported a wide variability in activity levels, and limited knowledge about the appropriateness and intensity of physical activity during and after treatment. Walking was the most commonly reported preferred activity, and 85% reported to prefer exercise with a group (50%) or either with a group or alone (35%). Clinical Relevance/Next Steps: A clinically appropriate and culturally sensitive physical activity program was developed based on these findings. These findings will be pilot tested among a small group of Navajo cancer survivors. TRNA PROCESSING IN TRYPANSOSOMA a parasitic hemoflagellate that causes African Sleeping Sickness (Trypanomiasis) in humans, and Nagana in livestock. The organism is transmitted to humans and animals from the tsetse fly, the vector in which it matures. Currently, there is no vaccination for Trypanomiasis; this is due to its unique ability to evade the host immune system. The host immune system recognizes foreign invaders using the parasite's unique variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. The knowledge of this protein composition is also necessary for vaccine production. However, T. brucei is able to change the composition of its VSG every week, which makes the parasite very infectious and a difficult target for vaccination development. A possible solution is to regulate intracellular VSG production by regulation of tRNA splicing. This experiment was an investigation into tRNA nuclear export, and in particular, splicing. The main goal was to test whether the S. cerevisiae Splicing Endonuclease Complex (SEN) is conserved in T. brucei. Since the SEN primarily targets introns, the only T. brucei Tyrosine intron was used in the analysis. The equivalent intron was isolated from S. cerevisiae, transformed into E. coli and electroporated into T. brucei. Subsequently, T. brucei RNA was extracted, and probed for both processed (spliced) and unprocessed radioactively labeled tRNA. Concurrently, a growth curve of six transformed T. brucei cell lines was plotted to test the impact of Tyr tRNA overexpression, and the incorporation into the T.brucei genome. A growth defect was detected, suggesting that the exogenous S. cerevisiae was indeed being produced. The presence of spliced S. cerevisiae produced from T. brucei cells would suggest that the two organisms have similar Splicing Endonuclease Complexes. Northern blots of the tRNA found both processed and unprocessed tRNA, showing possible conservation of the splicing mechanism.

GERBA Extending clothing length of use between washes is potentially beneficial in many circumstances. For instance, space travel or travel into desolate/rugged environments may demand clothing articles with extended lengths of use to avoid reliance on laundering facilities. Clothing made from antimicrobial textiles benefits from an extended length of use compared traditional textiles. This study aims to utilize various disinfection treatments in combination with antimicrobial textiles to keep personal clothing clean until washing becomes available. Silver-impregnated socks and traditional socks will be inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and treated with either varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or varying levels of UV light intensities, to test the efficiency of each treatment. The hydrogen peroxide and UV treatments which exhibit the largest log reduction will then be implemented in a qualitative study. Human subjects will wear both silver-impregnated and traditional socks to create realistic bacterial levels. The socks will then undergo specified hydrogen peroxide or UV treatment and subsequently be assessed for perceived 'freshness' via an olfactory panel. The efficiency testing is currently underway, and future work will include the qualitative human subject based study. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOB SPECIALIZATION AND BROOD THRESHOLD IN TEMNOTHORAX REGATULUS ANTS ALEXIS MORRISON, NICOLE FISCHER, COLIN LYNCH, ANNA DORNHAUS Division of labor is a distinct trait specific to social insects, however how these insects choose their tasks is not completely known. A proposed mechanism for task specialization is that the workers in the colonies have variations in their response thresholds to different stimuli that affect what tasks they have. This mechanism proposes that the worker will only perform a task when stimuli exceeds its response threshold. However, empirical evidence for response thresholds in social insects and its association with task specialization is still lacking. In this experiment we conducted, Temnothorax regatulus ants were used to explore response thresholds to brood pheromones and task allocation. Each worker's job specialization and time active was determined by observing the ants in videos and documenting their tasks and connecting this to their brood thresholds. We hypothesize that if there is a correlation between the amount of time that an ant does a task and its threshold that there will be a positive relationship that the lower the ants threshold, the more often they will do that task. Preliminary results begin to show that there is not a correlation between the tasks chosen by the ants and their brood thresholds, this means that while this experiment may not provide the answer to what causes division of labor in social insects, it helps factor out what does not contribute to task specialization. IDENTIFICATION OF CYCLIC PEPTIDES TO TARGET BETA AMYLOID (A)-MEDIATED TOXICITY IN CELLULAR SYSTEMS ELISE MUNOZ, AFTABUL HAQUE, SUSAN Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting 40 million people worldwide. AD is characterized by accumulation of neuropathological conformers of amyloid-beta (A) peptides that results in extensive neuronal loss. Exploring peptide and antibody therapeutics to target and inhibit toxic A oligomers is gaining increasing attention. We have established cytotoxic models in yeast and neurons by expressing A and its mutant variants. Intriguingly, both the wild-type and the familial Arctic mutation (E22G) of A robustly increased cytotoxicity whereas expression of a different mutant was nontoxic. Remarkably, upon co-expression, the non-toxic mutant abrogates the cytotoxicity of the toxic peptides (wild-type or Arctic), indicating a protective mechanism by the non-toxic peptide. Cyclization of peptides increases the stability and bioavailability of their linear counterparts, offering improved therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we employed 56 sortase-mediated cyclization of peptides in a yeast model of A-toxicity as a cellular platform to identify, characterize and validate candidate cyclic peptides in preventing A-cytotoxicity. Sortase (SrtA), a bacterial transpeptidase, and a calcium-independent mutant sortase (SrtA-7M) were expressed in the secretory pathway of a yeast A42 model and shown to successfully cyclize target peptides in vivo. Sortase-mediated cyclization of protective peptides in A cytotoxic models will provide an important proof of principle for delineating the mechanism of action of inhibitory cyclic peptides against A-toxicity in a cellular system. Such candidate peptides will also provide insights in understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and a complementary paradigm for drug development for treating AD.

USING BIOORTHOGONAL CHEMISTRY TO PULL-DOWN DENGUE VIRUS PROTEIN INTERACTIONS CELINA NGUYEN, STEPHANIE M. JENSEN, JOHN C. JEWETT A mosquito-borne virus endemic to the tropics and subtropics, dengue (DENV) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Among other obstacles, an incomplete understanding of specific host-virus protein-protein interactions limits the development of anti-viral therapies for DENV. Here, we attempt to use metabolically incorporated azides, an established bioorthogonal moiety, on the surface of DENV to pull down specific host-virus protein-protein interactions with the hopes of identifying potential protein targets for anti-viral therapies. As a proof of concept, we first endeavored to pull down a known interaction between the antibody for the envelope protein of DENV and the envelope protein of DENV. The interaction between the two proteins was fixed via a photo-crosslinker, and the protein complex was then attached to magnetic NeutrAvidin beads using a phosphine-biotinylation reagent that probed for azides in the DENV envelope protein. A fluorescent secondary antibody was then employed to verify that the primary antibody-to-viral protein interaction was successfully pulled down onto the beads. Currently, we are optimizing the conditions of the bioorthogonal strategy as means of identifying protein interactions with DENV. In the future, we plan to progress to identifying protein interactions in DENV-infected mosquitoes. CUSTOM OCT-ENDOSCOPE SYSTEM FOR IN VIVO MOUSE COLON IMAGING RYAN NOLCHEFF, JENNIFER BARTON Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly developing method of imaging for cancer research and is significant for a couple of reasons: first, it can create high resolution (on the order of microns) 3D mapping of a tissue sample with minimal - if any - invasive cutting into the tissue. This small scale resolution is advantageous for observation of some of the earliest signs of cancer. Second, OCT can use infrared or near-infrared light, which is a marginally harmless wavelength range that minimize scattering with tissue interactions. The conjunction of a custom endoscope for mouse colon imaging and the Thorlabs OCS1050SS swept-source OCT system designed previously by a former colleague (Dr. Weston Welge) allowed for in vivo imaging specifically for mouse colon. The integration of both a rotational and linear motor that are programmed to respond to the electrical signals controlling the mirrors in the OCT system created a helical scanning pattern from the endoscope. The implementation and improvement of an inverting differentiator and rectifying circuit and an Arduino Uno minimized the delay between the OCT system's data acquisition period and the mechanical movement of the motors. Because the dispersion between the custom endoscope and the OCT system are not matched, a MATLAB numerical dispersion compensation algorithm developed previously in lab must be used on the initial image to improve overall resolution. The system provides images with an approximate lateral and axial resolution of 10-15 \u00b5m and a depth of 1.5-2mm, however this is dependent on the wavelengths used and the optics in the endoscope.

PTTD is treated with either immobilization or surgery followed by physical rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative and objective method to characterize the mechanical properties of the posterior tibial tendon in vivo. The ongoing study is comparing properties of the PTT in patients with advanced tendinopathy (pre- and post- physical therapy) with that of healthy volunteers. Subjects sit on an elevated platform with their foot on a platform with ~30\u00b0 plantar flexion and asked to push against a force transducer by inverting their foot and keeping the heel motionless. A sonographer captures ultrasound movies (phase and amplitude) of the PTT at 50 Hz as the foot inverts. A 2D phase-sensitive cross correlation speckle tracking algorithm calculates the 2D displacement of the tendon. Based on the gradient of the displacement maps, strain images of the PTT are formed. In combination with data from the force plate, the elastic modulus of a PTT can be calculated at the vulnerable region above the malleolus. Based on preliminary data, elastic moduli of patients with tendinopathy tend to be higher than those of healthy patients. For example, one patient had a tendinopathic left tendon with E=0.7\u00b10.63 and a healthy right tendon with E=0.045\u00b10.019 whereas a healthy patient had moduli for the left and right, respectively, E=0.037\u00b10.013 and E=0.005\u00b10.014. We have also found that the linear correlation between stress and strain used to compute these moduli is generally greater in healthy patients. The tendinopathic patient had R^2 for the left and right, respectively, R^2=0.64\u00b10.06 and R^2=0.59\u00b10.28 whereas the healthy patient had R^2 for the left and right, respectively, R^2=0.85\u00b10.15 and R^2=0.54\u00b10.24. We have seen this trend of lower elastic moduli and greater correlation between stress and strain in healthy tendons compared to tendinopathic ones across consistently across many trials. A noninvasive and quantitative method that accurately characterizes weak tendons could help determine which PTTD should be treated with conservative immobilization therapy or surgery.

ALTERED METABOLISM IN A TDP-43 MODEL OF ALS IN DROSOPHILA ABIGAIL O'CONNER, ERNESTO MANZO, SYLVIA ZARNESCU, DANIELA ZARNESCU ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no cure. Several genes have been linked to ALS, including TDP-43, C9ORF72, and SOD1. While only 2-3% of ALS cases harbor mutations in the RNA binding protein TDP-43, more than 95% of patients exhibit TDP-43 positive cytoplasmic inclusions. A Drosophila model of ALS using both wild-type and mutant TDP-43 expression has been shown to recapitulate several pathogenic hallmarks of the disease, including motor dysfunction and decreased survival. Because metabolic changes have been seen in ALS patients, we have investigated whether similar defects are also present in our fly model. Indeed, metabolomics studies show that, as in ALS patients, flies expressing TDP-43 in motor neurons exhibit a significant increase in pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, and alterations in the TCA cycle. Using a larval locomotion assay which quantifies differences in locomotor function, we have tested the effects of dietary changes on larvae expressing TDP-43 in motor neurons or glia. Increased dietary glucose appears to alleviate motor dysfunction in wild-type and mutant larvae (both in motor neuronal and glial expression), while also increasing survival time in adult flies. These phenotypic improvements were also seen in C9ORF72 58 and SOD1 expressing larvae. Consistent with these dietary findings, coexpression of the glucose transporters GLUT4 or GLUT3 in addition to TDP-43 shows a similar improvement in motor function, both in the TDP-43 wild-type and mutant larvae. Additionally, the introduction of different fats into the diet of larvae expressing TDP-43 in motor neurons appears to also improve motor function at specific dosages. Taken together, these data suggest that the TDP-43 based fly model of ALS experiences specific alterations in metabolism that parallel the changes seen in patients and offer novel strategies for therapeutic and dietary intervention for ALS.

RODDEY, M.J. CORENBLUM, AND L. MADHAVAN Our recent work has examined the temporal and molecular dynamics of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) function in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of aging animals (Corenblum et al., 2016). These studies identified a critical time-period during middle-age (13-15 mos), when a marked reduction in NSPC survival and regenerative capacity occurred, and determined the reduced expression of the redox-sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), as an important mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Given these findings, we are currently analyzing whether Nrf2 might also play a role in regulating the regenerative capacity of NSPCs residing within the other major mammalian germinal niche, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. More specifically, in this study, we characterized NSPCs in the hippocampi of newborn (N) Nrf2 knockout (KO, Nrf2-/-) and wild-type (WT, Nrf2+/+) mice. Briefly, brains were extracted and sectioned on a cryostat and immunohistochemistry targeting specific NSPC antigens was performed. In particular we studied the expression of Ki67 (NSPC proliferation marker), Sox2 (type B and C NSPC Doublecortin (DCX, newborn neuron marker), and Protein (GFAP, type B NSPC and glial cell marker) at this developmental stage. It was observed that while we noted protein expression typical in newborn mice in WT samples, there was a decrease in expression of Ki67, Sox2, and DCX. There was no noticeable change between GFAP expression in WT and KO mice. We are currently quantifying the expression of the four NSPC antigens, and we are analyzing adult cohorts of Nrf2 KO animals to understand the influence of Nrf2 on aging DG NSPC function. So far, our results indicate that Nrf2 may be a potentially important factor influencing the proliferation and neurogenic capacity of DG NSPCs.

REGULATION OF LATERAL ROOT GROWTH IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA DANIEL OSORIO, FRANS E. TAX Plants employ long-distance signaling as a mechanism of communication between the shoot and the root system. These long-distance signals convey the nutritional status of the environment, such as the availability of nitrogen in the soil, and allow plants to optimize their growth and energy expenditure under suboptimal conditions. C-terminally Encoded Peptides (CEPs) and CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region-related (CLE) peptides are two types of small-secreted peptides that participate in the two currently known pathways of peptide-mediated long-distance signaling in Arabidopsis Encoded Peptide Receptors (CEPR1 and CEPR2), whereas CLE peptides bind to the CLV1 receptor. The purpose of this study is to characterize the relationship between the CEP- and CLE-mediated pathways of lateral root regulation in Arabidopsis. 59 To accomplish this, we screened for cepr1 (xip1), cepr2, and clv1 double and triple mutant plant specimens and performed genetic interaction analyses. The anticipated result of this project is the categorization of the CEP- and CLE-mediated signaling mechanisms as acting in the same genetic pathway or as being part of two separate pathways. The outcome of this project may have major implications for crop yield efficiency and other agricultural aspects of plant growth.

THE ART OF DATA VISUALIZATION FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCER RESEARCH THROUGH FRONT AND BACK END DEVELOPMENT KATIE PAN, JACOB GARLANT, MARVIN SLEPIAN, DAVID ARMSTRONG Diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic extremity amputations in the United States and it is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2010. 15% of those cases will result in a patient developing a diabetic foot ulcer. A diabetic foot ulcer is an open sore or wound that is commonly located on the bottom of the foot. Of those who develop a foot ulcer, 6 percent will be hospitalized due to infection or other ulcer-related complication. Luckily, research has shown, however, that development of a foot ulcer is preventable. With the rise of computer science and programming, research labs are now utilizing the front and back end software development to simplify data analysis and data visualization techniques. INVESTIGATING THE NEUROLOGICAL BASIS FOR DIVISION OF LABOR IN ANTS WESLEY PARKS, NICOLE FISCHER, ANNA DORNHAUS, WULFILA GRONENBERG, ALEXIS MORRISON Most organisms exhibit differences in their behavior. The social hymenoptera-(ants, bees, and wasps)-have a distinct system of behaviorial differences within the colony, known as division of labor. In this system, individuals tend to devote a substantial amount of time to certain tasks resulting in 'specialists' within the colony. Another type of division of labor exists in overall activity level, with some workers doing most of the work and others performing none at all. It is still largely a mystery as to how division of labor arises. Much of the research in this area focuses on polymorphic species which have behavioral castes based on differences in body morphology. In the brown rock ant Temnothorax rugatulus, individuals within the colony are monomorphic (i.e. have limited differences among each other in body morphology). We are interested in a neurological basis for the behavioral differences between individuals in this species. Specific areas of interest include the volume of sensory processing areas in the central nervous system of the ants, mainly the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies, and their relation to activity levels. In this study, we aim to discover if more active ants in the colony have larger volumes of sensory processing areas relative to the less active individuals. To test this, each individual is tracked to measure the proportion of time they allocate to each task. To measure relative brain volumes of the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies, the brain of each ant is then preserved, dissected, and imaged using confocal microscopy. The behavior data is compared to the volume of the sensory processing areas to examine the relation between division of labor, specifically activity level, and the central nervous system.

Cardiac hypertrophy can be induced by a number of pathological and non-pathological events. What distinguishes the two events is not a well-studied process. The process of cardiac hypertrophy appears to be affected by FXR1 protein expression such that lower FXR1 expression modulates the hypertrophy pathway in some way causing less cardiac hypertrophy. Alternatively, increased FXR1 expression results in increased cardiac hypertrophy. The Fragile X family of RNA binding proteins are often studied within the scope of mental retardation and autism. However according to current findings, FXR1 may serve to modulate the hypertrophy pathway. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured. Using transduction, FXR1 was either overexpressed or knocked down in cells. Between five different cultures, FXR1 overexpressed cells displayed a significant size decrease when compared to control cells and FXR1 knockdown cells displayed a significant size increase when compared to control cells. Translational activity may also be affected by FXR1 expression. SUnSET analysis is currently in use to determine the manner in which translational activity in the cell is altered by FXR1. Further cell size and protein analysis studies are in progress to continue to elucidate specifically how FXR1 modulates cardiac hypertrophy. This work was funded in part by BIO 5. QUANTIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVISION OF LABOR AND THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS ANTS VARUSKA PATNI, NICOLE FISCHER, ANNA DORNHAUS Eusocial hymenoptera (e.g. ants, wasps, bees) have division of labor, a system in which individual ants in a colony specialize in different tasks, and each task is completed by the same set individuals. Here, we explore how differences in the nervous system among workers drive this task specialization. A leading mechanism in studies on division of labor proposes that task specialization arises because individual workers have different response thresholds to these task-related stimuli. Currently, there is little empirical evidence for how the nervous system gives rise to response thresholds. Here, we test the hypothesis that variation in the elaboration of the sensory organs underlies response thresholds and thus task specialization. Using Temnothorax rugatulus ants, task specialization, response threshold to brood and sensory organ elaboration was quantified for each worker. If our hypothesis is supported we expect that ants specializing in a particular task, such as foraging, will feature more elaborate sensory organs and lower response thresholds to brood. We hypothesize that higher sensilla amount indicates higher sensory processing and thus lower response threshold and a more specialized task. Various subjects' sensilla hair will be compared in order to come to a conclusion. The source of funding for this project was NSF GRFP # STELLA ZHANG, SHAOWEN BAO An organism's experiences strongly shape the way that sensory information is represented in the brain, especially experiences in early development. For example, mice repeatedly exposed to sounds at a particular frequency early in development have an increased area of auditory cortex devoted to responding to sounds at that frequency. This early developmental period of heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli is known as the critical period and is characterized by heightened synaptic plasticity. Gene expression can influence synaptic plasticity; therefore it is possible that drugs altering gene expression could influence synaptic plasticity in auditory cortex. To analyze this question adult wild type mice were exposed to 16kHz sound pips while simultaneously injecting them with saline, for 9 days. Then after a one-day rest period we mapped the auditory cortex of the mice. This process will be repeated with mice injected with HDAC inhibitors, or DNA methylation inhibitors (both of which 61 are drugs known to alter gene expression). Preliminary results show that the mice exposed to saline injections show normal mapping of frequencies in auditory cortex. Data collection is still in process however if the epigenetic modulators increase plasticity, we would expect to find altered frequency representations in the auditory cortex of mice injected with HDAC inhibitors and DNA methylation inhibitors.

PETERSON Can prediction of an upcoming object affect how it's perceived? In particular, can the perceived sharpness of an object's borders be increased when it is predicted? We assessed the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE), the point at which two stimuli with borders that vary in blur are perceived as equally sharp. Participants viewed two small, enclosed black silhouette objects on a gray background in a psychophysical procedure in which a Test object varied in blur, from low to high levels across trials while another object, the Standard, was held at a constant medium blur value. We manipulated predictions on each trial by presenting a briefly exposed masked word prime outside of conscious awareness before the object display; the word was related or unrelated to the Test object. The left/right location of the Test and Standard objects varied across trials; each object served as Standard and Test equally often. Participants' task was to report which object - left or right -- was blurrier. In Experiment 1, the stimuli were two familiar objects (a butterfly and a bow). In Experiment 2, one object was familiar (a table lamp); the other was a matched novel object created by rearranging the parts of the familiar object. Neither experiment revealed an effect of word prime. Thus, no effect of prediction on perceived sharpness was observed. However, in both experiments one of the objects was perceived as sharper than the other (Experiment 1 = the bow; Experiment 2 = the familiar object). In both experiments, the objects perceived as sharper had a greater intrusion from the outside, groundside, along their borders than the other object. Hence, these results may indicate that the perceived sharpness of an object's borders is a function of the amount of inhibitory competition for object status, which is greater when there is more intrusion from the groundside. A third experiment is testing this hypothesis. These findings are consistent with claims that, rather than being a winner-take-all mechanism, the amount of inhibition of the groundside depends on the amount of competition for object status. Thus, these results elucidate the competitive mechanisms underlying object perception. EXAMINING THE CAUSE OF CELL DEATH IN MUCOLIPIDOSIS TYPE IV SAVANNAH PERNO, HOPE DANG, HANNA FARES Mucolipidosis Type IV is a lysosome storage disorder in humans characterized by slowed psychomotor development, vision loss, and early death. Mucolipidosis Type IV (ML4) is caused by mutations in the gene MCOLN1, which encodes the cation elegans orthologue of TRPML1. Our imaging studies have shown that loss of CUP-5 in C. elegans results in a strong lysosomal defect that leads to cell death and embryonic lethality. Using confocal imaging, we detected lysosomal leakage into the cytoplasm of degradative enzymes that may be the basis for the cell death. The goal of this study is to develop a biochemical assay to quantitate lysosomal leakage in wild type embryos and in the absence of CUP-5. We would then use this assay to determine whether genetic suppressors of cup-5 mutant cell death also suppress lysosomal leakage, thus establishing a correlation between lysosomal leakage and cell death. Defining the basis for the cell death in the absence of CUP-5 is an important step for developing therapies for Mucolipidosis Type IV.

CAMENISCH Chronic exposure to arsenic is linked to increased risk for cancers of the lung, kidney, bladder, and liver. Non-cancerous disease endpoints such as atherosclerosis, birth defects, metabolic syndrome and hypertension are also associated with arsenic exposure. Many of the organ systems impacted by arsenic require epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) to establish and maintain tissue homeostasis. For example, developmental EMT contributes to lung, neural tube and heart morphogenesis. As such, disruption of EMT programming by arsenic can result in birth defects and predispose to diseases later in life. The mechanisms by which arsenic disrupts EMT is not known. Long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a retrotransposon of the human and mouse genomes, and recently linked to conotruncal heart defects. Such defects arise from malformation of the outflow tract of the embryonic heart through altered EMT. In the present study, we discovered induction of Line-1 by arsenic and investigated whether Line-1 impacts cardiac developmental EMT. An increase in ORF-1 and ORF-2 Line-1 mRNAs was detected, starting 2 hr after exposure to arsenic and peaking at 8 hr. Line-1 protein is also increased following arsenic exposure with increased dose-dependent localization of Line-1 in the nuclear compartment. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of Line-1 was induced by arsenic in a time and dose dependent manner. Lastly, using a unique mouse genetic model we found that ectopic Line-1 expression functionally attenuated cardiac EMT in an ex vivo collagen gel invasion assay. On the bases of these findings we conclude that arsenic and Line-1 block R25ES025494. SIZE MATTERS: AND VARYING COLONY SIZE AFFECT TEMNOTHORAX RUGATULUS NESTBUILDING BEHAVIOR JENNA PIMENTEL, ANNA DORNHAUS, NICHOLAS DIRIENZO Previous studies have found that each ant colony possesses its own unique nest architecture, explained best by differences in colony behavior. Because these observations were given mostly by field studies, environmental factors may also play a role in nest architecture. Given the potentially drastic evolutionary consequences with both interactions, it is important to conduct an experiment to identify a significant relationship between ant intercolonial traits and nest architecture, and between environmental conditions and ant nest architecture. In this experiment we use several colonies of Temnothorax rugatulus ants to establish a variation in number of brood and number of workers. We followed the repeated measures design by transferring the colonies into new nest building arenas every twelve days, and controlling the experimental conditions for each nest. Colonies were transferred a total of three times so that they were forced to build four different nests. Two of these nests were covered and two were uncovered, imitating environmental humidity and good airflow, respectively. Statistical analyses of data indicate a positive correlation between worker number and wall length, nest weight, and internal area, as well as no correlation between these variables and brood number (the p-value for brood number v. internal area shows weak correlation, but this is thought to be indicative of spatial accommodation for a larger colony population rather than of certain brood behavior, so the value is determined to be insignificant for the purposes of this experiment). This may follow the general idea that ant nests are built longer and stronger because of the greater amount of worker resources available to the colonies. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between the two means for covered and uncovered arenas, indicating that there may be a tendency for ants to invest more time and energy into building longer and thicker nest walls under conditions of greater humidity as opposed to lesser humidity. 63 SEMI-AUTOMATED QUANTIFICATION OF TOXOPLASMA - CNS HOST CELL INTERACTIONS COLIN POTTER, OSCAR A. MENDEZ, THOMAS BELLO, MICHAEL VALDEZ, ELIZABETH G. FERNANDEZ, THEODORE P. TROUARD, ANITA A. KOSHY Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that establishes a chronic infection in the central nervous system (CNS) of many mammals, including humans and mice. While asymptomatic in most, the persistent CNS infection can be fatal in immunocompromised patients and is present in up to a third of the world's population. Despite this prevalence, Toxoplasma - CNS interactions are poorly understood. Recent studies have indicated that cysts localize to specific regions of the brain, and behavioral outcomes have been connected with these localizations. In an effort to further investigate the Toxoplasma - CNS interaction, we took advantage of our Toxoplasma-Cre system, which allows us to permanently mark and identify CNS cells that have directly interacted with parasites. In this system, we infect Cre reporter mice with parasites that have been engineered to secrete a Toxoplasma:Cre recombinase fusion protein into host cells, thus only cells that have been injected with Toxoplasma protein will undergo Cre-mediated recombination and express ZsGreen, a fluorescent protein. This system offers a novel method to visualize specific cells that have interacted with Toxoplasma and investigate behavioral outcomes of this interaction. To quantify regions of interaction, we immunohistochemically label the ZsGreen positive cells (ZsG+), then detect and map the neuroanatomic location of ZsG+ cells with a custom MATLAB-based semi-automated computer program. To verify this semi-automated method, we assessed both inter- and intra-operator error, which revealed consistency, reliability, and accuracy between trained operators and counting sessions. To date, we have analyzed infected tissue from mice infected with 2 different Toxoplasma strains for 3 and 8 weeks each. Our preliminary data suggest that, in CNS infection with either strain and at both time points, Toxoplasma parasites primarily interact with cortical and striatal neurons, which is seen both in the absolute number of ZsG+ cells and when normalized based on regional area to account for random distribution. These data indicate that Toxoplasma may have a higher affinity for specific brain regions and potentially for specific neuronal subtypes. Future investigation using co-localization of ZsG+ cells with neuronal subtype markers and behavioral testing will aid in elucidating the nature of Toxoplasma - CNS host cell interactions.

THE ROLE OF HIPPOCAMPAL REPLAY IN A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF PATH LEARNING MICHAEL RAGONE, S. GIANELLI, D. SCHWARTZ, L. SU, O.O. KOYLUOGLU, J.M.

The abstract from this conference can be found here: http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/presentation/9817 AGING OF DENTATE GYRUS CORENBLUM, D.D. ZHANG, C.A. BARNES, L. MADHAVAN 64 A NEW SELF-GUIDED REHABILITATION TASK DESIGNED TO REDUCE SOMATOSENSORY SENSITIVITY AND IMPROVE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTAL TBI JENNA RITCHIE, LOREN M LAW, DANIEL R. GRIFFITHS, THERESA C. THOMAS, JONATHAN LIFSHITZ Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not a transient event from which all people recover; the resulting damage can evolve into neurological disease. In rats, TBI disrupts circuits, expressed as cognitive impairment and sensitivity to whisker stimulation. The current study sought to establish a rehabilitation task targeting somatosensory and cognitive functions. The task takes place in a box with a peg board floor (24X24) that allows for 3 plastic pegs to be inserted at 1 inch intervals anywhere across the board. The configuration of pegs promotes whisker stimulation as rats explore the environment. To test feasibility of this approach, a pilot study was conducted by exposing rats to navigate through increasingly denser peg configurations as rehabilitation for TBI. Rats received sham or midline fluid percussion injury. Rats explored the peg-filled arena for 12 days over 2 weeks (or served as caged controls) and then tested for whisker sensitivity and working memory. Brain-injured rats that received rehabilitation showed sensory sensitivity levels similar to sham, while injured rats without rehabilitation showed elevated sensitivity. When tested on working memory using temporal object recognition, the injured rats without rehabilitation showed significant memory impairment compared to sham rats (t(3)=5.22, p<0.05). Injured rats that received rehabilitation performed at similar levels to sham rats and improved performance compared to injured rats without rehabilitation (t(3)=2.56, p=0.051). These exploratory results indicate that following a TBI, the self-guided rehabilitation through a forest of pegs reduced whisker sensitivity and cognitive impairment. Guided by this pilot, a study is underway to determine the benefits of self-guided rehabilitation compared to open field exploration over the course of 2 weeks in sham and injured rats. Efficacy is evaluated on a battery of behavioral tests, with primary endpoints on cognitive performance evaluated in object recognition tasks. We approach rehabilitative treatments for TBI as amenable to clinical translation to improve quality of life. Supported, in part, by the Diane and Bruce Halle Foundation. AMMONIA-OXIDATION MICROBIOTA ABUNDANCE ON AN ARID MINE SITE BENJAMIN RIVERA, LYDIA JENNINGS, CATHERINE F. GULLO, RAINA M. MAIER, JULIA W. NEILSON Mining is inextricably linked to the daily practices of the industrialized world as most of our modern tools and technologies contain metals which can be obtained from no other source. Notwithstanding, mining presents a host of environmental issues, including significant landscape disturbance resulting from the massive waste rock piles and tailings storage dams produced by mine operations. These waste materials are devoid of nutrients for plant growth, making ecosystem reclamation difficult. Reclamation typically requires costly revegetation strategies including the regrading of steep slopes and the installation of soil caps over waste materials. Our lab seeks to provide biogeochemical indicators which can be used to evaluate substrate quality to assist mining companies in effectively assessing different reclamation strategies. Nitrogen (N) is one nutrient factor limiting plant establishment on mine wastes. The preferred form for plant-uptake, nitrate (NO3-) is obtained from ammonia (NH4+) through nitrification, a process mediated by microbes. Specifically, the first, rate-limiting step, ammonia-oxidation to nitrite (NO2-), (AOA). The amoA gene, encoding the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme (AMO), that facilitates the chemical transformation, is used as a molecular marker to quantify the populations of these organisms. We hypothesize that the relative abundance of AOB and AOA populations will indicate substrate quality for plant growth. AOA are frequently found to be the dominant ammonia-oxidizers in nutrient poor sites. This study will construct clone libraries of archaeal amoA amplicons from the Carlota Copper Mine to evaluate AOA diversity. Representative plasmids will then be selected as standards to be used with existing AOB standards for quantitative PCR to determine the relative abundance of AOA and AOB populations as well as possible correlations with environmental parameters, shown to drive population dynamics. The results will be used to propose a follow-up study on activity, as the presence of the gene does not always equate to expression.

For unknown reasons, in some individuals, pain may become chronic. Unfortunately, there are no cures for chronic pain. Opioids remain one of the most important classes of drugs to treat pain but whether they are useful in chronic pain remains uncertain. Additionally, these drugs have significant side effects including tolerance, dependence and addiction. As a result, there is an urgent medical need to elucidate the underlining mechanisms by which relief of pain occurs. Opioids produce their effects primarily by alleviating the aversive qualities of pain. How this occurs is not known but pain aversiveness is thought to be integrated, in part, in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Cortical regions in the brain likely contribute to context dependent modulation of the pain experience through projections that ultimately converge on the the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Here, we determined the effects of microinjection of morphine in several regions of the rat ACC in rats with chronic experimental neuropathic pain induced by ligation of the spinal nerve (SNL model). The possible effect of ACC or RVM morphine on mechanical hypersensitivity was evaluated using von Frey filaments. Microinjection of morphine into different sites of the ACC failed to reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in nerve injured animals. In contrast, morphine injection in the RVM reversed evoked thresholds in SNL animals. These findings suggest that morphine may differentially modulate affective dimensions of pain within the ACC without altering sensory components. The primary goal of this research is to understand the nature of the neuroanatomical contributions of the ACC and its role in descending pain modulatory pathways. Further studies exploring other sites within the ACC with measures of affective qualities of pain may ultimately lead to a better understanding of opioid-sensitive circuitry. CRMP2 EXPRESSION AND THE HEALTHY AND INJURED BRAIN SERGIO SALGUERO, KIM YOUNG, JONATHAN LIFSHITZ, HELENA MORRISON Microglia\u2014the brain macrophage\u2014are highly ramified cells in the healthy brain. This is a morphology that is necessary to maintain a variety of neuronal and glial physiologic functions. Moreover, microglia have an immediate morphologic response to injury. The level of ramification and complexity of microglial shapes change in order to accommodate a change in microglia function (from surveillance to phagocytosis). As such, microglia morphologies reflect their cell function as well as the health-status of the cells in their micro-domains. We postulate that microglia morphology could be used as a biomarker of brain physiology/pathophysiology. The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of computer-aided methods to quantify microglia morphologies in physiologic and pathologic conditions. Adult male and female (estrus, diestrus, and accelerated ovarian failure) mice were euthanized to study microglia morphology in the physiologic brain (N=9-19/group). In addition, experimental diffuse brain injury (DBI) was delivered to adult rats using a fluid percussion method. Rats recovered for 1, 7 and 28 days post-injury (or sham) prior to tissue collection (N=3). In both studies, microglia ramified morphology and complexity of shape were quantified from photomicrographs imaged from cortical brain regions after immunohistochemistry. ImageJ plugins were used to quantify cell ramification (AnalyzeSkeleton(2D/3D)), complexity. and shape (FracLac). We reveal morphologic differences in the healthy brain according to sex, cycle, and ovarian function (skeleton analysis: F(3,49)=15.48, p<0.0001 and fractal analysis: F(3,49)=5.11, F(2,24)=43.15, p<0.0001) 28 multiple, easy-to-employ, and highly sensitive computer-aided methodologies (skeleton analysis and FracLac) useful in quantifying microglia morphologies in the healthy and injured brain. We expect that such analysis methods will be valuable tools to not only link microglia form and function but also in the use of microglia morphology as a biomarker of brain physiology/pathophysiology.

SHERMAN, FRANK PORRECA, TORSTEN FALK Paralysis agitans, commonly referred to as Parkinson's disease (PD), is a hypokinetic, age-related movement disorder associated with chronic, progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which have cell bodies located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and Striatal depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) gives rise to the cardinal motor symptoms of PD, which include bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability, and muscular rigidity. Here, we utilized a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) animal model of PD to test the application of a preclinical drug candidate, drug X, in ameliorating and/or preventing advanced parkinsonism in two main studies. Our PD animal model was created by unilaterally administrating the neurotoxin 6-OHDA into the dorsolateral striatum of Sprague-Dawley rats, which has been shown to cause selective degeneration of DAergic neurons in the SNc. The first investigated study, a neurorestoration study, sought to test the efficacy of drug X in restoring motor functionality to animals in which the 6-OHDA lesion had fully developed, while the second study, a neuroprotection study, assessed the effectiveness of drug X in preventing the initial development of the 6-OHDA lesion and the associated onset of motor impairments. Preliminary behavioral data indicate that there are no significant differences between the control and drug X groups in both studies, suggesting that this particular drug candidate does not improve established PD motor deficits nor prevent their initial development. However, we are analyzing brain tissue harvested from both studies to 1) verify the presence of a 6-OHDA lesion with stereology in the SNc, 2) to evaluate striatal dopamine levels, and 3) to investigate any neuroprotective effects of drug X on nigral DAergic neurons. Pending the results of these analyses, we may seek to evaluate the effects of drug X in a preclinical rodent model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in future studies.

DYNAMIC MODEL TO OPTIMIZE ULTRASOUND ELASTICITY IMAGING OF HUMAN TENDON FOR ASSESSMENT OF ADVANCED TENDINOPATHIES HANNAH SCHMITZ, LIANG GAO, NUNCIO ZUNIGA, DANIEL LATT, RUSSELL S. WITTE Tendinopathies can be debilitating and interfere with basic daily activities. To prevent such progression, there is need for better diagnostic methods to quantify severity and guide treatment decisions. Functional ultrasound elasticity imaging (fUEI) is an in vivo technique for estimating mechanical properties of tendon. In fUEI, ultrasound frames are collected as a subject performs a voluntary motor task to dynamically load the tendon (or muscle), while a force transducer measures force. Ultrasound speckle tracking is then applied across several ultrasound frames to estimate strain. This approach allows for calculating the linear and nonlinear elastic behavior of tendon, which may change with disease progression. We are currently evaluating fUEI in patients with posterior tibial tendon (PTT) disorder; however, in an in vivo setting, it is difficult to assess the method's accuracy and sources of error. The purpose of this work was to develop an ultrasound model of human tendon to study possible error sources for tracking tendon motion and estimating its mechanical properties. A 3D ultrasound model of the human PTT was developed in FOCUS simulation software and Matlab. The tendon was modeled as a cylinder with a diameter of 4.5 mm and a speckle density of 52 scatterers/mm3. A 14 MHz hockey stick linear ultrasound array with parameters similar to that implemented during in vivo experiments was used to produce simulated ultrasound data. The tendon was deformed according to a programmed strain profile, and ultrasound frames were generated. 67 A 2D phase-sensitive cross correlation speckle tracking program calculated tendon displacement and strain. We examined the effects of out-of-plane motion and strain rate on 2D tracking error as well as the programmed elastic properties of the PTT. With no out-of-plane motion, simulations revealed that lateral strain rates between 1-5 Hz produced tracking error less than 0.5 pixels. However, with an out-of-plane motion equal to one acoustic wavelength (154 \u00b5m), tracking error dramatically increased at strain rates above 4 Hz. Out-of-plane motion of two wavelengths (308 \u00b5m) at 1% strain produced an average correlation coefficient of 0.61, whereas no out-of-plane motion had a correlation of 0.96.

PROTEIN COMPLEX FORMATION AND C-MYC REGULATION OF PROSTATE CANCER LEONARD SEANEZ, RONALD HEIMARK, KELSEY GUEST Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Metastatic prostate cancer commonly shows MYC amplification. c-Myc is a transcription factor that contributes to the cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis and cellular transformation. MYC proteins levels are largely regulated at the level of degradation by numerous kinases which lead to ubiquitination. We have shown that c-MYC half-life is enhanced in prostate cancer cells versus in benign prostate epithelium. This stabilization of c-MYC in Du145 cells appears to be though expression of the long noncoding RNA PVT1. c-Myc protein plays a role in the activation of many different genes.c-Myc interacts with genes through a dimeric complex of c-Myc and Max that binds to the specific sequences of CACGTG Enhancer Box (Ebox) motifs.In addition to the known binding partners of c-Myc, Max and MYCBP, the broad association of c-Myc to chromatin is dependent on the WD40-repeat protein WDR5. WDR5 is a protein which may facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes that are effectors of histone H3K4 methylation WDR5 was overexpressed in Du145 cells by transfection and an anti-Flag antibody was used to co-immunoprecipitate WDR5 and associated proteins were analyzed by SDS/ PAGE and Western Blotting. The association between c-MYC and WDR5 was verified. c-Myc binds WDR5 by the MYC box lllb motif and is an important factor in c-Myc recruitment to chromatin. We will test whether c-MYC interaction with WDR5 aids in stabilizing c-MYC from degradation by overexpression and siRNA knockdown of WDR5. This interaction between c-Myc and WDR5 could be important because it can be a target for drugs to disrupt the interaction between c-Myc and WDR5 to prevent c-Myc's downstream tumorigenic effects when it is upregulated and able to bind AUTOLOGOUS FAT GRAFTING FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF GAIT, PEAK PRESSURE AND FUNCTIONALITY IN PEOPLE IN DIABETIC FOOT REMISSION: TOWARD EXTENDING ULCER-FREE DAYS TALA SHAHIN, KAIRAVI VAISHNAV, JORDAN GARTH, ETHAN LARSON, SUBBLAN VIGNESH, DAVID G. ARMSTRONG A major complication of diabetes, foot ulcers will affect at least one fifth of people with the disease. Half of these patients become infected and at least 20% of those infections lead to an amputation. Following often complex courses of healing, reulceration is approximately 40%, 66% and 75% at one, three and five years, respectively. Extending ulcer-free days for this population would be desirable. The use of fat grafting has been instituted by our group as a means of redistributing shear and normal stress of the foot after remission of plantar diabetic foot ulcers. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a plantar fat graft on patients with diabetic foot ulcers to assess the improvement of plantar pressure and fat pad thickness on gait, with the ultimate goal of reducing the risk of reulceration. Five feet in four patients in diabetic foot remission (ADA Foot Risk Category 3, 100% male, 55.9 \u00b1 1.8yr) received plantar fat grafting liposuction their postulcerative plantar wound. Using wearable pressure sensors (TekScan, Boston, USA), real-time plantar pressure was measured serially. Patients were instructed to walk at a self-selected speed for twenty-five meters without assistance other than their medically prescribed footwear. Changes in force and pressure were assessed preoperatively and at 2 months, postoperatively. Using a paired analysis, patients received a mean 45.4 \u00b1 8.0% reduction in peak pressure at the site of previous ulceration following fat grafting (p = 0.002). A postoperative 58.0 \u00b1 28.3% reduction in force time impulse of the site of ulceration, was also noted (p=0.01). Initial results of this ongoing project suggest a potential net protective effect in people undergoing plantar fat grafting/lipofilling at areas at high risk for reulceration as evidenced by plantar pressure reduction. This study was supported by a University of Arizona ACCELERATE for SUCCESS grant. ARSENIC TOXICITY IN DUST-LADEN PARTICLES RUBY SIERRA, SCOTT BOITANO Arsenic is a toxic metalloid frequently found in mine tailings from Arizona. Arsenic ingestion from contaminated drinking water has been associated with increased cancer risk, lung, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases. However, the effects of inhalation of arsenic laden dust are not well characterized and models predict airborne respirable dust to increase due to drier climates with increased wind. In our study, part of a larger group from the University of Arizona Superfund, we are investigating the toxicological effects of inhalation of arsenic-laden dust through cell models. The immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells used in these studies (16HBE14o- cells) originate from the epithelial lining of the human bronchi, and thus, represent the initial point of contact for inhaled dusts. Our initial experiments use an advanced high-capacity toxicity screening device, the xCELLigence real time cell analyzer (RTCA), to evaluate airway epithelial cell toxicity. We used the RTCA to compare toxicity between dust from mine tailings and control areas. 16HBE14o- cells were exposed for 24-48 hours to dusts and continually evaluated for cytotoxicity and cell-signaling toxicity. In a more targeted approach, we are now exploring the effects of mine-tailing and control dusts on tight junction proteins in the airway epithelial cells using immunocytochemistry. These proteins, allow for epithelial cells to form a sheet and thus prevent insults that enter into the airway from reaching underlying tissues. Initial findings from these two experimental approaches will be used to further in vitro and in vivo experiments that aim to develop interventions that could offset any detrimental effects of mine tailing dust.

FALK EFFECTS ON DELTA AND THETA POWER DURING SLEEP IN LRRK2 MOUSE MODEL OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE KIANOUSH SOOFI, JEAN-PAUL L. WIEGAND, KATHLEEN F. GIES, STEPHEN L. COWEN The most common form of genetically-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) can be found in individuals with mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene. Here we used a transgenic mouse model to examine how neural activity during sleep was altered in genetic knock-ins of the LRRK2 gene. As indicated in previous work, Delta activity is increased in certain cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Another previous study also indicated that Theta power was increased in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that Delta power and Theta power would also be increased in the LRRK2 model. Neural signals were recorded from LRRK2 knock-in mice as they slept. They slept for two, two-hour blocks during each recording session, with recording sessions occurring in five consecutive days. Sleep was determined with position tracking, motion tracking, and in data analysis of neural signals. Preliminary data suggests that delta and theta power during sleep in LRRK2 individuals was increased when compared to controls. Delta power increased by 25.66 decibels while Theta power increased by 33.83 decibels. This increase in neural activity could provide insight into possible causes for the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and may provide a potential indicator of individuals at-risk for Parkinson's Disease. IDENTIFICATION OF IXODES TICK DEFENSIN ACTIVITY AGAINST BORRELIA STACY SUAREZ CHAM, RYAN REGO A live dead assay was employed to test Ixodes tick defensin activity against different strains of Borrelia. Borrelia burgdorferi is an obligate parasite that can infect humans with Lyme disease via an infected Ixodes tick. The Ixodes ricinus tick has been identified with many defensins (host defense peptides) which are released by the tick's innate immune response and have shown to possess antimicrobial activity. Borrelia may have certain plasmids and genes present on those plasmids that care crucial for protecting Borrelia from the action of these defensins. An B. The defensins used from I. ricinus ticks include DefMT2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The Borrelial strains were tested in 1 and 5 micro molar concentrations of lyophilized defensin dissolved in BSK-II media. After being incubated for 11, 15 and 16 days, Borrelia were counted via a live/dead assay using sensu stricto (GFP) were contaminated which may have resulted from the use of wells. The infectious strain of Borrelia showed the highest live percentages after being tested in Ixodes tick defensins. The non-infectious clone of Borrelia resulted in extremely low live percentages, showing that the infectious strain may have plasmids and genes present on those plamids that are protecting it from the tick's defensins. This project was funded by the grant NIHT37MD001427. 70 DOXORUBICIN DOSE DEPENDENTLY ATTENUATES CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 IN FEMALE HUMAN CORONARY VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS TRINNY TAT, M. SO, N. VIJAYAVEL, P. RAMAN, J.M. an anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic agent, is highly effective at reducing recurrence and mortality in breast cancer patients. However, this anti-cancer drug elicits dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in its pathogenesis, one of which involves the development and progression of inflammation mediated by activation of the TLR4/NFkappaB pathway. However, we recently demonstrated that chronic in vivo Dox treatment reduced expression of the NFkappaB downstream proinflammatory mediator, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in cerebral and peripheral vasculatures isolated from ovariectomized female rats. Therefore, in the current study we tested whether Dox similarly alters vascular proinflammatory enzyme expression in the human vasculature and whether this response is dose dependent. We further investigated whether Dox alters upstream mediators of COX-2 expression by assessing levels of expression and activation of NFkappaB and an additional downstream gene product, TLR4. Primary human coronary vascular smooth muscle cells of female origin were studied at passage 6 and treated with vehicle or Dox (0.3, 1.0, and 5 M). Following drug treatment, cells were isolated, homogenized, and lysates (whole cell; nuclear and cytosolic) analyzed for NFkappaBp65, COX-2, and TLR4 protein levels via immunoblotting. Our results demonstrate that while total NFkappaB levels were unaffected following Dox, enhanced translocation of NFkappaB to the nucleus was observed. However, even in the presence of Dox-induced NFkappa translocation, basal expression of its downstream mediator, COX-2, was dose dependently attenuated. Similar to COX-2, a trend for a decrease in TLR4 levels was observed. Dox had no effect on cell morphology or density, as visualized via light microscopy. In conclusion, although others have suggested the involvement of NFkappaB activation during the development and progression of Dox-induced inflammation in cardiac muscle, our studies demonstrate a possible novel action for the anticancer agent targeting important downstream mediators of inflammation in the female vasculature. Future studies will evaluate the impact of Dox on COX-2 at the transcriptional or translational level to determine the mode of molecular regulation.

OPTIMIZING THE PROPERTIES OF CELL-LADEN GELMA HYDROGELS FOR A PREVASCULARIZED BONE GRAFT TISSUE DANIOM SUNGWOO KIM, CHI-CHUN PAN, YUNZHI YANG Rapid blood perfusion is critical for post implantation survival of bioartificial tissues. Prevascularization of these bioartifical tissues with a built-in connectable vasculature holds great promise in addressing this problem. Here we aim to design and engineer a model of prevascularized bone graft using biodegradable, biocompatible materials; (PEG), and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA). PCL was used for mechanical support and structure integrity. GelMA was used to accelerate vasculature formation while PEG was used to maintain a channel for perfusion and diffusion. In order to construct a prevascularized bone graft in this project, PEG based channels were covered by high density of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) that can form prevascular networks through GelMA GelMA hydrogels were evaluated for angiogenic activity of HUVECs including degradation, mechanical stiffness, cell viability and vessel formation. We tested two groups consisting of 5% and 10% GelMA concentration. Using a built-in-house 3D hybprinter with photopolymerization capabilities, GelMA was crosslinked under visible light. The degradation and mechanical properties of GelMA were demonstrated to be tunable through concentration modifications to the hydrogels. Higher concentrated GelMA solutions formed hydrogels with higher modulus values. The degradation rate was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of GelMA. It is well known that GelMA possesses excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity. HUVECs readily adhered, elongated, proliferated, and went through the process of angiogenesis when seeded on GelMA substrates. The accomplishment of a fully developed, prevascularized bone graft is anticipated to help solve the arguably greatest obstacle, vascularization in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by improving on engraftment of the bioartificial tissue and accelerate tissue healing and remodeling. 71 ASSESSING CAPPING MATERIALS USED FOR MINE RECLAMATION USING BIOGEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS MIRA THEILMANN, JULIANNA G. LOAIZA, RAINA M. MAIER, JULIA W. NEILSON Uncapped mine tailing sites with mine waste materials from legacy mining activities are major health concerns across Arizona. Sites without management or reclamation can result in heavy metal exposure to nearby residents. Revegetation is a low cost method of containing waste to reduce exposure to mine tailings and remediating the substrate for future use. Mining operations require removal of large amounts of overburden rock in order to reach valuable ore resources. Currently, Resolution Copper Mine is experimenting with the use of such waste rock as a capping material for mine tailings prior to revegetation. The mine is comparing the success of this capping strategy to the use of Gila Conglomerate material harvested from uncontaminated areas of the mine property. The objective of this research is to use biogeochemical indicators to evaluate the development of the capping materials as substrates for sustaining plant growth during reclamation. The following biogeochemical indicators were utilized in this research in order to gauge the comparative revegetation potential of the two capping materials: pH, electrical conductivity, particle size distribution, and neutrophilic bacterial plate counts. Bacterial plate counts are included because successful plant establishment creates subsequent development of diverse microbial communities. These include plant growth promoting microbes that improve the potential for future plant species to grow and survive. In this study, a total of 50 samples are taken annually from reclamation areas of dense and sparse vegetation under both capping scenarios. These locations vary in slope, soil characteristics, and vegetation types. The types of vegetation covering the various transects will also be compared along with the specific biogeochemical indicators in order to predict the long term revegetation potential. Resolution Copper Mine intends to apply the results of this research to inform reclamation strategies for future mining operations on this property. This work was made possible by funding from the University of Arizona Center for Environmentally Sustainable Mining Academic Industry Research Cooperative funded by KGHM Carlota Copper, Rio Tinto Resolution Copper, and Asarco Mission Mine. SHEAR STRESS EFFECTS MICROCHANNEL a biomimetic microsystem that reconstitutes the important functions of the alveolar-capillary interface of the human lung, which cannot be achieved using standard in vitro mono-layered cell cultures or in vivo animal testing models. The microfluidic system features two microchannels bonded on top of each other with a thin membrane separating them. Each microchannel has a dedicated inlet and outlet to independently control its fluid flow. The microchannels are constructed using a clear, flexible, inert polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer allowing real-time video monitoring and recording. The porous polyester membrane serves as a substrate for culturing on either side epithelial (A549) and endothelial (HUVEC) cell monolayers. In order to resemble the alveolar function, with an air-liquid interface, air flow is established along the epithelium and media (liquid) flow along the endothelium. The cells under such conditions are continuously exposed to shear stress exerted by the fluid (air or liquid) flow. In this project, we investigated the effect of the flow-induced shear stress on the endothelial cells morphology and adhesion. HUVEC cells were cultured in media on the separation membrane in the top microchannel. Upon the establishment of a confluent endothelial monolayer, the HUVEC cells were exposed to varying level of shear stress in the range of 0.1-6.92 dynes/cm2 over a period of 5 hours. Using a MATLAB program, we quantified the rate of cell detachment and found that the detachment rate increased proportionally to the level of the applied wall shear stress. In addition, we observed changes in the morphology of the endothelial cells due to the varying shear stresses over time. These results demonstrate that the microfluidic lung-on-a-chip enables fine control of the in vitro micro-environment in order to reproduce in vivo conditions and, therefore, has the potential to expand the capabilities of cell culture models and provide low-cost alternatives to animal and clinical studies for drug screening and toxicology applications.

It is the second leading cancer in men, and the mortality rate is higher in Native American populations compared to other ethnicities. There are many factors that contribute to prostate cancer risk such as genetic factors, age, ethnicity, cultural diet, lifestyle, and the distance from the nearest hospital. Knowing about these disparities helps to understand the progression and treatment of prostate cancer. The relative importance of these disparities is not well understood, and this research will focus on the genetic differences of the oncomir microRNA-27 (miR-27) between ethnic groups to help elucidate the role of genetics as a risk factor for prostate cancer. Specifically, we are screening a total of 40 Native American samples to identify polymorphisms of miR-27, which may affect its processing and function, and therefore risk of prostate cancer. Genetic variation of miR-27 has not been examined previously in Native American populations. With the primers that we have designed, we will amplify the region of the gene, and perform Sanger sequencing. Finally, we will test whether observed variants affect miR-27 using bioinformatic tools. Results are pending however, we have successfully amplified other oncogenes and the miR-27 cluster. Discovery of population-specific miR-27 polymorphisms may elucidate the disparity in prostate cancer mortality within Native Americans. THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF ESSENTIAL OILS DEIONNA VIGIL, FERNANDO MONROY Some natural oils extracted from plants and herbs known as essential oils (EO) demonstrate antimicrobial properties. We tested the EO's (garlic, basil, peppermint, and tea tree) [The Lebermuth Company, IN] against Staphylococcus thailandensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cytotoxic effect of these oils on eukaryotic cells was also investigated. Bacteria were grown in LB media and adjusted to inoculate 105 CFU/well. In a 96 well plate, bacteria were incubated in dilutions of EO mix (LB media, 10% DMSO) and spot plated at three time points (1, 3, and 6 hours) to assess growth. Eukaryotic cells were incubated in a similar EO mix (DMEM media, DMSO) and cytotoxic effect was calculated using the LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) after 1 and 3 hours exposure to EO's. At a 2.5% concentration, peppermint and tea tree oil killed 100% of MRSA, S. aureus, and Burkholderia thailandensis, while tea tree also killed 100% of P. aeruginosa. Garlic oil demonstrated bacteriostatic properties against MRSA and B. thailandensis, while basil oil killed B. thailandensis, but was ineffective against the other bacteria at all time points. When EO's were tested at a 2.5% concentration on eukaryotic cells for three hours; garlic showed 40%, basil 24%, peppermint 12%, and tea tree 17% cytotoxic effect on skin cells. These results suggest that EO's are effective in slowing or killing a wide variety of bacteria and their potential as active ingredients in antimicrobial preparations warrants further examination.

PERMAFROST THAW SUCCESSION IN ARCTIC PEATLANDS LEADS TO SHIFTS IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND BIOMASS TURNOVER RATES SARAH ROSE VINING, MOIRA HOUGH, AMELIA MCCLURE, SCOTT SALESKA, VIRGINIA RICH As permafrost thaws over the next century due to a rapidly changing climate, the shifting nature and amount of bioavailable soil organic matter (SOM) are causing ecosystem-level changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. These greenhouse gases could drive a positive feedback to climate change, increasing the rate of global warming. Two key drivers of the change in SOM are (a) liberation of previously frozen old permafrost carbon (C), and (b) shifting plant communities that change the production rate of new carbon. Appreciable study has focused on the former; we focus here on the latter, at a 'natural' permafrost thaw gradient in an Arctic mire near Abisko, Sweden. As previously frozen soil destabilizes and collapses into a waterlogged habitat at this site, dominant vegetation type shifts from smaller, woodier plants in permafrost palsas moss-dominated bogs, then to taller, leafier sedges in fens. This plant community succession is associated with increased CO2 73 uptake, which could partially offset the thaw-associated C release from soils if it resulted in greater C storage. We tested the hypothesis that C stored in plant biomass increases across the thaw gradient by sampling both above and belowground biomass in palsas, bogs, and fens. Surprisingly, we found that total above and belowground biomass together do not significantly change from the intact to the fully-thawed habitats, despite previous research showing that net ecosystem productivity (NEP) appears to be higher in the fully water-logged fen. The lack of observed biomass increase despite the increase in NEP observed in other studies could be explained if the higher productivity sedges in fen sites have higher turnover, and transfer that productivity to SOM through high root exudatation and/or litter deposition. Since the shift in plant community composition is also associated with loss of plant biodiversity across the gradient, these results suggest that plant community succession alters the quantity, type, and diversity of plant litter inputs to the soil. Such changes in litter quantity and type are important drivers of decomposition rates and therefore the status of the ecosystem as a source versus sink for atmospheric carbon.

COMPARING POLLEN COLLECTION OF BUMBLEBEE NECTAR-ROBBERS AND LEGITIMATE VISITORS KAREN WANG, JUDITH BRONSTEIN Bumblebees collect two resources from plants: they consume nectar for energy, and feed pollen to the colony's young. Bumblebees access nectar either by legitimately feeding through the floral opening or by nectar-robbing through a cut in the flower's corolla. When bumblebees brush against anthers, pollen is deposited on the hairs covering their bodies. This loose pollen is groomed together into a ball that bumblebees carry on their back legs. In many bumblebee species, individuals can feed on nectar using both of these behaviors. However, the few studies of how bees choose between robbery and legitimate visitation consider these behaviors purely in the context of nectar foraging. They neglect if and how this choice impacts pollen collection behaviors. This is a major oversight since pollination is a key ecosystem service. Our study asks if pollen collection differs between individuals foraging as nectar-robbers and as legitimate visitors. Robbing may allow contact with the anthers, as legitimate visitation does. Individuals may also collect pollen from the anthers of the same flower they rob. In these cases, robbing individuals will carry the pollen of the plant species they rob. Alternatively, individuals might only obtain nectar from robbing behaviors, and must switch to legitimately visiting flowers in order to obtain pollen. Robbers that switch to visiting may collect pollen from the same source as legitimate visitors or from different sources. In the either case, individuals will carry pollen from sources except for the species they rob. During July 2016, we observed 34 Bombus mixtus individuals and immediately collected their pollen loads at our field site in Kebler Pass near Gothic, Colorado. We then made slides of the pollen carried on each individual. We will identify pollen grains on each slide. Finally, we will test our hypotheses by comparing pollen compositions carried by robbers and legitimate visitors. Our study is the first to look at the implications of nectar-foraging strategies for pollen collection in bees. If we find a relationship between bees' foraging behavior and pollen source, it could fill a significant gap in our current understanding of pollination ecology in natural ecosystems.

The lack of funding for robust early detection screening programs, a reduction in quality of life, and an increase in the number of patients that discontinue treatment contributes to poor cancer outcomes in these communities. Patient navigation aids cancer patients in traversing the healthcare system after diagnosis of cancer through advocacy, support and health education. When patient navigation is successful, cancer disparities between populations reduce. Patient navigators address barriers that keep cancer patients from accessing treatment and follow-up care. The Tohono O'odham Cancer Partnership conducted a 10-week, in-person patient navigation course to train 11 Community Health Representatives on how to provide patient navigation services in the areas of prevention, early detection, treatment, survivorship and end-of-life care. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the navigation educational program was conducted through a 38-question self-efficacy questionnaire and a 15-question knowledge test. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Overall, the outcomes demonstrate that the course was effective in increasing self-efficacy and knowledge necessary to assume the role of cancer navigator. It is expected that patient navigators with increased knowledge and confidence will result in increased early detection rates, treatment retention and an improvement in quality of life in cancer patients. The outcomes of this program suggest a need to provide more education and stronger emphasis on screening recommendations in future cancer navigation courses. UA Grant: 2U54CA143924. FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATIONS OF HYPOGLOSSAL MOTONEURONS INNERVATING MUSCLES JESSE WEALING, M. CHOLANIAN, R.F. FREGOSI The mammalian tongue contains eight muscles that collaborate to ensure that breathing, swallowing, suckling and other important behaviors are robust and reliable. Seven of these muscles are innervated by hypoglossal motoneurons (XIIMNs). Most studies of XIIMNs have considered them to be a homogenous population, however a given tongue movement requires precisely allocated contributions from all tongue muscles. Thus, XIIMNs may have unique functional properties that reflect the usage pattern of the muscle that they innervate. To better understand the functional specializations of muscle-specific XIIMNs, intrinsic (superior longitudinalis) and extrinsic (genioglossus) muscles were injected with dextran-rhodamine to illuminate the XIIMNs innervating those muscles. The labeled XIIMNs were anatomically and differentiable. Intrinsic XIIMNs were located more medial and proximal and extrinsic were more lateral and distal to the fourth ventricle. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that resting membrane potential was on average 10 millivolts more depolarized in intrinsic compared to extrinsic XIIMNs, and that the firing rate response to current injection was lower in extrinsic compared to intrinsic XIIMNs. These observations show muscle-specific functional specializations in XIIMNs, and this information lays the foundation for the development of neuron-specific therapeutic approaches for tongue-related respiratory disorders.

SHIN Studying the behavior of social insects in both interesting and time consuming. Often researchers must film these behaviors in order to analyze them at greater length and in more detail then watching them in the moment, or live. However, analyzing film is time consuming, especially when tracking individual insects in a colony. It can take up to ten hours to track and analyze a video manually when there are 80 members in the colony. Introducing the ABCTracker. The ABCTracker is software that allows the user to mark individual insects or objects over multiple screens of a video, and then the ABCTracker will track these insects of objects for the user over the entire length of the video. This makes video analysis of any kind in the study of social insects much more efficient. 75 FAST-SCAN CONTROLLED ADSORPTION VOLTAMMETRY AS A METHOD TO MEASURE ABSOLUTE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN VIVO LUKE WOHLFORD, LINDSEY CROWN, KATE PARENT, MITCHELL BARTLETT, STEPHEN COWEN, TORSTEN FALK, MICHAEL HEIEN Dopamine (DA) is an important neurotransmitter in the brain linked to a variety of functions such as decision-making, reward signaling, and motor control. Parkinson's Disease, a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people world-wide, involves the death of dopamine neurons in the deep brain leading to shaking, rigidity, and dyskinetic movement. Because of DA's broad functionality and its importance in Parkinson's disease, the ability to quantify and measure it in awake and behaving animals would be highly beneficial to research programs. Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) has been used for decades to measure relative amounts of DA in vivo, however FSCV is limited to measuring short, phasic DA release. Thus far, measurements of absolute, tonic levels of DA have been limited by using techniques with very low time resolution, unsuitable for behavioral studies of decision-making or drugs that may have quick effects on DA concentrations. Fast-Scan Controlled Adsorption Voltammetry (FSCAV) uses instrumentation similar to FSCV but allows for measurement of tonic levels of DA every 30 seconds. This method is currently being tested for reliability by measuring tonic DA levels in the rat dorsal striatum after administering drugs known to either increase or decrease tonic dopamine levels. While this project is still underway, results so far seem to support the ability of FSCAV to measure tonic DA levels. Work on this project has been sponsored by the Brain Eager Initiative and Undergraduate Biology Research Program. ADDITION OF DOXORUBICIN CAUSES DISRUPTION OF CELL CYCLE IN MUTANT P53 HUMAN MAMMARY EPITHELIAL CELLS DANA WOODS, BERNARD FUTSCHER Human mammary epithelial cells can be immortalized by overcoming two major proliferation barriers. The stasis barrier is overcome by inactivating the RB pathway by knocking down p16 via shRNA. The replicative senescence barrier is crossed by reactivating telomerase though the dysregulation of MYC. Despite being immortal, these cells do not form tumors when injected into immunocompromised mice. Our goal was to determine if overexpression of mutant p53 could malignantly transform wild-type p53 cells. Because mutations in p53 are responsible for over half of human carcinomas, we hypothesized that mutant p53 transduction would cause changes in the cells' response to stress. Mutant p53 was transduced into the cells using a viral vector. These cells were grown alongside non-transduced wild-type cells and cells that were transduced with an eGFP viral vector, both used as controls. Western blots confirmed that the mutant p53 cells had much greater expression levels of the p53 protein compared to that of the wild-type and eGFP cells. We are currently measuring how the topoisomerase II-directed drug doxorubicin affects the mutant p53 cells compared to the wild-type p53 cells. Cells were exposed to varying doses of doxorubicin for 24 hours. Cell cycle analysis revealed that doxorubicin treatment caused G2 cell cycle arrest. In the higher concentrations, greater percentages of the cells were in G2 arrest. By comparing the wild-type cells with the mutant p53 cells, we observed that overexpression of p53 intensifies the G2 arrest effect. At 100nM for example, 82.4% of the mutant p53 cells were in G2 phase compared to 57.7% for that of the wild-type cells. These findings indicate that the addition of a mutant p53 can disrupt cell cycle checkpoints and may make them more prone to malignant transformation. This data allows us to plan future experiments, such as a colony forming assay or injection of these mutant p53 cells into immunocompromised mice, to determine if mutant p53 is sufficient to malignantly transform immortalized human mammary epithelial cells.

DEAD-box proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins that serves an important role in gene expression. DEAD-box proteins regulate RNA and the proteins associated with RNA, the RNA protein complex (RNP), during gene expression, thereby ensuring proper processing of the mRNA. Dbp1, one of the DEAD-box proteins in budding yeast, is considered to be a homolog of DDX3X, a gene that is highly mutated in the brain cancer medulloblastoma as well as other cancers types. Nevertheless, the function of the gene still remains unknown, and further research is needed to determine the cellular mechanism of Dbp1, which may have application to cancer pathology. Previously, our laboratory had performed a synthetic lethal screen in yeast with a dbp1-null mutant in order to identify genes related to Dbp1 function. Six candidate hits were isolated from the initial screen. We previously identified one of these as SHM2, which is synthetic lethal with a marker gene ade3 rather than dbp1; thus this candidate is an artifact of the screen. In my research, I have been attempting to identify the genes for the other candidate hits. Through plasmid complementation, I identified another candidate as SHM2 in addition to the first hit. Further, the synthetic lethal phenotype of one other candidate was not robust, thus making it difficult to continue to study. Currently, I am attempting to identify two other candidates from the screen using plasmid library complementation. Identification and validation of these hits should help elucidate the function of Dbp1. The work is funded by the American Cancer Society and the Arizona Biochemical Research Commission. TRANSLATION DYSREGULATION IN ALS STEPHEN YAO, A. COYNE, D. ZARNESCU Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the lives of at least 30,000 people in the United States, annually. It is often categorized by the progressive neurodegeneration of motor neurons. TAR DNA Binding Protein (TDP-43) is normally found within the nucleus having known roles in RNA splicing as well as DNA-binding. Mislocalization of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm, either due to mutations or to environmental stressors leads to accumulation of TDP-43 in cytoplasmic inclusions. Notably, in the cytoplasm, TDP-43 associates with RNA stress granules and also affects mRNA translation, both of which are thought to contribute to disease pathology. In order to study the effects that cytoplasmic TDP-43 mutations have on translation, a technique called polysome fractionation is utilized. This technique uses sucrose gradients to effectively separate different ribosomal populations. The mRNAs that are bound to multiple ribosomes, or polysomes, are separated from the mRNAs bound to single ribosomes. This allows the pinpointing of specific defects in protein production as well as potential explanations to how it may affect cellular metabolism. Furthermore, this technique is able to provide information about the halting of protein production in response to stress which is a potential factor that contributes to ALS. Western blotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) allow us to observe the protein and transcript distribution within the polyribosome fractions, respectively. Using these approaches we found that TDP-43 associates with both translating polyribosomes as well and untranslated fractions (RNP and the qPCR of futsch, an mRNA target of TDP-43 showed a shift in transcript levels from actively translated to untranslated fractions in the context of TDP-43, indicating that futsch mRNA is being repressed by TDP-43 in motor neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that TDP-43 regulates the translation of specific mRNAs and defects in translation may contribute to ALS. Experiments will focus on additional candidate mRNA targets that will be tested for their distribution within polysome fractionations to determine their translational status in disease. Candidate mRNAs that are identified by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) that also associate with TDP-43 in complex will be tested. Specifically, qPCR will used to distinguish shifts in translational targets in polysomes. Targets that are downtranslated should exhibit a shift into the RNP fractions while uptranslated targets will exhibit a shift into the polysomes. This work was supported by the Jim Himelic Foundation and NIH NS078429 (D.C.Z). Support was also provided by the University of Arizona Undergraduate Biology Research Program (UBRP) and the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation. 77 PRENATAL NICOTINE EXPOSURE AND THE 5HT-7 RECEPTOR CRISTINA YOUNG, RALPH FREGOSI Prenatal nicotine exposure is a known risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). This increase in risk is thought to be the result of the nicotine exposure affecting the development of the brainstem neurons that control breathing, as well as the serotonin neurons that project to these cells. This experiment was executed to determine what affect, if any, this type of nicotine exposure would have on the serotonin (5HT) system, specifically the 5HT-7 receptor. Prenatal rat pups were exposed to nicotine with osmotic minipumps during pregnancy, with continued exposure through breast milk after birth (developmental nicotine exposure, DNE). Brainstem-spinal cord preparations from 1-5 day old pups that were either DNE or unexposed (control group) were studied in vitro. Using a split-bath configuration, drugs can be applied to either the brainstem or the spinal cord without affecting the other side of the preparation. For this experiment, drugs were applied to the brainstem side of the preparation. The frequency and amplitude of action potential bursts were measured from cervical ventral roots from C2-C4, which contains the axons of phrenic motor neurons, which, in turn, innervate the diaphragm muscle in intact animals. A baseline of ten minutes was established, followed by fifteen minutes of 5HT-7 antagonist application, followed by thirty minutes of 5HT-7 antagonist + 5HT application, followed by washout for twenty minutes. There was no significant difference between the responses of the DNE and control group. These results indicate that DNE does not influence the activity of brainstem respiratory neurons by the 5HT-7 serotonin receptor subtype. This research was funded by NIH, UBRP, and WAESO. DEVELOPMENT OF A FRET-BASED APTAMER SENSOR FOR INTRACELLULAR ATP DETECTION DILLON YUP, ISEN A. CALDERON, CRAIG A. ASPINWALL ATP is the common source of energy for nearly all life on Earth. Because of this, monitoring intracellular ATP concentrations may provide insight into diverse signaling roles of ATP. The focus of this research is the development of a FRET-based sensor for intracellular detection of ATP using ATP-responsive aptamers. Aptamers are single strands of DNA/RNA that selectively bind analytes due to the unique, sequence-specific secondary structure. Many aptamers undergo conformational changes upon analyte binding that can be exploited in sensor design. Here, ATP-responsive aptamer sequences were functionalized with two fluorescent dyes, such analyte binding leads to a conformational change allowing Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to occur. Three DNA aptamer sensors were prepared and evaluated for detection of ATP using different sequences and different donor-acceptor pairs. These sensors demonstrated a Kd of approximately 1 mM in free buffer solution, within the physiological concentration range for ATP measurements. The binding of the aptamer is specific to the adenosine and ribose groups of ATP and does not bind GTP at the same extent. The sensors were also stable under physiological conditions, though in vivo conditions have proven problematic for aptamer-based sensors, due to degradation. To protect the sensors from degradation, we will integrate aptamer sensors into phospholipid nanoshell particles previously developed by our group and evaluate the utility for intracellular measurement of ATP. This study was supported by the NIH under grant number GM 116946. RESCUE OF NEUROTOXICITY IN A TDP-43-BASED DROSOPHILA MODEL OF ALS BY A 4-AMINOQUINOLINE ANALOG BENJAMIN ALYSSA COYNE, ALLEN B. REITZ, DANIELA C. ZARNESCU Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons. TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is an RNA and DNA binding protein that has been implicated in ALS, both as a causative factor and at the level of pathology. Although TDP-43 has been shown to play a key role in RNA metabolism, its mechanism is not fully understood. Specifically, evidence has shown that TDP-43 binds TG-rich sequences within RNA targets. In the context of disease, this binding can lead to alterations in splicing and/or proper regulation of its targets, and is partially responsible for the neurotoxicity that is associated with ALS. A 4-aminoquinoline analog (i.e. AAQ-1) has been shown to inhibit the binding of TDP-43 to TG oligonucleotides. To evaluate the effect of this small molecule in vivo, we administered AAQ probes to larvae expressing wild- 78 type or mutant TDP-43 in motor neurons (D42 GAL4>TDP-43). Our experiments show that feeding of AAQ-1, but not a structurally similar negative control (AAQ-9), rescues the lethality caused by overexpression of TDP-43 in motor neurons. Additionally, AAQ-1 feeding also leads to improved locomotor function of larvae, as well as increased lifespan of flies overexpressing both wild-type and mutant TDP-43. In exploring the role of TDP-43-associated proteins in mediating the protective effect of AAQ-1 in motor neurons, we find that rescue of TDP-43-induced neurotoxicity by AAQ-1 is dependent in Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in a TDP-43 variant-dependent manner. Currently, experiments are being performed to determine the effect of AAQ-1 on the solubility of full-length TDP-43 and its cleaved C-terminal fragment within motor neurons. These results provide insight into the role of TDP-43 in RNA metabolism, as well as suggest a possible therapeutic strategy for TDP-43-based ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases.

Twenty-eight years later, even Wells would be surprised at the impact this program has had on individual students, on the University of Arizona (UA), and on science. Wells, a biochemist and long time faculty member, claimed that it was his student Teri Suzuki's question, What do you guys do around here? that led him to create UBRP. As a scientist, he was concerned that few biochemistry majors were choosing to pursue careers in science. Suzuki's question led him to believe that if students were involved in research, they would develop the passion for inquiry and problem solving that attracted him to his profession. Wells recognized the power of hands-on learning. He also believed in inclusiveness. From its inception, UBRP has embraced students from any major, any year in college, any ethnicity or nationality, and both genders. Any faculty member who can define his/her work as biologically related can participate which allowed UBRP to span campus and to include off- campus scientists as well. In 1992, the Biomedical Research Abroad: Vistas Open (BRAVO!) program was launched. BRAVO! is the international extension of UBRP. The program enables research-experienced undergraduates to travel to other countries to work on projects related to the work they do at UA. The perspective students acquire through becoming part of the international scientific community is of tremendous value to participants and advances science. UBRP was embraced by UA faculty and quickly became one of the largest undergraduate research programs in the country. In 1997 the National Science Foundation awarded the University of Arizona a Recognition Grant for the Integration of Research and Teaching (RAIRE) largely on the strength of the UBRP and BRAVO! Programs. Nationally, only ten RAIRE awards were made. In addition, Project Kaleidoscope designated UBRP and BRAVO! as exemplary programs. The campus culture values and embraces undergraduate researchers. To date, more than 2,400 students have had a UBRP experience and even more UA undergraduate students became involved in research through programs inspired by UBRP. In the pages that follow are awards, activities, and special programs sponsored by UBRP, as well as the amazing accomplishments of our current students and alumni. UBRP alumni have used the skills developed through their research experience in a variety of ways. Roughly a third are now physicians; a third are involved in research in academia, government, or the private sector; and the remainder are allied health professionals, teachers, science writers, entrepreneurs, attorneys, and policy makers. In short, for 28 years, UBRP and BRAVO! have enhanced the learning experience of hundreds of students. Our goal is to grow the program to reach even more students in the future! 82 SUMMER 2016 SMALL GROUP LEADERS UBRP students meet in small groups every other week during the summer to discuss their research with their peers. Faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and research-experienced undergraduates volunteer their time to facilitate these groups and to mentor undergraduate researchers. We feel incredibly fortunate that these individuals volunteered their time and talents to serving as small group leaders in summer 2016! We deeply appreciate their contributions to enriching UBRP students' experiences.
