A balanced and harmonious mind and body indicates that the flow of Chi in the meridians or energy pathways is good. The four major styles of Chi Kung are supported by three techniques, namely, specific body movement, breathing and mind concentration. The major benefits of Chi Kung are promotion of health, reduction of health problems and management of stress more effectively. Chi Kung can contribute to nursing and nursing education in health promotion, stress management, cardiac rehabilitation, counseling and in establishing a therapeutic relationship between patients and nurses.
