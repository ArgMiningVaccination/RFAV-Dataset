Methods A phase 2a expanded safety and immunogenicity study of a saRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate LNP-nCoVsaRNA, was conducted at participating centres in the UK between 10th August 2020 and 30th July 2021. Participants received 1 g then 10 g of LNP-nCoVsaRNA, 14 weeks apart. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for one week post-each vaccine, and unsolicited AEs throughout. Binding and neutralisating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody raised in participant sera was measured by means of an anti-Spike (S) IgG ISRCTN17072692, EudraCT 2020-001646-20). Findings 216 healthy individuals (median age 51 years) received 1.0 g followed by 10.0 g of the vaccine. 28/216 participants were either known to have previous SARS-CoV2 infection and/or were positive for anti-Spike (S) IgG atbaseline. Reactogenicity was as expected based on the reactions following licensed COVID-19 vaccines, and there were no serious AEs related to vaccination. 80% of baseline SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals (147/183) seroconverted two weeks post second immunization, irrespective of age (18 -75); 56% (102/183) had detectable neutralising antibodies. Almost all (28/31) SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals had increased S IgG binding antibodies following their rst 1.0 g dose with a 0.5log10 increase in 71% (22/31). Interpretation Encapsulated saRNA was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults aged 18 -75 years. Seroconversion rates in antigen na\u00efve were higher than those reported in our dose-ranging study. Further work is required todetermine if this difference is related to a longer dosing interval (14 vs. 4 weeks) or dosing with 1.0 g followed by 10.0 g. Boosting of S IgG antibodies was observed with a single 1.0 g injection in those with pre-existing immune responses.

This is an open access article under the CC BY is a novel technology for vaccine develop-ment with the potential to be immunogenic at low dose levels. 1The platform employs a synthetic RNA molecule which includes the antigen of interest, in this case thestabilised Spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2, in combination with the amplicon derived from an alphavirus, Venezuela n equine encephalitis virus. 2 We reported data from the dose-ranging cohort component of COVAC1 (ISRCTN17072692, EudraCT 2020-001646-20) in encapsulated saRNA vaccine.3The saRNA vaccine administered in two intramuscular doses 4 weeks apart was well-tolerated but failed to induce seroconversion in 100% of participants.3 To respond to the need for COVID-19 vaccine development and prepare for transition to ef cacy testing, Phase 2a of COVAC1 was initiated in parallelwith the dose nding study. The Phase 2a trial enrolled a larger population to obtain a more precise estimate of safety and immunogenicity following administration ofthe highest dose levels studied in the dose-rangingcohort. This expanded safety cohort included in- dividuals with a wider age range, stable co-morbidities, and a sub-set with a prior history of laboratoryconrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was uncertainty about the optimum dose level of encapsulated saRNA required for IM injectionat the start of COVAC1 as the technology was novel in humans and there were no clinical data to guide dose level selection. Pre-clinical data from small animalmodels supported the likelihood that the ideal dose would lie between 0.1 and 1 g, but 1 g proved insuf cient to induce 100% seroconversion in the dose escalation phase. 3COVAC1 was therefore adapted to evaluate dose levels up to 10 g. The expanded safety cohort received an initial prime with a 1 gd o s eb u t were invited to delay their second vaccine to receive the highest tolerated dose (10 g ) .H e r ew er e p o r tt h e results from the expanded safety cohort who received1g following by 10 g of the candidate saRNA COVID-19 vaccine, LNP-nCoVsaRNA, approximately 14 weeks apart. Methods Study design and participants We report the results of the open label expanded safetycomponent of the protocol (see protocol version 8.0, Appendix 1 ). Healthy participants aged 18 -75 years were recruited through local advertisements. Partici- pants with no history of COVID-19 were eligible to take part, but participant sera were not prospectivelyscreened for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, except forthe St Mary 's Hospital site (which preferentially enrolled participants prospectively known to have infection- induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to enrolment).All participants underwent a screening visit where a full medical history and examination was performed in addition to blood and urine tests. Participant sera werescreened for the presence of blood borne viruses using a fourth generation HIV test and for IgG against Hepatitis C. Those with reactive responses in either of these testsResearch in context Evidence before this study We previously reported the rst published phase I dose ranging study of an LNP encapsulated saRNA vaccine (LNP-nCoVsaRNA). Using the search terms \"self-amplifying RNA \" AND \"clinical trial \", no additional clinical studies have been published between October 9 2021 and 1 June 2022. Added value of this study The SARS-CoV-2 saRNA vaccine (LNP-nCoVsaRNA) given at1g and 10 g doses 14 weeks apart was well tolerated in adults aged 18 -75 years, with fewer adverse reactions with increasing age. Seroconversion rates by ELISA in SARS-CoV-2na\u00efve individuals; 80% (147/183), were higher than those previously reported following two 1 g 43% (18/42), or 10 g61% (14/23) doses given 4 weeks apart, and binding titres were 5- and 2.5- fold higher respectively. Anti-S IgG responses in 90% (28/31) of participants who were seropositive forSARS-CoV-2 at baseline were boosted following a single vaccination with 1 g of LNP-nCoVsaRNA. Implications of all the available evidence Seroconversion rates were signi cantly higher than those we previously reported. Further work will determine if this isrelated to a longer interval (14 vs. 4 weeks) or dosing with 1g followed by 10 g. The response to a single 1 g dose in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals offers promise thatsaRNA may provide a low dose and low-cost booster vaccine for long-term management of COVID-19.Articles 2 www.thelancet.com Vol 56 February, 2023were ineligible for the study. Full details of the eligibility criteria are described in Appendix 2 . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Participants were offered reimburse-ment for their time, inconvenience, and travel expenses of \u00a350 per visit paid as a lump sum at the end of participation. This study was approved in the UK by theMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyand the North East -York Research Ethics Committee (reference the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 stabilised in the pre- fusion conformation with two proline substitutions. 2 Conduct of the trial The expanded safety cohort component of COVAC1evaluated LNP-nCoVsaRNA as two intramuscular (IM)injections into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. The rst injection was of 1.0 g; the second, given 14 weeks later, was 10.0 g (one participant chose to and received two injections of 1.0 g, four weeks apart). The vaccine was formulated as a suspension for injection in multi-dose vials stored at 70 C. On the day of injection, it was thawed and diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to give a nal volume of 0.5 mL for injection. Stability of both frozen and diluted productwas supported by an extensive stability database asrequired by the regulators. Participants were observed for up to 1 h following each injection. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were self-reported by participants in electronic diary records captured the evening after injection and for six further evenings. Study staff checked the diary record approximately 48 hpost-injection and at the day seven visit. All these events were considered related to vaccination. AEs, including any following receipt of an authorised/licensed COVID-19 vaccine as part of NHS roll-out in England, were captured by study staff at every visit. Causality was determined by the site investigators. Blood samples(haemoglobin, white cell count, platelets, lymphocytes,neutrophils, rubin, serum creatinine and non-fasting glucose) were collected at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after the rst vaccine; on the day of the second vaccine (pre-vaccination); 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the second vaccine; and at 52 weeks. Grade was determined according to the FDA toxicitytable for healthy volunteers, adapted to site laboratory normal reference ranges (see Appendix 2 ).Immunological assessments Binding antibody concentrations were assessed using a sensitive anti-S IgG ELISA as previously described.3For individuals who tested positive for anti-S IgG antibodies at baseline, subsequent visits were tested for binding anti- body using an in-house conventional ELISA platform toavoid the need for large dilutions. In brief, 96-well high- binding plates (Greiner, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria) were coated with anti-human kappa and lambda lightchain speci c mouse antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) at 1:1 ratio diluted 1:500 in PBS or an- tigen (1 g/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 1 h at 37 C. The rest of the protocol is as described in4. Irrespective of the ELISA platform used, the rst WHO international standard anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin was added at a concentration of 2 BAU/mL, equivalent ofapproximately 20,000 ng/mL, as a control. SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation were conducted using pseudotyped (PSV) viruses as described. 3Therst WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin included as a positive control, determined to have an IC50 neutralisation titre of approximately 1:3000. Outcomes The safety outcome measures were solicited local in-jection site and systemic reactions that started within seven days of administration of the vaccine, and any of the following that occurred throughout the study period:unsolicited adverse reactions (ARs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and unsolicited AEs. Immunogenicity was assessed by the titre of neutralising antibodies atbaseline, two and four weeks after the second injection, and the titre of IgG raised against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein two weeks after the rst injection, on the day of the second injection (pre-injection) and twoand four weeks after the second injection. Statistical analysis Sample size was based on achieving adequate statisticalpower to detect an adverse reaction with a true frequencyof between 1/100 and 1/50 or higher. To assess the safety of the vaccine candidate in people with pre-existing im- munity to SARS-CoV-2, a group was enrolled that hadknown anti-S IgG-in serum. 31 participants were pro- spectively known to have infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to enrolment, or anti-Spike IgG detect-able retrospectively at baseline prior to vaccination. Datafrom these participants are included in safety analyses but have undergone separate immune analysis. For participants who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection (labo-ratory-con rmed) during follow-up or who received an authorised/licensed COVID-19 vaccine, subsequent immunogenicity data are excluded. Further exclusionsfrom the immunogenicity analyses include the partici- pant that received two injections of 1.0 g, and the week 2Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 56 February, 2023 3and week 4 post-second vaccine samples for the ve participants who only received their rst injection. Binding and neutralisation antibody titres were analysedon a logarithmic scale and back transformed for pre- sentation. All analyses were carried out using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Results Recruitment a nd compliance A total of 222 participants were enrolled between 10 August and 20 August 2020 ( Fig. 1 ). Approximately half were male (114/222; 51%) with median age 51 years(Table 1 ). Twelve participants were known to have had laboratory-con rmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infectionprior to enrolment (all had detectable anti-Spike IgG at baseline); in an additional 19 participants, anti-Spike IgG was detected retrospectively at baseline prior tovaccination (indicative of an asymptomatic infection). 216 (97%) participants received 1.0 g followed by 10.0 g (median 14.1 weeks apart (inter-quartile range (IQR) 14.0, 14.7); range 13.0 -21.9); one 1.0g followed by 1.0 g (4.0 weeks apart); and ve participants received only a single injection (1.0 g). Only one participant was out of the window period forthe second injection. By the end of follow-up (52 weeks), 219/222 (99%) were known to have received an author- ised/licensed (median 5 ). Overall, 92% (2451/2663) of visits were carried out in the protocol window,including 91% (202/222) of vaccine 2 + 2 weeks and 90% (199/222) of vaccine 2 + 4 weeks visits (or, for partici- pants who did not receive vaccine 2, the correspondingvisits). Reactogenicity Considering the rst vaccine (1.0 g), the proportion of participants reporting a local reaction was 53% Fig. 1: Consort diagram demonstrating the eligibility assessment, enrolment, group allocation and follow-up of the n = 222 participants in the phase 2a expanded safety and immunogenicity study.Articles 4 www.thelancet.com Vol 56 2023(117/222). Common and Table 3 ). No participant re- ported a grade 3 (severe) local reaction. The proportion of participants reporting a systemic reaction was 58%(128/222). Common reactions were fatigue (65/222; 29%) and headache (65; 29%). Seven days after vacci- nation, laboratory safety parameters remained largelywithin normal limits ( Appendix 2 Table 6.5 ). Following the second vaccination, the proportion of participants receiving 10.0 g reporting a local reaction (202/216; 94%) was much higher than when receiving 1g. Common reactions reported were tenderness/ and Table 3 ). Two participants reported a grade 3 local reaction (tenderness/discomfort, or pain). The proportion of participants reportinga systemic reaction was 88% (191/216). Common re- 13%). 24 participants (11%) reported a grade 3systemic reaction. Seven days after vaccination, laboratory safety parameters remained largely within normal limits except for neutrophils: 11% (23/213) had neutropaeniathat was not 1.0-1.9 \u00d7 10 9/L) (Appendix 2 Table 6.6 ). The frequency of adverse reactions was age-dependent for certain outcomes, becoming less frequent at older ages (Table 2 and Table 3 and Appendix 2, Tables 6.7 -10). The effect was evident, after both rst and second vaccinations, for pain, tenderness, and fatigue. An asso-ciation after the second vaccination was also observed for headache, myalgia and chills/shivering. Local and systemic reactions were generally similar in those with and without a history of COVID-19 ( Appendix 2, Table 6.11 ). Nausea appeared more frequent after the second injection in those with a history of COVID-19(57.1% vs. 22.9%) ( Appendix 2, Table 6.14 ). Other adverse events There were no SAEs considered related to the study intervention. Amongst the 201 (91%) participants reporting 956 AEs, 89 had a moderately severe event(including one SAE (foot bunion requiring surgery)), and12 had a severe or worse event ( Appendix 2, Table 6.15 ). Four of the 12 SAEs that required sion (myocardial ischaemia, tibia were COVID-19/bacterial pneumonia, syncope, urinary tract infection, tonsillitis (participant separately experiencedgrade 4 back pain for which they attended the Accident & Emergency department, subsequently), varicocele repair, headache; and two participants with grade 2 neutropaeniaat enrolment prior to vaccine had grade 3 neutropenia 105 days after the rst and 56 days after the second vaccine. Immunogenicity Binding antibody Binding antibody to anti-S IgG, as measured by ELISA, is reported for samples obtained at 2 weeks post- rst vaccine, day of second vaccine (pre-injection), and2 weeks and 4 weeks post-second vaccine ( Tables 4 and 5 ). In addition to the expanded safety cohort (1.0g followed by 10.0 g group), the 1.0 g group and 10.0 g group from the dose-ranging cohort 3are included for comparison. It is important to note the comparison between dose levels is confounded with thedosing schedule; the gap between rst and second vaccination was much shorter for the 1.0 g and 10.0 g dose-ranging groups (median 4 weeks) than for the expanded safety group (median 14.1 weeks). Seroconversion to anti-S IgG by ELISA following second vaccination was higher in the expanded safety cohort (receiving 1.0 gt h e n1 0 . 0 g) than either the 1.0g group (receiving 1.0 gt h e n1 . 0 g) or the 10.0 g group (receiving 10.0 g then 10.0 g) fromTotal N = 222 Sex Male 114 (51.4%)Female 108 (48.6%) Age at last birthday (years) Median (IQR) 51 (31, 62) Range 20 -73 EthnicityWhite 198 (89.2%) Mixed 5 (2.3%) Asian or Asian British 8 (3.6%) Black or Black British 3 (1.4%) Other 6 (3.6%)BMI Mean (SD) 25.3 (4.03) Median (IQR) 24.7 (22.2, 27.5) Range 18.3 -40.4 History of SARS-CoV-2 infection a No 191 (86.0%) Yes 31 (14.0%) Centre Chelsea and Westminster 29 (13.1%) St Georges 37 (16.7%)St Marys 37 to enrolment; or anti-Spike IgG detectable retrospectively at baseline prior to vaccination.

At post-second (147/183), 43% (18/42), and 61% (14/23) within the respective groups, with a similar pattern observed at 4 weeks post-second vaccine ( Tables 4 and 5 ). Among those that seroconverted, anti-S IgG titre was approximately higher in the expanded safety cohort(GM = 1224 ng/mL) compared to the 1.0 mg dose-ranging group (GM = 251 ng/mL), and 2.5-fold higher compared to the 10.0 mg dose-ranging group (GM = 500 ng/mL). Although the age range was widerfor the expanded cohort (18 -75 years) than for the dose-ranging groups, these differences persisted in additional analyses which adjusted for age ( Appendix 2, Table 7 ). Anti-S IgG titre amongst responders in the expanded safety cohort was 2-fold higher compared with values derived from convalescent sera(GM = 650 ng/mL) ( Fig. 2 A). Neutralising Neutralising antibody, as determined by pseudovirus assay against Wildtype, is reported for samples obtained2 weeks and 4 weeks post-second vaccine ( Tables 4 and 5). Similarly, with the binding antibody results, the 1.0g group and 10.0 g group from the dose-ranging cohort are included for comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in neutralising response in the expanded safety cohort when compared to the 10.0 g dose-ranging group either at 2 25%])). The NT 50geometric mean was similar between these groups at 2 weeks post-second vaccine (NT 5070 vs. 68) and higher in the 10.0 g group than in the expanded safety cohort at 4 weeks post-second vaccine(NT 50124 versus 75) but this difference was not statis- tically signi cant (p = 0.30). Where seroconversion occurred NT 50values following the booster dose were broadly consistent with values derived from baselineconvalescent sera ( Fig. 2 B).

Among the participants with a response to both assays, only a modest correlation was observedbetween these two variables (r = 0.20). Similar ndings were observed at four weeks after the second vaccination (data not shown). Binding and neutralising antibody responses were also analysed according to age group (18 -39, 40 -59 and 60 -75). In contrast to the associations observed with reactogenicity, no signi cant differences were found in seroconversion rates nor the geometric means (anti-S IgG titre or NT 50for Fig. 4 Aa n dB ) . Immune response in baseline seropositive participants As described above, 31 participants had detectable anti- spike IgG at baseline. Note that three participants didnot receive their second vaccine and one participant hadno immunology results after the second vaccination. In terms of binding antibody response, almost all partici- pants showed an increase in serum concentration(28/31), with 71% (22/31) rising by 0.5 log 10or more following their rst vaccination with 1 g of saRNA (Fig. 5 A).

Tolerability wasdose related however, as the frequency and severity of adverse reactions was dose-dependent, as seen in the dose-ranging cohort, with more than 1 in 10 participantsexperiencing a severe reaction following the 10 g dose. The frequency of adverse reactions was age-dependent with lower frequencies in older age groups for pain,tenderness, and fatigue after the rst and second vac- cines, and for headache, myalgia and chills/shivering after the second vaccine.Participants in the expanded safety cohort were more likely to seroconvert than those in the 1 go r1 0 g groups in the dose-ranging cohort. The magnitude ofresponse was also signi cantly higher in the expanded safety cohort than the dose-ranging cohort, and 2-fold higher compared to convalescent sera. This nding is interesting, given that the total dose received by the safety cohort (1 g then 10 g) was 55% of the total dose given in the 10 g group (10 g then 10 g). This could be explained by the longer interval (a median of14 weeks compared to 4 weeks) between doses, a more efcient priming by the lower dose (1 g vs. 10 g), or Fig. 2: A.Anti-Spike (S) IgG (ng/mL) responses rais ed in sera from participants receiving two doses of LNP-saRNA in the dose-ranging cohort (1 g, 1gi ng r e e na n d1 0 g, 10 g in orange) and the expanded safety cohort (1 g, 10 g in pink).

Indeed, a longer dosing interval has been asso- ciated ef cacy of an adenoviral vectored vaccine.5 However, neutralising antibody response was not improved, with just over half the participants producing a response and at similar magnitudes to the dose-ranging participants who received two doses of 10 g. In contrast to the age-dependent reactogenicity, age was not predictive of seroconversion or induction of neu-tralising antibodies. In the 31 participants with prior COVID-19, the baseline binding antibody response was boosted in the majority of these participants after receiving only 1 g. This was by a similar amount ( 0.5 log 10) to that observed following a third booster in the COV-Boost trial which evaluated seven different COVID-19 vac-cines given as a third dose in those who had received two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 as their primary schedule. 6Although there were some differences in reactogenicity reporting, there was no unexpected reac- togenicity in the SARS-CoV2 seropositive group. Given that a long-term cost-effective vaccination strategy isneeded to secure public health against the evolvingCOVID-19 pandemic in coming years, a low dose booster vaccine is of strategic interest. 1The potential to deliver an effective and well-tolerated boost with a single1g dose of a next generation saRNA vaccine could provide advantages in relation to acceptability and cost effectiveness. The local, systemic and laboratory reactions observed were similar in nature to the dose-ranging cohort and authorised vaccines. Of note, the proportion with neu-tropaenia was higher than expected due to natural variation, and this phenomenon has been observed withauthorised COVID-19 vaccines 7and widely described in the typical response to vaccines against other unrelated infections.8Following reports of a possible association between mRNA vaccines with myocarditis and/or peri- carditis, particular attention was paid to cardiac events, but the only signi cant adverse event (exacerbation of myocardial ischaemia 30 weeks after the second vaccine) was in line with the participant 's age and past medical history so not considered related to vaccine. More than 1in 10 participants in the expanded safety cohort experi-enced a severe reaction following 10 g but reactions to the 1.0 g dose were largely mild, indicating a dose- related relationship with tolerability. The effect of ageon tolerability, has also been reported following both authorised mRNA vaccines, 9,10and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine.11Those at lowest risk of a life-threatening illness were most likely to experience a severe reaction which may deter individuals from completing the regimen at a population level. There wasno association between age and immune responses which were similar in all age groups. For this reason, evaluation of a second-generation vaccine (LNP-nCoVsaRNA-02) is proceeding with a maximum dose and COVAC Uganda ClinicalTrials.gov Identi er: NCT04934111). The delay between the rst and second vaccine may be the explanation for the higher rate of seroconversion in the expanded safety cohort as a longer gap facilitates the evolution of an anamnestic response and could alsoaffect the adjuvant properties of the vaccine, but the lower rst dose may also play an important role. It should also be noted that the dose level groups in dose-ranging cohort were small with a wide range of re- sponses. Greater clinical protection against disease was observed in participants in the ChAdOx trial whoreceived a low dose followed by the standard dose 8 -12 weeks apart. 5However, this was not part of the rando- mised evaluation and the subset that received the low/ standard dose regimen was younger compared to theoverall trial population. Analyses of national vaccine programme data con rm the immune bene t and clinical protection of the longer gap between the P zer- BioNtech mRNA vaccines, 12,13supporting the decision to delay the second dose so that a rst dose could be administered to a larger proportion of the population.This decision was taken in the context of authorisedvaccines that provided substantial clinical bene t following a rst dose 12,13and may not apply to future pandemic vaccines. Pharmaceutical companies arerightly cautious about mixed dose regimens due to the operational challenges, likely increased costs, and room for error in implementation, but a randomised evalua-tion of a low dose followed by a high dose and a variety of schedules would be of scienti c value in future ef - cacy trials to determine the minimum dose and optimalschedule required. We observed a predominant response to the boosting dose, this contrasts to a recent Fig. 3: Association between Pseudoneutralising antibodies (IC50) and anti-Spike (S) IgG.

Binding antibody responses against S correlate with vaccine ef cacy against symptomatic COVID-19. 15The magnitude of the responses observed with this rst-generation formula- tion using a fractional priming dose and prolonged prime-boost schedule independent of age suggest thatthis technology could be further developed to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Given thatindividuals with pre-existing baseline responses received a boost equivalent to authorised COVID-19 vaccines after only one dose of 1 g, a next-generation saRNA vaccine, with competitive immunogenicity andupdated to account for newer variants, could be placed to deliver boosting for an antigen-experienced global population in the future.
