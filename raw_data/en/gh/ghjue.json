Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-27-01716)]. Moreover, their wide spectrum of biological activities ensures their use in both traditional and conventional medicine. It is worth mentioning their antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, which are some of the most intensively studied biological activities. It is known that monoterpenes with conjugated double bonds in their structure reveal high or satisfactory activity [ [2](#B2-molecules-27-01716)]. Additionally, antifungal (i.e., thymol), antiviral (i.e., geraniol), antibacterial (i.e., myrtenal) and (i.e., pinene) activities were also observed [ [3](#B3-molecules-27-01716)]. [4](#B4-molecules-27-01716)]. The compounds can be found in various species of plant but the most popular is the Lamiaceae family. Among these plants are species and herbs containing a high level of monoterpenes. Among them are Melissa L., Mentha L., Ocimum L., and Origanum L., which are commonly used in everyday life [ [5](#B5-molecules-27-01716), [6](#B6-molecules-27-01716)]. Based on their structure, they can be classified into alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, resins, polypeptides, coumarins and glucosinolates. Despite comprehensive analysis of the safety of the substances for both in vitro and in vivo conditions, the issue has not been fully established. On-going research provides the latest information about various substances that were once considered safe, which now turn out to be dangerous to the body. [7](#B7-molecules-27-01716)]. However, long-lasting studies have demonstrated the harmful activity of some of these. 2. Monoterpenes: A Group of Isoprene Derivatives [7](#B7-molecules-27-01716), [8](#B8-molecules-27-01716)]. Their biosynthesis is usually explained by dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer, mevalonate and the 2-C-methyl--erythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP) [ is shown in [Figure 1](#molecules-27-01716-f001). [10](#B10-molecules-27-01716), [11](#B11-molecules-27-01716), [12](#B12-molecules-27-01716)]. Besides the pharmaceutical industry, monoterpenes and their derivatives find employment in the food, beverage and perfume industries. Examples include limonene, eucalyptol or linalool, which are used to generate the aroma of lemon, or 3-carene and terpinolene, which are associated with the scent of mango fruit [ [13](#B13-molecules-27-01716), [14](#B14-molecules-27-01716)]. Although most are safe for human food and medical applications, there are monoterpene compounds that, in certain amounts or under particular circumstances (e.g., pregnancy), can cause serious disorders. 3. Toxicity of Selected Monoterpenes 3.1. -Terpinene [Figure 2](#molecules-27-01716-f002)), displays some rather interesting characteristics. This monoterpene can be found in numerous aromatic plants, among others, Chenopodium ambrosidies and Melaleuca alternifolia [ [15](#B15-molecules-27-01716), [16](#B16-molecules-27-01716)]. Research has indicated that -terpinene demonstrates various biological and pro-health activities, such as those leading to improved neurotransmission through antioxidant or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Nevertheless, more and more studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have uncovered its toxic character [ [2](#B2-molecules-27-01716), [17](#B17-molecules-27-01716)]. Some of the first such studies were conducted by Araujo et al. and presented the embryo foetotoxic impact of the terpene in pregnant rats [ [18](#B18-molecules-27-01716)]. The studies, based on gavage administration of the monoterpene to female rats from day 6 to 15 of pregnancy, (30, 60, 125 and 250 mg/kg body weight) revealed the maternally toxic effect of 125 and 250 mg/kg body weight of -terpinene leading to a reduction of body weight. The highest dose of the monoterpene caused a reduction of the ratio of pregnant/treated females, a decrease in foetal body weight and an increase in foetal kidney weights. Other important studies were performed by Baldissera et al. who focused on the neurotoxic effect of -terpinene [ [19](#B19-molecules-27-01716)]. The in vivo studies, based on daily oral administration of 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mL kg1 for 10 days, were conducted towards assessing the neurotoxic effects and activity of Na+, K+ATPase and ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase). The detailed analysis did not reveal depressive, anxiety or locomotor abnormalities, nevertheless, memory impairment was observed (for all dosages). The researchers noted probable neuronal DNA damage, as well as inactivation of enzymes responsible for neuronal plasticity and hydrolysis of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). There is no precise mechanism, however, that has been discerned in explaining the neurotoxic character of the monoterpene. One possible way is decreased production of Na+, K+ATPase, which is often linked with plant product cytotoxicity [ [20](#B20-molecules-27-01716)] and is known to lead to memory and learning dysfunction [ [21](#B21-molecules-27-01716)]. [22](#B22-molecules-27-01716)]. The studies were based on a rat model which was treated with -terpinene (doses: 0.5; 0.75 and 1.0 mL/kg) (i.p) for 10 days. Liver samples were collected and assessed by histopathological analysis, caspases -1, 3, 8 assay, biomarkers glutathione peroxidase (GPx)). Significant changes in the organism were observed in all dosages. Study results revealed that each of the doses caused an increase in ROS levels and a decrease in glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels whereas 1.0 mL/kg caused an increase in thiobarbituric acids (TBARS) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. One of the important changes observed during such studies was an increase in MDA levels resulting from excessive ROS generation. This effect leads to lipid peroxidation that is harmful to the entire organism, but especially to brain function. Confirmation of excessive generation of ROS and oxidative stress development is indicated in such work through decreased (GST) activity. The enhanced activity of the enzyme, responsible for antioxidant protection, detoxification and lipid peroxidation regulation, explicitly demonstrates excessive levels of free radicals in the organism. Experiments involving rats treated with 1.0 mL kg1 have also revealed increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase production. All of the studied parameters indicate that -terpinene is able to induce oxidative stress, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in liver tissues 3.2. Camphor [Figure 2](#molecules-27-01716-f002)) is a bicyclic monoterpene widely used in industry. It was first derived from Cinnamomum camphora by distillation but currently is produced synthetically from turpentine. Camphor can be found in numerous been administered as a contraceptive, analeptic, cardiac, central nervous system stimulant and cold remedy, and applied as an insect repellent [ [25](#B25-molecules-27-01716)]. [24](#B24-molecules-27-01716)]. [26](#B26-molecules-27-01716)]. [26](#B26-molecules-27-01716)]. A particular example indicative of the toxic properties of camphor is the case history of a 25-year-old Guatemalan woman who ingested a cube of the monoterpene prescribed for a facial rash. The woman used camphor resin tablets (0.25-unce) containing 99% of pure monoterpene. The solution, obtained by dissolving the tablet in 1 l of water, was drunk over 6 days. The side effects were observed within a few minutes. The oral ingestion caused headache with vertigo and disorientation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, but was without eye-rolling, tongue biting and bowel incontinence [ [24](#B24-molecules-27-01716)]. Besides the prior-presented cases, there are a few case histories of other toxicosis engendered by chronic exposure to camphor. Among these, death [ [27](#B27-molecules-27-01716)] and granulomatous hepatitis [ [25](#B25-molecules-27-01716)] were recorded. The most negative influence of camphor-based treatment was observed in a child who received camphor daily, beginning at the age of 1 month as part of a remedy for fretfulness and cold. The following remedy was prepared: a 1-oz block of camphor and 8 oz of whiskey were diluted with water to a final volume of 16 oz. The total dosage of camphor given was 24.5 g or 3 g/kg thus, more than six times the amount (0.05-0.5 g/kg) known to be lethal following acute ingestion. Over a 5 months period, the infant had been given approx. 28 oz of the solution, including 4 oz during the 3 days before hospitalisation. The treatment led to the death of the infant. The death, due to camphor poisoning, is more likely the result of extensive degenerative and necrotic changes in the central nervous system limited primarily to neurons [ [27](#B27-molecules-27-01716)]. [24](#B24-molecules-27-01716)]. Camphor is initially metabolised via the cytochrome P450, it is oxidised by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver and conjugated with acid to become water-soluble for urinary excretion [ [28](#B28-molecules-27-01716)]. Considering the neurotoxic properties the monoterpene, available studies indicate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors inhibition, of two isomers: neral and geranial, which to date, has been recognised as GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe). Due to its intensive fragrance, the volatile is commonly employed in food, cosmetics or household products. The compound has revealed a variety of biological activities (spasmolytic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, diuretic), and it is often used in traditional medicine, especially in subtropical regions [ [30](#B30-molecules-27-01716)]. Indeed, the monoterpene can be found as the main constituent of Cymbopogon citratus [ [31](#B31-molecules-27-01716)]. [32](#B32-molecules-27-01716)]. Moreover, studies performed by Duerksen-Hughes et al. have uncovered the genotoxic property of citral based on the increase in cellular p53 protein that results in DNA damage [ [33](#B33-molecules-27-01716)]. [34](#B34-molecules-27-01716)]. Here, different results were achieved depending on the test performed. In the case of trypan blue cell viability testing, citral showed no influence upon a decrease in leukocyte cell viability. In contrast, in the case of the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, the monoterpene demonstrated cytotoxicity at the concentration of 5 g/mL and above. Studies based on comet assay also indicated the significant genotoxic impact on HepG2 and leukocyte cells. [35](#B35-molecules-27-01716)]. Pro-DNA damage activity of citral was also noted in the case of murine peritoneal macrophages [ [36](#B36-molecules-27-01716)]. Here, the negative influence was observed at the highest concentration (100 g/mL) and the lesions disappeared 4 h later. [37](#B37-molecules-27-01716)]. In accordance with the Screening Information Dataset (SIDS) Initial Assessment Report for the 13th SIAM (2001), underlining the high volatility of citral which causes rapid loss from the skin but the remaining amount of the terpene is well absorbed. Scientists underlined the low acute toxicity of the compound in rodents in comparison to humans. Available data of citral toxicity were summarised by Api et al. in \"RIFM fragrance ingredient safety assessment, citral, CAS Registry Number 5392-40-5\" [ [38](#B38-molecules-27-01716)]. Based on various study results, scientists present citral as a substance without concern for genotoxic potential whereas the total systematic exposure to citral (7.2 \u00b5g/kg/day) is below the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) (30 \u00b5g/kg/day) for the repeated dose toxicity endpoint of a Cramer Class I material at the current level of use [ [39](#B39-molecules-27-01716)]. 3.4. Limonene [Figure 2](#molecules-27-01716-f002)) is a monocyclic monoterpene that is the main component of various citrus oils (orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit) [ [37](#B37-molecules-27-01716)]. Limonene is characterised by low polarity. This limits its cell membrane passage and causes less activity in in vivo conditions [ [40](#B40-molecules-27-01716)]. In mammals, limonene, after absorption, is rapidly distributed within various tissues and metabolised into other active compounds. Among these, the most important are peryllic acid, dihydroperyllic acid and limonene-1,2-diol (the main metabolites), but 1,2- and 8,9-epoxide, carveol and perilyl alcohol were also found in some animal species [ [40](#B40-molecules-27-01716), [41](#B41-molecules-27-01716)]. Half-time of limonene ranges from 12 to 24 h and it can be excreted (83%) in the urine within 48 h [ [39](#B39-molecules-27-01716)]. [42](#B42-molecules-27-01716)]. [41](#B41-molecules-27-01716)]. Herein, intensive research in the 1990s demonstrated the development of kidney cancer in male rats after exposure to limonene. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of limonene's mechanism of action revealed that the toxicity is not relevant to humans [ [43](#B43-molecules-27-01716)]. Other studies have indicated that limonene administration affects uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase and total cytochrome P450 enzymes [ [44](#B44-molecules-27-01716)]. Additionally, limonene above concentrations of 100 M was shown to be highly toxic to human lung cells [ [41](#B41-molecules-27-01716)]. [42](#B42-molecules-27-01716)]. Moreover, in rabbit models, studies have revealed that high doses of limonene can reduce weight gain in dams, and in some such amounts, lead to death [ [42](#B42-molecules-27-01716)]. [42](#B42-molecules-27-01716)]. ketone that can be found in the essential oils of various plants, especially mint species (i.e., Hedeoma pulegoides, pennyroyal and Nepeta cataria) [ [46](#B46-molecules-27-01716)]. Similar to other monoterpenes, pulegone displays a variety of biological activities confirmed in in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies. Among the most important are the following: antioxidant (in vitro spectrophotometric studies revealed that pulegone is able to scavenge over 90% of free radicals at a concentration equal to 0.8 M within 5 min) [ [2](#B2-molecules-27-01716)]; anti-inflammatory (inhibition of lens protein-induced inflammation by 58% when 50 \u00b5L of 0.5% pulegone was instilled into the cul de sac of rabbit eyes) [ [47](#B47-molecules-27-01716)]; and antihyperalgesic effects (in vivo studies confirmed pulegone a transient antihyperalgesic effect on both mechanical, thermal heat and cold at a dosage of 100 mg/kg) [ [48](#B48-molecules-27-01716)]. Despite many cases of human poisoning, the compounds are often used in herbal medicine and in the cosmetics and food industries [ [49](#B49-molecules-27-01716)]. [50](#B50-molecules-27-01716)]. Oral consumption of the compound leads to its metabolisation into 14 metabolites, among which, menthofuran and 8-pulegone aldehyde are more toxic than pulegone. Within is characterised as a major reactive electrophilic metabolite. It is also highly probable that the compounds can create covalent bonds with cellular proteins in the liver\u2014leading to its injury [ [51](#B51-molecules-27-01716)]. Moreover, the metabolites of pulegone have revealed differing toxicity levels [ [Figure metabolite is This is generated from both pulegone and menthofuran. [54](#B54-molecules-27-01716)]. Although the majority of the scientific reports on pulegone toxicity relate to rodent models, valuable results were obtained for research based on the human livers of five patients. Detailed analysis therein indicated pulegone as being more hepatotoxic than menthofuran. In contrast, the mice and rat models have revealed the higher toxicity of menthofuran. Additionally, pulegone was found to be able to change the expression of certain miRNAs in liver samples [ [55](#B55-molecules-27-01716)]. [56](#B56-molecules-27-01716)]. In cosmetic formulations, the concentration of pulegone should not exceed 1%. In the USA, the monoterpene is not authorised as a synthetic flavouring substance (DHHS-FDA, 2012) [ [57](#B57-molecules-27-01716)]. -thujone and -thujon\u2014two enantiomeric forms. The monoterpene is widespread in nature and can be found in various plants and essential oils, among which the most important is Artemisia absinthium and Salvia officinalis [ [57](#B57-molecules-27-01716), [58](#B58-molecules-27-01716)]. Thujone has been intensively studied. The phenomenon results from the fact that the compound is often used to flavour foods and beverages, and is a significant constituent of the wormwood-flavoured spirit, absinthe. Ingestion of the alcohol cause symptoms of so-called \"absinthism\" characterised by convulsions, blindness, hallucinations and mental deterioration [ [59](#B59-molecules-27-01716), [60](#B60-molecules-27-01716)]. Due to the neurotoxic character of thujone, in most countries, there are regulations regarding the amount of terpene allowed in food and beverages. Nevertheless, some herbs containing thujone are recognised by the Food and Drug Administration as generally safe (see: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2010. Listing of Food Additive Status Part I.). In accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulations [ [61](#B61-molecules-27-01716)] contained in the Artemisia absinthium monograph, the daily intake should not exceed 3 mg/person/day for a maximum duration of 2 weeks. [62](#B62-molecules-27-01716), [63](#B63-molecules-27-01716)]. Thujone displays rapid absorption due to its small molecular weight and lipophilic character. Its precipitate metabolic processing leads to creating 7-hydroxy-(-thujone) as the main metabolite [ [62](#B62-molecules-27-01716)]. [64](#B64-molecules-27-01716)]. The basis of them were 6-8-week-old mice divided into five groups. The control group received paraffin oil while the experimental group received thujone (1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg/bw) intraperitoneally for 14 days. Study results showed behaviour changes, enhanced mortality, dissection out and decrease in organ weight (liver, spleen, thymus, kidney and lungs), as well as disturbances in hepatic and renal functions which were observed for a 25 mg/kg dose, whereas a dose of 1 mg/kg was selected as non-toxic. The greatest change was observed for the weight of the liver for which a decrease in weight from 5.64 g/100 g b.w. to 4.72 g/100 g b.w. was noted [ [64](#B64-molecules-27-01716)]. Other studies based on male and female rats and mice investigated the toxicokinetics of thujone [ [65](#B65-molecules-27-01716)]. The studies based on gavage administration of -thujone or a mixture of - and -thujone were performed with the following parameters: for single gavage administration: male and female rats and mice were given a single gavage dose of -thujone or a mixture of isomers at doses of 25 or 50 (rats) or 40 or 80 (mice) mg/kg whereas for intravenous administration the following parameters were used: a single intravenous dose of 1.6 (rats) or 3.2 (mice) mg/kg of -thujone and 3 (rats) or 6 (mice) mg/kg of a mixture of isomers. Obtained results have revealed that elimination of -thujone in the brain was slower than in the plasma. This effect can impact the neurotoxic effect of the terpene. It was also observed that in rats the compound was more easily absorbed in females than males. This difference, however, was not observed in mice [ [65](#B65-molecules-27-01716)]. Beyond its neurotoxicity, the compound reveals other negative properties, such as genotoxicity and carcinogenicity [ [66](#B66-molecules-27-01716)]. [67](#B67-molecules-27-01716)]. Thujone is not authorised for use as a flavouring substance in the USA, whereas in France and the United Kingdom the mean daily intake of thujone is estimated to be between 0.27 and 1.09 mg/person [ [68](#B68-molecules-27-01716)]. [Table 1](#molecules-27-01716-t001). 4. Plants and Their Essential Oils Rich in Monoterpenes [5](#B5-molecules-27-01716), [6](#B6-molecules-27-01716)]. Usage of the plants can cause allergic reactions or medical accidents. Particular attention should be paid to them by pregnant women due to the fact that a significant number of terpenes reveal teratogenic toxicity or changes in reproductive organs [ [54](#B54-molecules-27-01716)]. A characteristic feature of terpenes is their aromatic character which results in essential oils consisting of these compounds being commonly used in cosmetics and household products. Among them, very popular are lemongrass, verbena, lavandula or citrus fruits essential oils [ [68](#B68-molecules-27-01716)]. Considering their aromatic qualities, it is impossible not to agree with their common use. However, are too high a concentration and the frequent use of these oils harmful to the body? [Table 2](#molecules-27-01716-t002)provides a listing of plant sources of monoterpenes, along with a qualitative analysis of their essential oils and the toxicity observed in various types of studies. 5.
