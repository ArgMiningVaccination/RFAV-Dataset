This ancient form of medicine is based on the philosophy that illness is caused by an imbalance of vital energies in the body. In modern terms, acupuncture can help by improving blood flow, which boosts oxygenation in tissues. At Pet Vet, we feel that we can obtain the best results by using acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapy to help restore your pet's health and vitality. The Acupuncture Technique Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at precise points called meridians, where the blood vessels converge with the nerves. The needles help guide vital energy along these meridians, supporting the nervous system and promoting circulation while enhancing the body's healing abilities. Common Acupuncture Uses Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a number of issues, including: [Pain Management](#) Medical treatments such as chemotherapy can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. They will often be combined with acupuncture in an effort to relieve some discomfort, helping your cat or dog to fight their illness. [Musculoskeletal Issues](#) Acupuncture can often be used for injury rehabilitation. Conditions such as arthritis, nerve injuries and hip dysplasia also tend to respond well to acupuncture. [Dermatology & Skin Issues](#) Acupuncture treatment can help encourage increased circulation, which can help hot spots, granulomas and allergic dermatitis. It can also improve healing and reduce pain, leading to less itching and subsequent over-grooming. [Gastrointestinal Issues](#) Acupuncture may stimulate digestive secretions, which helps to promote healthy digestive activity. Conditions such as diarrhea or nausea may benefit from increased blood flow. [Respiratory Issues](#) The immune-calming and anti-inflammatory capabilities of acupuncture treatment can improve asthma, allergies and other conditions. The Benefits Acupuncture for pets provides a number of benefits, including: - Pets in poor health will benefit from the lack of systemic side effects - Lowers the amount of waste products produced - Helps relax muscles and relieve pain - Improves metabolic waste removal from the body - Promotes an increased blood flow which boosts oxygen in tissues "}
