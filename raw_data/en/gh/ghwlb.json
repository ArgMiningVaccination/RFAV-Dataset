Introduction Over a century ago, Paul Ehrlich proposed the \"Magic bullet theory of targeted therapy. \"He postulated that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism (in patients) could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. The hybridomatechnology introduced by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 enabled the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a large scale. 1Fundamental knowledge gained on cancer antigens or receptors, the structures and mechanisms of mAbs as well as the achievements in recombinant DNA techniques and devel-opments in modern protein engineering trigger people 's in- terest in developing novel antibody-based cancer therapies, including new mAb constructs2,3and antibody -cytotoxic agent conjugates,4including immunotoxins.5,6 In the past 20 years, the development of cancer therapeutic drugs was mainly focused on the eld of mAbs. Despite the signicant ef cacy of mAbs, cancer is still far away from being completelycured. Therefore, many innovativebiotherapeutics, which were safer and more effective, were developed to treat tumors in laboratories and clinics. In recent years,bispeci c antibodies, 7,8immunotoxins,5,6oncolytic viruses,9 o x i c i t yAbstract Immunotoxins are proteins that consist of a protein toxin conjugated to a speci c targeting moiety. The targeting moiety is usually an antibody or ligand, such as monoclonal antibody,antibody fragment, a cytokine, or a growth factor. The toxins usually come from planttoxins, bacterial toxins, or human-origin cytotoxic elements. Nearly all toxins work byenzymatically inhibiting protein synthesis. After binding to antigens or receptors on targetcell surfaces, immunotoxins are internalized and translocated to the cytosol where they can kill the cells. Immunotoxins have demonstrated high cytotoxicity to cancer cells and to date two immunotoxins have been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration on themarkets for the treatment of hematological tumors: Lumoxiti and Ontak. Many othermolecules are under development or clinical trials for different forms of cancer. Althoughimmunotoxins exhibit great potency in xenograft model systems and early clinical trials,there are obstacles that limit successful treatments, including immunogenicity, nonspeci c toxicity, and poor penetration. However, efforts are underway to address these problems.In this review, we summarize immunotoxins currently in clinical trials for either hematologi- cal tumors or solid tumors, outline the design of immunotoxins utilizing variety of components, and discuss the prominent examples of redesigned immunotoxins withreduced immunogenicity and nonspeci c toxicity, as well as the strategies in manufactur- ing immunotoxins. With further improvements, it is anticipated that immunotoxins willplay an increasing role in cancer therapy. received October 3, 2019accepted November 7, 2019DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0039-1700507.ISSN 2628-5088.\u00a9 THIEME Review Article e33 Published online: 2019-12-30become research hotspots. In the immunotoxin eld, there have been many valuable review articles summarizing re-search and clinical progresses available for references. 6,10-16 Here, in this review article, the authors would like to provide updates on the progresses in the eld with the focus on the immunotoxin molecules, clinical applications, and latest approaches using immunotoxins in cancer therapy. Immunotoxins are proteins that consist of a protein toxin fused to a speci c targeting moiety. Antibodies, antibody fragments, or growth factors are employed as targeting moie- ties. The toxin partners usually come from plants, bacteria, orhuman-origin cytotoxic elements, which act through enzy- matically inhibiting protein synthesis. 17Many cases demon- strated the potential applications of immunotoxins inpreclinical and clinical trials. 7To improve tumor penetration capacity, some immunotoxins are constructed by fusing a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or single-domain anti-body to toxins, which can lead to enhanced antitumor cacy when they are delivered intrathecally or intratumorally. 10-17 Compared with ADC molecules, most immunotoxins can be directly expressed as a fusion protein in host cells, which reduces the off-target effects caused by unstable junctions.4 The off-target side-effect, that toxins released from the deliv- ery vehicles and bind to normal tissue before getting to target cells, led to unexpected cellular necrosis.4 Immunoconjugates for Cancer Therapy There have been more than 70 mAbs on the market and most of which are for cancer therapy. However, to enhance effec-tiveness of the targeted therapy, one design from logical thinking would be immunoconjugates with cytotoxic agents. The cytotoxic agents may be a chemotherapy drug, a proteintoxin, or a radionuclide, thus creating ADCs, 4immunotox- nents: a target portion conjugated via a short spacer to a cytotoxic agent. The most important component of immu-noconjugates is the targeting moiety, usually an antibody or cytokine. An ideal antibody should deliver and enhance accumulation of the conjugated payloads speci cally to the targeted sites. Identi cation of an appropriate targeted anti- gen or receptor is the most important step in designing an immunoconjugate. The linker, linking of the payloads to thetargeting moiety, and linkage strategy are another aspect that should be intensively considered. Critically, the linker should not affect the af nity with targets and be stable in bloodstream but labile once inside the targeted cells thus releasing the payloads in the active form. A series of regio- selective linking techniques have been developed to ful ll this need. The third compone nt of an immuno conjugate is the cytotoxic payloads. Payloads could be a chemotherapy drug, a protein toxin, or a radionuclide. Antibody -Drug Conjugates ADCs are molecules containing an with a cytotoxic drug via a linker.4,19,20Early ADCs were composed of whole murine antibodies conjugated to a traditional chemotherapeutic drug. These attempts were not successfuldue to the rapid clearance caused by the nonspeci ct o x i c i t y to normal cells and tissues, immunogenicity, insuf cient anticancer potency of the conjugated cytotoxic limited internalization, thus the amount of the effector accumulated in the targeted cells was not enough to triggercell death. 4,19,20With experiences gained from these early explorations, several improvements were introduced in de- veloping new ADCs. To date, there are treat CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the year 2000 but withdrawn from the market in 2010. Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris or SGN-35), an linker, was approved by U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2011 for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma after the failure of autolo- gous stem cell transplant and systematic anaplastic large celllymphoma to maytansinoid via a thioetherlinker, was the rst ADC approved for treating solid tumors. The success of Adcetris and Kadcyla spurred the develop- ment of other ADCs targeting different numerous malignan-cies. To date, there are over 30 ADCs with different indications under development or clinical investigation. 24 Radioimmunoconjugates It was well established that a cancer cell was killed when a sufcient high dose of radiation was delivered. By combining the bene t of the speci city of antibodies and the high potency of radiation therapies, researchers developed RICs exhibiting high potency in treating cancers.18RICs are mAbs labeled with therapeutic radionuclides which can deliver radiation precisely to the tumor cells or cells with heteroge-neously expressed antigens. So far, two RICs targeting CD20 treating hematological malignancies, Although RICs gained success in malignancies, the responses in solid tumors were insuf cient, which may be due to the poor radiosensitivity of these tumors as well asthe inability to deliver suf cient doses to the targets. Opti- mizations on the antibodies 'uptake could be made to enhance the ef cacy of RICs. 25In the meantime, there are many other RICs in development, including at least 10 candidates for treating solid tumor.26These advances give rise to a variety of opportunities in the management ofvarious cancers, where the radiolabeled antibodies may be particularly useful in immunospeci c phenotypic imaging, e. g., companion diagnostics. Concerning therapeutic applica-tions, RICs have demonstrated their ef cacy in the treatment both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. 18,25 Immunotoxins Immunotoxins are chimeric proteins consisting of a targeting moiety and a cytotoxic protein, which were prepared by Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e34 chemical conjugation or expressed as a fusion protein. To date, denileukin diftitox [Ontak] and anti-CD22 antibody with PE38[Lumoxiti] are the two immunotoxins approved on markets. Ontak, approved in 1999, is a fusion protein consisting of an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor targeting a portion conjugated toa modi ed diphtheria toxin (DT), and was used in treating of CD-25 positive cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). 27Lumoxiti, approved in 2018, is a fusion protein consisting of disul de bond stabilized Fv targeting CD22 fused with toxin PE38 to treat hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in clinics.12,28,29 All the immunoconjugates mentioned above are based on the concept of \"magic bullet. \"By taking the advantage of the target speci city, mAbs, ADCs, immunotoxins, and RICs can selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to the targeted cells andcause the apoptosis of the target cells while minimizing nonspeci c toxicity induced by cytotoxic agents. Mechanism of Cancer Therapy by Immunotoxins There are quite a few different designs of an immunotoxic molecule, which may have different mechanisms in targetcell killing. The function of the targeting moiety is to bind to the corresponding antigen or receptor and trigger endocyto- sis. After receptor-mediated internalization, the toxin moietyis activated by proteolysis, then exerts cytotoxic activity. Generally cancer cell killing by immunotoxins can be sum- marized as the following three steps: rst, binding to the target cells: the antigen- or receptor-binding domain of the immunotoxin binds to the corresponding antigen or receptor on the surface of the target cells. Second, entering into thetarget cells: the translocation domain of the immunotoxin promotes the toxin moiety entry into the target cells byendocytosis or transmembrane transport. 30Lastly, killing the target cells: the catalytic domain of the immunotoxin in the target cell could trigger cell death by inhibiting target cellprotein synthesis or activating some important apoptotic proteins. 31,32The mechanisms of different toxins are illus- trated by Wayne et al as shown in Fig. 1 .31 Human toxins are human cytolytic fusion proteins (hCFPs) that cause cell death through an apoptosis pathway ( Fig. 2 ).33 Compared with toxins from bacteria and plants, hCFPs have lower immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, with higher tumor selectivityand in ltrationability. At present, mostofthehuman toxins used granzyme B (GrB) and ribonucleases(RNases). GrB translocates across the lipid membrane together with perforin, 34,35then attacking its target substrate to activate the apoptosis pathway.34-37Natural and engineered RNases may degrade tRNA in vivo to terminate protein synthesis that will lead cell death through apoptosis.38-41 Immunotoxins in Clinical Trials Many immunotoxins were in clinical stages targeting on both hematological tumors and solid tumors. Two immunotoxic drugs were approved by FDA on global markets ( Table 1 ). Different types of chroniclymphocytic leukemia (CLL), HCL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), etc. were treated by several immunotoxins in clinical stages I to III ( Table 1 ) targeting on CD3, CD22, CD25, CD30, Fig. 1 Mechanisms of immunotoxins with three different kinds of protein toxin killing of cells. Ricin-, diphtheria-, and Pseudomonas -based immunotoxins are shown in the diagram. After binding the antigen, immunotoxins are internalized by clathrin-coated pits and reached the endosome. Pseudomonas and ricin traf c from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol and then inhibit the protein synthesis. Diphtheria toxins are internalized and then the A chain of the toxin is transport ed to the cytosol to inactivate EF-2. Inhibition of protein synthesis nally caused the cell death.31 Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e35 CD33, etc. on B-cells and others. In certain case, for instance, HCL, it is rare disease and no effective medication before HA22 (Lumoxiti) used in clinic.28,29After several years of clinical development, Lumoxiti was nally approved to glob- al market in August 2018.29Up to now, Pseudomonas exotox- in A (PE), ricin, DT, and gelonin have been the commonly usedtoxins in research laboratories and clinical development. Clinical development for solid tumors would be much more challenged, as it could be much more dif cult than targeting hematologic tumors. Tumor tissues are packed tightly and the mass increases rapidly. The patients are less immunosuppressed and more likely to make neutraliz- ing antibodies to the toxin. Many popular molecules for cancer research including mesothelin, epithelial cell adhe-sion molecule (EpCAM), EGFRvIII, ErbB2, transferrin receptor (TfR), and IL-13R were used as action targets for a variety ofcancer diseases such as mesothelioma, lung, head, neck, bladder, breast cancers, glioblastoma, brain, and CNS tumors. Toxin partners used in these studies were similar to thosedeveloped in hematological tumors. Although there is no market product approved in this eld, several treatment options of glioblastoma have entered has entered phase III clinical trials; it has been developed as a speci c tumor-targeting agent, which was administered by positive- pressure convection-enhanced delivery directly to brain tissue at risk for residual in ltrating conjugated with a 1 Immunotoxins targeting on hematological tumors Immunotoxin Targeting moiety Toxic moiety lymphoma.

Oportuzumab monatox was granted orphan drug status in 2005 and a fast track quali cation in 2018 for the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Currently, the phase III VISTA study (NCT02449239) is evaluating NMIBC patients who have received BCG prior to treatmentwith oportuzumab monatox; the primary endpoint is the patient 's complete response rate. Tf-CRM107 is a conjugate protein of DT with a point mutation (CRM107) linked by a thioester bond to human transferrin (Tf). 51This conjugate exhibits potent cytotoxicity in vitro against mammalian cells expressing TfR. Phase Iclinical trial results demonstrated that Tf-CRM107, delivered via a high- flow convection method utilizing stereotactically placed catheters, produced tumor response in patients with malignant brain tumors refractory to conventional therapy without severe neurologic or systemic toxicity. In the phase IIclinical trial, the Tf-CRM107 treatment results in complete and partial tumor response without severe toxicity in 35% of the evaluable patients. Mesothelin is a tumor antigen that is highly expressed in many human cancers, including malignant mesothelioma and pancreatic, ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. Several anti-body-based therapeutic agents including bispeci ca n t i b o d y , CAR-Tcells,ADCs,and immunotoxinsdirected at mesothelin are Two antimesothelin agents are currently in multicenter clinical registration trials for malignant meso-thelioma: amatuximab in the rst-line setting and anetumab ravtansine as second-line therapy. Phase II randomized clinical trials of CRS-207 as a boosting agent and in combination withimmune checkpoint inhibition for pancreatic cancer are nearing completion. These ongoing studies will de ne the utility of mesothelin immunotherapy for treating cancer. 49Updated information on immunotoxins in clinical trials has been summarized by a number outstanding reviewarticles recently. 6,13,14,52,53 Immunotoxin Classi cation Immunotoxins are proteins consisting of a targeting moiety which could selectively bind to a target cell and a killingmoiety which could kill the targeted cell after internaliza- tion. The targeting moiety could be an antibody, antibody fragment, cytokine, or growth factor, while the most potenttoxins are different types of enzymatic inhibitors of protein synthesis. A toxin moiety can be derived from bacteria, fungi, plants, or human cells. Th erefore, immu notoxins may be classi ed according to targeting moieties and toxins. Immunotoxin Target and Targeting Moieties For cancer therapeutics, the goal of antibody-mediated killing is to eliminate the malignant cells. The choice ofantibody will depend on the disease target based on results from basic researches. In general, speci c antigens or recep- tors expressed on malignant cells rather than normal vitaltissues are appropriate targets. These antigens and receptors should be internalized after antibody binding, ensuring that the toxin or drug is transported to the cell interior and thenseparates from the antibody and kills the cell. It is important to note that targeting antigens are not well validated, which is the risk in target selection. The risk is mitigated if theclinical results of targeting an antigen with an mAb are available. The targeting moiety of immunotoxins can be either an antibody (such as mAb, scFv, and single-domainantibody) or a ligand (such as cytokine, growth factor, and hormone peptide) that binds selectively to an antigen or a receptor expressed on the surface of the target cells. Cytokine Receptor as a Target and Ligand as a Targeting Moiety The IL-2R complex, which consists of three subunits \u2014 (CD122), and (CD132) \u2014is killer (NK) cells.54Ontak is a fusionTable 2 Immunotoxins targeting on solid tumors Immunotoxin Toxic moiety Target Type of tumor Clinical phase SS1P PE38 Mesothelin Mesothelioma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer Phase I, II44,49 VB4-845 PE EpCAM Head and neck cancer, squamous bladder cancer Phase II, III42 MR1-1 Malignant Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e37 protein composed of IL-2 fused to the rst 388 amino acids of DT. It has IL-2 instead of an Fv; it targets and kills cells in thesame manner as an immunotoxin. Ontak binds tightly to the IL-2 but less to the subunit. (Ontak (Denileukin Diftitox)) was approved for the treatment of CTCL in adults, and itsactivity has been reported in other hematologic malignan- cies, including IL-2R-expressing leukemia. 54Thesubunit is mostly overexpressed in T cell malignancies, since newerimmunotoxin fusion in which the Fv portion of an antibody toCD25, the chain of the IL-2 receptor, is fused to PE38. It has been proved that gliomas overexpress IL receptors. Cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 were used to target gliomas sincethey are overexpressed in tumor cells. IL4-PE toxin was also reported to show antitumor activity in vivo and regression of human glioblastoma tumors, thus leading to the ongoingphase I/II clinical trials. 57Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-based immunotoxins were developed with antimelanoma antibody (scFvMEL), which showed cytotoxicity in nude mice.58 Growth Factor Receptors as Targets Growth factor receptors are generally overexpressed in solidtumors, which make them as effective therapeutic targets. ErbB has higher expression levels in many tumors; ErbB2/ Her2 was targeted by ScFv (FRP5)-ETA for solid tumors. 58It consists of an N-terminal ScFv, genetically linked to truncat- ed PE. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is another growth factor being used widely for solid tumors. Anti-ScFvEGFRvIII-PE38 in an athymic rat model of neoplastic menin- gitis was reported to increase median survival. TP-38 is a recombinant chimeric-targeted toxin composed tumor-associated surface antigen EpCAM has been used to target solid tumors and has shown regression of largetumor xenografts derived from lung, colon, or squamous combines the speci city of an anti-EpCAM ScFv with the toxicity of PE 40. 61-63Mesothelin, expressed on mesotheliomas, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancers, hasbeen targeted with PE toxin and was found to have a synergistic effect with chemotherapeutic agents in a mice model. 44,49,64One of the more interesting ITs is SS1P or antimesothelin (Fv)-PE38.44,49 CD3 is widely expressed in malignancies. An anti-CD3 recombinant immunotoxin (RIT), AdmDT390-bisFv (UCHT1),was constructed from a divalent molecule consisting of two single-chain antibody fragments reactive with the extracellu- lar domain 65The combination of HD37-dgA and RFB4- dgA (Combotox) has studied in adults and children with B-lineage hematologic malignancies. In addition to this, a bivalent recombinant immunotoxin hasbeen developed in which one Fv CD19 and the other targets CD22 (DT2219ARL). This agent has shown activity in preclinical models and is in phase 1 testing in adolescents andadults with B-lineage hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 65-67 CD22 is a lineage-restricted differentiation antigen expressed on B cells and most B cell malignancies. Because it is rapidly internalized after binding, it is an attractivetarget for immunotoxins and ADCs. HA22 and variants are named in a patent, which claims a method for treating ALL in pediatric patients. 68In addition to CD22, the receptor CD25 has also been targeted to treat various leukemias and lym- phomas.55,56Clinical trials of IMTOX25, using dgA to anti-CD25 on CD25 positive refractorycutaneous T cell NHL and T cell leukemia or lymphoma were completed. 56CD30 is expressed on several types of hematologic tumors, particularly in HL and ALCL. The or brentuximab 69,70CD33 expressed on the early multi- lineage hematopoietic progenitors, myelomonocytic precur- sors, cells of the monocyte/macrophage system, some lymphoid cells, 80 to 90% of cases of AML, and some casesof B cell precursor and T cell ALL. An anti-CD33 I study inadults with myeloid leukemias. 71,72 Antibody as a Tar ScFv, single-domain antibody, full- length murine, and humanized antibodies can be used as targeting moieties. In the early stage, the targeting moietiesof immunotoxins were mainly murine mAbs, which had limitations in clinical application due to their large molecular weight (MW) and high immunogenicity. So, smaller size targeting moieties such as ScFv, single-domain antibody, and humanized antibody were developed to reduce immu- nogenicity. The MW of the complete murine mAb is generally approximately 150 kDa, which may be dif cult to diffuse and penetrate into the solid tumor cells due to their large MW. Sothese immunotoxins were often used for hematological tumors. Immunotoxins composed of such full-size mAbs not only have high immunogenicity, but also are dif cult to express in host cells, due to their cytotoxicity. Despite all these, many different types of immunotoxins were still widely developed, as they also have several importantadvantages, such as a long half-life, strong antigen af nity, and low preparation costs. 11 To overcome the shortcomings of the complete murine mAb, researchers used genetic engineering technology to develop ScFv as the targeting moiety, which has smaller MW, and better permeability and stability. The ScFv has a MW ofapproximately 25 kDa, which is a combination of a light- chain variable fragment (VL) and a heavy-chain variable fragment (VH) via a flexible linker peptide, and the ScFv retains the speci city like the complete mAb. The ScFv immun otoxins have shown good results in many studies in hematological and solid tumors. On the basis of ScFv, to further reduce the MW of the targeting moiety of immunotoxins to bene t for fusion expression, researchers designed the single-domain Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e38 antibody which only contains the VH. Its MW is about half of that of ScFv 's, but it retains most of the antigen-binding ability as ScFv.73However, with the decrease of the MW, the half-lives of the immunotoxins composed of ScFv or single- domain antibody were shortened and they were quicklyeliminated from the body. 73 The reason for using humanized antibody as the targeting moiety is to reduce the immune rejection induced by exoge-nous antibody. 40Compared with the murine antibody, hu- manized antibody reduces immunogenicity and retains the advantages of high af nity and long half-life. However, there still exist the disadvantages of large MW and low permeabil- ity. Humanized antibody has been also used as a targeting partner in ADC. As an example, P zer's Mylotarg (gemtuzu- was approved for AML in 2000 and reap- proved in 2017. Although it is an ADC drug, it is very similarto humanized immunotoxin. It was prepared by a chemical coupling method and using humanized antibody as the targeting moiety. 74 Immunotoxins with Different Toxins Protein toxins exhibit high potency when compared withsmall molecular cell killing agents. It has been shown that one single molecule in the cytosol is suf cient to kill a cell, 75 thus an extremely low concentration was needed. Among the vast protein toxins, three toxins were intensively studied and commonly used in developing immunotoxins: the bacterial toxins PE and DT, and the plant toxin ricin. Bacterial Toxins DT and PE are the most widely studied two EF-2, which is posttranslationally modi ed to a diphthamide residue 35. Despite their similar action, PE and DT have quite differentamino acid sequences. In fact, PE 'se n z y m a t i cd o m a i ni sn e a r the carboxyl terminus, while DT 's is near the amino termi- nus. Conversely, PE 's binding domain is near its amino terminus, and DT 's is near its carboxyl terminus. To reduce the nonspeci c toxicity, the binding domain of the toxins was usually deleted to prevent their binding to normal cells.Based on the structural and functional studies, the most common truncated form of PE is PE38, which contains the amino acids 253 -364 and 381 -613, and the derived form PE38KDEL, in which the last four amino acid residues REDL at the C terminal were replaced by KDEL to enhance the translocation to cytosol. For DT, the most commonly usedtruncated form is DT388 or DAB389, containing the rst 388 - 389 amino acids of DT. 15,78,79 Pseudomonas Exotoxin APE, a 613-amino acid peptide, is one of the virulence factors derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and could be structur- ally and functionally separated into three major domains. 80-82 Domain Ia is composed of residue 1 -252 and responsible for cell recognition and binding, while domain II, residue 253 -364, is involved in the translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. Domain III (amino acids 405 -613), which is located at the C terminus of PE, halts the protein synthesis by eukaryotic EF-2 by catalytical ADP- procedure was elucidated to contain the following steps: the toxin was rst processed by carboxypeptidases in plasma to remove the C-terminus resi- due Lys613 leaving an REDL terminus,82then domain Ia mediated the binding of the processed toxin to the receptor present on the target cell surface and the sequential internali- zation into the cell via an endosomal pathway; once internal-ized into the target cell, the toxin undergoes a transient unfolding and a subsequent proteolytic cleavage by furin at domain II 82and a reduction of a key disul de bond, then the C- terminal fragment of the toxin was transported to the endo- plasmic reticulum (ER) via the binding of the 609 -612 REDL terminus to the KDEL receptor, then domain II mediated thetranslocation of the toxin to the cytosol, and catalyzed the ADP-ribosylation of the residue in EF-2 and eventually caused the cell apoptosis in the cytosol. 11,78 Diphtheria ToxinDT is derived from the pathogen Corynebacterium diphther- iae, which is a single-chain protein containing 535 amino acids. Like PE, DT is composed of three domains, the enzy- matic A domain (amino acids 1 -193), the binding B domain (amino acids 482 -535), and a translocation domain which is located between the A and B domains. 81DT shares a similar mechanism with PE, which is catalyzing the ADP-ribosyla-tion of the EF-2 and causing the blockage in protein synthe- sis. More speci cally, DT is cleaved outside the cell into two domains at the furin cleavage site, and forms a di-chainprotein which is linked by a single disul de bond. After binding to the target cell and internalized into the endosome, DT undergoes a transient unfolding at a low pH and a key disulde bond was reduced. Then the active domain of DT is translocated to cytosol through a channel formed by the Tdomain and ADP-ribosylates the EF-2 and eventually halts the protein synthesis. 83 Plant Toxins Plant toxins can be classi ed into holotoxins and hemitoxins. Holotoxins (also referred antiviral (PAP), saporin, bryodin 1, bouganin, and gelonin. 84 Holotoxins contain both binding and catalytic domains, where- as hemitoxins contain only the catalytic domain. Both of holotoxins and hemitoxins exert their toxic effects by inactivat-ing the cell 's ribosomes, thus they can work only when their enzymatically active domains enter the cytosol. Ricin Ricin as a representative of holotoxins is extracted from the seeds of castor. Natural ricin is a 64-kDa protein that consistsof two domains. Domain A can permanently inactivate the ribosome of eukaryotic cells, and domain B can bind to glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. Ricin can Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e39 enter the target cells by endocytosis, then the two domains of ricin are reduced in endosomal vesicles; the domain A istransferred to the cytoplasm, which inactivates the ribosome by removing the base of G4323 in 28S rRNA of the ribosome, permanently inhibits cellular protein synthesis, leads tocell death. 85The deglycosylated A-chain of ricin (dgA) was also used to construct immunotoxins with a slower clearance rate. Since it is not easy to express functional ricin inEscherichia coli , ricin-based immunotoxins were constructed by chemically conjugating the ricin or dgA prepared by reduction to a targeting portion. 85 GeloninGelonin is another plant-derived single-chain RIP (corre-sponding to the recombinant ricin toxin A [RTA] chain) exhibiting sound cytotoxicity and is applicable in gene manipulation and thus widely used in RIT construction. 32 As a representative of hemitoxins, gelonin is often studied as the toxin moiety of immunotoxins. Gelonin is a single-chain soluble glycoprotein toxin with a MW of approximately30 kDa extracted from the seeds of the Himalayan plant Gelonium multi florum . Many studies have shown that gelo- nin can prevent the association of EF-2 with the 60s ribo-somal subunit by removing the base of A4324 in 28s rRNA. 32 Human Toxins Human toxins are hCFPs that also can trigger apoptosis and cause cell death. Compared with heterologous toxins, hCFPs have lower immunogenicity an d cytotoxicity, while having higher tumor selectivity and in ltration ability. At present, most of the human toxins used in research are GrB33-37and RNases.38-40 Granzyme B GrB a of NK cells andcytotoxic T cells.86Duetocytotoxicity with GrB, it was usually expressed as an inactive zymogen form, and theactivity was recovered by lysosomal dipeptide protease to remove two propeptide amino acids, it is expressed as an inactive zymogen form, and can recover activity by lysosomaldipeptide protease to remove two propeptide amino acids. GrB can enter the cytoplasm of target cells through the pores in the cell membrane, and cause apoptosis by cutting various struc-tural and functional proteins containing Aps-X, Glu-X sites, etc., such as a variety of caspases, BH3 proapoptotic pro- tein. 33,34In addition, GrB is molecule of the granzyme family. It activates the caspase cascade in target cells, which can rapidly cause DNA fragmentation and lead to cell apoptosis. It can also directly migrate to the nucleus,cutting nuclear proteins to promote nuclear apoptosis. 35 RNaseRNase is capable of hydrolyzing phosphodiester rRNA, or tRNA. 39,40RNases play a wide-ranging role in cell processes andcorrespond to different targets at differentsites, even to stop the cell process for the survival of the body. 39,40RNases are nontoxic and can promote apoptosis by hydrolyzing RNA in the cytosol. As a toxin moiety ofthe immunotoxin, RNases have better biosafety and only exert cytotoxicity after entering the cell, inhibiting tumor growth byterminating the cell cycle. RNases can be fused to a targeting antibody or ligand to form an immunotoxin that selectively kills tumor cells, showing signi cant anticancer effects through speci c tumor-cell surface antigens. 39,40 The three major types of toxins discussed above, in which bacterial and plant toxins are highly immunogenic in clinicaltreatment, and the human toxins avoid this problem. As foreign proteins, nonspeci c bacterial and plant toxins may induce the neutralizing antibodies when administrated. Thisresults in a short half-life and thus high doses or more rounds are needed. Although many works have been done to mitigate the immunogenicity of these foreign proteins, fully human-origin cytotoxic proteins stand another chance to construct immunotoxins with reduced or eliminated immunogenicity. Immunogenicity, Nonspeci c Toxicity, and Other Side Effects RITs are genetically engineered proteins being developed to treat cancer. In the development of immunotoxins, immu- nogenicity and nonspeci c toxicity are the major obstacles. The plant- or bacterial-derived toxins are foreign proteins that may induce neutralizing antibody formation in patients, thus causing rapid removal of the immunotoxin from thebloodstream, resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effect. The clinical success of RITs in patients with a normal immune system is limited by their immunogenicity. With a balancingact between immunogenicity and therapeutic potency, one approach is to prevent the activation of B cells by mapping and elimination of B cell epitopes. Another approach is toprevent helper T cell activation by interfering with major histocompatibility complex II presentation or T cell recogni- tion. Immunizing mice with RITs that were deimmunized by elimination of the murine B cell or T cell epitopes showed that both approaches were effective. 56,87Nanoparticles con- taining synthetic vaccine particle encapsulating antigens was able to induce immune tolerance and prevent antidrug antibody formation. This treatment restores RIT antitumoractivity that is otherwise neutralized because of immunoge- nicity. When treating patients with hematological malignan- cies, the immune system is suppressed by either the diseaseor chemotherapy. However, with solid tumors, the immune systems is intact, and the immunotoxins are neutralized after one cycle thus preventing effective retreatments. 56,87 Several approaches have been attempted to overcome the problem of immunogenicity without compromising toxin efcacy.88-91Chemically modifying the protein with high MW polyethylene glycol is a common approach to reduce or eliminate immunogenicity.30Researchers tried to modify various immunotoxins with PEG and found PEGylation oftoxin may result in a modest reduction in immunogenicity with an unaffected cytotoxicity. 88 Intensive research studies have also been done to improve the PE moiety to produce smaller and less immunogenic PE molecules. HA22 was taken as the parental molecule. By locating the epitope groups and mutating the key amino Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e40 acids in the epitope groups in PE,88a mutant immunotoxin HA22 -8X was constructed. Domain II contains a lot of proteolytic sites. By deleting domain II except for the furin cleavage site, a smaller toxin HA22-LR (lysosome resistant) was HA22-LR exhibited more cytotoxic activityto CLL samples than HA22, which may due to the resistance to the proteolytic process while traf cking to the ER. 88New immunotoxins HA22-LR-6X92and HA22-LR-8M93were by combining the HA22-LR deletion with immunogenic epitope removal. Both have a further reduced immunogenicity while retaining a high antitumor activity athigh doses. 94Based on this knowledge, Stish et al linked human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and IL-4 to the B cell epitope-deleted PE38 to create a bispeci c immunotoxin- targeting mesothelioma. When administrated to a mouse model, the immunogenicity was greatly reduced with no apparent compromises in antitumor activity.95Many more of mutants were constructed by Pastan 's laboratory for the purpose of reducing immunogenicity.56,87,91Human-de- rived cytotoxic proteins such as GrB or RNase toconstruct immunotoxin to further eliminate the immunoge- nicity. Engineering a targeting portion to increase the af nity could therefore reduce the nonspeci ct o x i c i t y .B yi n t r o d u c - ing three amino acid mutations in CDR3 of the heavy chain of the Fv, moxetumomab pasudotox (Lumoxiti) showed a 14- fold and a 50-fold increase in antitumor activity against HCL and CLL cells. 2As mentioned above, a bispeci c antibody can increase speci city by simultaneous- ly binding different targets. Combining this advantage,researchers can further de crease immun otoxin nonspeci c toxicity by employing dual targeting moieties. 96-98Using the deimmunizing strategy and dual targeting strategy, Valleraet 99developed 2219KDEL7mut, a PE38-derived immuno- and CD22 with im- proved cytotoxic activity. Although newer versions of immunotoxins are constructed with improved safety and exhibit sound potency in treatingvarious cancers, the dose administrated to achieve ef cient therapeutic outcomes is limited, mainly due to the immuno- toxin-related side effects. Most commonly reported toxicitiesagainst normal cells and tissues are vascular leak syndrome (VLS), hepatotoxicity, and renal toxicity. Several studies have been reported and indicated that VLS may be resulted from theweak binding of immunotoxins, especially the RTA-based ones to normal endothelial cells when exiting blood vessels to targeting cells and tissues. 100-102Antibody fragments were used to construct immunotoxins to reduce the molecular size and decrease the in vivo half-life thus preventing their pro- longed contact with vascular cells. It was reported that RTAwould bind directly to endothelial cells, 102and a three-amino acid motif was identi ed to contribute to the toxicity. Then this motif was mutated to generate a new construct which showedless VLS in mice. 102VLS caused by truncated PE- and DT-based immunotoxins may rarely be dose-limiting due to the relative short half-lives in plasma. It was reported that PE- and DT-based immunotoxins may bind to the endothelial cells via the interaction between the targeting moiety and endothelial cells. 11Production of Immunotoxins For the recombinant expression of toxin-based biotherapeu- tics, a crucial step lies not only in the choice of the production host but also in the accurate design of the fusion proteins. Toavoid or limit the toxicity to production host cells without sacricing a consistent yield, several systems from bacterial to mammalian host cells have been employed. 103-106In the early stage, immunotoxins were assembled through chemical con- jugation of the toxin molecule with an antibody IgG that could be manufactured in mammalian systems. To avoid complicat-ed manufacturing steps, an E. coli host system has been commonly used for expressing antibody fragment -toxin fu- sion proteins without chemical conjugation. 105The fusion proteins were expressed as an inclusion body that can be puried with no toxic activity to the host cells. Due to limita- tionof proteinsize,theentirelength ofIgGwould bedif cult to be expressed in E. coli compared to a fragment of the IgG. So ScFv, single-domain antibody or other format of small size of the molecules would be logically considered as the targetingpartners in the molecular design, which makes it easy to apply theE. coli system to produce the immunotoxins. Immunotoxins could be historically categorized into three generations, and the construction and production strategy were developed to meet each generation. The rst-generation immunotoxins were conjugates consisting of a whole toxin toan intact antibody. The antibody portion and the toxin portion were prepared separately and chemically conjugated invitro to form the nal fusion proteins. The linkage may be a disul de bond or a nonreducible thioether bond. The problem of the rst-generation immunotoxins was the nonspeci ct o x i c i t yt o normal cells resulted from the intact toxin to the circulation. Inaddition, thelinkage may not bestable in circulation and would generate unconjugated mAbs which may block the tumor antigen and decrease the antitumor ef cacy. The binding domain of the toxin portion was eliminated with the second- generation immunotoxins; however, chemical conjugationwas still used to link the two parts, which might not be stable in circulation time. With further rational design and optimiza- tion, the third-generation immunotoxins could be constructedto form a fusion protein of a fragment of an IgG and a part of toxin with a binding domain. When it comes to the expression of the constructs, E. coli , yeast, and CHO cell systems could be used to meet different needs. Among these, the E. coli expres- sion system is the most widely employed one, although this system could not correctly fold the protein of interest with acomplex structure. Basically, the immunotoxins are expressed inE. coli as inclusion bodies, followed by denaturing and refolding and a further puri cation process to obtain the nal product. 105By introducing an ammonium sulfate precipita- tion, a cGMP process for preparing MR1 afforded high yield and acceptable purity.105An eukary- otic system with resistance to toxin, e.g., DT, may be used to produce immunotoxins. Based on this theory, several groups developed mammalian-cell immunotoxin-expression strate-gies to produce immunotoxins without serious toxicity to the host cells. 107,108The chloroplast of green algae demonstrates the ability to fold and assemble complex eukaryotic Pharmaceutical Fronts Vol. 1 No. 1/2019Immunotoxins: Targeted Toxin Delivery for Cancer Therapy Mei et al. e41 proteins,109while the machinery of the chloroplast resembles that of a prokaryote, thus it could be used to accumulateeukaryotic toxins. Taking these advantages of algae, Tran et al produced correctly formed immunotoxins with full bio- activities in vivo and in vitro. 109-111 Due to cytotoxicity by toxins in a variety of cells, immu- notoxins with a full length of IgG were normally not expressed in mammalian cells. Escherichia coli -based pro- duction procedures to produce fragments of antibody fused with a toxin were seen in many cases. However, it was recently reported that a DT-resistant cell line enabled avariety of cell lines robust for production of DT-encoding lentivirus. 112 Besides the above-mentioned construction and produc- tion strategies, there are quite a few interesting designs of immunotoxin molecules, or new ways to link the toxin with the targeting moiety. Lee et al constructed an immunotoxinvia site-speci c conjugation of anti-Her2 IgG with using Her2-overex- cell utilized split inteins to generate immunotoxins against HER1/2,113while Wang et al reported reduction of nonspeci c toxicity of immuno- toxin by intein-mediated reconstitution on cells.5 several CD38, constructed and tumor-inhib- itory effects were evaluated.114-116 Conclusions Immunotoxins are chimeric proteins that combine the advan- tages of the speci city of the targeting portion and the potent cytotoxicity of protein toxins. And the area of immunotoxin development is in rapid expansion. To date, two immunotox- ins, Ontak and anti-CD22 with PE38, have been approved by the U.S. FDA to treat CTCL and HCL. And clinical trials of otherimmunotoxins have been performed in hematologic malig- nancies and solid tumors. Immunotoxins could be used as a single agent or in combination with other agents. At present,the truncated forms of bacterial-derived protein toxin PE and DT are the most frequently used toxins for immunotoxin development. These foreign-protein -related immunogenicity will affect the therapeutic outcome by inducing the formation of neutralizing antibodies, especially in solid tumor treatment. Thus future research efforts will lie on further reducing theimmunogenicity or humanizing the toxic moiety or even utilizing full human-origin protein cytotoxins to construct immunotoxins. Further, identifying novel cancer-related anti-gens or receptors with high speci city and selectivity and mAbs ready to be internalized once bound to the targets is another aspect that should be extensively worked on. Effortsalso should be devoted to optimize the constructs 'orientation and MW and the linkage strategies to reduce the nonspeci c toxicity to normal tissues and achieve a higher max tolerancedosage to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Coadministration with other agents such as chemotherapies and immunosup- pressors should also be considered to augment the therapeuticoutcomes either by increasing cytotoxic activity or reducing immunogenicity. Immunotoxin manufacturing is another is-sue that should be addressed. A mammalian cell expression system has the capability to produce mAb and its fragments, but it is susceptible to toxins. It can be utilized to producesoluble immunotoxins in a correct form if a split intein mediated protein ligation strategy was introduced. With further improvements, it is envisaged that in the near futureimmunotoxins will expand the repertoire for treating cancers. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no con flict of interest.
