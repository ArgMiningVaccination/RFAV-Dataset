The earliest of these, dating from the second decade of the twentieth century and crowned by a mag- num opus in 1944, was cooperative game theory. V on Neumann and Morgenstern's The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Prince- ton, 1944) is arguably the most signi\u0002cant single achievement in social science theory in the last century. And Luce and Raiffa's Games and De- cisions (Wiley, 1957) served as a seminal textbook, popularizing many of the tools developed there. Commencing not too long after was social choice theory, which may be dated with the appearance of Kenneth Ar- row's Social Choice and Individual Values (Wiley, 1951), though it was preceded in the 1940s by several of his own papers as well as those by Duncan Black (and several centuries earlier by the work of Condorcet and Borda). Spatial models, the third tributary, also is associated with work early in the twentieth century, principally that of Harold Hotelling. But its real relevance for political science emerged in the 1950s with An- thony Downs's An Economic Theory of Democracy (Harper and Row, 1957) and Duncan Black's Theory of Committees and Elections (Cam- bridge, 1958). A fourth tributary is non-cooperative game theory, devel- oped as an offshoot of the earlier work by von Neumann and Morgen- stern in seminal papers by John Nash, but reached its zenith in the late 1970s as it took over \u0002eld after \u0002eld in economics (for overviews, see especially James Friedman, Oligopoly and the Theory of Games (North- Holland, 1977), Drew Fudenberg and Jean Tirole, Game Theory (MIT, 1991), and David Kreps, A Course in Microeconomic Theory (Princeton, 1990)). A \u0002fth tributary, another offshoot of cooperative game theory, was coalition theory, developed most prominently in political science by William Riker, The Theory of Political Coalitions (Yale, 1962). Need- less to say, there were second-order intellectual descendants, but these are the principal branches. For quite some time each of these lived an independent existence, ixx Foreword their fruits harvested by separate communities of scholars with only the occasional cross-over (as in William Riker and Peter Ordeshook, An In- troduction to Positive Political Theory (Prentice-Hall, 1972)). One of the leading innovators, drawing from (and making important contribu- tions to) all of these traditions, is Norman Scho\u0002eld. The present volume is something of a grand synthesis. Its substantive focus is elections with its electoral deals, party activists, and voters on the one hand, and parlia- ments with their coalition-building and government-forming maneuver- ings on the other. In terms of tools, the arguments found in this volume draw heavily on social choice theory, the spatial model, and cooperative game theory. Indeed, the \u0002rst \u0002ve chapters constitute just about all one needs to know of social choice theory. But the core (pun intended) of this \u0002ne volume is found in four very rich applied chapters, constituting a profound synthesis of elections and parliaments \u0096 of voters and activists choosing political agents, agents in turn choosing governments, and governments governing. Along the way we learn about voting rules, electoral systems, the ecology of government coalitions, precipitating events, and quite a lot about the empirical con- dition of electorates, parliaments, and legislatures in the advanced indus- trial democracies of the West. (The intensive treatment of an incredibly complex coalitional situation found in Israel over the last two decades is highly instructive.) I want to single out two especially imaginative treatments found in the later chapters of this volume \u0096 imaginative both theoretically and em- pirically. First, Scho\u0002eld provides one of the most elaborated theoreti- cally grounded typologies of coalitional arrangements in parliamentary democracies (in a literature rich in typologies based mainly, even exclu- sively, on empirical patterns alone) which, in turn, provides insights into the frequent absence of centripetal forces in multiparty regimes. Sec- ond, Scho\u0002eld elaborates an analysis of electoral activists that goes far- ther, and is founded on a more \u0002rm theoretical basis, than anything that presently exists in the literature. Taking a highly original turn, Scho\u0002eld applies the logic of Duverger to interest groups, suggesting how the elec- toral rule (plurality vs. proportional representation) will affect activist coalition building. Application to the building of electoral coalitions in Argentina and the United States is quite provocative. Each of these will be of separate interest to research communities. To-xi gether, however, they provide the underpinnings for a net assessment of the effects of the centripetal pull of the voting electorate and the centrifu- gal impact of activists. The reader may have to burn a lot of intellectual energy to get to these points, but getting there not only is half the fun but also makes strikingly evident that Scho\u0002eld's large theoretical buildup is not merely an occasion for play in the theory sandbox. Norman Scho\u0002eld has the soul of a mathematician and the heart of a political scientist. He has, over a long career but especially in the present volume, combined these two impulses elegantly. In one sense this book is a \u0002nished product. In another it is but the beginning of a conversation. Kenneth A. Shepsle Harvard University September 2007Preface William H. Riker's book, The Theory of Political Coalitions (1962) at- tempted to answer the question why plurality rule in the United States electoral system seemed to be the cause of both minimal winning coali- tions and the two-party system. His later book, Positive Political Theory (1973) with Peter Ordeshook, presented the theory on two-party elec- tions, suggesting that parties would be compelled to compete over the electoral center. In fact, there is no empirical evidence for such con- vergence either in the U.S. polity or in those European polities whose electoral systems are based on proportional representation. This volume is, in a sense, the fourth part of a tetralogy aimed at providing a theory why political convergence does not occur. The \u0002rst part of the tetralogy was the book, Multiparty Government (1990) with Michael Laver. The key idea of this book was to use the social choice notion of the core to explain the occurrence of minority governments in multiparty polities based on proportional representa- tion. Social choice theory suggests that a large and centrally located party could dominate politics, and possibly create a minority govern- ment. This possibility seemed to provide a reason why minimal winning coalition governments were not the norm in such multiparty systems. Although the idea of the core seemed very attractive, it could only be used to account for government formation in very speci\u0002c situations in the post-election period when party positions and seat strengths were determined. There was no theory to account for the nature of coalition government in the absence of a core. Secondly, no theory was provided of the pre-election choice of party positions and the electoral mechanism by which seats were allocated to the parties. The second volume on Multiparty Democracy (Scho\u0002eld and Sened, 2006) presented a formal theory of elections, together with empirical analyses of elections in Britain, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States. The key idea of that book was that elections involve judgements by the electorate of the quality, or valence of the candidates, xiiixiv Preface or party leaders. In elections with multiple parties, the theory suggests that low valence parties will be compelled to vacate the electoral center in order to garnish votes. Moreover, it is possible that parties can use the resources provided by activists to enhance the electoral perception of the party leaders. The third volume, Architects of Political Change (Scho\u0002eld, 2006a), addressed a number of the historical questions raised by Riker in his Lib- eralism against Populism (1982) and The Art of Manipulation (1986), using as a conceptual basis the formal electoral model presented in Mul- tiparty Democracy. The key idea was that if elections depend on elec- toral judgements, then the bases of these judgements may be transformed at the time of crucial social quandaries . The book considered a number of events in U.S. political history, including the decision to declare in- dependence in 1776, the choice over the rati\u0002cation of the Constitution in 1787, the elections of Jefferson in 1800 and of Lincoln in 1860, and \u0002nally the passing of civil rights legislation in 1964. The current volume is intended as an exposition \u0002rst of social choice theory, leading to the idea of the core and the heart . The notion of the heart is intended to apply to a committee, or legislature, when positions and strengths are known. It is a domain in the policy space, bounded by the compromise sets of various winning coalitions. The technical the- ory of social choice is presented in Chapters 2 to 5 of this book, and the application of the theory to multiparty coalitions is given in Chap- ter 6. To account for the positioning and power of parties, Chapter 7 presents a general model of elections, using the idea of activist support. It is suggested that the heterogeneity of activist groups in polities based on proportional representation accounts for the great variety of political con\u0002gurations in these polities. Chapter 8 applies this theory to show that it can lead to a signi\u0002cant transformation of the winning party position, particularly in a polity whose electoral system is based on plurality rule. Finally, the theory is applied in Chapter 9 to recent elections in the United States. It is argued that party positions are based on both eco- nomic and social dimensions, and that the changing power of activist coalitions in this two-dimensional domain has brought about a certain confusion of policy goals within the two-party structure of the United States. Chapter 10 draws together the various threads of the book, by quotingxv from Madison's dual theory of the Republic. On the one hand, Madison saw the President as a a natural way to prevent mutability or disorder in the legislature, while the ability of Congress to veto presidential risk- taking could prevent autocracy. At the same time, the election of the president would, in the extended republic, enhance the \u0093probability of a \u0002t choice.\u0094 Madison's argument is interpreted in the light of the model of elections presented in the previous chapters.

Norman Scho\u0002eld Washington University Saint Louis, Missouri 4 November 2007Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Representative Democracy A fundamental question that may be asked about a political, economic or social system is whether it is responsive to the wishes or opinions of the members of the society and, if so, whether it can aggregate the con\u0003icting notions of these individuals in a way which is somehow ra- tional. More particularly, is it the case, for the kind of con\u0002guration of preferences that one might expect, that the underlying decision process gives rise to a set of outcomes which is natural and stable, and more im- portantly, \u0093small\u0094 with respect to the set of all possible outcomes? If so, then it may be possible to develop a theoretical or \u0093causal\u0094 account of the relationship between the nature of the decision process, along with the pattern of preferences, and the behavior of the social and po- litical system. For example, microeconomic theory is concerned with the analysis of a method of preference aggregation through the market. Under certain conditions this results in a particular distribution of prices for commodities and labor, and thus income. The motivation for this en- deavor is to match the ability of some disciplines in natural science to develop causal models, tying initial conditions of the physical system to a small set of predicted outcomes. The theory of democracy is to a large extent based on the assumption that the initial conditions of the politi- cal system are causally related to the essential properties of the system. That is to say it is assumed that the interaction of cross-cutting interest groups in a democracy leads to an \u0093equilibrium\u0094 outcome that is nat- ural in the sense of balancing the divergent interests of the members of 12 Chapter 1. Introduction the society. One aspect of course of this theoretical assumption is that it provides a method of legitimating the consequences of political decision making. The present work directs attention to those conditions under which this assumption may be regarded as reasonable. For the purposes of analysis it is assumed that individuals may be represented in a formal fashion by preferences which are \u0093rational\u0094 in some sense. The political system in turn is represented by a social choice mechanism, such as, for example, a voting rule. The purpose is to determine whether such a formal political system is likely to exhibit an equilibrium. It turns out that a stable social equilibrium in a pure (or direct ) democracy is a rare phenomenon. This seems to suggest that if the political system is in fact in equilibrium, then it is due to the nature of the method of representation. As Madison argued in Federalist X , [I]t may be concluded that a pure democracy . . . can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction . . . . Hence it is that such democ- racies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security. . . and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths.. . . . A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect . . . [I]f the proportion of \u0002t characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a \u0002t choice.1 Social choice is a theory of direct or pure democracy which seeks to understand the connection between individual preferences, institutional rules and outcomes. The theory suggests that Madison's intuition was largely correct. In any direct democracy, if there is no great concentra- tion of power, in the form of an oligarchy or dictator, then decision mak- ing can be incoherent. Madison, in Federalist LXII ;commented on the \u0093mischievous effects of mutable government\u0094: It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if laws be so . . . incoherent that they 1James Madison, Federalist X (1787) in Rakove (1999: 164).1.1 Representative Democracy 3 cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is today can guess what it will be tomorrow2 The opposite of chaos is equilibrium, or rationality, what Madison called \u0093stability in government\u0094 in Federalist XXXVII: : Stability in government, is essential to national character, and to . . . that repose and con\u0002dence in the minds the people . . . An irregular and mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself, than it is odious to the people[.]3 This volume may be regarded as a contribution to the development of Madison's intuition. Chapters 2 to 5 present a self-contained exposition of social choice theory on the possibility of aggregating individual pref- erences into a social preference in a direct democracy. Chapter 6 consid- ers legislative bargaining in polities based on proportional representation, while Chapters 7 to 9 present a theory of elections\u0096the selection of the representatives in an indirect democracy, what Madison called a repub- lic.A brief concluding Chapter 10 attempts to relate social choice theory, the models of election and Madison's theory of the Republic in terms of the aggregation of preferences and beliefs. In a sense, Chapter 6 combines elements of social choice theory with the theory of elections that is to follow in the later chapters. It applies the theoretical notions developed in the early chapters to examine bargaining in a legislature. In particular, it assumes that the representatives have policy preferences, induced from the preferences of their constituents and the activists for the various parties. The party leaders must bargain among themselves in order to form a governing coalition, in the situation most common under proportional representation, that the election has led to a number of parties, none of which commands a majority. Social choice theory suggests that there are two fundamentally dif- ferent bargaining situations in such a multiparty legislature. The \u0002rst is where there is a large, centrally located party in the policy space. Such a party is located at what is known as the \u0093core.\u0094 No combination of other parties can agree to overturn the position of this \u0093core\u0094 party. Conse- 2James Madison, Federalist LXII (1787) in Federalist 196).4 Chapter 1. Introduction quently the \u0093core\u0094 party can, if it so chooses, form a minority govern- ment, one without a majority of the seats in the legislature. This property of the core provides an explanation for what has appeared to be a puz- zle. The data set collected by Laver and Scho\u0002eld (1990) dealing with coalition governments in 12 European countries in the period 1945\u00961987 shows that about one-third of the governments were minority. About one- third were minimal winning, with just enough seats for a majority, and the remaining third were surplus, with parties included in the coalition unnecessary for the majority. In the absence of a core, the spatial the- ory suggests that bargaining between the parties will focus on a domain in the policy space known as the \u0093heart.\u0094 In the simplest case where it is assumed that parties have \u0093Euclidean\u0094 preferences determined by policy distance, the \u0093heart\u0094 will be a domain bounded by the compromise sets of various minimal winning coalitions. These minimal winning coalitions are natural candidates for coalition government. Indeed, in some cases a bounding minimal winning coalition may costlessly include a surplus party. This notion of the heart suggests that in the absence of a core, one or other of these minimal winning or surplus coalitions will form. Chapter 6 illustrates the difference between a core and the heart by considering recent elections in Israel in the period 1988 to 2006 and in the Netherlands in 1977, 1981 and 2006. In Israel, the core party was Labor, under Rabin in 1992, and a new party, \u0093Kadima,\u0094 founded by Ariel Sharon in 2005, but under the leadership of Ehud Olmert. After the elections of 1988 and 2003 the bargaining domain of the heart was bounded by various coalitions, involving the larger parties, Labor and Likud, and smaller parties like Shas. These examples raise another theoretical problem: if party leaders are aware that by adopting a centrist position they can create minority, dom- inant government, then why are parties located so far from the electoral center? Chapter 6 illustrates the great variety of political con\u0002gurations in Europe: bipolar political systems, such as the Netherlands and Fin- land; left unipolar systems such as Denmark, Sweden and Norway; center unipolar systems such as Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland; right unipo- lar such as Iceland. Italy is unique in that it had a dominant center party, the Christian Democrats until 1994, after which the political system was totally transformed by the elimination of the core. Models of elections also suggest that the electoral center will be an at-1.1 Representative Democracy 5 tractor for political parties, since parties will calculate that they will gain most votes at the center.4Chapter 7 presents an electoral model where this centripetal tendency will only occur under speci\u0002c conditions. The model is based on the idea of valence , derived from voters' judgements about characteristics of the candidates, or party leaders. These valences or judgements are \u0002rst assumed to be independent of the policy choice of the party. The theory shows that parties will converge to the electoral cen- ter only if the valence differences between the parties are small, relative to the other parameters of the model. The empirical analysis considers elections in Israel in 1996, in Turkey in 1999 and 2002, in the Netherlands in 1977\u00961981 and in Britain in 1997. The results show that the estimated parameters of the model did not satisfy the necessary condition for convergence in Israel. The theory thus gives an explanation for the dispersion of political parties in Israel and Turkey along a principal electoral axis. However, the condition suf\u0002cient for convergence of the parties was satis\u0002ed in the British election of 1997, and in the Dutch elections of 1977\u00961981. Because there was no evidence of convergence in these elec- tions, the con\u0003ict between theory and evidence suggests that the stochas- tic electoral model be modi\u0002ed to provide a better explanation of party policy choice. The chapter goes on to consider a more general valence model based on activist support for the parties5. This activist valence model presupposes that party activists donate time and other resources to their party. Such resources allow a party to present itself more effectively to the electorate, thus increasing its valence. The main theorem of this chapter indicates how parties might balance the centrifugal tendency as- sociated with activist support, and the centripetal tendency generated by the attraction of the electoral center. One aspect of this theory is that it implies that party leaders will act as though they have policy preferences, since they must accommodate the demands of political activists to maintain support for future elections. A further feature is that party positions will be sensitive to the nature 4An extensive literature has developed in an attempt to explain why parties do not converge to the electoral center. See, for example, Adams (1999a,b, 2001); Adams and Merrill (1999a, 2005); Adams, Merrill and (2005); Merrill and Grofman (1999); Merrill and Adams (2001); Macdonald and Rabinowitz (1998). 5See Aldrich (1983a,b, 1995); Aldrich and McGinnis (1989).6 Chapter 1. Introduction of electoral judgements and to the willingness of activists to support the party. As these shift with time, then so will the positions of the parties. The theory thus gives an explanation of one of the features that comes from the discussion in Chapter 6: the general con\u0002guration of parties in each of the countries shifts slowly with time. In particular, under pro- portional representation, there is no strong impulse for parties to cohere into blocks. As a consequence, activist groups may come into existence relatively easily, and induce the creation of parties, leading to political fragmentation. Chapters 8 and 9 apply this activist electoral model to examine elec- tions under plurality rule. Chapter 8 considers presidential elections in Argentina in 1989 and 1995. In 1989, a populist leader on the left, Car- los Menem, was able to use a new dimension of policy (de\u0002ned in terms of the \u0002nancial structure of the economy) to gain new middle-class ac- tivist supporters, and win the election of 1995. Chapter 9 considers recent elections in the United States, and argues that there has been a slow re- alignment of the principal dimensions of political competition. Since the presidential contest between Johnson and Goldwater in 1964, the party positions have rotated (in a clockwise direction) in a space created by economic and social axes. In recent elections, the increasing importance of the social dimension, characterized by attitudes associated with civil and personal rights, have made policy making for political candidates very confusing. Aspects of policy making, such as stem cell research and immigration, are discussed at length to give some background to the nature of current politics in the United States. It is worth summarizing the results from the formal model and the empirical analyses presented in this volume. 1.The results on the formal spatial model, presented in Chapters 2 to 5, indicate that the occurence of a core, or unbeaten alternative, is very unlikely in a direct democracy using majority rule, when the dimen- sion of the policy is at least two. However, a social choice concept known as the heart, a generalization of the core, will exist, and con- verges to the core when the core is non-empty. A legislative body, made up of democratically elected representatives, can be modeled in social choice terms. Because party strengths will be disparate, a large, centrally located party may be located at a core position. Such a party, in a situation with no majority party, may be able to form a1.1 Representative Democracy 7 minority government. 2.A more typical situation is one with no core party. In such a case, the legislative heart can give an indication of the nature of bargaining between parties as they attempt to form a winning coalition govern- ment. This theory of legislative behavior takes as given the position and strengths of the parties. Because a centrally located party may dominate coalitional bargaining, and because such a party should be able to garner a large share of the vote, there would appear to be a strong centripetal tendency in all electoral systems. 3.Estimates of party positions suggest that parties adopt quite heteroge- nous positions. This suggests that there is a countervailing or cen- trifugal force that affects all parties. While core parties can be ob- served in some of the Scandinavian polities, in Israel, and in Italy, the dominance of such central parties can be destroyed particularly if there is a tendency to political fragmentation. 4.It is very unlikely that the heterogenous positions of the parties can be accounted for in terms of a stochastic model of elections based simply on exogenous valence alone. This stochastic model is rea- sonably competent to model elections in Israel, but does not account for party divergence in the Netherlands for example. Other work on Italy (Giannetti and Sened, 2004; Scho\u0002eld and Sened, 2006) came to the same conclusion. This suggests that party location can be bet- ter modeled as a balancing act between the centripetal electoral pull, and the centrifugal pull of activist groups. 5.Under proportional electoral methods , there need be no strong ten- dency forcing activist groups to coalesce, in order to concentrate their in\u0003uence. If activist groups respond to this impulse, then ac- tivist fragmentation will result in party fragmentation. Illustrations of party positions in Chapter 6 show that parties tend to be scattered throughout the policy space. Activist groups, linked to small parties, may aspire to political of\u0002ce. This is indicated by the observation that the bargaining domain in the legislature (the heart) often includes small parties. In some countries (such as Italy), a centrist core party can dominate the political landscape. To maintain dominance, such a party requires a high valence leader who can also maintain a \u0003ow of resources from a centrist activist group. By de\u0002nition, however, an8 Chapter 1. Introduction activist group will tend to be located at a policy extreme. Thus a core party may need the support of an activist group that is not concerned about policy per se, but about monetary rewards. Thus there may be a link between core dominance and corruption. This suggests the underlying reason for the collapse of core dominance in Italy. 6.Under plurality rule , small parties face the possibility of extinction. Unlike the situation in a polity based on proportional rule, an activist group linked to a small party in a plurality polity has little expectation of in\u0003uencing government policy. Thus activist groups face increas- ing returns to size. The activist model of elections presented in chap- ters 8 and 9 suggests that when there are two dimensions of policy, then there will tend to be at most four principal activist groups. The nature of the electoral contest generally forces these four principal activist groups to coalesce into at most two, as in the United States and the United Kingdom. 7.In the United States, plurality rule induces the two-party system, through this effect on activist groups. Although the two-party con- \u0002guration may be in equilibrium at any time, the tension within the activist coalitions induces a slow rotation, and thus political realign- ment. Presidential candidates must balence the centripetal electoral effect against the centrifugal valence effect. It is plausible that, in general, the relative electoral effect is stronger under plurality than under proportional rule. On occasion in the United States, the con- \u0003ict within activist groups is so pronounced that the two-party system breaks down. Such a collapse of the activist cohesion may herald a major realignment, induced by the creation of a new policy dimen- sion, such as civil rights. The fundamental theory presented in this book in Chapters 2 to 5 con- cerns the application of social choice theory to modeling political choice in direct and representative democracy. This theory is quite technical, and to provide a guide, the following section provides a brief overview of the theory. 1.2 The Theory of Social Choice Each individual iin a society N=f1;:::;n gis characterized by a \u0093ra-1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 9 tional\u0094 preference relation pi. The society is represented by a pro\u0002le of preference relations, p= (pi;:::;p n);one for each individual. Let the set of possible alternatives be W=fx;y;::: g. If personiprefersxtoy then write (x;y)2pi, or more commonly xpiy. The social mechanism orpreference function ,\u001b, translates any pro\u0002le pinto a preference rela- tion\u001b(p). The point of the theory is to examine conditions on \u001bwhich are suf\u0002cient to ensure that whatever \u0093rationality properties\u0094 are held by the individual preferences, then these same properties are held by \u001b(p). Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (1951) essentially showed that if the ra- tionality property under consideration is that preference be a weak order then\u001bmust be dictatorial. To see what this means, let Ribe the weak preference for iinduced from pi. That is to say xRiyif and only if it is not the case that ypix:Thenpiis called a weak order if and only i.e., ifxRiyandyRizfor that if \u001b(p)is a weak order whenever every individual has a weak order preference then there must be some dictatorial individual i, say, who is characterized by the ability to enforce every social choice. It was noted some time afterwards that the result was not true if the conditions of the theorem were weakened. For example, the requirement that\u001b(p)be a weak order means that \u0093social indifference\u0094 must be tran- sitive. If it is only required that strict social preference be transitive, then there can indeed be a non-dictatorial social preference mechanism with this weaker rationality property (Sen, 1970). To see this, suppose \u001bis de\u0002ned by the strong Pareto rule :x\u001b(p)yif and only if there is no in- dividual who prefers ytoxbut there is some individual who prefers x toy. It is evident that \u001bis non-dictatorial. Moreover if each piis transi- tive then so is \u001b(p). However,\u001b(p)cannot be a weak order. To illustrate this, suppose that the society consists of two individuals f1;2gwho have preferences 1 2 x y z x y z This means xp1zp1yetc. Since f1;2gdisagree on the choice between xandyand also on the choice between yandzbothx;yandy;zmust be10 Chapter 1. Introduction socially indifferent. But then if \u001b(p)is to be a weak order, it must be the case thatxandzare indifferent. However, f1;2gagree thatxis superior toz, and by the de\u0002nition of the strong Pareto rule, xmust be chosen overz. This of course contradicts transitivity of social indifference. A second criticism due to Fishburn (1970) was that the theorem was not valid in the case that the society was in\u0002nite. Indeed since democ- racy often involves the aggregation of preferences of many millions of voters the conclusion could be drawn that the theorem was more or less irrelevant. However, three papers by Gibbard (1969), Hanssen (1976) and Kir- man and Sondermann (1972) showed that the result on the existence of a dictator was quite robust. The \u0002rst three sections of Chapter 2 essentially parallel the proof by Kirman and Sondermann. The key notion here is that of a decisive coalition : a coalition Mis decisive for a social choice function,\u001b;if and only if xpiyfor allibelonging to Mfor the of decisive coalitions de\u0002ned by \u001b:Suppose now that there is some coalition, perhaps the whole society N, which is decisive. If \u001bpreserves transitivity (i.e., \u001b(p)is transitive) then the intersection of any two decisive coalitions must itself be deci- sive. The intersection of all decisive coalitions must then be decisive: this smallest decisive coalition is called an oligarchy . The oligarchy may indeed consist of more than one individual. If it comprises the whole so- ciety then the rule is none other than the Pareto rule. However, in this case every individual has a veto. A standard objection to such a rule is that the set of chosen alternatives may be very large, so that the rule is effectively indeterminate. Suppose the further requirement is imposed that \u001b(p)al- ways be a weak order. In this case it can be shown that for any coalition, M;eitherMitself or its complement NnMmust be decisive. Take any decisive coalition A, and consider a proper subset Bsay ofA. IfBis not decisive then NnBis, and soA\\(NnB)=AnBis decisive. In other words every decisive coalition contains a strictly smaller decisive coali- tion. Clearly, if the society is \u0002nite then some individual is the smallest decisive coalition, and consequently is a dictator. Even in the case when Nis in\u0002nite, there will be a smallest \u0093invisible\u0094 dictator. It turns out, therefore, that reasonable and relatively weak rationality properties on \u001b impose certain restrictions on the class D\u001bof decisive coalitions. These restrictions on D\u001bdo not seem to be similar to the characteristics that po-1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 11 litical systems display. As a consequence these \u0002rst attempts by Sen and Fishburn and others to avoid the Arrow Impossibility Theorem appear to have little force. A second avenue of escape is to weaken the requirement that \u001b(p) always be transitive. For example a more appropriate mechanism might be to make a choice from Wof all those unbeaten alternatives. Then an alternativexis chosen if and only if there is no other alternative ysuch thaty\u001b(p)x. The set of unbeaten alternatives is also called the core for \u001b(p);and is de\u0002ned by Core (\u001b;p) =fx2W:y\u001b(p)xfor noy2Wg: In the case that Wis \u0002nite the existence of a core is essentially equivalent to the requirement that \u001b(p)beacyclic (Sen, 1970). Here a preference, p, is called acyclic if and only if whenever there is a chain of preferences x0px1px2p\u0001\u0001\u0001pxr then it is not the case that xrpx0. However, acyclicity of \u001balso imposes a restriction on thecollegium\u0014(D\u001b)for the family D\u001bof decisive coalitions of \u001bto be the intersection (possibly empty) of all the decisive coalitions. If the collegium is empty then it is always possible to construct a \u0093rational\u0094 pro\u0002lepsuch that\u001b(p)is cyclic (Brown, 1973). Therefore, a necessary condition \u001bto be acyclic is that \u001bexhibit a non-empty collegium. We say\u001biscollegial in this case. Obviously, if the collegium is large then the rule is indeterminate, whereas if the collegium is small the rule is almost dictatorial. A third possibility is that the preferences of the members of the society are restricted in some way, so that a natural social choice function, such as majority rule, will be \u0093well behaved.\u0094 For example, suppose that the set of alternatives is a closed subset of a single dimensional \u0093left\u0096right\u0094 continuum. Suppose further that each individual ihasconvex preference onW, with a most preferred point (or bliss point) xi, say.6Then a well- known result by Black (1958) asserts that the core for majority rule is 6Convexity of the preference pjust means that for any ythe set { x:xpy} is convex. A natural preference to use is Euclidean preference de\u0002ned by xpiyif and only if jjx\u0000xijj<jjy\u0000xijj, xi, and norm jj\u0000jj onW. Clearly Euclidean preference is convex.12 Chapter 1. Introduction the median most preferred point. On the other hand, if preferences are not convex, then as Kramer and Klevorick (1974) demonstrated, the so- cial preference relation \u001b(p)can be cyclic, and thus have an empty core. However, it was also shown that there would be a local core in the one- dimensional case. Here a point is in the local core, LCore (\u001b;p), if there is some neighborhood of the point which contains no socially preferred points. The idea of preference restrictions suf\u0002cient to guarantee the existence of a majority rule core was developed further in a series of papers by Sen (1966), Inada (1969) and Sen and Pattanaik (1969). However, it became clear, at least in the case when Whad a geometric form, that these preference restrictions were essentially only applicable when W was one-dimensional. To see this suppose that there exists a set of three alternatives X= fx;y;zginW, and three individuals f1;2;3ginNwhose preferences on Xare: 1 2 3 x y z y z x z x y The existence of such a Condorcet cycle is in contradiction to all the preference restrictions. If a pro\u0002le ponW, containing such a Condorcet cycle, can be found then there is no guarantee that \u001b(p)will be acyclic or exhibit a non-empty core. Kramer (1973a) demonstrated that if W were two-dimensional then it was always possible to construct convex preferences on Wsuch thatpcontained a Condorcet cycle. Kramer's result, while casting doubt on the likely existence of the core, did not, however, prove that it was certain to be empty. On the other hand, an earlier result by Plott (1967) did show that when the Wwas a subset of Euclidean space, and preference convex and smooth, then, for a point to be the majority rule core, the individual bliss points had to be symmet- rically distributed about the core. These Plott symmetry conditions are suf\u0002cient for existence of a core when nis either odd or even, but are nec- essary when nis odd. The \u0093fragility\u0094 of these conditions suggested that a majority rule core was unlikely in some sense in high enough dimension (McKelvey and Wendell, 1976). It turns out that these symmetry condi-1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 13 tions are indeed fragile in the sense of being \u0093non-generic\u0094 or atypical. An article by Tullock (1967) at about this time argued that even though a majority rule core would be unlikely to exist in two dimensions, nonethe- less it would be the case that cycles, if they occurred, would be con- strained to a central domain in the Pareto set (i.e., within the set of points unbeaten under the Pareto rule). By 1973, therefore, it was clear that there were dif\u0002culties over the likely existence of a majority rule core in a geometric setting. However, it was not evident how existence depended on the number of dimensions. The results by McKelvey and Scho\u0002eld (1987) and Saari (1997) dis- cussed in Chapter 5 indicate how the behavior of a general social choice rule is dependent on the dimensionality of the space of alternatives. 1.2.1 Restrictions on the Set of Alternatives One possible way of indirectly restricting preferences is to assume that the set of alternatives, W, is of \u0002nite cardinality, r, say. As Brown (1973) showed, when the social preference function \u001bis not collegial then it is always possible to construct an acyclic pro\u0002le such that \u001b(p)is in fact cyclic. However, as Ferejohn and Grether (1974) proved, to be able to construct such a pro\u0002le it is necessary that Whave a suf\u0002cient cardinality. These results are easier to present in the case of a voting rule\u001b. Such a rule,\u001b, is determined completely by its decisive coalitions, D\u001b. That is to say: x\u001b(p)yif and only if xpiyfor everyi2M, for someM2D\u001b: An example of a voting rule is a q-rule;written\u001bq;and the decisive coalitions for \u001bqare de\u0002ned to be an empty \u001b(p)was acyclic.14 Chapter 1. Introduction Conversely, if q\u0014\u0012r\u00001 r\u0013 n then such a pro\u0002le could certainly be constructed. Another way of ex- pressing this is that a q-rule\u001bis acyclic for all acyclic pro\u0002les if and only if jWj<n n\u0000q: Note that we assume that q<n . Nakamura (1979) later proved that this result could be generalized to the case of an arbitrary social preference function. The result depends on the notion of a Nakamura number v(\u001b)for\u001b. Given a non-collegial family Dof coalitions, a member MofDisminimal decisive if and only ifMbelongs to D, but for no member iofMdoesMnfigbelong to D. IfD0is a subfamily of Dconsisting of minimal decisive coalitions, and D0has an empty collegium then call D0aNakamura subfamily ofD. Now consider the collection of all Nakamura subfamilies of D. SinceNis \u0002nite these subfamilies can be ranked by their cardinality. De\u0002nev(D)to be the cardinality of the smallest Nakamura minimal non-collegial subfamily . When\u001bis a social preference function with decisive family D\u001bde\u0002ne the Nakamura number v(\u001b)of\u001bto be equal to v(D\u001b). More formally v(\u001b) = min fjD0j:D0\u001aDand\u0014(D0) = \bg: In case that \u001bis collegial then de\u0002ne v(\u001b) =v(D\u001b) =1(in\u0002nity): Nakamura showed \u001b;ifWis \u0002nite, with jWj< v(\u001b);then\u001b(p)must be acyclic whenever pis an acyclic pro\u0002le. On the other hand, if \u001bis a social preference function and jWj \u0015v(\u001b)then it is always possible to construct an acyclic pro\u0002le on Wsuch that\u001b(p)is cyclic. Thus suf- \u0002cient for\u001bto be acyclic is that jWj<v(\u001b). To Ferejohn\u0096 Grether's result for a q-rule, de\u0002ne v(n;q)to be the largest integer such that v(n;q)<q n\u0000q:1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 15 It is an easy matter to show that when \u001bqis aq-rule then v(\u001bq)= 2 +v(n;q): be jWj<1 n\u0000q which is the same as jWj<v(\u001bq): Thus Nakamura's result is a generalization of the earlier result on q-rules. The interest in this analysis is that Greenberg (1979) showed that a core would exist for a q-rule as long as preferences were convex and the choice space, W, was of restricted dimension. More precisely suppose thatWis a compact,7convex subset of Euclidean space of dimension w, and suppose each individual preference is continuous8and convex. Ifq > (w w+1)nthen the core of and if q\u0014 (w w+1)nthen a convex pro\u0002le can be constructed such that the core is empty. From a result by Walker (1977) the second result also implies, for the constructed pro\u0002le p;that\u001b(p)is cyclic. Rewriting Greenberg's inequality it can be seen that the necessary and suf\u0002cient dimensionality condition (given convexity and compactness) for the existence of a core and the non-existence of cycles for a q-rule,\u001bq, is that dim(W)\u0014v(n;q) where dim(W) =wis the dimension of W. Since v(\u001bq)= 2 +v(n;q): wherev(\u001bq)is the Nakamura number of the q-rule, this suggests that for an arbitrary non-collegial voting rule \u001bthere is a stability dimension , namelyv\u0003(\u001b) =v(\u001b)\u00002, such that dim(W)\u0014v\u0003(\u001b)is a necessary and suf\u0002cient condition for the existence of a core and the non-existence of 7Compactness just means the set is closed and bounded. 8The continuity of the preference, p;that is required is that for each x2W;the set p\u00001{y2W:xpy} is open in the topology on W:16 Chapter 1. Introduction cycles. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this volume prove this result and present a number of further applications. An important procedure in this proof is the construction of a represen- tation for an arbitrary social preference function. LetD=fM1;:::;M vgbe a minimal non-collegial subfamily Moreover, each of the vfaces of this simplex can be identi\u0002ed with one of the v coalitions in D. Each proper subfamily Dt=f::;M t\u00001;Mt+1;::ghas a non-empty collegium, \u0014(Dt), and each of these can be identi\u0002ed with one of the vertices of \u0001. To eachi2\u0014(Dt)we can assign a preference x1x2xv x2x3x1 : : : : : : : : xvx1::: x v\u00001: From this construction it follows that x1\u001b(p)x2\u0001\u0001\u0001\u001b(p)xv\u001b(p)x1: Thus whenever Whas cardinality at least v, then it is possible to construct a pro\u0002lepsuch that\u001b(p)has a permutation cycle of this kind. This representation theorem is used in Chapter 4 to prove Nakamura's result and to extend Greenberg's Theorem to the case of an arbitrary rule. The principal technique underlying Greenberg's Theorem is an impor- tant result due to Fan (1961). Suppose that Wis a compact convex subset ofRw, and suppose Pis a correspondence from Winto itself which is convex and continuous.9Then there exists an \u0093equilibrium\u0094 point xinW such thatP(x)is empty. In the case under question if each individual preference,pi, is continuous, then so is the preference correspondence P associated with \u001b(p). Moreover, if Wis a subset of Euclidean space with 9Again, continuity of the preference correspondence, P;means that for each x2W; the set P\u00001(x) =fy2W:x2P(y)gis open in the topology on W:1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 17 dimension no greater than v(\u001b)\u00002, then using Caratheodory's Theorem it can be shown that Pis also convex. Then by Fan's Theorem, Pmust have an equilibrium in W. Such an equilibrium is identical to the core, Core (\u001b;p). On the other hand, suppose that dim(W) rep- resentation vgbe the of \u0001. :t= 1;:::;v gbe Each player with the vertex ytand is assigned a \u0093Euclidean\u0094 preference of the formxpizif and only if jjx\u0000yijj<jjz\u0000yijj. In a manner similar to the situation with W\u0002nite, it is then possible to show, with the pro- \u0002lepso constructed, that for every point zinWthere existsxinWsuch thatx\u001b(p)z. Thus the core for \u001b(p)is empty and \u001b(p)must be cyclic. In the case that Wis compact and convex, and preference is continuous and convex, then a necessary and suf\u0002cient condition for the existence of the core, and non-existence of cycles is that dim(W)\u0014v\u0003(\u001b);where v\u0003(\u001b) =v(\u001b)\u00002is called the stability dimension . This inde- pendently obtained by Scho\u0002eld (1984a,b) and Strnad (1985). This result on the Nakamura number is extended by showing that even with non-convex preference, a \u0093critical\u0094 core called \u0002(\u001b;p), which con- tains the local core ,LCore (\u001b;p), will exist as long as dim(W)\u0014v\u0003(\u001b). It is an easy matter to show that for majority rule v\u0003(\u001b)\u00151, and so this gives an analog of the Kramer\u0096Klevorick (1974) Theorem. Chapter 5 examines in more detail the case when dim(W)\u0015v\u0003(\u001b) + 1. The purpose here is essentially to extend Kramer's (1973a) result from the three-person case to that of an arbitrary voting rule. Given a pro\u0002le pon a topological space W, say a point xinWbelongs to the local cycle setLC(\u001b;p)for\u001b(p)if and only if, in every neighborhood Vof x, there exists a \u001b(p)cycle. In Theorem 5.1.2 it is essentially shown that the local cycle set contains the interior of the simplex \u0001associated with the Euclidean preference pro\u0002le constructed above. In effect dim(W)\u0015 v\u0003(\u001b) + 1 is a suf\u0002cient condition not only for the non-existence of the local coreLO(\u001b;p)but also for the non-emptiness of the local cycle set LC(\u001b;p). This result has an important bearing on manipulation of a choice func- tion,C;derived from a social preference function \u001b. Consider a choice C(W;p)fromWwhich is compatible with \u001bin some sense. The choice18 Chapter 1. Introduction is manipulable if the members of some coalition may lie about their pref- erences (and so change ptop0) so thatC(W;p0)is preferred by them to C(W;p). Maskin (1999) used the term \u0093implementable in Nash equi- libria of the underlying game form\u0094 for what I call \u0093non-manipulation.\u0094 Maskin has shown that if the choice is to be non-manipulable then it must bemonotonic . Monotonicity is ally6=xand alli, thenx2C(W;p)impliesx2 C(W;p0). For an arbitrary choice function, C, de\u0002nev(C)to be the same as the Nakamura number, v(\u001b);of the underlying social preference func- tion\u001b. The existence of local \u001b-cycles whenever dim(W)\u0015v(C)\u00001 implies that Ccannot be monotonic. This suggests that a non-collegial voting procedure cannot be implemented by an appropriate game form. For a general voting rule \u001b, ifdim(W)\u0014v(\u001b)\u00001thenLC(\u001b;p) may be non-empty, but it will be contained within the Pareto set. Since v(\u001b)\u00001 = 2 for majority rule in general, this supports Tullock's (1967) argument that voting cycles are not very important in two dimensions. However, in the case dim(W) =v(\u001b)then for the Euclidean preference pro\u0002le,p, constructed above, the local cycle set LC(\u001b;p)is open dense and path connected. This means essentially that there is a pro\u0002le ponW such that the set LC(\u001b;p)has the following property: for almost any two pointsx;yinW, there exists a voting trajectory between xandywhich is contained in LC(\u001b;p)such that successive manipulations by various coalitions can force the choice from xtoy. Thus, as the dimension of W increases from the stability dimension v\u0003(\u001b)tov\u0003(\u001b) + 2;the existence of the core can no longer be guaranteed, and instead cycles, and indeed open dense cycles can be created. 1.2.2 Structural Stability of the Core Although the \u001b-core cannot be guaranteed in dimension v\u0003(\u001b) + 1 or more, nonetheless it is possible for a core to exist in a \u0093structurally stable\u0094 fashion. We now assume that each preference pican be represented by a smooth utility function ui:W!R. As before, this means simply that xpiyif and only if ui(x)>u i(y):1.2 The Theory of Social Choice 19 A smooth pro\u0002le for the society Nis a differentiable function u= (u1;:::;u n):W!Rn: We assume in the following analysis that Wis compact, and let U(W)N be the space of all such pro\u0002les endowed with the Whitney C1-topology (Golubitsky and Guillemin, 1973; Hirsch, 1976). Essentially two pro\u0002les u1andu2are close in this topology if all values and the \u0002rst derivatives are close. Restricting attention to smooth utility pro\u0002les whose associated pref- erences are convex gives the space Ucon(W)N. We say that the core Core (\u001b;u)for a rule\u001bisstructurally stable (inUcon(W)N) ifCore (\u001b;u) thatCore (\u001b;u0)is non-empty for all u0inV. To illustrate, if Core (\u001b;u) is non-empty but not structurally unstable then an arbitrary small pertur- bation ofu;to a different but still convex smooth preference pro\u0002le, u0, is suf\u0002cient to destroy the core by rendering Core (\u001b;u0)empty. By the previous result if dim(W)\u0014v\u0003(\u001b)thenCore (\u001b;u)is non- empty for every smooth, convex pro\u0002le, and thus this dimension con- straint is suf\u0002cient for Core (\u001b;u)to be structurally stable. It had earlier been shown by Rubinstein (1979) that the set of contin- uous pro\u0002les such that the majority rule core is non-empty is in fact a nowhere dense set in a particular topology on pro\u0002les, independently of the dimension. However, the perturbation involved deformations induced by creating non-convexities in the preferred sets. Thus the construction did not deal with the question of structural stability in the topological spaceUcon(W)N. Chapter 5 continues with the result by McKelvey and Scho\u0002eld (1987) and Saari (1997) which indicates that, for any q-rule,\u001bq;there is an in- stability dimension, w(\u001bq). Ifdim(W)\u0015w(\u001bq)andWhas no boundary then the\u001bq-core will be empty for a dense set of pro\u0002les in Ucon(W)N. This immediately implies that the core cannot be structurally stable, so any suf\u0002ciently small perturbation in Ucon(W)Nwill destroy the core. The same result holds if Whas a non-empty boundary but dim(W)\u0015 w(\u001bq) + 1 . Theorem 5.1.1 shows that if a point belongs to the core of a voting game, de\u0002ned by a set, D, of decisive coalitions, then the direc- tion gradients must satisfy certain generalized symmetry conditions on the utility gradients of the voters at that point. This theorem is an exten-20 Chapter 1. Introduction sion of an earlier result by Plott (1967) for majority rule. The easiest case to examine is where the core, Core (\u001b;u);is charac- terized by the property that exactly one individual has a bliss point at the core. We denote this by BCore (\u001b;u). The Thom Transversality Theo- rem can then be used to show that BCore (\u001bq;u)is generically empty (in the spaceUcon(W)N), whenever the dimension exceeds 2q\u0000n+ 1. This suggests that the instability dimension satis\u0002es w(\u001bq) = 2q\u0000n+ 1. Saari (1997) extended this result in two directions, by showing that ifdim(W)\u00142q\u0000nthenBCore (\u001bq;u)could be structurally stable. Moreover, he was able to compute the instability dimension for the case of a non-bliss core, when no individual has a bliss point at the core. For example, with majority rule the instability dimension is two or three depending on whether nis odd or even. For nodd, neither bliss nor non-bliss cores can be structurally stable in two or more dimensions, since the Plott (1967) symmetry conditions cannot be generically satis- \u0002ed. On the other hand, when (n;q) = (4;3);the Nakamura number is four, and hence a core will exist in two dimensions. Indeed, both bliss cores and non-bliss cores can occur in a structurally stable fashion. How- ever, in three dimensions the cycle set is contained in, but \u0002lls the Pareto set. For all majority rules with n\u00156, and even, a structurally stable bliss-core can occur in two dimensions. However, when neven, in three dimensions the core cannot be structurally stable and the cycle set need not be constrained to the Pareto set (in contradiction to Tullock's hypoth- esis). For general weighted voting games, de\u0002ned by a non-collegial family, D, the core symmetry condition can be satis\u0002ed in a structurally stable fashion. This provides a technique for examining when a core exists in the legislatures discussed in Chapter 6. Since the core may be empty, the notion of the heart is presented as an alternative solution idea. The heart can be interpreted in terms of a local uncovering relation, and can be shown to be non-empty under fairly weak conditions. This idea is illustrated by considering various voting rules in low dimensions. The last section of Chapter 5 presents the experimental results obtained by Fiorina and Plott (1978), McKelvey, Ordeshook and Winer (1978), Laing and Olmstead (1978) and Eavey (1996) to indicate the nature of the heart in two dimensions.Chapter 2 Social Choice 2.1 Preference Relations Social choice is concerned with a fundamental question in political or economic theory: is there some process or rule for decision making which can give consistent social choices from individual preferences? In this framework denoted by Wis auniversal set of alternatives . Members of Wwill be written x;yetc. The society is denoted by N, and the individuals in the society are called 1;:::;i;:::;j;:::;n . The values of an individual iare represented by a preference relation pion the setW. Thusxpiyis taken to mean that individual iprefers alternative xto alternative y. It is also assumed that each piis strict, in the way to be described below. The rest of this section considers the abstract properties of a preference relation ponW: De\u0002nition 2.1.1. A strict preference relation ponWis (i)Irre\u0003exive : for nox2Wdoesxpx; (ii)Asymmetric : for anyx;y;2W;xpy)not(ypx). The strict preference relations are regarded as fundamental primitives in the discussion. No attempt is made to determine how individuals ar- rive at their preferences, nor is the problem considered how preferences might change with time. A preference relation pmay be represented by a utility function. De\u0002nition 2.1.2. A preference relation pisrepresentable by a utility function 2122 Chapter 2. Social Choice u:W!Rfor anyx;y2W;xpy,u(x)>u(y): The equiva- lence class of real valued functions which represents a given pis called anordinal utility function forp, and may be written up. Ifpcan be rep- resented by a continuous (or smooth) utility function, then we may call p continuous (or smooth). By some abuse of notation we shall write: up(x)>u p(y) to mean that for any u:W!Rwhich represents pit is the case that u(x)>u(y). We also write up(x) =up(y)when for any urepresenting p, it is the case that u(x) =u(y). From the primitive strict preference relation pde\u0002ne two new rela- tions known as indifference andweak preference For by: xI(p)yiffnot(xpy)and orxI(p)y: Note that since pis assumed irre\u0003exive, then I(p)must be re\u0003exive. From the de\u0002nition I(p)must also be symmetric, although R(p)need not2.1 Preference Relations 23 be. From the de\u0002nitions: xpy orxI(p)yorypx; so thatxR(p)y,not(ypx). Furthermore either xR(p)yoryR(p)xmust be true for any x;y2W, so thatR(p)isconnected . In terms of an ordinal utility function for p;it is the case that for any x;yinW: (i)xI(p)yiffup(x) =up(y) (ii)xR(p)yiffup(x)\u0015up(y): Ifpis representable by u, then from the natural orderings on the real line,R, it follows that pmust satisfy certain consistency properties. If u(x)>u(y) and u(y)>u(z) it follows that u(x)>u(z): Thus it must be the case that xpy andypz)xpz: This property of a preference relation is known as transitivity and may be seen as a desirable property for preference even when pitself is not representable by a utility function. The three consistency properties for preference that we shall use are the following. De\u0002nition then it is called . The class of strict preference relations on Wwill be written B(W). If p2B(W)and is moreover negatively transitive then it is called a weak order . The class of weak orders on Wis writtenO(W). In the same way ifpis a transitive strict preference relation then it is called a strict partial24 Chapter 2. Social Choice order , and the class of these is written T(W). Finally the class of acyclic strict preference relations on Wis writtenA(W). Ifp2O(W)then it follows from the zR(p)yandyR(p)xcontradicts the transitivity Hence not(xpz). Let the society be N=f1;:::;i;:::;n g:Apro\u0002le forNonWis an2.2 Social Preference Functions 25 assignment to each individual iinNof a strict preference relation pion W. Such ann-tuple (p1;:::;p n)will be written p. A subsetM\u001aNis called a coalition. The restriction of ptoMwill be allxpiyfor all for Ma coalition in NwritexpMywhenever xpiyfor alli2M. WriteB(W)Nfor the class of pro\u0002les on N. When there is no possi- bility of misunderstanding we shall simply write BNforB(W)N. On occasion the analysis concerns pro\u0002les each of whose component individual preferences are assumed to belong to some subset F(W)of B(W); for example F(W)might be taken to be O(W),T(W)orA(W). In this case write F(W)N, orFN, for the class of such pro\u0002les. LetXbe the class of all subsets of W. A member V2Xwill be called a feasible set . Suppose that p2B(W)Nis a pro\u0002le for NonW. For somex;y2W write \u0093pi(x;y)\u0094 for the preference expressed by ion the alternatives x;y under the pro\u0002le p. Thus \u0093pi(x;y)\u0094 will give pro\u0002les any more abbreviated form write fV =M=gV =M. Implicitly this implies con- sideration of a restriction operator V M:B(W)N!B(V)M:f!fV =M; whereB(V)Mmeans naturally enough the set of pro\u0002les for MonV. Asocial preference function is a method of aggregating preference information, and only preference information, on a feasible set in order to construct a social preference relation. De\u0002nition 2.2.1. Amethod of preference aggregation (MPA),\u001b, assigns to any feasible set V, and pro\u0002le pforNonWa strict social preference relation\u001b(V;p)2B(V). Such a method is written as \u001b:X\u0002BN!B.26 Chapter 2. Social Choice As before write \u001b(V;p)(x;y)forx;y2Vto mean \u0093the social preference relation aggregation \u001b:X\u0002BN!B is said to satisfy the weak axiom of independence of infeasible alterna- tives (II) iff fV=gV)\u001b(V;f) =\u001b(V;g): Such a method is called a social preference function (SF). Note that an SF,\u001b, is functionally dependent on the feasible set V. Thus there need be no speci\u0002c relationship between \u001b(V1;f)and\u001b(V2;f)forV2\u001aV1say. However, suppose \u001b(V1;f)is the preference relation induced by \u001b fromfonV1. LetV2\u001aV1, and let\u001b(V1;f)=V2be the de\u0002nition [\u001b(V1;f)=V2](x;y)] = [\u001b(V1;f)(x;y)] wheneverx;y2V2. A binary preference function is one which is consistent with this re- striction operator. De\u0002nition 2.2.3. A social preference function \u001bis said to satisfy the strong axiom of independence of infeasible alternatives (II\u0003) iff forf2 B(V1)N,g2B(V2)N, andfV=gVforV=V1\\V2non-empty, then \u001b(V1;f)=V=\u001b(V2;g)=V: For\u001b(V1;f)to be meaningful when \u001bis an SF, we only require that f be a pro\u0002le de\u0002ned on V1. This indicates that II\u0003is an extension property. For suppose f;gare de\u0002ned on V1;V2respectively, and agree on V. Then it is possible to \u0002nd a pro\u0002le pde\u0002ned onV1[V2, which agrees with then \u001b(V1[V2;p)=V1=\u001b(V1;f) \u001b(V1[V2;p)=V2=\u001b(V2;g) \u001b(V1[V2;p)=V1\\V2=\u001b(V1;f)=V=\u001bV2;g)=V:2.2 Preference Functions if V2\u001aV1andfis de\u0002ned on V1;letfV2be the restriction offtoV2. Then for a BF, \u001b(V2;fV2) =\u001b(V1;f)=V2: The attraction of this axiom is clear. It implies that one can piece to- gether the observed social preferences on various feasible sets to obtain a universal social preference on W. Moreover in the de\u0002nition we need only consider Vto be a pair of alternatives and construct the social preference \u001b(f)from the pairwise comparisons. It is for this reason that a SF satisfying II\u0003is called a bi- nary social preference function (BF). We may regard a BF as a function \u001b:BN!B. To illustrate the differences between an MPA, an SF and a BF, consider the following adaptation of an example due to Plott (1976). Example 2.2.1. Three individuals i;j;k seek to choose a candidate for a job from a short list V=fx;y;z;w g. For purposes of illustration take theuniversal set to beW=V[ fmg [ fjg [ fsg;whereM;J;S stand for Madison, Jefferson and J.S. Mill respectively. The preferences (f)of the individuals are: i j k Borda count m y z z : 16 J z w y : 15 x w x x : 14 y x y m :13 z m m w :12 s j j j : 10 w s s s : 4: (i)The Borda count is used on W: that is the most preferred candidate if each individual scores 7and the least preferred 1. OnW;z wins with 16, andyis second. Assume social preference on Vis induced by restriction from W. With the pro\u0002le f;we obtainz\u001by\u001bx\u001bw . Now change i's preferences to the following: xis preferred to y toMtoJtoztoStow. With this new pro\u0002le, g, the induced preference on Visy\u001bzI (\u001b)x\u001bw, wherezI(\u001b)xmeanszandxare28 Chapter 2. Social Choice socially indifferent. This decision rule is an MPA, because although \u001b(V;f)6=\u001b(V;g),fandgare not identical on W:Although the method uses restriction as required for a BF, it satis\u0002es neither II nor II\u0003. This can be seen since fV=gV yet \u001b(W;f )=V6=\u001b(W;g)=V: (ii)Alternatively suppose that on each subset Borda count is recomputed. Thus on V, an individual's best alternative scores 4 and the worst 1. The scores for (z;y;x;w )are now (9;8;7;6), so z\u001by\u001bx\u001bw . Clearly\u001bsatis\u0002es II and is an SF, since by de\u0002nition, if fandgagree onV, so must the scores on V. However, this method is not a BF, since this social preference cannot be induced by restriction from \u001b(W;g). More importantly, consider the restriction of the method to binary choice. For example on fx;yg,xscores 5andyonly 4sox\u001by. In- deed under this binary majority rule, z\u001bw\u001bx\u001by yety\u001bz, acyclic prefer- ence. Thus the social preference on Vcannot be constructed simply by pairwise comparisons. One method of social decision that is frequently recommended is to assign to each individual ia utility function ui, representing pi, and to de\u0002ne the social utility function by u\u001b(x) =X i2N\u0015iui(x);with all\u0015i\u00150: Social preference can be obtained from u\u001bin the obvious way by x\u001b(p)y,u\u001b(x)>u \u001b(y): See for example Harsanyi (1976), Rawls (1971) and Sen (1973). Unfor- tunately in the ordinal framework, each uiis only de\u0002ned up to an equiv- alence relation, and in this setting the above expression has no meaning, and so\u001b(p)is not well de\u0002ned. Such a procedure in general cannot be used then to de\u0002ne a social preference function. However, if each feasi- ble set is \u0002nite, then as the Borda count example shows we may de\u0002ne2.3 Arrowian Impossibility Theorems this gives a well-de\u0002ned SF, \u001b(V;p), it nonethe- less results in a certain inconsistency, since \u001b(V1;p1)and\u001b(V2;p2)may not agree on the intersection V1\\V2, even though p1andp2do. Although a BF avoids this dif\u0002culty, other inconsistencies are intro- duced by the strong independence axiom. 2.3 Arrowian Impossibility Theorems This section considers the question of the existence of a binary social preference function, \u001b:FN!F, whereFis some subset of B. In this notation\u001b:FN!Fmeans the following: LetVbe any feasible set in W, andF(V)Nthe set of pro\u0002les, de\u0002ned onV, each of whose component preferences belong to F. The domain of \u001bis the union of F(V)Nacross allVinW. That is for each f2F(V)N; we write\u001b(f)for the binary social preference on \u001b(f)2F(V). De\u0002nition 2.3.1.

ForN\u0002nite, there is no BWF. This theorem was originally obtained by Arrow (1951). To prove it we introduce the notion of a decisive coalition . De\u0002nition 2.3.2. LetMbe a coalition, and decisive under \u001bforxagainstyiff for allp2BN xpMy)x\u001b(p)y:30 Chapter 2.

(iii) LetD\u001b(x;y)be the family of decisive coalitions under \u001bforxagainst y, andD\u001bbe the family of decisive coalitions under \u001b. To prove the theorem we \u0002rst introduce the idea of an ultra\u0002lter. De\u0002nition 2.3.3. A family of coalitions can satisfy the proper- ties. (F1) monotonicity :A\u001aBandA2D)B2D; (F2) identity Nwhich (F3) a\u0002lter. A D1is said to be \u0002ner than a \u0002lter D2if member of D2 \u0002ner than D2and \u0002ner \u0002lter is called an ultra\u0002lter . A \u0002lter is called freeor\u0002xed depending on whether the intersection of all its members is empty or non-empty. In the case thatNis \u0002nite then by (F2) and (F3) any ultra\u0002lter, Sondermann, a BF and satis\u0002es the weak Pareto property (P), then the family of decisive coalitions, D\u001b;satis\u0002es (F1), F(2), F(3) and F(4). We follows Lemma 2.3.2 an ultra\u0002lter which de\u0002nes a unique dicta- tor. This can be shown by the following three lemmas. Lemma 2.3.3. LetDbe a family of subsets of N, satis\u0002es (F1), (F2), (F3) and (F4). Then if A2D, there is some proper subset BofA which belongs to D. Proof. LetBbe a proper subset of AwithB an ultra- \u0002lter. Proof. Suppose D1is a \u0002lter which is strictly \u0002ner than D. Then there is someA;B2D1, withA2DbutB =2D. By the previous lemma, eitherAnBorA\\Bmust belong AnB2D1. But since D1is a \u0002lter (AnB)\\B= \b must belong to D, which contradicts (F2). Hence A\\Bbelongs to D. But by (F1), B2D. Hence Dis an ultra\u0002lter. Lemma \\Aj=fig; where figis decisive and consists of a single member of N. Proof. Consider any Aj2D, and leti2Aj. number of times to obtain a singleton fig, say, belonging to D. Proof of Theorem 2.3.1. ForN\u0002nite, by the previous four lemmas, the family of\u001b-decisive coalitions forms an ultra\u0002lter. The intersection of all decisive coalitions is a single individual i, say. Since this intersection is \u0002nite,fig 2D\u001b. Thusiis adictator . Consequently any BF \u001b:ON!O which satis\u0002es (P) must be dictatorial. Hence there is no BWF. Note that when Nis in\u0002nite there can exist a BWF \u001b(Fishburn, 1970). However, its family of decisive coalitions still forms an ultra\u0002lter . See Schmitz (1977) and Armstrong (1980) for further discussion on the exis- tence of a BWF when Nis an in\u0002nite society. The rest of this section will prove Lemma 2.3.2.

Although there may ex- ist a BWF when Nis in\u0002nite, nonetheless \u0093power\u0094 is concentrated in the sense that there is an \u0093invisible dictator.\u0094 It can be argued that the require-2.4 Power and Rationality 35 ment of negative transitivity is too strong, since this property requires that indifference be transitive. Individual indifference may well display intransitivities, because of just perceptible differences, and so may social indifference. To illustrate the problem with transitivity of indifference, consider the binary social preference function, called the weak Pareto rulewritten\u001bnand de\u0002ned by: x\u001bn(p)yiffxpNy: In this case fNg=D\u001bn. This rule is a BF, satis\u0002es (P) by de\u0002nition, and is non-dictatorial. However, suppose the preferences are zpMxpMy ypN\u0000MzpN\u0000Mx for some proper subgroup MinN. Since there is not unanimous agree- ment, this implies xI(\u001bn)yI(\u001bn)z. If negative transitivity is required, then it must be the case that xI(\u001bn)z:YetzpNx;soz\u001b(p)x:Such an ex- ample suggests that the Impossibility Theorem is due to the excessive rationality requirement. For this reason Sen (1970) suggested weakening the rationality requirement. De\u0002nition 2.4.1. A BF\u001b:ON!Twhich satis\u0002es (P) and (ND) is called a binary decision function (BDF). Lemma 2.4.1. There exists a BDF.

While this seems to refute the relevance of the impossibility theorem, note that the only decisive coalition for \u001bnisfNg. Indeed the strong Pareto rule is somewhat indeterminate, since any individual can effec- tively veto a decision. Any attempt to make the rule more \u0093determinate\u0094 runs into the following problem. De\u0002nition 2.4.2. Anoligarchy\u0012\u001bfor a BF\u001bis a minimally decisive coalition which belongs to every decisive coalition. Lemma 2.4.3. (Gibbard, 1969).

The following lemma shows that members of an oligarchy can block social decisions that they oppose. Lemma 2.4.4. (Schwartz, 1986). If Rationality 37 Individuals in the oligarchy may thus block decisions in the sense implied by this lemma. From these results it is clear that BDF must concentrate power within some group in the society. If the oligarchy is large, as for\u001bn;then we may infer that decision-making costs would be high. If the oligarchy is small, then one would be inclined to reject the rule on normative grounds. Consider for a moment an economy where trades are permitted between actors. With unrestricted exchange any particular coalitionMis presumably decisive for certain advantageous trades. If we require the resulting social preference to be a BDF, then by Lemma 2.3.7, this coalition Mhas to be (globally) decisive. Consequently there must be some oligarchy. In a free exchange economy there is however no oligarchy, and so the social preference relation must violate either the fundamental independence axiom II\u0003, or the rationality condition. This would seem to be a major contradiction between social choice theory and economic equilibrium theory. Lemma 2.4.3 suggests that the rationality condition be weakened even further to acyclicity. It will be shown below that acyclicity of a BF is suf\u0002cient to de\u0002ne a well-behaved choice procedure. De\u0002nition 2.4.3. A BF\u001b:AN!Awhich satis\u0002ed (P) is a binary acyclic preference function (BAF). De\u0002nition 2.4.4.

To prove (F0), suppose there exists fMjgr j=1where each Mj2D\u001b0yet this family has empty intersection. Let V=fa1;:::;a rg be a collection of distinct alternatives.38 Chapter 2. Social Choice For each such a way that each piis acyclic.10By the extension property of II\u0003, an have non-empty intersection. Even acyclicity requires some concentration in power, though the exis- tence of a collegium is of course much less unattractive than the existence of an oligarchy or dictator. The next section turns to the question of the existence of choice pro- cedures associated with binary preference functions, and relates consis- tency properties of these procedures to rationality properties of the pref- erence functions. 2.5 Choice Functions Instead of seeking a preference function \u001bthat satis\u0002es certain rationality conditions, one may seek a procedure which \u0093selects\u0094 from a set Vsome subset ofV, in a way which is determined by the pro\u0002le.

Thus by de\u0002nition a choice function satis\u0002es the analogue of the weak independence axiom (II). Note that there has as yet been no requirement thatCsatisfy the analogue of the strong independence axiom. 10A later result, Lemma 3.2.6, shows that this can indeed be done, as long as ris of suf\u0002cient cardinality.2.5 Choice Functions 39 De\u0002nition 2.5.2.

If one seeks a choice function which satis\u0002es the strong consistency properties of WARP or EX, then choices must be made by binary com- parisons (BICH), and consequently the Arrowian Impossibility Theorems are relevant. If one seeks only IIP, then C\u001aC\u001bC;and again binary com- parisons must be made, so the Impossibility Theorems are once more relevant. The attraction of\u0003IIP is that it permits choice to be done by di- vision. Suppose a decision problem, V;is divided into components Vj; choice made from Vj;and then choice made from these. Then the resul- tant decision must be compatible with whatever choice would have been made fromV:\u0003II P would seem to be a minimal consistency property of a choice procedure. Unfortunately it requires the selection of cycles, no matter how large these are. The next chapter examines the occurrence of cycles for arbirary voting rules. Since cycles, and particular non-Paretian cycles, will occur under such rules, there is a contradiction between implementability (or path independence) and Pareto optimally for general voting processes.Chapter 3 Voting Rules 3.1 Simple Binary Preference Functions The previous chapter showed that for a binary preference function \u001bto satisfy certain rationality postulates it is necessary that the family of decisive coalitions obey various \u0002lter properties. A natural question is whether the previous restrictions on power, imposed by the \u0002lter prop- erties, are suf\u0002cient to ensure rationality. In general, however, this is not the case. To see this, for a given class of coalitions de\u0002ne a new BF as follows. De\u0002nition 3.1.1. LetNbe a \u0002xed set of individuals, and ofN:De\u0002ne the BF \u001bD:BN!Bby: x\u001bD(p)y, a given BF \u001b:BN!B;D\u001bis de\u0002ned to be its family of decisive coalitions. Consequently there are two transformations: \u001b!D\u001bandD\u001b!\u001bD\u001b: In terms of these transformations, the previous results may be written: Lemma 3.1.1. a pre\u0002lter then \u001bD:AN!Ais a BF and satis\u0002es (P). However, even though D\u001bsatis\u0002es one of the \u0002lter properties, \u001bneed not satisfy the appropriate rationality property. The problem is that the transformation \u001b!\u001bD\u001b is \u0093structure forgetting.\u0094 It is easy to see that for any x;y2W;p2BN; x\u001bD\u001b(p)y)x\u001b(p)y: Thus\u001bD\u001b\u001a\u001b:For this reason it may be the case that, for some x;y;p; we obtainx\u001b(p)ybut also not (x\u001bD\u001b(p)y):To see this consider the following example due to Ferejohn and Fishburn (1979). de\u0002nition that D\u001b=ff1g;f1;2ggis an ultra\u0002lter.

On the other hand, if\u001b1fails a rationality properly, such acyclicity, then so will \u001b2: From the above discussion, \u001bD\u001b\u0012\u001b:Indeed, in Example 3.1.1, \u001b is strictly \u0002ner than \u001bD\u001b;and is cyclic, even though \u001bD\u001bis acyclic. To induce rationality conditions on \u001bfrom properties of D\u001b0we can require \u001b=\u001bD\u001bby assuming certain additional on (v)simple iff\u001b=\u001bD\u001b. It readily follows that a simple rule is characterized by its decisive coalitions. Lemma 3.1.3. A BF\u001bissimple iff\u001bisdecisive;neutral andmonotonic: To distinguish between neutrality and decisiveness consider the fol- lowing example, adapted from Ferejohn and Fishburn (1979).

A simple BF is called a simple voting rule. To illustrate various kinds of simple voting rules consider the following. De\u0002nition 3.1.4. (i)A voting rule, \u001b;is called a simple weighted majority rule iff: (a)each individual iinNis assigned a real valued integer weight s(i)\u00150; (b)each coalition Mis assigned the weight s(M) a real valued integer Binary Preference Functions 49 D\u001biffs(M)\u0015q; (d)\u001b=\u001bD\u001b: (ii)A simple weighted majority (i);:::;s (n)]: Ifs(i) = called thesimpleq-majority rule , orq-rule, and denoted then the weak Pareto rule \u001bn: Note that\u001bqisanonymous as well as simple .

Obviously Cycle (\u001b;W;N;p )6= \b andCore (\u001b;W;N;p ) = \b: The argument obviously holds whenever jWj>v(\u001b);again by assigning indifference to alternatives outside Y: Note that Corollary 3.2.1 does not require that the voting rule be sim- ple, since the construction holds for the simple rule \u001bD. In the same way, the corollary also holds for a BF, \u001b;by applying the construction to \u001bD: Example 3.2.3. To illustrate the construction, consider the previous Ex- ample 3.2.2.

The demonstration in Lemma 3.2.6 of the existence of a \u001b-permutation preference pro\u0002le on an alternative set of cardinality v(\u001b)has a bearing on whether a choice mechanism can be manipulated. It is to this point that we now brie\u0003y turn. 3.3 Manipulation of Choice Functions The existence of a permutation preference pro\u0002le, of the kind constructed in the previous section, essentially means that a particular choice mecha- nismCcan be manipulated . The general idea is to suppose that the choice procedure is imple- mentable in the sense that the outcomes selected by the choice procedure result from the individuals in the society selecting preference relations to submit to the choice procedure. These preference relations need not be \u0093sincere\u0094 or truthful, but are in an appropriate sense optimal for the individuals in terms of their truthful preferences. An \u0093implementable\u0094 choice procedure will then be monotonic. However, the existence of a \u001b-permutation pro\u0002le means that any choice mechanism which is com-3.3 Manipulation of Choice Functions 63 patible with the voting rule, \u001b;cannot be monotonic and thus cannot be implementable. Full details can be found in Ferejohn, Grether and McK- elvey (1982). Here we simply outline the proof that the existence of a \u001b-permutation pro\u0002le means the choice mechanism is not monotonic. De\u0002nition 3.3.1. LetC:X\u0002BN!Xbe a choice function (where as beforeXis the set of all subsets of the universal set of alternatives): (i)The preference function,\u001b;onWiff whenever x2W;p2B(W)NandM2D\u001b satisfy the property: for everyi2M; there exists no yi2Wwithyipix thenfxg=C(W;p): (iii) Ifp2A(W)Nthen p0ofpbyM;withx0= C(W;p0)for somex06=x;wherex0pixfor alli2M: We now show that if a choice function is compatible with a social pref- erence function, \u001b;and there exists a \u001b-permutation preference pro\u0002le p onW;forjWj \u0015v(\u001b);thenpmay be manipulated by some coalition in D\u001b0in such a way that Ccannot be monotonic. Corollary 3.3.1. Let\u001bbe a non-collegial If jWj \u0015v(\u001b)thenCcannot be monotonic on W: We can demonstrate this Theorem by using Example 3.2.3. Example 3.3.1. SupposeCis a choice function compatible with \u001b;where64 Chapter 3. V oting Rules the decisive coalitions for \u001bare as given in the example. Let pbe the permutation pro\u0002le based on 1 2 y2y3y4y1 with y2p5y3p5y4I5y1: Ify42C(p;W y3andy4are identical in p andp0:Thus, ifCwere monotonic, we would obtain y42C(p;W ):This contradiction implies that Ccannot be both monotonic and \u001b-compatible. In identical fashion, whichever alternative is selected by the choice func- tion, one of the four decisive coalitions may manipulate pto its advan- tage. Corollary 3.3.2. IfjWj for no monotonic binary social preference func- tion,\u001b;such thatCis compatible with \u001b: Proof. For any non-collegial voting rule, \u001b;it is the case that v(\u001b)\u0014n: Thus ifW\u0015n;Corollary 3.3.1 applies to every choice function. Ferejohn, Grether and McKelvey (1982) essentially obtained a ver- sion of Corollary3.3.1 in the case that \u001bwas aq-rule withq=n\u00001:In this case they said that a choice function that was compatible with \u001bwas minimally democratic . They then showed that a minimally democratic choice function could be neither monotonic nor implementable.3.4 Restrictions on the Preferences of Society 65 As we know from Lemma 3.2.2, v(\u001b) = 3 for majority rule other than whenn= 4:Thus even with three alternatives, any choice func- tion which is majoritarian is effectively manipulable. In a later chapter we shall show that Lemma 3.2.6 can be extended to show the existence of a permutation preference pro\u0002le for a voting rule, \u001b;in dimension v(\u001b)\u00001:\u0093Spatial\u0094 voting rules will therefore be manipulable, in the sense described above, even in dimension v(\u001b)\u00001:In particular, majori- tarian rules will be manipulable in two dimensions. 3.4 Restrictions on the Preferences of Society The results of the previous section show that non-manipulability, of a non-collegial voting rule cannot be guaranteed without some restriction on the size,r;of the set of alternatives. It is, however, possible that while majority rule, for example, need not be \u0093rational\u0094 for general nandr;it is \u0093rational\u0094 for \u0093most\u0094 preference pro\u0002les. A number of authors have analyzed the probability of occurrence of voting cycles. Assume, for example, that each preference ranking on a set WwithjWj=ris equally likely. For given (n;r)it is possible to compute, for majority rule, the probability of (a)an unbeaten alternative; (b)a permutation preference pro\u0002le, and thus a voting cycle, containing allralternatives. Niemi and Weisberg (1968) shows that for large n;the probability of (a) declined from about 0.923 when r= 3;to 0.188 when r= 40: By a simulation method Bell (1978) showed that the probability of total breakdown (b) increased from 0.084 (at r= 3) to 0.352 (at r= 15) to 0.801 (atr= 60): Sen (1970) responded to the negative results of Niemi and Weisberg and others with the comment that the assumption of \u0093equi-probable\u0094 pref- erence orderings was somewhat untenable. The existence of classes in a society would surely restrict, in some complicated fashion, the variation in preferences. This assertion provides some motivation for studying re- strictions on the domain of a binary social preference function, \u001b;which are suf\u0002cient to guarantee the rationality of the rule. These so-called ex-66 Chapter 3. V oting Rules clusion principles are suf\u0002cient to guarantee the transitivity majority rule. De\u0002nition 3.4.1.

If the pro\u0002le psatis\u0002es value restriction or limited However, all exclusion principles on a pro\u0002le fail if there is a Con- dorcet cycle within the pro\u0002le. De\u0002nition 3.4.2.

It is obvious that if there is a Condorcet cycle in p;thenpcannot be single-peaked, and indeed pmust fail all the exclusion principles. On the other hand there may well be a Condorcet cycle in p;even though \u001bm(p); for example, is transitive. Chapter 4 will show, in two dimensions, that a Condorcet cycle typi- cally exists. The analysis is developed to demonstrate that \u001b-voting cy- cles typically exist in Rwas long as the dimension, w;is at leastv(\u001b)\u00001: This procedure clari\u0002es the relationship between the behavior of a vot- ing rule on a \u0002nite set of alternatives (the concern of this chapter) and the behavior of the rule on a policy space of particular dimension.Chapter 4 The Core In the previous chapter it was shown that a simple voting rule, \u001b;was acyclic on a \u0002nite set of alternatives, W;if if the cardinality jWjofWsatis\u0002ed jWj \u0014v(\u001b)\u00001:The same cardinality restriction was shown to be necessary and suf\u0002cient for the non-emptiness of the core. In this chapter an analogous result is obtained when the set of alter- natives,W, is a compact, convex subset of Rw.11With this assumption on the set of alternatives, W\u0012Rw;we shall show, for a simple voting rule,\u001b;that the core of \u001b(p);for any convex and continuous preference pro\u0002leponW;will be non-empty if and only if the dimension of Wis no greater than v(\u001b)\u00002:We say that v(\u001b)\u00002 =v\u0003(\u001b)is the stability dimension. Thus, if dim(W)\u0015v(\u001b)\u00001then a pro\u0002le can be con- structed so that the core is empty and the cycle set non-empty. Indeed, above the stability dimension v\u0003(\u001b);local cycles may occur, whereas below the stability dimension local cycles may not occur. In dimension v\u0003(\u001b) + 1;local cycles will be constrained to the Pareto set. In dimen- sion abovev\u0003(\u001b) + 1;these local cycles may extend beyond the Pareto set, suggesting a degree of chaos. 4.1 Existence of a Choice We \u0002rst show the suf\u0002ciency of the dimension restriction, by consider- ing the preference correspondence associated with \u001b(p): LetWbe the set of alternatives and, as before, let Xbe the set of 11In fact, the same result goes through when Wis a subset of a topological vector space.

We shall use lower demi-continuity of a preference correspondence to prove existence of a choice. In some cases, however, it is possible to make use of lower hemi-continuity. For completeness we brie\u0003y show that the former continuity property is stronger than the latter. Lemma 4.1.1. If a correspondence P:W\u0010Yis ldc then it is lhc. Proof.

IfWis a compact topological space and Pis an acyclic, preference correspondence on As Walker (1977) noted, when Wis compact and Pis ldc, then Pis acyclic iffPsatis\u0002es FMP on W;and so either property can be used to show existence of a choice. A second method of proof to show that CP is a choice function is to substitute a convexity property for Prather than acyclicity. First, remember that in De\u0002nition iffWis both compact and convex. (iv)A preference correspondence allx2W;P (v)A preference correspondence P:W\u0010Wissemi-convex iff, for all x2W;it is the case that x2Con(P(x)): Fan (1961) has shown that if Wis admissible and Pis ldc and semi- convex, then C(W;P )is non-empty. Theorem 4.1.1. (Fan, 1961). If Wis admissible and P:W\u0010W a preference correspondence on Wwhich is ldc and semi-convex then C(W;P )6= \b. A proof of this theorem in the more general case that Wis a com- pact, convex subset of Hausdorff topological vector space can be found Scho\u0002eld (2003a) using a lemma due to Knaster, Kuratowski and Mazurkiewicz (1929). There is a useful corollary to this theorem. Say a4.2 Existence of the Core in Low Dimension 73 preference correspondence on an admissible space Wsatis\u0002es the con- vex maximality property (CMP) iff for any thatP(x)\\Con(V) = convex maximality property. The form of Theorem 4.1.1, originally proved by Fan, made the as- sumption that P:W\u0010Wwasirre\u0003exive (in the sense that x2P(x) for nox2W) and convex . Together these two assumptions imply that P is semi-convex. Bergstrom (1975) extended Fan's original result to give the version presented above. A different proof of Theorem 4.1.1 using a \u0002xed-point argument has also been obtained by Yannelis and Prabhakar (1983). Note that Theorem 4.1.1 is valid without restriction on the dimension of W:Indeed, Alipran- tis and Brown (1983) have used this theorem in an economic context with an in\u0002nite number of commodities to show existence of a price equilib- rium. Bergstrom also showed that when Wis \u0002nite dimensional then Theorem 4.1.1 is valid when the continuity property on Pis weakened to lhc. Numerous applications of this theorem in the \u0002nite dimensional case to show existence of an equilibrium for an abstract economy with lhc preferences have been made by Shafer and Sonnenschein (1975) and Borglin and Keiding (1976). In the application that we shall make of this theorem we require the stronger property that the preference be ldc. Fi- nally, note that Theorem 4.1.1 shows that CPis a choice function, for every ldc and semi-convex preference correspondence P:W\u0010W;as long as the domain of CPis restricted to admissible subsets of W: 4.2 Existence of the Core in Low Dimension In the previous chapter we proved Nakamura's Theorem 3.2.3 for a sim- ple, non-collegial voting rule, \u001b;in the caseWwas \u0002nite, and showed that this generalized the Ferejohn\u0096Grether result for a q-rule,\u001bq:Green- berg (1979) has extended the Ferejohn\u0096Grether result to the case when W is admissible and individual preferences are continuous and convex, and shown that if dim(W)\u0014v(n;q);then theq-rule,\u001bq;has a non-empty74 Chapter 4. The Core core.12We shall obtain a generalization of Greenberg's result, by show- ing that if\u001bis a general non-collegial voting rule with Nakamura number, v(\u001b);then if dim(W)\u0014v(\u001b)\u00002;and certain continuity, convexity and compactness properties are satis\u0002ed then \u001bhas a core. To make use of Theorem 4.1.1, we need to show that when individual preference correspondences are ldc then so is social preference. Suppose, therefore, that p= (p1;:::;p n)is a preference pro\u0002le for society. Let \u001b be a voting rule, and Dbe the family of decisive coalitions of \u001b: LetP= (P1;:::;P decisive coalitions then clearly x2PD(y))x\u001b(p)y; whereas when \u001bis a voting rule, then x2PD(y),x\u001b(p)y: In this latter case we sometimes write P\u001bfor the preference correspon- dencePD;whereD=D\u001b:We have thaty\u001b(p)x: if\u001bis a of decisive coalitions, then Core (\u001b;W;N;p )\u0012C(W;P D): with equality in the of a rule. Theorem 4.2.1. (Scho\u0002eld, 1984a; Strnad, 1985). Let Wbe with Nakamura number v(\u001b):Ifdim(W)\u0014 12Here dim(W)can be identi\u0002ed with the number of linear independent vectors that spanW:Thus we can regard was the smallest integer such that W\u0012Rw:4.2 Existence of the Core in Low Dimension 75 v(\u001b)\u00002andp= (p1;:::;p n)is a preference pro\u0002le such that for each i2N;the preference correspondence Pi:W\u0010Wis ldc and semi- convex. Then Core (\u001b;W;N;p )6= \b: Note that the theorem is valid in the case \u001bis collegial, with Nakamura number 1:We prove this theorem using the Fan Theorem and the fol- lowing two lemmas. For convenience we say a pro\u0002le P= (P1;:::;P n) satis\u0002es a property, such as Pi;i2N; satis\u0002es the pro\u0002le PD:W\u0010Wis ldc, for any family Dof coalitions in N: Proof. We seek to show that set Ui\u001aWsuch that y2Ui\u001aP\u00001 i(x)for alli2M: LetU=T i2MUi. i(x); 8i2M:Hencex2Pi(z)8i2M;orx2PM(z);sox2PD(z):Thus U\u001aP\u00001 D(x)and is open, if P= (P1;:::;P n)is a lhc pro\u0002le on W then it is not necessarily the case that the preference correspondence PM:W\u0010Wis lhc. For this reason we require the stronger continuity property of lower demi-continuity rather than lower hemi-continuity. An easy example in Yannelis and Prabhakar, 1983, shows that an lhc prefer- ence correspondence need not be ldc, although, as Lemma 4.1.1 showed, an ldc correspondence must number v(D) =v, and dim (W)\u0014v\u00002;thenPD:W\u0010Wis semi-convex. Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that for some z2W;it is the case thatz2ConPD(z):By Caratheodory's Theorem (Nikaido, 1968) there exists x1;:::;x Note that the result \u0014(D\u001b)6= \b, then M2D\u001bimplies\u0014(D\u001b)\u0012Mso PM(x) =T of Lemma 4.2.3, P\u0014(D\u001b)will be semi-convex, and so there 4.2.1. As a further corollary, we obtain Green- berg's result. As a reminder, note that v(n;q) =h q n\u0000qi ;forq<n; is the largest integer strictly less than the bracketed term,q n\u0000q.4.2 Existence of the Core in Low Dimension 77 Corollary 4.2.1. (Greenberg, 1979). If \u001bis aq-rule result follows. Clearly Theorem 4.2.1 is the suf\u0002ciency part require- ment dim(W)\u0014v(\u001b)\u00002;together with lower demi-continuity and semi- convexity of preference. In parallel to the necessity part of Nakamura's Theorem, we shall now show that if dim(W)\u0015v(\u001b)\u00001then there exists a preference pro\u0002le, p;satisfying the continuity and convexity properties such that the core is empty. We shall also show that \u001b-voting cycles may always be constructed whenever the dimension is at least v(\u001b)\u00001: A natural preference to use is Euclidean preference de\u0002ned byxpiy if and only if jjx\u0000yijj<jjy\u0000yijj;for some bliss point, yi;inW, and norm jj \u0000 jj onW. Clearly Euclidean preference is convex. When preference is de\u0002ned in this way, we say that the pro\u0002le of correspon- dencesP= (P1;:::;P n)as p= (p1;:::;p n)Euclidean pro\u0002les.

Without loss But and (M;u ): The result follows. Euclidean pro\u0002les are extremely useful for constructing examples, since the core of the voting rule will be the intersection of a family of convex sets, each one of which is the convex hull of the bliss points of the members of one of the decisive coalitions. 4.3.1 Non-Convex Preference Theorem 4.2.1 shows that as long as Wis admissible with dim(W)\u0014 v(\u001b)\u00002;and preference is semi-convex and ldc then the core for \u001bis non-empty. Lemma 3.2.2 demonstrates, however, that for majority rule (except for the case (n;q) = (4;3)) the Nakamura number is three. Thus a majority rule core can generally only be guaranteed in one dimension. In one dimension if preferences are convex then the pro\u0002le is single- peaked (see De\u0002nition 3.4.1). Thus Theorem 4.2.1 may be thought of as an extension of those results which show that single-peakedness is suf- \u0002cient for certain rationality properties of majority rule, and thus for the existence of a majority rule core. See Sen (1966), Sen and Pattanaik (1969), Black (1958) and the discussion in Section 3.4. .In this section we brie\u0003y examine the consequence of dropping the4.3 Smooth Preference 85 Figure 4.1: Convex and non-convex preference86 Chapter 4.

In fact it is clear that the core, for the situation represented in Figure 4.1(ii) is empty. Figure 4.1 illustrates that, even when a majority rule core exists, for a convex pro\u0002le, on a one-dimensional admissible set of alternatives, there is a \u0093small\u0094 perturbation of the pro\u0002le suf\u0002cient to destroy this core.

We can illustrate the emptiness of the core, and the existence of cycles in dimension above v\u0003(\u001b)by the following example. Example 4.4.1. (Kramer, 1973a). To illustrate the necessity of the di- mension constraint, consider again the case with N=f1;2;3g;and D=ff1;2g;f1;3g;f2;3ggin two dimensions. That is to say, consider majority rule, \u001b;withv(\u001b) = 3 in dimension v(\u001b)\u00001:Because we are above the stability dimension, there may be no core. Let ube a Euclidean88 Chapter 4.

Indeed it should be clear that in any neighborhood V ofxit is possible to \u0002nd three points fa0;b0;c0gsuch that there is voting cycle a!b!c!a: Indeed,Core (D;u)is empty.

Indeed, we may infer that \u0002(D;u)is empty. The existence of the \u0093permutation\u0094 cycle in this example implies that all \u0093exclusion principles,\u0094 which are suf\u0002cient to guarantee rationality properties of majority rule, must fail on this pro\u0002le. We formalize this observation in the following subsection.4.4 Local Cycles 89 Figure 4.3: Non-convexity of the critical preference cones 4.4.1 Necessary and Suf\u0002cient Conditions The formal de\u0002nitions and proof of the existence of local cycles in dimen- sion abovev\u0003(\u001b)are adapted from Scho\u0002eld (1978).

Then for somey =2Pareto (N;u);it will be the case that the direction gradients are linearly independent. Obviously p\u001b(y) = \b:In general,Pareto (N;u) will be dense. Then LCycle (\u001b;u)will also be dense in W: The same argument can be carried out for a general voting rule, \u001b;in dimensionv(\u001b). This gives the following theorem. Theorem voting rule on W;with Nakamura its family of decisive a (\u001b;u) is open dense in W: We have shown in this chapter that (in the presence of compactness and convexity) if the dimension of the \u0093policy space\u0094 Wis no greater thatv(\u001b)\u00002then a core will exist, whereas if dim(W)\u0015v(\u001b)\u00001then a pro\u0002le can be constructed so that the core is empty and the cycle set non-empty. Indeed, above the stability dimension v\u0003(\u001b) =v(\u001b)\u00002;local cycles may occur, whereas below the stability dimension local cycles may not occur. In dimension v\u0003(\u001b) + 1 local cycles will be constrained to the Pareto set. By analogy with Corollary 3.3.2, for the \u0002nite case, we may infer that manipulation by coalitions can occur, but in dimension v\u0003(\u001b)+1 they cannot lead outside the Pareto set. This will not be true, however, in dimensionv\u0003(\u001b) + 2, since local cycles can \u0093wander\u0094 far from the Pareto set. However, there may be reasons to suppose that cycles will be re- strained to the Pareto set. By Theorem 4.2.2, Core (\u001b;u)=W0[LCycle convex preference is convex. This suggests that we de\u0002ne the choice function, called the heart, written94 Chapter 4. The Core H(\u001b;u);which (N;u)]]=W0: above results, this set will be non-empty when W0is compact, convex, and the smooth preferences are convex.

It immediately follows that a bliss core cannot be structurally stable in dimension greater than 2q\u0000n+ 1.5.1 Symmetry Conditions at the Core 105 Saari (1997) also showed that if dim(W)\u00142q\u0000nthen a structurally stable bliss core can occur. Similar results hold for structural stability of anon-bliss core, where pi(x) = 0 for no individual. Saari's result allows us to de\u0002ne the instability by w\u0003(\u001bm)\u0011w\u0003(Dm) = 2;whereas for neven,w\u0003(\u001bm)\u0011w\u0003(Dm) = 3:For all other q-rules, be 2q\u0000n+ 1 + max\u001a(4q\u00003n\u00001) 2(n\u0000q);0\u001b : Saari (1997) has shown that even the non-bliss core for a q-rule is generically empty in dimension at least w\u0003(\u001bq):These results can be fur- ther applied to the case of majority rule.

Plott (1967) obtained the following theorem, which can be obtained as a corollary of Theorem 5.1.1. Theorem 5.1.2. (Plott, 1967). Let Dmbe the family of decisive coalitions for majority rule.106 Chapter 5. The Heart (i)Ifp= (p1;:::;p n)2(Rw)nis a Plott equilibrium then it must be a Dm-equilibrium.

(iii) Ifnis and pis aDm-equilibrium with pi= 0 for noi2N; thenpis an even Plott equilibrium. To illustrate, suppose nis odd, and that L=fi2N:pi= 0gis empty. Then the empty set \bis clearly pivotal. But then pivotal sym- metry cannot be satis\u0002ed, and by Theorem 5.1.1, pcannot a Dm- equilibrium. Thus Lcannot be empty. This theorem effectively gives necessary conditions for a pro\u0002le of vectors to be a majority rule equilibrium in the case with nodd. Note, however, that if nis even and pi= 0 for somei2Nthenpmay be a majority rule equilibrium but not a Plott equilibrium. This relationship between the symmetry properties required for pto be a majority rule equi- librium and a Plott equilibrium permits an examination of the properties of the core for majority rule. Corollary 5.1.4. Let\u001bbe a majority rule, with W=Rw, andu2 de\u0002ned critical core.

(iv)Furthermore if u2U(W)Nsatis\u0002es the convexity property then Core (\u001b;u)may be substituted for \u0002(\u001b;u)in (i). Note that the Plott equilibrium condition on the direction gradients at a point is neither necessary nor suf\u0002cient for the point to belong to the ma- jority rule core. If preferences satisfy the convexity property then the5.1 Symmetry Conditions at the Core 107 Plott conditions are suf\u0002cient . Even in the presence of convexity, how- ever, the conditions are not necessary. For example, if nis even, with pi(x) = 0 for one individual, then xmay be a majority rule core point although p(x)is not a Plott equilibrium. For example, a pair of voters, M=fi;jgwill pivot, so the pivot condition 02pM\u0003(x)can be satis\u0002ed if there is a third voter k;say, such that 02Con[pi(x);pj(x);pk(x)]: Example 5.1.1. Consider the case where W=R2and each individual, i;has a Euclidean utility function with bliss point xi:First of be theq-rule with (n;q) = (4:3):From Lemma 3.2.2 we know that the Nakamura number is v(\u001b) = 4 and so the stability dimension v\u0003(\u001b) = v(\u001b)\u00002 = 2:By earlier results, Core (\u001b;u)will be non-empty. Figure 5.1(i) represents the situation where p(x) = (p1(x);p2(x);p3(x);p4(x)) is a Plott equilibrium, where pi(x) = for Corollary is satis\u0002ed at that point:The \u0002rst case is an example of a non-bliss core, and the second of a bliss core. By Saari's Theorem, both these cores are structurally stable. Example 5.1.2. Now let\u001bbe the majority q-rule with (n;q) the decisive coalitions :We know that v\u0003(\u001b) = 1 and so there is no guarantee that the core is non-empty in two dimensions. Figure 5.2(i) presents a Euclidean pro\u0002le, u;such that, at the equilibrium and x2Core (\u001b;u). Figure 5.2(ii) presents a perturbation (small in the of this pro\u0002le uto a new pro\u0002leu0;such thatCore (\u001b;u0)is empty. Thus the non-bliss core in Figure 5.2(i) is structurally unstable. In Figures 5.2(i) and (ii), the arcs between the bliss point pairs f3;6g;f1;4gandf2;5gare called median lines. On each such line there are two bliss points. Moreover, there are two further bliss points on either side of each of these lines, giving a majority of bliss points on both sides of these medians. Another way to express this condition, for example, is that the arc [3;6]is the intersection of the two Pareto sets Pareto (f3;4;5;6g;u)andPareto (f3;2;1;6g;u). The intersection of these median lines gives the core in Figure 5.2(i). In Figure 5.2(ii), these median lines do not intersect. Instead they bound a small triangle, which can readily be shown to be the local cycle set,108 Chapter 5. The Heart Figure 5.1: Euclidean preferences with the qrule given by (n;q) = (4;3)5.1 Symmetry Conditions at the Core 109 Figure 5.2: Euclidean preferences with the qrule given by (n;q) = (6;4)110 Chapter 5. The Heart Figure 5.3: Euclidean preferences with the qrule given by (n;q) = (5;3)5.1 Symmetry Conditions at the Core 111 LCycle (\u001b;u0):Thus, Figures 5.2(i) and 5.2(ii) illustrate the proposition derived in the previous chapter that the heart H(\u001b;u) =Core (\u001b;u)[[LCycle (\u001b;u)] is not empty. Now, consider the pro\u0002le urepresented by Figure 5.2(iii). It should be clear that pivotal symmetry is satis\u0002ed at the bliss point of player 6, and so the bliss core is non empty. However, the direction gradients at this point do not satisfy the Plott symmetry conditions. For a small perturbation, u0, of this pro\u0002le the core is still non-empty, so the bliss core is structurally stable, as is consistent with Saari's Theorem. In three dimensions, the bliss core cannot be structurally stable. Example 5.1.3. In the same way Figure 5.3(i) represents a Euclidean pro- \u0002le for theq-rule with (n;q) = (5;3):We can see that the bliss core at the bliss point of player 5 in the \u0002gure is structurally unstable. After a small perturbation, the bliss point of player 5 is not located at the intersection of the median lines. The perturbation gives Figure 5.3(ii), showing an empty core. The cycle set, LCycle (\u001b;u0);is non-empty and is the interior of the four pointed star, bounded by the median lines [1;5],[4;5],[2;5],[3;5]and [1;3], and shown shaded in the \u0002gure. We the heart by H(\u001b;u) =Core (\u001b;u)[[LCycle (\u001b;u)\\Pareto (N;u)]: We now give an alternative de\u0002nition that links it to another choice concept called the uncovered set.

In the application of these notions, the correspondence, Q;will be taken to be the correspondence PDde\u0002ned by some non-collegial fam- ily,D, of decisive coalitions, given by the simple voting rule, \u001b, at a smooth pro\u0002le u:In this case we write C\u0003(D,u)orC\u0003(\u001b,u)for the un- covered set. It can be shown that the heart de\u0002ned previously is identical to the heart as just de\u0002ned in terms of this correspondence (Scho\u0002eld, 1999b). Indeed, the heart can be de\u0002ned in terms of the decisive coali- tionsDand the pro\u0002le p[u]of direction gradients. From now on we shall write either H(D,u)orH(\u001b,u)for a simple voting rule, \u001b;with decisive coalitions, D. Under fairly general conditions, if the core, Core (D;u);is non-empty, then it is contained in both C\u0003(D;u)andH(D;u). It can also be shown that the heart, regarded as a correspondence HD\u0011 H (D;\u0000) : Ucon(W)N:\u0010Wis lower hemi-continuous (see u);soHD(u)is Figure 5.2(ii) illustrates, in any neighborhood VofxinW, there is a neighborhood YofuinUcon(W)N such that, at the pro\u0002le u02Y;thenHD(u0)\\V6= \b: 5.2 Examples of the Heart and Uncovered Set For the case (n;q) = (5;3);Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show the cycle set is bounded by the \u0002ve median lines. In Figure 5.4, for example, the heart is the symmetric pentagon generated by the \u0002ve bliss points. The yolk is the smallest circle that touches all the median lines, and is represented by the small inner circle. McKelvey (1986) showed that the uncovered5.2 Examples of the Heart and Uncovered Set 113 Figure 5.4: The heart, the yolk and the uncovered set set is contained within the ball of radius 4 times the yolk radius ( r), thus demonstrating that the size of the uncovered set is fairly constrained. This can be seen in Figure 5.4 where the uncovered set is the symmetric blunt pentagon lying inside the larger outer circle of radius 4 r:Figure 5.5 illus- trates the heart and the yolk (under majority rule) when there is a uniform distribution of the voter preferred points on the boundary of the triangle. The lines marked M1,M2,M3,M4are representative median lines. Fig- ure 5.6 shows the heart and yolk when there is a uniform distribution of voter bliss points on the pentagon. Obviously, as the voter distribution becomes symmetric, then the heart collapses to a core point. Both the heart and the uncovered set have been suggested as predictors in experimental games. Perhaps the main advantage of the heart is that it is easily computed, since it can be determined from the median lines of the political game. The next section considers the results of experiments from spatial voting games with no core.114 Chapter 5. The Heart Figure 5.5: The heart with a uniform electorate on the triangle Figure 5.6: The heart with a uniform electorate on the pentagon5.3 Experimental Results 115 5.3 Experimental Results Figures 5.7 through 5.12 present the experimental results obtained by var- ious authors for the q-rule with (n;q) = (5;3):In Figure 5.7 there is a core point at the bliss point of player 1. As the \u0002gure suggests, all exper- imental outcomes clustered near that point. The experiments in Figures 5.8 to 5.12 are more interesting, since the core is empty in all \u0002ve \u0002gures. Four of these experiments were designed to test an equilibrium notion called the competitive solution (McKelvey, Ordeshook solution in these \u0002gures is denoted CS. The cycle set, orheart as it is dubbed here, is again the pentagon generated by the voter bliss points. All observations in Figure 5.8 lie in this set. Figures 5.9 and 5.10 present the results of the experiment carried out by Laing and Olm- stead (1996). See also Laing and Slotznick (1987). Approximately 24 out of 30 of the data points lie in the heart. In Eavey's two experiments pre- sented in Figures 5.11 and 5.12 (Eavey, 1996), 15 out of 20 of the data points lie in the heart. We may say the \u0093success rate\u0094 of this notion is about 80 percent. These observations are only meant to suggest that the heart has some intrinsic merit.

More precisely, under the assumption that parties seek perquisites (such as portfolios, ministries), it is natural to suppose that minimal winning (MW) coalitions form. Here we change terminology from the previous chapters, and use the term minimal winning to mean a coalition that controls a majority of the seats, but may lose no party and still be winning. On the other hand, if policy is relevant, then an obvious notion is that of a minimal connected winning (MCW) coalition (Axel- rod, 1970; de Swaan, 1973). A MCW coalition is a group of parties that controls at least a majority of the seats, and also comprises parties that are adjacent to one another in the one-dimensional space. Much of the research on the characteristics of multiparty govern- ments in European democracies was based on the construction of ty- pologies designed to distinguish between different qualitative features of the various political systems (Duverger, 1954; Sartori, 1966; Rokkan, 1970). This research concentrated on an empirical relationship between the duration of multiparty coalition governments and the fragmenta- tion14of the polity (Taylor and Herman, 1971; Herman and Sanders, 14Fragmentation can be identi\u0002ed with the effective number of parties (Laakso and Taagepera, 1979). That is, let H(the Her\u0002ndahl index) be the sum of the squares of the relative seat shares and ns=H\u00001be the effective number . 119120 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition 1977; Warwick, 1979). For example, Table 6.1 (from Scho\u0002eld, 1995) lists the average duration of government in twelve European polities for the period 1945-1987 together with the average effective number in each polity. The relationship between effective number and duration is quite weak. Table 6.1.

One problem with these two notions was the occurrence of minority and surplus coalitions. (A minority coalition is a non-winning coalition, while a surplus coalition is supra-winning, able to lose a party and still be winning.) Herman and Pope (1973) had observed that minority coali- tions seemed to contradict the logic behind the MW notion. Table 6.2 presents data from Laver and Scho\u0002eld (1990) and Scho\u0002eld (1993) in- dicating that out of the 218 coalition governments in these 12 European countries in the period in question, over 70 were minority. Although 31 of these had some sort of implicit support, at least 40 were unsupported minorities. Moreover of the 46 surplus governments that formed, only nine were MCW.6.1 Empirical Analyses of Coalition Formation 121 Table 6.2.

(Con\u0003ict of in- terest is calculated in terms of inter-party policy differences on a one- dimensional scale.) His theory was that party systems with high frag- mentation, as indicated by Ns;would give rise to minority government when con\u0003ict of interest was high. Conversely with high fragmentation but low con\u0003ict of interest, surplus governments were expected. While this theory was attractive, it failed to explain why both minority and sur- plus governments were common in both Finland and Italy (Table 6.2). Table 6.3 shows average duration of government by coalition type. While there is some indication that MW coalitions are longer lived than minor- ity coalitions, it is not clear how exactly fragmentation, coalition type and duration are related. A fully-developed formal theory of coalition would connect the nature of the electoral system, the motivations of parties concerning policy and perquisites, and the process of government formation, in a way which makes sense of the empirical phenomena. A number of attempts have122 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition been made to model the motivations of parties in a game-theoretic frame- work. For example, one class of models is based on the Downsian frame- work, where parties compete via policy declarations to the electorate in order to maximize the number of seats they obtain (Shepsle, 1991). How- ever, since parties are assumed in these models to be indifferent to policy objectives, viewing policy solely as a means to gain power, symmetry would suggest that one equilibrium would be the situation where all par- ties declare the same position. Indeed, the next chapter considers such a model, and shows that there are necessary and suf\u0002cient conditions for convergence of this kind. Table 6.3.

There is generally no guarantee that the party gaining the most seats will be- come a member of the governing coalition. This chapter will use the idea of the core, developed in the previous chapter, to argue that a dominant party, located at the center of the policy space, can control the forma- tion of government. Instead of assuming that the \u0093political game\u0094 is a6.1 Empirical Analyses of Coalition Formation 123 constant sum or based on a one-dimensional policy space, we shall con- sider situations where the policy space may have two or more dimensions, and government results from bargaining between three or more parties. The political game is divided into two components. In the post-election phase, the \u0093positions\u0094 of the parties are assumed to be given, as is the distribution of seats. This distribution de\u0002nes a set of winning coali- tions. Given the set of winning coalitions, and party positions, we use the theory presented in Chapter 5 to examine the \u0093political heart.\u0094 Under some circumstances, the heart will consist of a single policy point, the \u0093core.\u0094 If the \u0093core\u0094 is stable under small perturbations in the positions of the parties then it is said to be \u0093structurally stable.\u0094 If a party's posi- tion is at the \u0093structurally stable core,\u0094 then we shall call this party the \u0093core party.\u0094 Under these circumstances, it is argued that the \u0093core party\u0094 may form a minority government. If the heart is not given by a point, then it will comprise a domain in the policy space, \u0093the cycle set.\u0094 Using the arguments presented in Chapter 5, we can infer that the \u0093cycle set\u0094 will be \u0093bounded\u0094 by the preferred positions of a particular set of parties. The bounding \u0093proto-coalitions\u0094 form the basis for coalitional bargain- ing. This model of the heart can then be used to describe, heuristically, the general pattern of coalition formation. The pre-election calculations of parties involve calculations over the relationship between party position, electoral response, and the effect that the resulting party positioning and parliamentary strength has on coali- tion bargaining. Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006) propose that these calcula- tions are based on beliefs by the political actors that can be represented by a \u0093selection\u0094 from the heart correspondence. More formally, let party positions be given by the vector, z;and suppose, for convenience, that the parties have Euclidean preferences derived from this vector of bliss points. Let D(z)be the set of winning or decisive coalitions that occur af- ter the election, as a result of the declarations of the vector, z;of positions. Since preferences and decisive coalitions are now speci\u0002ed, we can use the symbol, H(D(z);z);to denote the \u0093post election heart.\u0094 Then beliefs of the political agents can be represented by a mapping g:Wn!W, where the selection g(z)is a lottery with support, H(D(z);z)inW:This lottery,g(z);in the space, W, of all lotteries in W;speci\u0002es what party leaders expect to occur as a result of the choice of a vector z2Wnof party positions, and the outcome, D(z). This generates a \u0093pre-election124 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition game,\u0094 where the utilities of the agents over the choice of positions are induced by their beliefs or expectations of post election outcomes. De- termining whether this pre-election game has equilibria is extremely dif- \u0002cult. As a \u0002rst step, the next section will examine the post-election behavior of parties to gain some insight into the nature of coalition bar- gaining. Although scholars are in fair agreement concerning the positions of parties in a one-dimensional policy space (Laver and Scho\u0002eld, 1990), party positions in two dimensions are much more dif\u0002cult to ascertain. Empirical models can be constructed on the basis of multi-dimensional data on party policy positions that have been derived from the content analysis of party manifestos in European polities,15and more recently in Israel.16Using factor analysis it is generally possible to reduce these data to two dimensions giving a tractable description of the main political issues in these countries. Using these estimates of party position, we can then determine whether the core is empty, and if it is, deduce the location of the \u0093cycle set\u0094 or heart. Because the Nakamura number for these weighted voting rules will be three, we can infer that the core will always be non-empty if the policy space is one-dimensional and preferences of the parties are single peaked. In particular, the core in the one-dimensional situation corresponds to the position of the median party or legislator (that is the politician or party who is positioned so that there is a majority neither to the left nor to the right). Note in particular that any MCW coalition must contain the me- dian party. More importantly, any one-dimensional policy-based model of coalition formation predicts that the median legislator will necessarily belong to the governing coalition. Thus the spatial model implies that the median party can effectively control policy outcomes if the policy space is uni-dimensional. In two dimensions, it is possible for a core to occur in a structurally stable fashion, but as shown below it will generally be necessary that the core party is dominant in terms of its seat strength. As in the one- 15The original manifesto group (Budge, Robertson and Hearl, 1987) used a 54-category policy coding scheme to represent party policy in 19 democracies. The more recent work (Budge, Klingemann, V olkens and Bara, 2001) covers 25 countries. See also Benoit and Laver (2006) who use expert estimates. 16Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2005a,b, 2006).6.1 Empirical Analyses of Coalition Formation 125 dimensional case, the core party will be able to veto any coalitional pro- posal. As a consequence we expect this party to belong to the govern- ment. On the other hand, if the core is empty then no party can have a veto of this kind, and it is natural to expect greater uncertainty in coali- tion outcomes. In such a situation, for any incumbent coalition and pol- icy point, there is always an alternative coalition that can win with a new policy point. This it can do by seducing some members of the incumbent coalition away, by offering them a higher policy payoff than they can ex- pect if they remain loyal to the original coalition. However, because the heart will be bounded by a small number of median arcs, we can iden- tify these arcs with a set of minimal winning coalitions. It is suggested that bargaining between the parties will result in one or other of these coalition governments. In this chapter we shall use the estimated posi- tions and relative sizes of the parties, together with the concepts of the core and heart to suggest a categorization of different types of bargain- ing environments, distinguishing between unipolar, bipolar andtriadic political systems. Inleft unipolar systems such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Ice- land, there is typically one larger party and three or four smaller parties. The larger party may be able to dominate coalition politics, and form a minority government with or without the tacit support of one of the other parties. In triadic systems, such as Austria and Germany (where typically there are two large and one or two small parties) most coalition cabi- nets are both minimal winning and minimal connected winning. Center unipolar systems, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, typically have two large and at least two other small parties. Minority or surplus coalitions are infrequent and governments are usually minimal winning coalitions. In bipolar systems, such as the Netherlands and Finland, there are typically two large and a number of smaller parties. Finally, Italy (until the election of 1994) had a strongly dominant party, the Christian Democrats. This party was in every coalition government, and relatively short-lived governments were very common (Mershon, 2002). By 1994, the dominance of the Christian Democrat party had evaporated (Giannetti and Sened, 2004). This typology is only meant to be indicative. As we discuss the var- ious polities, it is quite clear that under proportional representation, the number of parties and their relative strengths can change in radical ways,126 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition inducing complex changes in the possibility of a core and in the con\u0002gu- ration of the heart. 6.2 A Spatial Model of Legislative Bargaining As in the previous chapters, we assume that each party chooses a pre- ferred position (or bliss point ) in a policy space W. From now on we shall denote the parties as N=f1;:::;j;:::;n gand the vector of bliss points as z= (z1;:::;z n):After the election we denote the number of controlled by party, j, bysjand let s= (s1;:::;s n)be the vector of parliamentary seats. We shall suppose that any coalition with more than half the seats is winning, and denote the set of winning coalitions byD. This assumption can be modi\u0002ed without any theoretical dif\u0002culty. For each winning coalition MinDthere is a set of points in Wsuch that, for any point outside the set there is some point inside the set that is preferred to the former by all members of the coalition. Furthermore, no point in the set is unanimously preferred by all coalition members to any other point in the set. This set is the Pareto set, Pareto (M);of the coalition, as introduced previously. If the conventional assumption is made that the preferences of the actors can be represented in terms of Euclidean distances, then this compromise set for a coalition is simply the convex hull of the preferred positions of the member parties. (In two dimensions, we can draw this as the area bounded by straight lines join- ing the bliss points of the parties and including all coalition members.) Since preferences are described by the vector, z;we can denote this as Pareto (M;z):Now consider the intersection of these compromise sets for all winning coalitions. If this intersection is non-empty, then it is a set called the Core ofDatz;written Core (D;z). At a point in Core (D;z) no coalition can propose an alternative policy point that is unanimously preferred by every member of some winning coalition. In general, Core (D;z)will be at the preferred point of one party. The analysis of McKelvey and Scho\u0002eld (1987), presented in the previous chapter, obtained pivotal symmetry conditions that are necessary at a core point. Clearly a necessary and suf\u0002cient condition for point xto be in Core (D;z)is thatxis in the Pareto set of every minimal winning coalition. As shown in Chapter 5, the symmetry conditions depend on6.2 A Spatial Model of Legislative Bargaining 127 certain subgroups called pivot groups. Alternatively, we can determine all median lines given by the pair (D;z). To illustrate these conditions, consider the con\u0002guration of party strengths after the election of 1992 in Israel. (The election results in Israel for the period 1988 to 2003 are given in Table 6.4.) The estimates of party positions in Figure 6.1 were obtained from a survey of the electorate carried out by Arian and Shamir (1995), complemented by an analysis of the party manifestos (details can be found in Scho\u0002eld and Sened, 2006). As Figure 6.1 indicates, all median lines go through the Labor party position, so given the con\u0002guration of seats and positions, we can say La- bor is the core party in 1992. Another way to see that the Labor position, zlab;is at the core is to note that the set of parties above the median line through the Labor-Tsomet positions (but excluding Labor) only control 59 seats out of 120. When the party positions are such that the core does indeed exist, then any government coalition must contain the core party. When the core party is actually at a core position then it is able to in- \u0003uence coalition bargaining in order to control the policy position of the government. Indeed, if we assume that parties are only concerned to con- trol policy, then the party at the core position would be indifferent to the particular coalition that formed. The ability of the core party to control policy implies a tendency for core parties to form minority governments, since they need no other parties in order to ful\u0002l their policy objectives. In fact, in 1992, Rabin \u0002rst created a coalition government with Shas, and then formed a minority government without Shas. We have emphasized that in two dimensions the core can be empty. To see the consequences of this, consider the con\u0002guration of party positions in Israel after the election of 1988, as presented in Figure 6.2, again using the seat allocations from Table 6.4. In this case there is a median line through the Tzomet, Likud positions, so the coalition of parties above this line is winning. It is evident that the Labor does not belong to the Pareto set of the coalition including Likud, Tzomet and the religious parties. Indeed, it can be shown that the symmetry conditions necessary for the existence of a core are nowhere satis\u0002ed. In this case, there are cycles of different coalitions, each preferred by a majority of the legislature to some other coalition policy in the cycle.128 Chapter 6.

The heart, H(D;z);given the seat strengths and party positions, is the star-shaped \u0002gure, bounded by the \u0002ve median lines. It is reasonable to conclude, in the absence of a core party, that a coalition government will be based on a small number of minimal winning coalitions. No- tice that this inference provides a good reason to consider using a two- dimensional rather than a one-dimensional model of policy bargaining. In6.2 A Spatial Model of Legislative Bargaining 129 Figure 6.1: The core in the Knesset in 1992 Figure 6.2: The heart in the Knesset in 1988130 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition a single-dimensional model there will always be a core party (since there will always be a party to which the median legislator belongs). Moreover it can happen that this median core party is small in size. For example, in Figure 6.2, if there were only the single security dimension, then the Shas position would be the median, and it could be concluded that Shas could form a minority government. In fact this did not occur. In two di- mensions, if a core does exist then it must be at the position of the largest party. We can therefore deduce that in 1992, only Labor could be a core party. We can compare the heart in Figure 6.2 with other solution notions, such as the yolk and uncovered set (McKelvey, 1986; Cox, Breton and Salles, 1992). The yolk in Figure 6.2 is the smallest circle that just touches the median lines that bound the heart. Its theoretical justi\u0002cation is in term of a process of policy amendments with a \u0002xed agenda. While such a process is ap- propriate for policy making in the U.S. Senate, it does not seem relevant for coalition bargaining over government formation. The uncovered set is also centrally located like the heart, and can be shown to be the sup- port of mixed strategy equilibria in models of elections (Banks, Duggan and Le Breton, 2002, 2006). The work of Banks and Duggan (2000) con- siders bargaining between political parties when the party positions and seat strengths are given. Their analysis suggests that the outcome can be described as a lottery across a set of points on the boundary of the heart. Figure 6.3 shows the positions of the parties after the election of 1996, together with an estimate of the electoral distribution, based on the sur- vey data obtained by Arian and Shamir (1999), while Figure 6.4 gives a schematic representation of the heart, based on party positions after 2003. The \u0002gure shows Labor with 21 seats, after Am Ehad, with 2 seats, joined Labor in 2003, while Likud has 40 seats after being joined by Olim, with 2 seats. Although Barak, of Labor, became Prime Minister in 1999, he was defeated by Ariel Sharon, of Likud, in the election for prime minister in 2001. The set denoted the heart in this \u0002gure represents the coalition possibilities open to Sharon after 2003. The \u0002gure can be used to understand the consequences after Sharon seemingly changed his policy on the security issue in August 2005, by pulling out of the Gaza Strip. First, Likud reacted strongly against this change in policy. Then, in the \u0002rst week of November 2005, Amir Peretz,6.2 A Spatial Model of Legislative Bargaining 131 Figure 6.3: Party positions in the Knesset in 1996132 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition a union activist, and leader of Am Ehad, won an election against Shimon Peres for leadership of the Labor Party. Sharon then left the Likud Party and allied with Peres, the former leader of Labor and other senior Labor Party members, to form the new party, Kadima (\u0093Forward\u0094). We can infer that the coalition of Sharon and Peres positioned Kadima at the origin of the policy space, as shown in Figure 6.5. This \u0002gure gives estimates of party positions at the March 28, 2006, election to the Knesset. Because of Sharon's stroke in January 2006, Ehud Olmert had taken over as leader of Kadima, and was able to take 29 seats. Likud only took 12 seats, while the four parties on the upper right of the \u0002gure won 38 seats. One surprise of the election was the appearance of a Pensioners' party with 7 seats. As Figure 6.5 indicates, the parties on the right (even with the Pensioners' Party) do not have the required 61 seats for a majority, so Kadima is located at the structurally stable core position. Even though Kadima is estimated to be a core party, Olmert needed the support of Labor to be able to deal with the complex issue of \u0002xing a permanent border for Israel. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle in Lebanon severely weakened the Kadima\u0096Labor coalition, and in October 2006, the 61 members of the coalition voted to bring Israel Beiteinu into the government. Barak then won the election for the Labor Party leadership on 12 June, 2007, and became Minister of Defense in the government on 18 June. In November, Olmert proposed a land-for-peace proposal, possibly involving the separation of Jerusalem. It appears that Sharon's change of policy has led to a fundamental transformation in the political con\u0002guration, from the coalition structure without a core (that had persisted since 1996), to a new con\u0002guration, associated with the center, core party, Kadima. 6.3 The Core and the Heart of the Legislature In this section we shall use the results of Chapter 5 on pivotal symme- try to examine more formally the situation when a party can occupy a structurally stable core position. 6.3.1 Examples from Israel Example 6.3.1. Consider again the election of 1992 in Israel. Table 6.46.3 The Core and the Heart of the Legislature 133 Figure 6.4: The con\u0002guration of the Knesset after the election of 2003 Figure 6.5: The con\u0002guration of the Knesset after the election of 2006134 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition shows that, after this election, the coalition M1=fLabor, Meretz, De- mocrat Arab, Communist Party gcontrolled 61 seats while the coalition M2of the remaining parties, including Likud, controlled only 59 seats out of 120. Thus the decisive structure in 1992 may be written D1992and includes the decisive coalitions fM1;M2[Labor;M 2[Meretz g: SinceM1\\M2is empty, the Nakamura number is three, and a core can only be guaranteed in one dimension. To formally examine the pivotal symmetry condition at the Labor position, let L=Labor; and consider whetherM=Likud pivots at this position. Take the disjoint partition fA;Bgof the parties other than Labor and Likud, where A={Democrat Arab, Communist Party, Meretz, Shas}, with 23 seats, and B={parties on the right excluding Shas} with 21 seats. Now Likud has 32 seats, so clearly neither Likud [AnorLikud [Bis a decisive coalition. Thus Likud does not pivot. Indeed, any pivotal coalition in Elabor(D1992)must contain at least two parties. It is easy to see in Figure 6.1 that any pivotal coalition containing say Likud, Shas and NRP is blocked at the Labor po- sition by an opposing coalition, such as Meretz and ADL. Moreover, this blocking is not destroyed by a small perturbation of the party positions. For this reason, the core at the Labor position is structurally stable. Example 6.3.2. Now consider the election of 2003, where Likud is the largest party. It is obvious that Labor together with Meretz and the par- ties on the left pivot together. For the Likud position to be a core it is necessary that this \u0093proto\u0096coalition\u0094 be blocked. But Figure 6.4 indi- cates that this proto\u0096coalition is not blocked at the the Likud position. Consequently, the Likud position was not at a core position. De\u0002nition 6.3.1.

We now examine the calculations by parties over policy positions, on the basis of these ideas. 6.3.2 Examples from the Netherlands Example 6.3.3. Consider the elections of 1977 and 1981 in the Nether- lands. Table 6.5 gives the election results together with the National V ote Shares, while Table 6.6 gives the sample survey estimates of the vote shares, based on Rabier and Inglehart (1981) Euro-barometer voter sur- vey. Figure 6.6 gives estimates of the positions of the four main parties: Labor (PvdA), the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Liberals (VVD) and the Democrats '66 (D'66). These estimates were obtained using data from the middle-level Elites Study (ISEIUM, 1983). The background to the \u0002gure gives the estimate of the distribution of voter bliss points de- rived from the Euro-barometer survey. This example is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 below. A coalition {CDA, VVD} with 77 seats formed in December 1977, and lasted 41 months until the election in 1981. After the second election, a short lived \u0093surplus coalition,\u0094 {PvdA, CDA, D'66}, with 109 seats \u0002rst formed and then collapsed to a minority coalition, {CDA, D'66}. The increase of seats for the D'66 between the elections meant that the me-136 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition Figure 6.6: Party positions in the Netherlands in 1977 dian lines, and therefore the heart, changed. Using the estimates of party position from Figure 6.6 for both 1977 and 1981, and assuming Euclid- ean preferences but ignoring the small parties, we see that in 1977, the heart is bounded by the three median arcs, [zPvdA;zCDA];[zPvdA;zV V D] and[zCDA;zV V D]while in 1981, the heart is bounded by [zPvdA;zCDA]; [zPvdA;zV V D]and[zCDA;zD66]. Notice that we can infer that the minor- ity coalition {CDA, D'66} had the implicit support of the VVD. Let us now perform the thought experiment of moving party positions to determine whether a core can exist. If seat strengths are unchanged, then after 1977 there is no possible core position. For example, move- ment by the PvdA to a position inside the convex set [zCDA;zD66;zV V D] does not put it at a core position. In the same way, a move by the CDA to the interior of [zPvdA;zD66;zV V D]is also not a core. On the other hand, with the seat strengths after 1981, such moves would have given core po- sitions. This thought experiment raises the question of the choice of party positioning, since the logic of legislative bargaining would suggest that any party at the core could guarantee membership of government (Banks and Duggan, 2000). However, this thought experiment is inadequate, be-6.3 The Core and the Heart of the Legislature 137 cause moves by the parties would change their seat strengths. Table 6.5.

The model ignored the small parties and used vote intentions from the sample to construct a stochastic vote model. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. It was found appropriate to add in what are called valence values for the four parties. Valence is simply an exoge- nous component of voter evaluation based on subjective estimates of the quality of the party leaders. Table 6.6. Estimated vote shares and valences in the Netherlands Party Estimated Sample Model Valences vote % vote% % PvdA 35.3 36.9 38.6 1.596 1.403 VVD 24.2 18.9 21.7 D'66 10.6 10.4 7.8 0 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Table 6.6 gives the sample vote shares for the four major parties (these excluded the small parties, so the four shares sum to 100 percent). The138 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition MNL model gave the estimated shares given in Table 6.6. Using the em- pirical estimates of these valences, normalized by setting the valence of the D'66 to zero, increased the statistical signi\u0002cance of the model. The valences are shown in the table. As discussed in Chapter 7, simulation of the model shows that the electoral origin is a Nash equilibrium of a sim- ple vote-maximizing model. Because the PvdA has the highest estimated valence, the simulation shows that when all parties are at the origin, then the PvdA would have received 38.6 percent of the vote. (The estimated vote shares when all parties are at the origin is given by the column la- beled Model in Table 6.6). Because the model did not include the small parties, we can infer that the PvdA would have obtained 53 seats when all parties are at the electoral origin. Similarly we obtain estimates for the CDA of 45 seats, the VVD of 29 seats and the D'66 of 11 seats. No- tice that these estimated vote shares at the origin are very close to the National vote shares in 1977 as well as the sample vote shares. If parties are concerned to maximize vote shares, and can compute the outcome of adopting policy positions at the electoral origin, then they can also estimate that overall vote shares would be quite insensitive to such move- ments. Indeed, the decisive structure resulting from this Nash equilibrium will be identical to the one resulting after the 1977 election. Example 6.3.4. We now consider a more complicated situation, that of the Dutch Par- liament after the recent election of November 2006. Table 6.7 shows the party strengths while Figure 6.7 shows the party positions as estimated by Shikano and Linhart (2007). The coalition government of {CDA, VVD, D'66} had broken up on 29 June, 2006 over the so-called \u0093Ayaan Hirsi Ali affair.\u0094 She had become a Member of Parliament for the VVD, but was stripped of Dutch nationality by the Minister for Integration and Alien Affairs because of allegations that she lied on her application for asylum. When her nationality was reinstated, on the basis of a document exonerating this Minister (a member of the VVD), the D'66 pulled out of the coalition, leading to a minority caretaker government of {CDA,VVD} with only 72 seats, out of 150, installed on 7 July. After the election in November 2006, a coalition {CDA, PvdA, CU}, with 80 seats, was formed on 7 February, 2007. Although this coalition6.3 The Core and the Heart of the Legislature 139 Figure 6.7: The Dutch Parliament in 2006140 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition might seem fairly unusual, being a combination of parties with a religious basis and the labor party, it is compatible with the notion of the heart. The heart is the star shaped \u0002gure bounded by a small number of median lines in the two-dimensional policy space generated by the economic axis (dimension 1) and the religious axis (dimension 2). These medians can be associated with various coalitions: (i) Two coalitions involving the CDA associated with the median arcs f[zCU;zCDA];[zCDA;zPV V]g (ii) Three coalitions involving the PvdA associated with the median arcsf[zPvdA;zCDA];[zPvdA;zPV V];[zPvdD;zCU]g (iii) Two probably unlikely coalitions involving the parties on the left of the economic axis associated with the arc [zPvdD;zD66], and on the right, associated with the arc [zCDA;zD66]: Table 6.7.

While the heart does not give a pre- cise prediction of which coalition will form, it provides clues over the complex bargaining calculations that policy-motivated party leaders are faced with when attempting to form majority coalitions in polities based on proportional representation (PR). In particular, because of the con\u0003ict that the affair generated between the VVD and D'66, the {CDA, PvdA,6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government 141 CU} coalition is one of the few possible viable coalitions. Even so, it took over six months of negotiation before the coalition parties could agree. There are some general points that can be made on the basis of an ex- amination of politics in the Netherlands. Obviously, under PR there is little incentive for parties to coalesce. On the contrary, parties may well fragment. The strengths of the parties may \u0003uctuate as a result of local events. Such a \u0003uctuation is compatible with the electoral model pre- sented in the next chapter, since the model suggests that this \u0003uctuation is due to shifting valences\u0096the perceptions of the competence of the par- ties on the part of the electorate. Ignoring the possibility of fragmentation of parties, the policy locations of parties seem quite stable over time, sug- gesting that the electoral response is primarily due to changes in valence. Computing the relationship between valence, activists and party location is an extremely complicated theoretical problem. On the other hand, if we take the post-election positions and strengths of the parties as given then we can use the concept of the heart to gain some insight into the nature of post-election bargaining over government formation in polities based on proportional representation. The next section outlines a typology based on this idea. 6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government The previous examples suggest that parties do not appear to adopt Nash- equilibrium positions based on a simple vote-maximizing game. Because of this, Chapter 7 considers a more general electoral model, where each party is dependent on activist support. In this model parties gain support from activists, as long as the party position is chosen in response to ac- tivist demands. We can interpret this to mean that the party implicitly has policy preferences. However, since there may well be many potential ac- tivist groups in a polity, we may expect a number of parties to respond to activist demands. In Chapter 7 we discuss the simpler case of plurality rule, as in Britain, where there will tend to be no more than three parties. In polities using electoral systems based on proportional representation (PR) there appears to be no rationale forcing activist groups to coalesce. In the following discussion of legislative politics we shall use estimates of party positions, and examine the nature of the core, or heart, under142 Chapter 6.

If the reasoning presented in the previous section is valid, then we should expect minority governments in situations where there is a core party. 6.4.1 Bipolar Systems The Netherlands. As in the previous examples of the Netherlands, there are two weakly dominant parties, namely the Labor Party (PvdA) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) or its predecessor, the Catholic Peo- ple's Party (KVP). For this reason, we shall use the term bipolar. How- ever since the CDA/KVP or D'66 tends to be located at the median on the economic domension, there is little possibility that the PvdA can oc- cupy the two-dimensional core. In the period 1945\u00961987, there were only three minority governments (in 1966\u00961967 for 5 months, 1972\u00961973 for 10 months, and 1982 for 6 months). Figure 6.7 makes clear the bipo- larity of the polity, as coalitions lie essentially on either side of the line separating the upper right of the \u0002gure from the left. Finland. The pattern of coalition formation in Finland is quite com-6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government 143 plex. The effective seat number is approximately 5.5, re\u0003ecting the fact that there are generally four larger parties \u0096 the Left Alliance (V AS) with 19 seats out of 200 in 2003, the Social Democrat Party (SDP) with 53 seats in 2003, the Center Party (KESK) with 55 seats and the Conserv- ative Party or National Coalition (KOK) with 40 seats. In addition there are a number of small parties: the Green League (Vihre\u00e4 Liito, VIHF) with 14 seats, the Christian Democrats (Kristillisdemokraatit, KD) with 7 seats, Perussuomalaiset (PS) with 3, and the Swedish People's Party (SFP) with 8. On the usual left\u0096right scale either SDP or KESK is at the median (Laver and Scho\u0002eld, 1990). The system is bipolar , just as with the Netherlands, since the heart is determined by the SDP and KESK, both of which can be weakly dominant parties. Figure 6.8 indicates that the heart is based on the triad of {SDP, KESK, KOK}, with a median line dividing the right\u0096wing parties from those of the left.17 6.4.2 Left Unipolar Systems Table 6.2 suggests that the frequent minority governments in the period 1945\u00961987 in Denmark, Sweden and Norway were based on core parties on the left of the policy space. Denmark. The political system has a high degree of fragmentation (the effective number increased from about 3.8 in the late 1940s to 7.0 in 1970). The largest party is the Social Democrat Party (SD) with 30\u0096 40 percent of the seats, and the Liberals (or Venstre, V) with 20 to 30 percent. The SD is the only dominant party. The SD was in 13 out of 21 governments in the period 1945\u00961987, while Venstre was a member of the remaining governments. Governments without a clear majority are typical in Denmark, though tacit support is often provided by small parties. The pattern that emerges is one of SD minority governments with support of the radical liberals (RV), Socialist People's Party (SF) or Communist Party (DKP) alternat- ing with governments consisting of the Venstre and the Conservative Peo- ple's Party (KF). 17The estimates of party positions given by Benoit and Laver (2006) are used to con- struct the \u0002gures in the rest of this chapter .144 Chapter 6.

For example, Table 6.8 gives the election results for 1957 and 1964. Because the parties on the right controlled more than a majority of the seats in 1957, we can infer that the core is empty. In 1964, the right coalition gained only 84 seats, and the core SD formed a minority gov- ernment. Note however that the Danish system became more fragmented, so that the possibility of a core declined. Figure 6.9 gives the estimates of positions in 2001, including those of new parties: the Center Democrats (CD), the Christian Peoples Party (KrF), Danish People's Party (DF) and the Red\u0096Greens (or Enhedslisten (Enh). The \u0002gure shows the median lines. The heart is the star shaped set given in the \u0002gure, generated by the SD, DF, KF and V positions. In the election 2001, the effective number was over 6.5, and a coalition of {V , KF} formed, controlling 72 seats, out of 179. This coalition gained 70 seats in 2005, and stayed in power. It would seem that the major party positions may have changed very little over time, but there is a clear indication of an increase in fragmen- tation. Sweden. The dominance of the Social Democratic Party (SAP) in Sweden was quite pronounced, since it typically obtained just less than6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government 145 24681012141624681012141618DF EnhKFKrF RVSDSFV Taxes vs. Spending Social Figure 6.9: Denmark in 2001 2468101214161824681012141618C FPKDM MPSAPVTaxes vs. Spending Social Figure 6.10: Sweden in 2002146 Chapter 6.

This implied that the only coalition ex- cluding the SAP was a counter coalition of four other parties on the right, making the SAP a natural core party. In contrast, Figure 6.10 shows the political con\u0002guration in 2002. The heart is a triangle bounded by the positions of the Christian Democrats (KD, with 33 seats, out of 349), the SAP (with 144) and the Green Party (MP, with 17 seats). The parties outside the heart are the Center Party (C, with 22 seats), the Moderate Party (M, with 55 seats), the Liberal People's Party (FP, with 48 seats) and the Left Party (V for Vansterpartiet, with 30 seats). Thus, in 2002, the SAP, the Left Party and the Greens together took 53 percent of the vote and 191 seats out of 349. In the 2006 election, the four parties of the right (KD, M, FP and C) formed a pre- election coalition, gained 48 percent of the vote and 178 seats, and were able to form the government. Norway. The Labor Party (Det Norske Arbeiderpartie or DNA) occu- pies a position similar to that of the SAP in Sweden. Indeed the DNA has often been the strongly dominant party. Until 1961 it controlled a ma- jority of the seats. The Socialist Left Party (SV) took only 2 seats (out6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government 147 of 155) in 1977 but jumped to 17 seats in 1989, and in the recent elec- tion in September 2005, took 15 out of 169. After the election of 1981, the three parties on the right (Center Party, Sp; Christian People's Party, KrP; and Conservatives, H) controlled a majority. From 1989, the radi- cal right\u0096wing populist Progress Party (FrP), founded by Anders Lange, grew rapidly, gaining 38 seats in 2005. After the 1989 and 1993 elections the DNA was essentially at the core position with a plurality of the vote and was able to form a minority government. In 1997, however, the DNA lost a couple of seats, and the DNA leader, Jagland, stepped down, lead- ing to the formation of a minority right\u0096wing coalition, led by Bondevik of the KrP, together with the Center Party. The unwillingness of the three right\u0096wing parties to form a coalition with the FrP led to the minority right\u0096wing coalition from 1997 to 2005. In the 2005 election, the Cen- ter Party switched, forming a Red\u0096Green coalition with the DNA and the SV . This alliance took 87 seats out of 169, and was able to form the \u0002rst majority coalition in Norway since 1985. (See Strom, 1991, for an ear- lier discussion of minority coalitions in Norway.) Note, however, that if the parties on the right could agree to form a coalition with the Progress Party, then the heart is the set bounded by the positions of the DNA, the Sp and the Liberals (V), making the Sp a pivot party between coalitions of the left and right. See Figure 6.11. 6.4.3 Center Unipolar Systems Belgium. Belgium is an interesting example with respect to the theoret- ical prediction about the core. In the period up to the late 1960s, the political con\u0002guration based on three parties meant that the core was empty and minimal winning coalition governments the rule. However, af- ter 1970, increasing political fragmentation resulting from con\u0003icts over language and regional autonomy led to the replacement of the three\u0096party system with a multiparty system generated by the federalist\u0096unitary di- mension. The entrance of new parties, including the nationalist V oksunie (VU) in 1954, the Rassemblement Wallon (RW) and the Francophone Democratic Front (FDF), increased the effective seat number (to 6.0 by 1971). The centrist Christelijke V olspartij (CV) was almost continually in power until the election of 1999,when it lost its plurality status, gain-148 Chapter 6.

A coalition of six parties with 94 seats formed the government: VLD, the two wings of the Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste, or PS, and the Socialistische Partij, SP, with 33 seats be- tween them), the Free Democrat Party (FDF) with 18 seats, and 20 seats from two other small, green parties (Ecolo, EC, and Agalev, AG). Figure 6.12 shows the party positions, on the assumption that the two socialist parties (PS and SP) were at the same position. The heart illustrates the various coalition possibilities. The V olksunie had split into a national- ist wing (VU&ID) and a more federalist component, the Flemish Block (VB). These parties, together with the National Front (FN) are shown to be positioned outside the heart. In 2003, the CV renamed itself the Christian Democratic and Flemish Party (CD&V) and won 21 seats while the FDF was renamed the Re- formist Movement (MR) and won 24 seats. The green parties only won four seats. The other small parties were the New Flemish Alliance (N- V A) with 1 seat and the Humanistic Democratic Center (CDH) with 8. The Flemish Socialist Party (SP) formed an alliance with Spirit (Sp), a6.4 Typologies of Coalition Government 149 46810121416182468101214161820CD&VCDH EcoFN MRN\u00adVAPSSPSpVB VLDTaxes vs. Spending Social Figure 6.13: The heart in Belgium in 2003 small offshoot of the VU, and together they won 23 seats. Assuming that the two parties, PS and SPSp, were at distinct positions gives the heart as shown in Figure 6.13. This illustrates the more complex coalition possi- bilities as a result of the increasing fragmentation that occurred between 1999 and 2003. In the election of 10 June, 2007, the CD&V went from 21 seats to 30 (out of 150), becoming the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives. After a month of negotiation, King Albert II asked the leader of the CD&V, Yves Leterme, to be formateur of a coalition government, Yves Leterme. Leterme found this impossible, and resigned from the task on 23 August. At the time of going to press (7 November, 2007), Belgium had been without a government for a record 149 days. Luxembourg. The largest party is the Christian Social Party (CSV) with about one-third of the seats, followed by the Luxembourg Social- ist Workers' Party (LSAP) with between one-quarter and one-third of the seats. The smaller Democratic Party (DP) generally gains just less than one-\u0002fth of the seats. The heart is clearly based on the triad of the po- sitions {LSAP, CVP, DP}, and governments tend to be associated with150 Chapter 6.

Ireland is especially interesting because it has a dominant center\u0096right party (Fianna F\u00e1il) and unlike Belgium or Luxembourg, there have been a number of minority (Fianna F\u00e1il) governments. To see the complexity of the bargaining possibilities, consider Table 6.9 which lists the seat strengths after February 1987 in the D\u00e1il Eireann. Table 6.9.

We may infer that Fianna F\u00e1il was indeed a core party, suggesting a minority government. This is precisely what occurred. Sean Treacy became Ceann Comhairle (Chairman) of the Dail.

Bertie Ahern, leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, formed a coalition with the Progressive Democrats and Rory O'Hanlon was unanimously elected Ceann Comhairle at the \u0002rst meeting of the 29th D\u00e1il on 6 June 2002. In the May 2007 election, Fianna F\u00e1il won 78 seats, while the Progres- sive Democrats only won 2 seats, not enough to form a majority coalition. Fine Gael increased its strength to 51, with only 5 seats going to indepen- dents, while Sinn F\u00e9in won 4 seats and Labor won 20 seats. Figure 6.15 suggests the nature of the heart.

To some extent Iceland is a mirror image of the three Scandina- vian political systems. The largest party is the right-wing Independence Party (IP) which took 22 seats out of 63 in the 2003 election. At the cen- ter are two parties: the Progressive Party (PP) with 12 seats in 2003 and a Liberal Party (F) with 4 seats in 2004. On the left is the Social Demo- cratic Alliance (SDA) with 20 seats, and the Left\u0096Green Movement (G) with 4. The heart is given by the triad of positions {SDA, PP, IP} indi- cating the likelihood of minimal winning coalitions. David Oddsson, the leader of IP, served as Prime Minister from 1991 to 1995, in alliance with SDA, and then from 1995 to 2004 in alliance with the PP. Oddsson was succeeded in September 2004 by Halldor Asgrimsson of the PP. A coali- tion government of the IP, under Geir Haarde, with the PP, was formed in June 2006.

In Austria the large parties are the Social Democrat Party (SPO) and People's Party (OVP). Until 1959 the Communists (KPO) had roughly four seats, while the Freedom Party (FPO, but called the League of In- dependents before 1956), generally won between 6 and 11 seats up until 1979. The OVP won majorities in 1945 (with 85 seats) and in 1966 (with 84 seats). The SPO, under Bruno Kreisky, gained majorities in the elec- tions of 1971, 1975 and 1979, and between 1983 to 1986 formed a coali- tion with the FPO. From 1986 until 1999 the grand SPO\u0096OVP coalition governed. From 1995 to 1999, partly under the leadership of Jorg Haider, the FPO increased in strength from 41 to 52 seats, making it an obvious coalition partner for the OVP (also with 52 seats out of 183). Surpris- ingly, the FPO gained a slightly larger proportion of the vote than the OVP. Various controversies over the FPO leadership led to a new elec- tion in 2002. Haider had resigned the leadership of the FPO in 2000, and, in the 2002 election, the FPO strength fell to 18 seats, while the OVP jumped to 79 seats. For the \u0002rst time since 1966, the OVP gained154 Chapter 6.

In 2005, Haider formed a new party, the \u0093Alliance for the future of Austria,\u0094 BZO), which only gained 7 seats in the 2006 election. The OVP, with 66 seats, then formed a coalition with the FPO (with its 21 seats), against the SPO, with its 68 seats and the Greens (Gru) with its 21 seats. Figure 6.17 shows the heart for the election of 2006. Assuming that the BZO is located at the FPO position, the heart is based on the triad {SPO/Gru, OVP, FPO}. Germany. Figure 6.18 shows the heart for the election of 2002 in Ger- many, where the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) gained 248 seats, the Social Democrat Party (SPD) gained 251 seats, and the Free Democrat Party (FDP) gained 47 seats. The Greens (GRU) with 55 seats formed a minimal winning coalition with the SPD until the September 2005 elec- tion. As the \u0002gure indicates, the {SPD, GRU} median line is one of the boundaries of the heart, and so this coalition is a natural one to form. After the September 2005 election, however, the Greens gained 51 seats against 61 for the FDP and 54 for the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS).

Italy needs a category of its own, as it was originally a center unipo- lar system, where the dominant party, the Christian Democrat Party (DC), was in a uniquely powerful position until the 1994 election. The DC went from 206 seats (out of 630) in 1992 to 33 in 1994. Until 1987 the DC con- trolled about 40 percent of the seats, with the Communist Party (PCI) and Socialists (PSI) controlling just less than 30 percent each. The smaller parties include the Social Democrats (PSDI), Republicans (PRI), Lib- erals (PLI), Monarchists (PDIUM) and Neofascists (MSI). Aside from the \u0002rst two governments in 1946 and 1947, the Communists never be- longed to a coalition government. The DC was strongly dominant, and the only party able to position itself at a structurally stable core in a two- dimensional policy space, as indicated in Figure 6.19 (based on Giannetti156 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition Figure 6.19: The core in Italy in 1987 and Sened, 2004). The persistence of the Pentapartito coalition (1979\u00961989) compris- ing a coalition of DC, PSI, PRI, PLI and the PSDI is further evidence that the core was non-empty. To control the distribution of government perquisites, the DC maintained a grand, anti-PCI coalition. Scho\u0002eld (1993) suggested that corruption associated with these perquisites even- tually led to an anti-DC coalition based on new parties such as the North- ern League and the Greens. Mershon (1996a,b, 2002), Giannetti and Sened (2004) and Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006) discuss the dramatic changes in Italian politics that occurred in the period 1992\u00961996. Figure 6.20 in- dicates the quite new Italian con\u0002guration based on the positions of the parties in 2001: the Alleanza Nazionale (AN, 24 seats), Democratici di Sinistra (DS, 31 seats), Forza Italia (FI, 62 seats), La Margherita (Marg, 27 seats) and Rifondazione Comunista (RC, 11 seats). 6.5 Concluding Remarks Each of these 12 European countries, together with Israel, discussed in this chapter, displays very complex characteristic features. Although this chapter has suggested a typology of these polities based on the qualitative features of the core and the heart, it is evident that the suggested typology does not give a full account of the subtle aspects of6.5 Concluding Remarks 157 246810121416182468101214161820AN DSFIMargRCTaxes vs. Spending Social Figure 6.20: Italy in 2001 coalitional bargaining. The key features of this typology is the degree of fragmentation, and the extent of centrality (i.e., whether a dominant party occupies the core position). What is remarkable, however, is the degree to which each country exhibits a pattern of coalition government that is consistent, in some sense, over time. It is hardly surprising that compar- ative scholars have found these patterns to be of such great theoretical interest. Estimating party positions, and attempting to model coalition bargaining between the parties is a major challenge for comparative re- search. Recent work by Benoit and Laver (2006) on estimating party position for a large number of political con\u0002gurations is a signi\u0002cant ad- vance, and their estimates have proved invaluable as a means to estimate the legislative heart in these polities. The purpose of the spatial analysis presented in this chapter is to give some insight into the complexities of multiparty bargaining. The typol- ogy presented here has used the theory developed in the previous chap- ters, based on the existence of core parties and on the heart as an indica- tion of the bargaining domain when the core is empty. Some countries are characterized by the existence of a dominant party, able to attain enough158 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition seats to be strongly dominant and command the core position. In the bipolar polities there are two potentially dominant parties, each one of which may be able to gain enough seats on occasion to control the core. Increasing fragmentation may make it less likely that a core party can exist. As the con\u0002guration of the heart becomes more complex, then bar- gaining over government will also become more complex. It is hardly suprising that fragmentation will be associated with less durable govern- ment (see King, Alt, Burns and Laver, 1990). The main theoretical point that emerges is that the con\u0002guration of the heart in these polities suggests that there is hardly any centripetal tendency towards an electoral center. It is consistent with this analysis that activist groups will tend to pull the parties away from the center. Indeed, we can follow Duverger (1954) and Riker (1953) and note that under proportional electoral methods, there is very little motivation for interest groups to coalesce. Consequently, the fragmentation of interest groups will lead to a degree of fragmentation in the polity. Fragmentation may be mitigated by the electoral system (especially if there is a relatively high electoral requirement which determines whether a party will obtain some legislative representation. However, even when there is a degree of majoritarianism in the electoral system (as in Italy in recent years) this may have little effect on reducing fragmentation. Clearly if one party dominates coalition policy for a long period of time then there will be a much higher degree of stability than indicated purely by government duration. However, as the situation in Italy circa 1994 suggests, if there is a core party facing little in terms of real political opposition, then corruption may become persistent. For democratic poli- ties, there may be an element of a quandary associated with the choice of an electoral system. If it is based on proportional representation then there may be the possibility of dominance by a centrally located party. Alternatively, there may be coalitional instability resulting from a frag- mented polity and a complex con\u0002guration of parties. Another way of expressing, in simpli\u0002ed form, the difference between proportional repre- sentation and plurality rule is this: under proportional electoral methods, bargaining to create winning coalitions occurs after the election. Under plurality rule, if interest groups do not form a coalition before the elec- tion, then they can be obliterated, creating a pressure to coalesce. Popper (1945, 1988) may have had this in mind, when he argued that6.5 Concluding Remarks 159 \u0093\u0002rst past the post\u0094 or plurality rule forces political agents to form op- posing coalitions, associated with majoritarian parties. In a sense, this tendency requires society to make a decision, one way or the other, about the best option. Indeed, it is possible that plurality rule induces political leaders to be more willing to make risky decisions than they would under proportional rule (Scho\u0002eld, 2006a; Falaschetti, 2007). The next three chapters present a model of elections under plurality and proportional rule, based on the logic of activist groups.160 Chapter 6. A Spatial Model of Coalition 6.6 Appendix Table 6.10.

Such a core party can, if it chooses, form a minority government by itself and control policy outcomes.19If party leaders are aware of the fact that they can control policy from the core, then this centripetal tendency should lead parties to position themselves at the center. More- over, the \u0093mean voter theorem,\u0094 based on a stochastic model of election and on vote maximization, suggests that the electoral origin will be a Nash equilibrium.20These two very different models of political strat- egy suggest that parties will tend to locate themselves at the electoral center. Yet, contrary to this intuition, there is ample empirical evidence that party leaders do not necessarily adopt centrist positions. For example, Budge, Robertson and Hearl (1987) and Laver and Hunt (1992), in their study of European party manifestos, found no evidence of a strong cen- tripetal tendency. The electoral models for Italy and Israel presented in Giannetti and Sened (2004) and Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006) estimated party positions in various ways, and concluded that there was no general 19In addition to the arguments in the previous chapter, see (2005); McKelvey and Patty (2006). 163164 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections indication of policy convergence by parties. As the previous chapter has suggested, the only clear indications of parties adopting very centrist po- sitions were the examples of the Christian Democrats in Italy, up until the election of 1992, and Kadima in Israel at the election of 2006. This chapter examines the evidence for Israel,21Turkey,22the Netherlands,23 and Britain24to determine if the non-convergence noted previously can be accounted for by a stochastic electoral model that includes \u0093valence\u0094 (Stokes, 1992). These empirical models have all entailed the addition of heteroge- neous intercept terms for each party. One interpretation of these intercept terms is that they are valences or party biases, derived from voters' judge- ments about characteristics of the candidates, or party leaders, which can- not be ascribed to the policy choice of the party. One may conceive of the valence that a voter ascribes to a party leader as a judgement of the leader's quality or competence.25This idea of valence has been utilized in a number of recent formal models of voting.26 The chapter considers a general valence model based on activist sup- port for the parties.27This activist valence model presupposes that party activists donate time and other resources to their party. Such resources allow a party to present itself more effectively to the electorate, thus in- creasing its valence. Since activists tend to be more radical than the av- erage voter, parties are faced with a dilemma. By accommodating the political demands of activists, a party gains resources that it can use to enhance its valence, but by adopting the radical policies demanded by activists, the party may appear too extreme and lose electoral support. The party must therefore balance the electoral effect against the activist 21Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006). 22Scho\u0002eld and Ozdemir (2007). 23Scho\u0002eld, Martin, Quinn and Whitford (1998); Quinn, Martin and Whitford (1999). 24Scho\u0002eld (2005a,b). 25Stokes (1963) used the term valence issues to refer to those that \u0093involve the link- ing of the parties with some condition that is positively or negatively valued by the electorate.\u0094 As he observes, \u0093in American presidential elections... it is remarkable how many valence issues have held the center of the stage.\u0094 Stokes's observation is validated by recent empirical work on many polities, as well as by a study on the psychology of voting (Westen, 2007). 26Ansolabehere and Snyder (2000); effect. Theorem 7.2.1 presents the requisite balance condition between electoral and activist support. Since valence in this model is af- fected by activist support, it may exhibit \u0093decreasing returns to scale\u0094 and this may induce concavity in the vote-share functions of the par- ties. Consequently, when the concavity of the activist valence is suf\u0002- ciently pronounced then a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE) of the vote-maximizing game will exist. However, Theorem 7.2.1 indicates that there is no reason for this equilibrium to be one where all parties adopt centrist positions. In some polities, activists' valence functions will be suf\u0002ciently con- cave so that only one PNE will exist. However, computation of PNE is extremely dif\u0002cult and as a \u0002rst step this chapter concentrates instead on conditions for existence of \u0093local pure strategy Nash equilibia\u0094 (LNE). Recent analyses of elections in Israel have used simulation techniques to examine the nature of these local equilibria (Scho\u0002eld and Sened, 2006). The next section of this chapter presents a characterization of LNE for the stochastic electoral activist model, in terms of the Hessians of the vote-share functions of the parties. Throughout it is assumed that the sto- chastic errors have the Type I extreme value (Gumbel) distribution, : The formal model based on parallels the empirical models based on multinomial logit (MNL) estimation (Dow and Endersby, 2004). Theo- rem 7.2.2 specializes to the simpler case when only exogenous valence is relevant, so that the activist valence functions are zero. For the case of \u0002xed or exogenous valence, Theorem 7.2.2 shows that the model is classi\u0002ed by a \u0093convergence coef\u0002cient,\u0094 c, which is a function of all the parameters of the model. A suf\u0002cient condition for the existence of a convergent LNE at the electoral mean is that this coef\u0002cient is bounded above by 1. When the policy space is of dimension w;then the necessary condition for exis- tence of a PNE at the electoral mean, and thus for the validity of the \u0093mean voter theorem\u0094 (Hinich, 1977; Lin, Enelow and Dorussen, that the coef\u0002cient is bounded above by w:It is shown that the conver- gence coef\u0002cient is (i) an increasing function of the maximum valence difference (ii) an increasing function of the spatial parameter, , giving the relative importance of policy difference, and (iii) an increasing func- tion of the electoral variance of the distribution of voter preferred points. When the necessary condition fails, then parties, in equilibrium, will166 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections adopt divergent positions. In general, parties whose leaders have the low- est valence will take up positions furthest from the electoral mean. More- over, because a PNE must be a local equilibrium, the failure of existence of the LNE at the electoral mean implies non-existence of such a centrist PNE. The failure of the necessary condition for convergence has a simple interpretation. If the variance of the electoral distribution is suf\u0002ciently large in contrast to the expected vote-share of the lowest valence party at the electoral mean, then this party has an incentive to move away from the origin towards the electoral periphery. Other low valence parties will follow suit, and the local equilibrium will be one where parties are dis- tributed along a \u0093principal electoral axis.\u0094 The general conclusion is that, with all other parameters \u0002xed, then a convergent LNE can be guaranteed only when the convergence coef\u0002cient, c;is \u0093suf\u0002ciently\u0094 small. Thus, divergence away from the electoral mean becomes more likely the greater is ;the valence difference and the variance of the electoral distribution. To illustrate the theorem, empirical studies of voter behavior, for Is- rael, in the election of 1996, and for Turkey, in the elections of 1999 and 2002, are used to show that the condition on the empirical parameters of the model, necessary for convergence, was violated. The equilibrium positions obtained from the formal result under vote maximization were found to be comparable with, though not identical to, the estimated posi- tions. In Israel, for example, the two highest valence parties were sym- metrically located on either side of the electoral origin, while the lowest valence parties were located far from the origin. Since vote maximization is a natural assumption to make for political competition, the result suggests that there are essentially two non-centrist political con\u0002gurations: If there are two or more dimensions of policy, but there is a principal electoral axis associated with higher electoral variance, then all parties will tend to be located on, or close to this axis. In particular, if there are two competing high valence parties, then they will locate themselves at vote-maximizing positions on this axis, but on opposite sides of the electoral mean. Low valence parties will be situated on this axis, but far from the center. The unidimensionality of the resulting con\u0002guration will give a centrist party on the axis the ability to control government and thus policy. As the discussion of Israel in the previous chapter suggests, there may be a core party, as in 1992 and 2006, and the party will be able7.1 Political Valence 167 to control the core because of the high exogenous valence of the party's leader. If both policy dimensions are more or less equally important, with low covariance between the electoral distributions on both axes, then there will be no principal axis and parties can locate themselves throughout the policy space. Again high valence parties will tend to position them- selves nearer the mean. To construct a winning coalition, one or other of the high valence, centrist parties must bargain with more \u0093radical\u0094 low valence parties. In those situations where there is no core party, then a number of government coalitions are possible, and the range of possible outcomes is suggested by the legislative heart, as presented in the previ- ous chapter. In contrast to the examples from Israel and Turkey, the empirical evi- dence from the Netherlands in 1981 indicates that the eigenvalues of the Hessians of the vote-share functions at the joint electoral origin were all negative. In other words, the joint origin was an LNE for the stochas- tic model with exogenous valence. Clearly this is compatible with the mean voter theorem. This inference does not rule out the existence of other non-convergent LNE, but no other local equilibria were found by simulation (Quinn and Martin, 2002). For a two-dimensional stochastic model of the 1997 election in Britain, it was found that the estimated position of the Conservative Party was incompatible with the results with exogenous valence. However, this model did provide an explanation for the position of the centrist Lib- eral Democrat Party. The results of Theorem 7.2.2 with activist valence are then used to explain the changes in positions of the two larger parties in Britain between the elections of 1992 and 1997. Indeed, the empirical model suggests that as the exogenous valence of the Labor Party leaders increased in the 1990s, then the party's activists became less important. This provides an explanation why the party could become more centrist on the economic axis. On the other hand, as the valences of the leaders of the Conservative Party fell in the same period, then the in\u0003uence on the party of anti-Europe activists increased. This suggests why the party adopted an anti-European Union position. While these observations are particular to Britain, they appear applicable to any polity such as the U.S., where activist support is important. Although the equilibrium for the exogenous valence models for Is-168 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections rael and Turkey correctly predict non-convergence, they do not accu- rately predict the positions of all the parties. Moreover, the analyses of the Netherlands and Britain strongly suggest that the valence model will more accurately re\u0003ect party positions if the notion of valence is ex- tended to include the in\u0003uence of activists. The more general inference is that parties are located in political niches which they inhabit in a balance between activist in\u0003uence and electoral preferences. This more complex model is elaborated in the following two chapters. The next section of this chapter presents the formal model and state- ment of the theorems. Section 7.3 gives the empirical applications, while Section 7.4. brie\u0003y comments on the idea of the balance solution when there are two or more opposed activist groups for each party. An empiri- cal appendix gives details on the electoral model for Turkey. 7.2 Local Nash Equilibrium with Activists We consider a model of competition among a set, N, of parties. The elec- toral is an extension of the multiparty stochastic model of Lin, Enelow and Dorussen (1999), but modi\u0002ed by inducing asymmetries in terms of valence. The basis for this extension is the extensive empirical evidence that valence is a signi\u0002cant component of the judgements made by voters of party leaders. There are a number of possible choices for the appropri- ate model of multiparty electoral competition. The simplest one, which is used here, is that the utility function for party, j, is proportional to the vote-share,Ej, of the party. With this assumption, we can examine the conditions on the parameters of the stochastic model which are necessary for the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE). Because the vote-share functions are differentiable, we use calculus techniques to es- timate optimal positions. We can then obtain suf\u0002cient conditions for the existence of local pure strategy Nash equilibria (LNE). Clearly, any PNE will be an LNE, but not conversely. Additional conditions of concavity or quasi-concavity are suf\u0002cient to guarantee existence of PNE. The key idea underlying the formal model is that party leaders attempt to estimate the electoral effects of party declarations, or manifestos, and choose their own positions as best responses to other party declarations, in order to maximize their own vote-share. The stochastic model essen-7.2 Local Nash Equilibrium with Activists 169 tially assumes that party leaders cannot predict vote response precisely, but can estimate an expected vote-share. In the model with valence, the stochastic element is associated with the weight given by each voter, i, to the average perceived quality or valence of the party leader. De\u0002nition 7.2.1.

The difference between the Gumbel and normal (or Gaussian) distribu- tions is that the latter is perfectly symmetric about zero.

We use the notion of LSNE to avoid problems with the degenerate situation when there is a zero eigenvalue to the Hessian. The weaker requirement of LNE allows us to obtain a necessary condition for z\u0003to be an LNE and thus a PNE, without having to invoke concavity. Of particular interest is the joint mean vector x\u0003=1 vX i2Vxi: (7.5) We \u0002rst transform coordinates so that in the new coordinate system, x\u0003= 0. We shall refer to z0= (0;:::; 0)as the origin. Theorem 7.2.1 below z0= (0;:::; 0)will generally not satisfy the \u0002rst-order condition for an LSNE, namely that the differential ofEj;with respect to zjbe zero. However, if the activist valence function is identically zero, so that only exogenous valence is relevant, then the \u0002rst-order condition will be satis\u0002ed. On the other hand, Theorem 7.2.2 shows that there are necessary and suf\u0002cient conditions for z0to be an LSNE in a model without activist valence. A corollary of Theorem 7.2.2 gives these conditions in terms of a \u0093convergence coef\u0002cient\u0094 determined by the Hessian of party 1, with the lowest valence. It follows from (7.4) that for voter i, with bliss point, xi;the probabil- ity,\u001aij(z);thatipicksjatzis the \u0002rst-order condition for z\u0003to be an LSNE is that it be a balance solution.

Consider the electoral model E(\u0015;\u0016; ; )based on the Type I extreme value distribution, and including both exogenous and ac- tivist valences. The \u0002rst-order condition for z* to be an LSNE is that it is a balance solution. If all activist valence functions are highly concave, in the sense of having negative eigenvalues of suf\u0002ciently great magnitude, then the balance solution will be a PNE.174 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections When the valence functions f\u0016jgare non-zero, then it is the case that generically z0cannot satisfy the \u0002rst-order condition. Instead the vector d\u0016j dzj\u0093points towards\u0094 the position at which the activist valence is maxi- mized. When this marginal or gradient vector,d\u0016j dzj;is increased, (if ac- tivists become more willing to contribute to the party) then the equilib- rium position is pulled away from the weighted electoral mean of party j, and we can say the \u0093activist effect\u0094 for the party is increased. On the other hand if the activist valence functions are \u0002xed, but the exogenous valence,\u0015j;is increased, or the exogenous valence terms f\u0015k:k6=jg are decreased, then the vectordE\u0003 j dzjincreases in magnitude, and the equi- librium is pulled towards the weighted electoral mean. We can say the \u0093electoral effect\u0094 is increased. The second-order condition for an LSNE at z* depends on the neg- ative de\u0002niteness of the Hessian of the activist valence function. If the eigenvalues of these Hessians are negative at a balance solution, and of suf\u0002cient magnitude, then this will guarantee that a vector z\u0003that satis- \u0002es the balance condition will be an LSNE. Indeed, this condition can ensure concavity of the vote-share functions, and thus of existence of a PNE. In the case that all activist valence functions f\u0016jgare identically zero, we write the electoral model as E(\u0015; ; ).

Theorem 7.2 2 immediately gives the following corollaries: Corollary 7.2.1. Consider the model E(\u0015; ; ):In the case that Xis w-dimensional, then the necessary condition for the joint origin to be an LNE is that c(\u0015; ; )\u0014w: Ceteris paribus , an LNE at the joint origin is \u0093less likely\u0094 the greater are the parameters ,\u0015p\u0000\u00151and\u001b2: Corollary 7.2.2. In the two-dimensional case, a suf\u0002cient condition for the joint origin to be an LSNE for the model E(\u0015; ; )is thatc(\u0015; ; )< 1: It is evident that suf\u0002cient conditions for existence of an LSNE at the joint origin in higher dimensions can be obtained using standard results on the determinants, fdet(Cj)g, and traces, ftrace(Cj)g;of the charac- teristic matrices. Notice that the case with two parties of equal valence immediately gives a situation with 2 [1\u00002\u001a1]\u001b2= 0, irrespective of the other para- meters. However, if \u00152>\u0015 1, then the joint origin may fail to be an LNE if \u001b2is suf\u0002ciently large. Corollary 7.2.3. In the case that Wisw-dimensional and there are two parties, with \u00152> \u0015 1;then the joint origin fails to be an LNE if > 0 where 0=w[exp(\u00152\u0000\u00151) + 1] 2\u001b2[exp(\u00152\u0000\u00151)\u00001]: (7.15)7.2 Local Nash Equilibrium with Activists 177 Proof. This follows immediately using \u001a1= [1 + exp [ \u00152\u0000\u00151]]\u00001: It follows 0=1:Since is \u0002nite, then the neces- sary condition for an LNE must be satis\u0002ed. Example 7.2.1. We can illustrate these corollaries, in the case the neces- sary condition fails, by assuming that Wis a compact interval, [\u0000a;+a]\u001a R. Suppose further that there are three voters at x1=\u00001;x2= 0 above. Then z0fails to be an equilibrium, and party 1 must move z1 away from the origin, either towards x1orx3: To see this suppose \u00152= 1and\u00151= 0;so 0= 1:62:If = 2:0;then + 0:182 + 0:622] = 0:277: Hence candidate 1 can slightly increase vote-share by moving away from the origin. Obviously the joint origin cannot be an equilibrium. The gain from such a move is bigger the greater is \u00152\u0000\u00151and : Example 7.1.2. in Two Dimensions.

A Spatial Model of Elections r0=1 5\u0014 2 0 0 2\u0015 ; (7.16) so\u001b2=4 5:The crucial condition for a local equilibrium at the origin is that the Hessian of the vote-share function of player 1 has negative eigenvalues. The Hessian is given by the matrix 2 [1\u00002\u001a1] 5\u0014 2 0 0 2\u0015 \u0000\u0014 1 0 0 1\u0015 : (7.17) The necessary condition is that the trace of this matrix is negative. In fact, because of the symmetry of the example, the necessary condition on each eigenvalue becomes 2 [1\u00002\u001a1]2 5\u00141, This condition fails if 2 [1\u00002\u001a1]2 5>1, in which case both eigenvalues will be positive. Thus, if > 1;where 1=5 4(1\u00002\u001a1)=5[exp(\u00152\u0000\u00151) + 1] 4[exp(\u00152\u0000\u00151)\u00001]; then the electoral origin is a minimum of the vote-share function of player 1. Thus player 1 can move away from the origin, in any direction, to increase vote-share. Scho\u0002eld (2007a) and Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006) show that typically there will exist a \u0093principal\u0094 high variance electoral axis. Simulation of empirical models with exogenous valence and nparties shows that the lowest valence player will move away from the origin on this axis whenc(\u0015; ; )> w . In this case, an LSNE will exist, but not at the electoral origin, and will satisfy the condition jjz\u0003 1jj>jjz\u0003 njj. In other words, in equilibrium, the highest valence party will adopt a position closer to the electoral origin, while parties with lower valence will move to the electoral periphery. These two simple examples provide the justi\u0002cation of the assertion made in the second section of this chapter that when \u00152and\u00151are sub- stantially different, in terms of v2and ;then the joint origin becomes unstable. Note, however, that the joint origin will be an equilibrium as long as\u00152and\u00151are similar, or \u001b2and are small enough. In the following section we consider models for Israel, Turkey, the Netherlands and Britain. For Israel and Turkey, the vector of estimated7.3 Empirical Analyses 179 party valences and the other estimated parameters were such that elec- toral origin could not be an LNE. Indeed, the pattern of party positions in Israel in 1996 can be shown to be similar to a non-convergent LNE, based on the empirical parameters of the vote-maximizing game with en- dogenous valence. The details of the empirical model for Turkey in the elections of 1999 and 2002 are presented in an Appendix to this chap- ter. Again, convergence could not be expected. On the other hand, for the Netherlands and Britain, it is shown that the parameters of the mod- els imply that the suf\u0002cient conditions for an LSNE at the joint origin, in the model E(\u0015; ; );was satis\u0002ed. Indeed the eigenvalues were suf\u0002- ciently negative so as to imply that the joint origin was the unique PSNE. Since the parties did not appear to be positioned at the origin, the likely explanation is that the activist valence functions were signi\u0002cant. 7.3 Empirical Analyses 7.3.1 Elections in Israel Figure 6.3 in the previous chapter showed the estimated positions of the parties in the Israel Knesset, and the electoral distribution, at the time of the 1996 election. Table 7.1 presents summary statistics of this election. The table also shows the valence estimates, based on a multinomial logit model using the assumption of a Type I extreme value distribu- tion on the errors.28The two dimensions of policy deal with attitudes to the PLO (the horizontal axis) and religion (the vertical axis). The policy space was derived from a voter survey (obtained by Arian and Shamir, 1999) and the party positions from analysis of party manifestos (Scho\u0002eld, Sened and Nixon, 1998; Scho\u0002eld and Sened, 2006). Using the formal analysis, we can readily show that the convergence coef\u0002cient of the model greatly exceeds 2 (the dimension of the policy space). In- deed, one of the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the low valence party, the NRP (also called Mafdal), can be shown to be positive. Indeed it is obvi- ous that there is a principal component of the electoral distribution, and this axis is the eigenspace of the positive eigenvalue. It follows that low 28This estimated model correctly predicts 63.8 percent of the voter choices. The log marginal likelihood of the model was \u0000465.180 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections valence parties should position themselves close to this principal axis, as illustrated in the simulation given below in Figure 7.2. Table 7.1.

The spatial coef\u0002cient is = 1:12;so to use Theorem 7.2.2, we note that the valence difference between the NRP and Labor is 4:15\u0000(\u00004:52) = 8:67, while the difference between the NRP and Likud is 3:14\u0000(\u00004:52) = 7:66. Since the electoral variance on the \u0002rst axis is 1.0, and on the second axis it is 0.732, with covariance 0.591, we can compute the characteristic matrix of the NRP at the origin as 7.2.6, Iis the 2 by 2 identity matrix.) From the estimate of CNRP it follows that the two eigenvalues are 2.28 and\u00000:40, giving a saddlepoint, and a value of 3:88for the convergence coef\u0002cient. This exceeds the necessary upper bound of 2. The major eigenvector for the NRP is (1.0, 0.8), and along this axis the NRP vote- share function increases as the party moves away from the origin. The minor, perpendicular axis associated with the negative eigenvalue is given7.3 Empirical Analyses 181 by the vector (1, \u00001.25). Figure 7.2 gives one of the local equilibria in 1996, obtained by simulation of the model. The \u0002gure makes it clear that the local equilibrium positions of all parties lie close to the principal axis through the origin and the point (1.0, 0.8). In all, \u0002ve different LNE were located. However, in all equilibria, the two high valence parties, Labor and Likud, were located close to the positions given in Figure 7.2. The only difference between the various equilibria was that the positions of the low valence parties were perturbations of each other. It is evident that if the high valence party occupies the electoral origin, then all parties with lower valence can compute that their vote-share will increase by moving up or down the principal electoral axis. In seeking local maxima of the vote shares all parties other than the highest valence party should vacate the electoral center. Then, however, the \u0002rst-order condition for the high valence party to occupy the electoral center would not be satis\u0002ed. Even though this party's vote-share will be little affected by the other parties, it too should move from the center. The simulation illustrated in Figure 7.2 make it clear that there is a correlation between a party's valence and the distance of the party's equilibrium position from the electoral mean. A similar analysis is given in Scho\u0002eld and Sened (2006) for the elections of 1992 and 1988. The simulation for 1996 is compatible with the formal analysis: low valence parties, such as the NRP and Shas, in order to maximize vote shares must move far from the electoral center. Their optimal positions will lie either in the \u0093north-east\u0094 quadrant or the \u0093south-west\u0094 quadrant The vote-maximizing model, without any additional information, cannot determine which way the low valence parties should move. In contrast, since the valence difference between Labor and Likud was relatively low, their local equilibrium positions are close to, but not iden- tical to, the electoral mean. Intuitively it is clear that once the low valence parties vacate the origin, then high valence parties, like Likud and Labor, should position themselves almost symmetrically about the origin, and along the principal axis. Clearly, the con\u0002guration of equilibrium party positions will \u0003uctuate as the valence differences of the parties change in response to exogenous shocks. The logic of the model remains valid, however, since the low valence parties will be obliged to adopt relatively \u0093radical\u0094 positions in order to maximize their vote shares.182 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections Figure 7.2: A local Nash equilibrium in the Knesset in 19967.3 Empirical Analyses 183 There is a disparity between the estimated party positions in 1996 given in Figure 6.3 and the simulated equilibrium positions given in Fig- ure 7.2. The two religious parties, Shas and Yahadut, are estimated to be far from the principal axis, seeming in contradiction to the prediction of the stochastic model. Moreover, the high valence parties, Labor and Likud appear further from the origin than suggested by the simulation. This disparity may be accounted for by modifying the assumption that valence is exogenous, and by allowing for the in\u0003uence of activists on party position This version of the model is discussed further in Chapter 8. 7.3.2 Elections in Turkey 1999-2007 In empirical analysis it is dif\u0002cult to estimate the activist valence func- tions. However, it is possible to use socio-demographic variables as prox- ies. Instead of using (7.1) as the estimator for voter utility, we can use the expression uij(xi;zj) =\u0015j\u0000 kxi\u0000zjk2+\u0012T j\u0011i+\"j: (7.18) where thek-vector\u0012jrepresents kdifferent socio- demographic parameters (class, domicile, education, income, etc.) on party jwhile\u0011iis ak-vector of\u0012jso\u0012T j\u0011iis a scalar. When andf\u0015jgare assumed zero then we call the model pure socio-demographic (SD). When \u0012T j\u0011iare assumed zero then the model is called pure spatial , and when all parameters are included then the model is called joint. The differences in log marginal likehoods for two models then gives the Log Bayes' factor for the pair- wise comparison.29This technique can then be used to determine which is the superior model. We can use this model to explain Turkish elec- tion results in 1999 and 2002, given in Tables 7.2 and 7.3. Figures 7.3 and 7.5 show the electoral distributions (based on sample surveys of sizes 635 and 483, respectively) and estimates of party positions for 1999 and 2002. Minor differences between these two \u0002gures include the disappear- 29Since the Bayes' factor for a comparison of two models is simply the ratio of mar- ginal likelihoods, the log of the Bayes factor is the difference in log likelihoods.184 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections ance of the Virtue Party (FP) which was banned by the Constitutional Court in 2001, and the change of the name of the Kurdish party from HADEP to DEHAP. The most important change is the appearance of the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2002. This latter party obtained about 35 percent of the vote and 363 seats out of 550 seats in 2002. Figure 7.4 presents an estimate of the heart in 1999. In 1999, a DSP minority government formed, supported by ANAP and DYP. This only lasted about 4 months, and was replaced by a DSP-ANAP-MHP coalition. During the period 1999\u00962002, Turkey experienced two severe economic crises. As Tables 7.2 and 7.3 show, the vote shares of the par- ties in the governing coalition went from about 53 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2002. In 2002, AKP obtained a majority and so was a core party. Tables 7.5 and 7.6, in the empirical Appendix, present the re- sults of a MNL estimation of these elections.30The estimations include various socio-demographic characteristics such as religious orientation. Note in particular that one of the socio-demographics is \u0093Alevi.\u0094 Alevis belong to a non-Sunni religious/cultural community living in Turkey and in some parts of Iran, and comprise 13-15 percent of the Turkish popu- lation. They are closer to Shia Islam than Sunni Islam but the majority of Shia and Sunni do not regard Alevis as Muslims. Alevis tend to sup- port \u0093Kemalism\u0094 and the secular state and vote for CHP, leading to a Sunni-Alevi tension in the society. The Log Bayes' factors reported in the Appendix show that the joint MNL model is superior to all others. It is noticeable that the valences of the ANAP and MHP dropped from 1999 to 2002. In 1999, the esti- mated\u0015ANAP was\u00000:114, whereas in 2002 it was \u00000:567;while\u0015MHP fell from 2:447to1:714. The estimated valence, \u0015AKP;of the new Jus- tice and Development Party (AKP) in 2002 was 1:968, which we might ascribe to the disillusion of most voters with the other parties, as well as the charisma of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the AKP.31Notice that the coef\u0002cient was 0:456in 1999, and 1:445in 2002, suggesting that electoral preferences over policy had become more intense. The es- 30The estimation is based on a factor analysis of a sample survey conducted by Veri Arastima for TUSES. 31Abdullah Gul became Prime Minister after the November 2002 election because Erdogan was banned from holding of\u0002ce.

The electoral covariance matrix is the 2 by 2 matrix r0=\u0014 1:2 0:78 0:78 1:14\u0015 : As Table 7.5 shows, the coef\u0002cient is 0:456;while the party with the lowest valence is CHP with \u0015CHP =\u00000:673. When all parties are located at the origin, the probability, \u001aCHP;that a voter chooses CHP is equal to [1+exp(0:559)+exp(1 :136)+exp(1 :688)+exp(0 :059)+exp(3 :1]\u00001 CHP is CCHP = [2 (1\u00002\u001aCHP)(r0)\u0000I]:188 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of 2 by 2 identity matrix. The Theorem also shows that the necessary condition for convergence is that the convergence coef\u0002cient, c= [1\u00002\u001aCHP]trace (r0) eigenvalue of CCHP must be nega- tive. It is easy to show that the eigenvalues of CCHP are+0:679and \u00000:664. The eigenvector corresponding to the second minor eigenvector is ( +1:0;\u00001:04). The \u0002rst eigenvector corresponds to the principal electoral component, or eigenspace, alligned at approximately 45 degrees to the religion axis. On this principal axis, the vote share of the CHP increases as it moves away from the electoral origin. The minor, perpendicular axis is aligned at right angles to the \u0002rst, and on this axis, the vote share of the CHP decreases as it moves away from the origin. Clearly the origin is a sad- dlepoint, and we can expect all parties to align themselves close to the principal axis. Many of the parties are so aligned in Figure 7.4. The fact that some of the parties are located off this axis can be attributed to the in\u0003uence of activists. The 2002 Election The empirical model given in Table 7.6 estimates the electoral variance on the \u0002rst axis (religion) to be 1:18while the elec- toral variance is on the second axis 1:15, with the covariance between the two axes shows, the coef\u0002cient is 1:445;while the party with the lowest valence is ANAP with \u0015ANAP =\u00000:567.7.3 Empirical Analyses 189 Because we use the Type I distribution, when all parties are located at the origin, the probability, \u001aANAP;that a voter chooses ANAP is given by [1 Hessian of the vote share function of ANAP (when all parties are at the origin is CANAP [1\u00002\u001aANAP ]trace (r0) = 2\u00021:39\u00022:33 = 6:48: This greatly exceeds the upper bound of 2:0for convergence to the elec- toral origin. The major eigenvalue for the ANAP is 4:30, with eigenvector (+1:10;+1:0)while eigenvalue is 0:18, with orthogonal eigen- vector (\u00001:0;+1:10):In this case, the electoral origin is a minimum of the vote share function of ANAP. As before, the \u0002rst eigenvector corre- sponds to the principal electoral component, or eigenspace, alligned at approximately 45 degrees to the religion axis. On both principal and mi- nor axis, the vote share of ANAP increases as it moves away from the electoral origin, but because the major eigenvalue is much larger than the minor, we can expect some of the parties in equilibrium to adopt posi- tions far from the principal electoral axis. Figure 7.5 is consistent with this inference. In the 2007 election, the Kurdish Party (now called the Freedom and Solidarity Party, DTP) contested the election as independents, and thus were not subject to the 10 percent cut-off, and were able to win 24 seats. As Table 7.4 shows, the AKP took 46.6 percent of the vote and 340 seats, re\u0003ecting the continuing high valence of Erdogan.

There are four main parties: Labor (PvdA), Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Liberals (VVD) and Democrats (D'66), with approximately 35 percent, 35 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent of the popular vote. Table 6.6 in Chapter 6 gave the Na- tional V ote shares for the parties in 1977 and 1981, as well as the sample vote-share from the Eurobarometer survey. The table also gave the va- lences for an MNL model based on the positions of the parties as shown in Figure 7.6. This \u0002gure gives the estimated positions of the parties based on the middle level Elites Study. As in Figure 6.3, an estimate of the density contours of the electoral distribution of voter bliss points is also shown, based on the voter survey. The empirical model estimated exogenous valences, which were nor- malized, 32The Independent, 29 September 2007. 33Twenty-four of these \u0093independents\u0094 were in fact members of the DTP\u0096the Kurdish Freedom and Solidarity Party.7.3 Empirical Analyses 191 other valences are \u0015V V D = 1:015;\u0015CDA = 1:403and\u0015PvdA = 1:596:To compute the D'66 Hessian, we note that electoral variance on the \u0002rst axis is\u001b2 1= 0:658, while The covariance (\u001b1;\u001b2)is negligible. the model with exogenous va- lence. Thus the probability of voting for each of the parties, as well as the Hessians when all parties are at the origin, can be calculated as follows: the convergence coef\u0002cient exceeds 1.0, so the suf\u0002cient condition, given by Corollary 7.2.2 is not satis\u0002ed, the necessary condi- tion of Corollary 7.2.1 is satis\u0002ed, and the eigenvalues for the Hessian of D'66 can be seen to be negative. By Theorem 7.2.2, the joint origin is an LSNE for the stochastic model with exogenous valence. In a similar way, we can compute the other probabilities, giving (\u001aD66;\u001aV V D;\u001aCDA;\u001aPvdA) = (0:078;0:217;0:319;0:386): This vector can be identi\u0002ed as the expected vote shares of the parties when all occupy the electoral origin. Note also that these expected vote shares are very similar to the sample vote shares (S\u0003 D66;S\u0003 V V D;S\u0003 CDA;S\u0003 PvdA) = (0:104;0:189;0:338;0:0:369); as well as the average of the national vote shares in the two elections.

Quinn and Martin (2002) performed a simulation of the empirical model and showed that the joint origin was indeed a PSNE for the vote-maximizing model with the exogenous valence values estimated by the MNL model. Moreover, the positions given in Figure 7.6 could not be an LSNE of the stochastic model with exogenous valence alone. This con\u0003ict between the predicted equilibrium positions of the model and the estimated positions suggest that the activists for the parties played an important role in determining the party positions. Although we do not have data available on the activist valences for the parties, these empirical results indicate that Theorem 7.2.1 is compatible with the following two hypotheses: (i)the party positions given in Figure 7.6 are a close approximation to the actual positions of the parties; (ii)each party was at a Nash equilibrium position in an electoral contest involving a balance for each party between the centripetal marginal electoral pull for the party and the centrifugal marginal activist pull on the party. We now examine this possibility further in the case of recent elections in Britain. 7.3.4 The Election in the United Kingdom in 1997 Figure 7.7 shows the estimated positions of the parties, based on a survey of Party MPs in 1997 (Scho\u0002eld, 2005a,b). In addition to the Conser- vative Party (CONS), Labor34Party (LAB) and Liberal Democrat Party (LIB) responses were obtained from Ulster Unionists (UU), Scottish Na- tionalists (SNP) and Plaid Cymru (PC). The \u0002rst axis is economic, the second axis concerned attitudes to the European Union (pro to the \u0093south\u0094 of the vertical axis). The electoral model with exogenous valence was es- timated for the election \u001alib=e0 e0+e1:24+e0:97=1 spelling for this party.194 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections Figure 7.7: Party positions in the United Kingdom Since the electoral variance is 1.0 on the \u0002rst economic axis and 1.5 on the European axis, we obtain Alib= (1\u00002\u001alib) +0:08\u0013 : The convergence coef\u0002cient can be calculated to be 1.8. Although the necessary condition is satis\u0002ed, the origin is clearly a saddlepoint for the Liberal Democrat Party. Note that the second \u0093European\u0094 axis is a \u0093principal electoral axis\u0094 exhibiting greater electoral variance. This axis is the eigenvector associated with the positive eigenvalue. Because the covariance between the two electoral axes is negligible, we can infer that, for each party, the eigenvalue of the Hessian at the origin is negative on the \u0002rst or minor \u0093economic\u0094 axis. According to the formal model with7.4 The In\u0003uence of Activists 195 exogenous valence, all parties should have converged to the origin on this minor axis. Because the eigenvalue for the Liberal Democrat Party is positive on the second axis, we have an explanation for its position away from the origin on the Europe axis in Figure 7.7. However there is no explanation for the location of the Conservative Party so far from the origin on both axes. Scho\u0002eld (2005a,b) offers a model (based on an earlier version of Theorem 7.2.2) where the falling exogenous valence of the Conservative Party leader increases the marginal importance of two opposed activist groups in the party: one group \u0093pro-capital\u0094 and one group \u0093anti-Europe.\u0094 The next section comments on this observation. 7.4 The In\u0003uence of Activists The empirical analysis discussed in the previous section showed that overall Conservative valence dropped from 1.58 in 1992 to 1.24 in 1997, while the Labor valence increased from 0.58 to 0.97. These estimated valences include both exogenous valence terms for the parties and the ac- tivist component. Recent studies of these elections35suggest that when Tony Blair took over from John Smith as leader of the Labor Party, then the exogenous valence, \u0015lab;;of the party increased up to the 1997 elec- tion. Conversely, the exogenous valence, \u0015con, for the Conservatives fell. Since the coef\u0002cients in the equation for the electoral pull for the Con- servative Party depend on \u0015con\u0000\u0015lab, Theorem 7.2.1 implies that the effect would be to increase the marginal effect of activism for the Con- servative Party, thus pulling the optimal position away from the party's weighted electoral mean. The opposite conclusion holds for the Labor Party, since increasing \u0015lab\u0000\u0015conhas the effect of reducing the marginal activist effect. Indeed, it is possible to include the effect of two potential activist groups for the Labor Party: one \u0093pro-Europe,\u0094 called E, and one \u0093pro- labor,\u0094 called L. The optimal Labor position will be determined by a ver- 35For an empirical analysis of the election of 2005 see Clarke, Sanders, Stewart and Whiteley (2006).

This locus is where the joint marginal activist pull is zero. This locus of points can be called the \u0093activist contract curve\u0094 for the Conservative Party. The next chapter develops an activist model of this kind, where pref- erences of different activists on the two dimensions may accord different saliences to the policy axes. The \u0093activist contract curves\u0094 for the two parties will be catenaries that depend on the ratios of the saliences that different activists have on the two dimensions. According to Theorem 7.2.1, the reason the Labor Party under Blair was able to move to a position closer to the origin between the elections of 1992 and 1997 was that his increasing valence reduced the importance of pro-labor activists in the party. On the other hand, the declining va- lences of the Conservative Party leaders, \u0002rst William Hague, and then Iain Duncan Smith, increased the importance of the marginal activist ef- fect for the party. This appears to have the effect of obliging the party to move to the fairly extreme position shown in Figure 7.7. Figure 7.8 gives a schematic representation of the balance loci of the two parties and the change in party positioning over recent decades. It remains to be seen whether the new leader, David Cameron, can gain high enough valence in contrast to the new leader of Labor, Gor- don Brown, to overcome the apparent dominant in\u0003uence of anti-Europe activist sentiment in the party.7.4 The In\u0003uence of Activists 197 198 Chapter 7. A Spatial Model of Elections 7.5 Concluding Remarks The above discussion of the possible role of activists is developed only for the case of two parties and two potential activist groups for the two parties. The model is developed further in the next two chapters. Theo- retically it should be possible to carry out the analysis for any number of parties, and an arbitrary number of potential interest groups.7.6 Empirical Appendix 199 7.6 Empirical Appendix Table 7.5 .

Theorem 7.2 covers the speci\u0002c situation when activist valence is identically zero, so that only exogenous valence is rel- evant. This theorem provides the necessary and suf\u0002cient conditions for convergence of all parties to the electoral center. It is proposed here that in Argentina in 1989, the necessary condition failed, leading to diver- gence of the positions of the two major parties. Once the parties were seen to adopt different positions, then activists were motivated to pro- vide resources to the party most attractive to them. Such support then tends to drive the parties further apart. Theorems 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 in the previous chapter suggest that PNE for a vote-maximizing game need not exhibit convergence of party po- sition, particularly when activist in\u0003uence is pronounced. This chapter applies Theorem 7.1 to an examination of how a party's equilibrium po- sition will be affected when it responds to different activists groups with contradictory agendas. As the intensity of support from a group of ac- tivists increases, the party leader will consider the bene\u0002ts of moving along a \u0093balance locus\u0094 between them and an opposed group of ac- tivists. In particular, when there are two dimensions of policy, these strategic moves by the parties in response to activist support will induce a rotation of the party positions. These transformations bring about a change in the most salient dimension of policy, thus inducing a political \u0093realignment.\u0094 The model is applied to the case of Argentinian elections in 1989\u0096 203204 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions 1995, because of the deep transformations that occurred in a very short period of time. Indeed, between 1989 and 1995, Argentina's polity ex- perienced: (i) the saliency of a new dimension, namely the value of its currency, (ii) a sharp change in the population's perception of the rela- tive \u0093quality\u0094 of the two major parties, the PJ and the UCR, and (iii) the emergence of a potent activist group, in the form of the recently priva- tized \u0002rms and their political allies. 8.1 Activist Support and Valence To develop the model, consider competition between two parties, 1 and 2, in a policy space with w= 2;where party 1 has traditionally been on the left of the economic (x)axis, and party 2 on the right of the same axis. The model examines the effect of the second (y)axis of policy by using the work presented by Miller and Scho\u0002eld (2003), based on \u0093ellipsoidal\u0094 utility functions of potential activist groups. In the application to the Argentine polity presented in the next section, the y-axis will represent policy in support of a hard or a soft currency. Consider the \u0002rst-order equationd\u00161 dz= 0;for maximizing the total valence of 1 when there are two activist groups, L, H, whose preferred points are, say, L; H; and whose utility functions are uLanduH:The contributions of the groups to party 1 are \u0006Land\u0006H:The model uses the following set of assumptions. Assumption 8.1.1. Valence Functions. (i)The total activist valence for contributions \u0006L;\u0006Hcan be written as functions of the utilities of the activist groups, so \u0006L(z1) = \u0006 L(uL(z1))and\u0006H(z1) = \u0006 H(uH(z1)): (8.2) Note that there is no presumption that these functions are linear.8.1 Activist Support and Valence 205 (iii) The gradients of the contribution functions allz;and are differentiable functions equation becomes d\u00161 dz=\u0014 (8.5) H(z)>0. Since these are assumed to be differentiable functions of z;this equation generates the smooth one-dimensional con- tract curve associated with the utility functions of the activist groups. The solution to the \u0002rst-order equation will be a point on the contract curve that depends on the various coef\u0002cient functions f \u0003 L; \u0003\u0003 L; various activist coef\u0002cients are left unspeci\u0002ed. They are determined by the response of activist groups to policy positions. Assumptions 8.1.1.(i)-(iv) are quite natural. They posit that the utility gradient of the activist group dictates the gradient of each contribution function, which in turn gives the direction of most rapidly increasing valence for party 1. To apply this analysis, suppose that an economic activist, situated on the left of the economic axis, with preferred point L= (xl;yl)has a utility function uL(x;y)based on the of the =A\u0000\u0012(x\u0000xl)2 a2+(y\u0000yl)2 b2\u0013 : (8.6) Assuming that a<b means that such an activist is more concerned with economic policy than currency issues. We also suppose that a hard cur-206 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions rency activist with preferred point H= (xh;yh)has a utility function uH of the form uH(x;y) =B\u0000\u0012(x\u0000xh)2 e2+(y\u0000yh)2 f2\u0013 : (8.7) Assuming that f <e means that such an activist is more concerned with currency policy than with issues on the x-axis. The contract curve gener- ated by these utility functions is given by the equation \u0014 LduL dz+ H)6= (0;0):Using this expression it can be shown that the \u0093contract curve,\u0094 between the point (xl;yl)and the point (xh;yh);generated by the utility functions is given by the equation (x\u0000xl) a2b2 (y\u0000yl)=(x\u0000xh) e2f2 (y\u0000yh): between the two activist groups, centered at Land H, is a catenary , whose curvature is determined by the \u0093salience ratios\u0094 (b a;e f)of the utility functions of the activist groups. By (8.17), this cate- nary can be interpreted as the closure of the one-dimensional locus of points given by the \u0002rst-order condition for maximizing the total va- lence\u00161(z1) =\u0016L(\u0006L(z1)) +\u0016H(\u0006H(z1));generated by the contribu- tions (\u0006L;\u0006H)offered by the two groups of activists. This locus is called the activist catenary for 1. Note that while a posi- tion of candidate 1 on this catenary satis\u0002es the \u0002rst-order condition for maximizing the total valence function it need not maximize vote-share. In fact, maximization of vote-share requires considering the marginal electoral effect. From Theorem 7.2.1, the \u0002rst-order condition is given by the balance equation for candidate 1: \u0014dE\u0003 The coef\u0002cient functions, f L; Hg;depend on the various gradient coef- \u0002cients introduced under Assumption 8.1.1, and are explicitly written as functions of z\u0003 1:For \u0002xedz2, the locus of points satisfying this equation is called the balance locus for 1. It is also a one-dimensional smooth cate- nary, and is obtained by shifting the contract curve for the activists (who are centered at LandH)towards the weighted electoral mean of party 1. Notice, for example, that if \u0003 H(z1);the coef\u0002cient that determines the willingness of the currency activist group to contribute, is high, then this group will have a signi\u0002cant in\u0003uence on the position of candidate 1. Obviously, the particular solution z\u0003 1on this balance locus depends on the second-order condition on the Hessian of the vote function E1;and this will depend on the various coef\u0002cients and ondE\u0003 1 dz1:Moreover, by The- orem 7.2.1, the weighted electoral mean of 1 depends on the weighted electoral coef\u0002cients [ i1] =\u0014\u001ai1(1\u0000\u001ai1) \u0006v k=1(\u001ak1(1\u0000\u001ak1)\u0015 (8.12) and thus on the valence functions as well as the location of the opposition candidate. Candidate 1 can, in principle, determine the best response to z2by trial and error. By the implicit function theorem, we can write z\u0003 1(z2)for the best response , or solution to the balance equation for 1, at \u0002xedz2: In the same way, if there are two activist groups for party 2, centered at R= (xr;yr)andS= (xs;ys)with utility functions based on between the point (xr;yr)and the point (xs;ys) is given by the equation (y\u0000yr) 8. Activist Coalitions where 2=h2 g2r2 s2: (8.16) As before, this contract curve gives the \u0002rst-order condition for maximiz- ing the valence function \u00162(z2) =\u0016R(\u0006R(z2)) +\u0016S(\u0006S(z2)) (8.17) and can be identi\u0002ed with the for 2, dz+ S(z)duS dz\u0015 = 0: (8.18) Again, this expression is derived from the utility functions uRanduSfor the activist groups located at RandSrespectively. The locus of points on which vote-share is maximized is given by the balance locus for before, this locus is obtained by shifting the activist contract curve for 2, to adjust to the electoral pull for the party. The coef\u0002cients will be determined by the second-order condition on E2: Assumption 8.1.2. Concavity of Valences. The contribution functions \u0006L;\u0006Hare assumed to be concave in z1, and the contribution functions \u0006R;\u0006Sare assumed concave in z2:It is further assumed that the valences \u0016L;\u0016H;\u0016R;\u0016Sare concave functions of \u0006L;\u0006H;\u0006R;\u0006Srespectively. These assumptions imply that the total activist valence functions \u00161(z1) = =\u0016L(\u0006L(uL(z1))) +\u0016H(\u0006H(uH(z1))) (8.20) (8.21) are concave functions of z1;z2;respectively. These assumptions appear natural because (i) the utility functions of the activist groups for both 1 and 2 are concave in z;and (ii) the effect of contributions on activist valence can be expected to exhibit decreasing returns.8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 209 In this case of two activist groups for each of two parties, the pair of positions (z\u0003 1;z\u0003 2)satisfying the above balance loci gives lution speci\u0002ed in Theorem 7.2.1. This theorem, together with the above assumptions, can then be used to obtain a suf\u0002cient condition for ex- istence of PNE. Indeed, once the parameters of the activist groups are determined, then existence and location of the LNE can be ascertained. Indeed, as the Theorem asserts, if the activist functions are suf\u0002ciently concave, then the LNE will in fact be PNE. The same technique can be used when there are more than two activist groups for each candidate. As noted above, we can write z\u0003 1(z2)for the locus of points satisfying the balance equation for 1 at \u0002xed z2:This balance locus given by the functionz\u0003 1(z2)will lie in a domain bounded by the contract curve of the activists who contribute to party 1. A similar argument gives the balance locusz\u0003 2(z1), which again will lie in a domain bounded by the contract curve of the activists who contribute to 2. Both z\u0003 1(z2)andz\u0003 2(z1)can be regarded as solution submanifolds of W2, wherez\u0003 i(zj)2W2iffz\u0003 iis a best response to zj:Then these solution submanifolds are generically two-dimensional submanifolds of W2. Transversality arguments can be used to show that these will generically intersect in a zero-dimensional vector, or set of vectors (Scho\u0002eld, 2003a). There may be many \u0002rst- order solutions, but the assumption of suf\u0002cient concavity of the total valence functions gives a balance solution which is a PNE. The same argument can be carried out for an arbitrary number of parties (Scho\u0002eld, 2001). 8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 The main contenders in Argentina's 1989 presidential election were Car- los Menem, the candidate of the PJ ( Partido Justicialista ) and Union Civica Radical ). Angeloz had the disadvantage of coming from the same political party as the president in of\u0002ce, forced to call an election in 1989 because of hyperin\u0003ation. Angeloz's platform was located in the center-right of the economic axis of the political space. His most important proposal was the so-called \u0093red pen,\u0094 to reduce the size of the state apparatus in an attempt at \u0002scal austerity.210 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions Menem was a charismatic, populist candidate, but lacked a sound po- litical platform. His platform, such as it was, included a universal rise in salaries ( salariazo ) and an emphasis on the productive sector ( revolucion productiva ). This platform, clearly located in the left of the economic axis, gave Menem broad support from the working class, and constituted the key to his electoral victory. Surprisingly, once in of\u0002ce Menem adopted policies that were the op- posite of his electoral promises, including the liberalization of trade, the privatization of several state companies, a freeze of public salaries and the deregulation of the markets. Also, in 1991 Menem established a currency board, the so-called \u0093Convertibility Plan,\u0094 which succeeded in controlling hyperin\u0003ation. This provided the basis for four years of macroeconomic stability and growth. However, the Convertibility Plan proved to be vulnerable to both ex- ogenous \u0093contagion\u0094 and \u0002scal imbalances and led to a progressive ap- preciation of the Argentinean currency. This currency appreciation cre- ated both losers and winners in the polity. Among the latter were the re- cently privatized \u0002rms (seeking to maximize the value of their assets and pro\u0002ts denominated in dollars) and most of the upper middle class, who came to enjoy the bene\u0002ts of inexpensive imported goods. The losers consisted of the export-oriented sector, together with many small and medium-sized \u0002rms and their employees, who could not survive the ap- preciation of the peso and the liberalization of the economy. Menem was re-elected in 1995, with a manifesto promising to main- tain the administration's economic policy. Because he had broken the electoral promises of 1989, Menem lost about 15 percent of the leftist votes. However, because of the high standard of living achieved during Menem's administration, the gain in upper-middle-class votes compen- sated for the working-class defection. In 1995 Menem took approxi- mately 50 percent of the vote, with about 70 percent of his share coming from the traditional working-class constituency of the PJ, and about 30 percent from other constituencies, mainly voters who had previously cho- sen the UCR (Gervasoni, 1997). The win for Menem was partly due to his newly acquired vote from the middle class, and partly due to the rel- ative success of a new party, the FREPASO (with 29 percent). Minor parties took 4.6 percent and the UCR suffered a great defeat (with only 17 percent of the vote).8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 211 This sequence of events is at odds with the electoral models used to analyze elections. First, the policy positions of the main parties in 1989 seems to contradict the \u0093mean voter theorem.\u0094 This theorem predicts the convergence of the candidates to the electoral center. Second, Menem's policy positions in 1989 and 1995 were very different. In particular, the position that won him the election in 1995 led to considerable economic bene\u0002ts for a constituency that was opposed to him in 1989. The aim of this chapter is two-fold. The \u0002rst intention is to use the theory presented above to explain a \u0093paradox,\u0094 which is contrary to gen- erally accepted theory: As discussed in the previous chapter, actual polit- ical systems generally display divergence rather than convergence . The case of the presidential elections in Argentina in the 1989 and 1995 is a good example of such divergence. The second aim to present a theory of the kind of \u0093political realignment\u0094 (Sundquist, 1973) that occurred be- tween these elections in Argentina, with a view to understanding such realignments more generally. Perhaps more importantly, the model sug- gests that there may well be a high degree of contingency over whether a populist leader or a right\u0096wing political candidate comes to power in presidential polities that resemble Argentina in the distribution of elec- toral preferences. Such polities include many in Latin America, as indi- cated by recent events in Mexico and Bolivia. Prior to the election of 1989, Argentina was under the administration of the UCR and in the grip of hyperin\u0003ation. Carlos Menem, the candi- date for the opposition party, PJ, adopted a populist platform well to the left of the electoral center on the traditional left\u0096right axis. Menem pro- posed typical redistributive policies in favor of the working class coupled with incentives to the \u0093productive sector\u0094 of the economy. In contrast, the platform proposed by Angeloz, of the UCR, focused on \u0002scal dis- cipline and a reduced role of the state. Thus, a one-dimensional policy space seems a reasonable approximation to Argentina in 1989.36 The results in Chapter 7 suggest that there are two different cases de- pending on the parameters of the model. First, suppose that the convergence coef\u0002cient c= 2 (1\u00002\u001a)\u001b2is 36This standard, unidimensional, model of voting has been widely used in the recent literature. For example, see Osborne and Slivinski (1996); Bueno de Robinson (2005); and Herrera, Levine and Martinelli (2005).212 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions bounded above by the dimension of the policy space, w= 1. In this case, we say that the critical condition is satis\u0002ed. If the exogenous valences are very similar (with j\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCRjclose to zero), then the vote-share, \u001a;of both parties will be close to1 2, andcwill be close to 0. With just two parties, the critical condition is given by \u0014 0\u0011[exp(\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCR) + 1] 2\u001b2[exp(\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCR)\u00001]: (8.22) Note that if \u0015PJapproaches\u0015UCR;then 0approaches 1so the critical condition is always satis\u0002ed. For the sake of exposition we consider only two parties, but a similar critical condition can be obtained for an arbitrary number of parties. In fact, in 1989 three candidates contested the election. Angeloz obtained 37 percent of the votes, Menem 47 percent, and Alsogaray, a rightist candidate, about 6 percent. Consider Figure 8.1, in which we assume a distribution of voter bliss points whose mean is the electoral origin. The left\u0096right axis is termed the \u0093labor\u0096capital\u0094 axis in the \u0002gure. The vertical axis may be ignored by the moment. The estimated strategies of the PJ and UCR in the 1989 election are represented by the points PJ89\u0003andUCR 89\u0003, respectively. Prior to the election, we may suppose that j\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCRjwas indeed close to zero. In a model without activists there would be no reason for either party to vacate the center. Notice, however, that a perturbation in the valences of the parties, so that j\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCRj 6= 0;will induce a move by the low valence party away from the origin whenever > 0: In this second situation let us assume that \u0015PJ>\u0015 UCR. By Theorem 7.2.2, if both the electoral variance \u001b2and the spatial coef\u0002cient are large enough, then the low valence party, the UCR, should retreat from the origin, in order to increase its vote-share. Thus the position near to UCR 89\u0003is compatible with Theorem 2. However, because \u0015PJ> \u0015 UCR, it follows that if the UCR could not obtain electoral support from activists then it would lose the election. The consequence will be that both PJ and UCR should move further apart, in opposite directions away from the electoral origin, to obtain increasing support from the left activists, at L(for the PJ) and from the conser- vative activists at R(for the UCR). The vote-maximizing equilibrium 89\u0003)results from moves to balance the8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 213 214 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions attraction of the weighted electoral mean and the in\u0003uence of the ac- tivists. Menem's higher valence, together with populist support from the left activists at Lgave him the electoral victory. The pointLcan be taken to be the preferred policy of the working- class \u0093syndical\u0094 leaders, who provided key support for Menem's 1989 electoral victory. Because the choices of the syndical leaders were fol- lowed by a large part of the Argentinean working class, the effect of this support, represented by the valence function \u0016L;was pronounced. This explains why Menem's strategy against a discredited UCR was far to the left, as indicated in Figure 8.1. This analysis seems to be a fairly accu- rate description of Argentina's polity for the election of 1989. We now use the model to analyze the events after 1989, leading up to the 1995 election. The main issue is whether Menem's drastic and successful reposition- ing after the 1989 election can be explained by this model. Until hyper- in\u0003ation was defeated, any debate regarding the optimal real exchange rate was fruitless. Thus, it was not until Menem's Convertibility Plan stabilized the level of prices that the currency issue gained signi\u0002cant saliency. Because the Convertibility Plan was successful against hyper- in\u0003ation through \u0002xing the nominal rate of exchange of the Argentinean peso in a 1-to-1 ratio to the American dollar, the currency issue naturally ended up focusing on the Convertibility Plan itself. The Convertibility Plan became most salient during the Mexican crisis, popularly known as \u0093Tequila,\u0094 in December 1994. Because the next presidential election (in which Menem would seek his re-election) was scheduled for May 1995, the issue dominated the electoral debate. The vertical axis in Figure 8.1 represents the policy options in this new axis, which will be called the \u0093currency dimension.\u0094 Two groups gained from the Convertibility Plan. The European \u0002rms that won most of the privatization concessions of Argentinean companies bene\u0002ted from the progressive appreciation of the peso after 1991 via the increased value in their assets and pro\u0002ts. Though these originated in Argentina, they were denominated in dollars. The upper middle class bene\u0002ted from this policy too, since it enjoyed a consumption boom of foreign goods and the reappearance of credit after so many years of high in\u0003ation. The main losers from the Convertibility Plan were those small and8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 215 medium entrepreneurs, and their employees, who could not overcome the dif\u0002culties associated with the appreciation of the Argentinean currency and the liberalization of the economy.37 Among all groups affected by the value of the currency, the privatized companies had the greatest potential as an effective activist group. This was a consequence of their small number, their large pool of \u0002nancial resources and their lobbying power. On the other hand, any attempt at activism against the Plan by either small and medium entrepreneurs and their employees had to overcome their collective action problem. Consider again the positions PJ89\u0003andUCR 89\u0003on either side of, and approximately equidistant from, the electoral origin as in Figure 8.1. The \u0002gure also gives balance loci for the PJ and UCR in 1989 and 1995. These balance loci can be derived from the four different activist groups centered atL,H,RandS. To apply this model developed previously, consider a move by Menem along the balance locus from position PJ89\u0003to positionPJ95\u0003. By such a move, Menem would certainly gain the support of the activists located atH, while losing some of the political contributions of erst- while supporters located at L. While \u0006Lwould fall, \u0006Hwould increase. Because of the higher marginal gain of the hard currency activists, we expect\u0016L+\u0016Hto increase. This reasoning is reinforced by the assump- tion of concavity of each activist valence function, since this implies that d\u0016H dzPJwould be positive and high, andd\u0016L dzPJwould be negative, but of low modulus, as the PJposition moves along the balance locus away from L: Menem's overall exogenous valence was high in 1995 for two rea- sons. First, a large proportion of the electorate still regarded Menem as the guardian of the working-class interests, mainly because his party, thePartido Justicialista, was associated with the iconic \u0002gures of Juan Domingo and Evita Peron, revered by the working class. Second, the absolute success of the Convertibility Plan in controlling hyperin\u0003ation had the effect of increasing Menem's exogenous valence because he ap- peared to be the only politician who could solve what appeared to be the most dif\u0002cult problem facing the country. The increased exogenous va- 37The rate of unemployment peaked at 18 percent in 1995, the year in which the Tequila affected the Argentinean economy.216 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions lence shifted the balance locus for Menem towards the origin, while the emergence of the hard currency activist group, in turn, induced Menem to move along the one-dimensional balance locus, from PJ89\u0003toPJ95\u0003. These effects are illustrated in Figure 8.1.38 Conversely, the exogenous increase in \u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCR shifted the UCR balance locus towards the contract curve between the activist positions, RandS. The model suggests that this change would imply an optimal position for the UCR at a position such as UCR 95\u0003\u0003in Figure 8.1. In- deed, the drop in UCR valence led to a search for disaffected voters in the \u0093north-west\u0094 region of the \u0002gure. A centrist position for the UCR, say atUCR 95\u0003, would not cause centrist voters to choose the UCR with high probability (because of the higher exogenous valence of Menem). This suggests that (PJ95\u0003;UCR 95\u0003\u0003)is a local equilibrium, in the sense that each position is a best response to the opposition position. With the assumption of suf\u0002cient concavity, this pair of positions would be a PNE. Two candidate slates were opposed to one another in the UCR pri- maries for 1995. The Storani\u0096Terragno slate adopted a position similar toUCR 95\u0003\u0003in the \u0002gure, which the model suggests is an optimal re- sponse toPJ95\u0003. The other slate, Massaccesi\u0096Hernandez, adopted the positionUCR 95\u0003in the \u0002gure. The model suggests that this was not a best response. Because of its low exogenous valence, severely aggravated by events between 1989 and 1995, the UCR could not win with such a centrist position. The Massaccesi\u0096Hernandez slate won the primaries, so the UCR po- sition can be represented by UCR 95\u0003:The UCR suffered a historical de- feat, obtaining only 17 percent of the vote. Moreover, the candidate Jose Octavio Bordon, the candidate for a new party, FREPASO, outperformed UCR, with 29 percent of the vote. His position, denoted FREPASO 95 in Figure 8.1, was close to UCR 95\u0003\u0003, although somewhat to the left on the economic axis. The electoral data for the 1989 and the 1995 elections are consistent with the change of electoral support for Menem implied by the model. Among the voters with low to moderate income, Menem's support de- creased from 63 percent to 59 percent. Among the voters of middle and 38Seligson (2003) and Szusterman (1996) discuss the electoral platforms of PJ, UCR and FREPASO in the 1995 election. Their estimates and those presented in Figure 8.1 are broadly consistent.8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 217 upper middle income, it increased from 40 percent to 49 percent and from 38 percent to 47 percent, respectively. Finally, among the upper class voters, it increased from 13 percent to 42 percent (Gervasoni, 1997). To- gether, the vote proportions gave Menem 50 percent of the overall vote. It is crucial for this analysis that there were indeed two dimensions of policy. If the distribution of voter bliss points displayed high covariance between the two axes in Figure 8.1, then the contract curves between R andSand between LandHwould be degenerate. To test the validity of this assumption, Scho\u0002eld and Cataife (2007) examined a data set on Argentinean presidential elections for the period 1983\u00961999.39This data set contained the following information: (i)actual vote in the presidential elections of 1989 and 1995 and inten- tion of vote for 1999. (ii)the voter socio-demographical variables. (iii) responses to several issue questions regarding the opinion of the \u0093subject\u0094 on particular policy issues. These included the subject's degree of agreement regarding the Convertibility Plan at the time of the survey. Applying factor analysis techniques to the issue questions gave an esti- mate of the position (or bliss point) of each voter in a space of reduced dimension. One of the fundamental premises of the model presented here is that the Convertibility Plan emerged around 1995 as a new dimension in the Argentinean polity. A principal-components factor model, based on the Arromer survey data, was used to test this premise. Using the 10 issue questions in the survey, four factors were obtained and given the following interpretations: Factor 1 represented the standard \u0093economic redistribution\u0094 dimension (whether extra social assistance should be provided, whether food and education should be taxed, etc.). Factor 2 re\u0003ected attitudes to the Convertibility Plan. An additional factor 3, representing the dimension associated with \u0093eco- 39The data set Arromer [TOP045(1998) in the Roper Center Archive] is based on a national poll conducted by the survey organization Graciela Romer & Asociados, with face to face methodology, and sample size of 1,203 respondents.218 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions nomic structural reforms\u0094 (labor market \u0003exibility, privatization and other related policies), was not salient for the 1995 election, since by that time most of the structural reforms had been already implemented. A fac- tor 4 representing the standard \u0093social\u0094 dimension (human rights, order vs. freedom, etc.) but had little salience, particularly after 1990 when the main policy issue on human rights was abruptly ended by President Menem's pardon for those responsible for the violations of human rights during the dictatorships of the 1970s. Factors 1 and 2 can be interpreted as the orthogonal axes of the under- lying policy space de\u0002ning the election of 1995. Factor 1 corresponds to the Labor/Capital axis, which can be called econ; while factor 2 corre- sponds to the currency axis, which can be called cur. This preliminary analysis of the formal model seems to capture the essence of the Argen- tinean political economy circa 1995. Figure 8.2 presents an estimate of the distribution of voter positions in the space of reduced dimension given by factors 1 and 2. The central electoral domain shows the estimated probability density function of the voter distribution, while the dots are individual bliss points outside the central domain. Clearly the electoral covariance matrix r0generated by these data exhibits little covariance, implying that r0has insigni\u0002cant off-diagonal terms. The the electoral the labor/capital axis slightly exceeded the the currency axis, while the covariance (\u001bcur;\u001becon)was0:If indeed j\u0015PJ\u0000\u0015UCRjwere close to zero, then, for the exogenous valence model, Corollary 7.2.2 implies conver- gence to the electoral mean. Because of the lack of evidence for con- vergence, it can be assumed that \u0015PJ> \u0015 UCR:Theorem 7.2.2, for the model with exogenous valence, suggests that the Hessian, CUCR;at the joint origin, has two positive eigenvalues, corresponding to a minimum of the vote-share function for the UCR. The model with exogenous va- lence alone then gives local equilibrium positions for the PJ and the UCR on opposite sides of the economic axis, with the PJ position closer to the origin than the UCR position. The estimate of both the PJ and UCR positions in 1995 is at odds with this inference. This suggests that the estimated locations of (PJ95\u0003;UCR 95\u0003\u0003)in Figure 8.1 are indeed compatible with the activist valence model, and that Menem was able to use his high exogenous valence to take advantage of the saliency of the currency issue.8.2 Argentina's Electoral Dynamics: 1989\u00961995 219 220 Chapter 8. Activist Coalitions 8.3 Concluding Remarks This chapter has presented a general activist model of elections and used it to analyze the complex Argentinean polity in 1989\u00961995. The success of the Convertibility Plan in controlling hyperin\u0003ation changed three of the political variables in the Argentinean polity: (i) it critically altered the relative valence of the two main parties, (ii) it intro- duced a second dimension, and (iii) it created a strong activist group. These changes are compatible with the model proposed here, and can be used to account for the seeming paradox of non-convergence of the parties to the electoral origin. The model implies that the changes in the political variables led to new equilibrium strategies of the candidates. The higher-valence candidate adopted a position that was supported by upper-middle-class voters. The low-valence candidate miscalculated, and moved closer to the electoral center and suffered a damaging defeat. Part of this defeat was due to the emergence of a third party, which adopted a position close to the estimated optimal strategy for the low-valence party. In this model, the Convertibility Plan, the fundamental cause of these exogenous changes, was the result of a clever electoral strategy adopted by Menem. Cataife and Scho\u0002eld (2007) suggest that the creation of the Convertibility Plan was due to the alignment of interest between three different actors: (i) Argentina's upper middle class, (ii) money-motivated domestic politicians and (iii) the U.S. Department of Treasury (represent- ing the interests of the U.S. government). Because politicians need to win of\u0002ce in order to pursue their ultimate goals, and because the upper middle class provided activist support, the model presented here gives a framework with which to understand this political realignment. Elaborating the model to examine the game be- tween activists and candidates would also involve a more detailed analy- sis of the, implicit contract between candidates and activists and the com- patibility of these political motivations with foreign interests. Indeed, a similar model can be used to examine the ability of politi- cal leaders to remain in of\u0002ce in non-democratic regimes (Scho\u0002eld and Levinson 2008).The only difference to the model would be a modi\u0002ca- tion of the vote-share function, to re\u0003ect the nature of regime support.Chapter 9 Coalitions in the United States 9.1 Convergence or Divergence As discussed in the previous chapters, models of elections tend to give two quite contradictory predictions about the nature of political com- petition. In two-party competition, if the \u0093policy space\u0094 involves two or more independent issues, then the majority rule core will be empty. This implies that if there are two candidates who desire to win, then, generically there will exist no \u0093pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\u0094 In such a game it can be presumed that instability of some kind is possible. That is to say, whatever position is picked by one party there always exists another policy point which will give the second party a majority over the \u0002rst. On the other hand, the earlier electoral models based on the work of Hotelling (1929) and Downs (1957) suggest that parties will converge to an electoral center (at the electoral median ) when the policy space has a single dimension. Although a pure strategy Nash equilibrium gener- ically fails to exist in competition between two agents under majority rule in high enough dimension, there will exist mixed strategy equilibria whose support is located near to the electoral center.40These various and contrasting theoretical results are in need of resolution: will democracy tend to generate centrist compromises, or can it lead to disorder? Partly as a result of these theoretical dif\u0002culties with the \u0093determin- istic\u0094 electoral model, and also because of the need to develop empirical models of voter choice, Chapter 7 focused on \u0093stochastic\u0094 vote models. 40See McKelvey (1986); Banks, Duggan ( 2002, 2006). 221222 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States A formal basis for such models is provided by the notion of \u0093quantal response equilibria\u0094 (McKelvey and Palfrey, 1995). In such models, the behavior of each voter is characterized by a vector of choice prob- abilities determined by the candidate positions.41A standard result in this class of models is that all parties converge to the electoral origin when the parties are motivated to maximize vote-share (or plurality in the two-party case).42The predictions as regards convergence are at odds with the general perception that the principal parties in the United States implement very different policies when in of\u0002ce. The focus of the last two chapters was the apparent paradox that ac- tual political systems display neither chaos norconvergence . The key idea is that the convergence result need not hold if there is an asymme- try in the electoral perception of the \u0093quality\u0094 of party leaders. The early empirical work by Poole and Rosenthal (1984) on U.S. presidential elec- tions included these valence terms and noted that there was no evidence of candidate convergence. This chapter applies the valence model presented in Chapters 7 and 8 where activists provide crucial resources of time and money to their cho- sen party, and these resources are dependent on the party position.43The party then uses these resources to enhance its image before the electorate, thus affecting its overall valence. Although activist valence is affected by party position, it does not operate in the usual way by in\u0003uencing voter choice through the distance between a voter's preferred policy po- sition, sayxi;and the party position. Rather, as party j's activist valence, \u0016j(zj);increases due to increased contributions to the party in contrast to the support \u0016k(zk)received by party k;then (in the model) all voters become more likely to support party jover partyk:44 The problem for each party is that activists are likely to be more ex- treme than the typical voter. By choosing a policy position to maximize activist support, the party will lose centrist voters. The party must there- 41See the earlier studies by Hinich (1977); Enelow and Hinich (1984, 1989); Cough- lin (1992). For an empirical comparison of deterministic and probabilistic models, see Burden (1997). 42See McKelvey and Patty (2006); Banks and Duggan (2005). 43For convenience, it is assumed that the activist valence, \u0016j(zj);of party jis only dependent on the policy position, zj, and not on zk; k6=j;but this is not a crucial assumption. A more general version of the model is brie\u0003y considered in Chapter 10. 44In other words, it is not the source of the resources that matters, just the amount.9.1 Convergence or Divergence 223 fore determine the \u0093optimal marginal condition\u0094 to maximize vote-share. Theorem 7.2.1 gave this as a (\u0002rst-order) balance condition. Moreover, because activist support is denominated in terms of time and money, it is reasonable to suppose that the activist function will exhibit decreas- ing returns. For example, in an extreme case, a party that has no activist support at all may bene\u0002t considerably by a small policy move to fa- vor a particular interest group. On the other hand, when support is very substantial, then a small increase due to a policy move will little affect the electoral outcome. For this reason it is reasonable to assume that the functions themselves are concave, so their Hessians are everywhere negative-de\u0002nite. Theorem 7.2.1 pointed out that when these functions are suf\u0002ciently concave, then the vote-maximizing model will exhibit a Nash equilibrium. As discussed in the next section for the two-party case, when the con- vergence condition of Theorem 7.2.1 is violated, then electoral logic will force one of the parties to move away from the origin so as to increase vote-share. Such a move, by creating asymmetry between the parties, is the trigger for differential activist support for the parties. It is intrinsic to the model that voters evaluate candidates not only in terms of the voters' preferences over intended policies, but also in terms of judgements over their capacity to carry out these policies. While the model presented in Chapters 7 and 8 is relatively simple, the analysis of the trade off between preference and judgement proved to be quite complex. This chapter is devoted to a discussion of U.S. politics in the light of the model in order to suggest possible lines of research over the formation of electoral judgements and over the logic of activist support. In the next section, the activist vote-maximizing model is used in an informal fashion to explain the partisan realignment that has occurred in U.S. politics since 1960. This section has the additional purpose of suggesting that neither chaos nor convergence is a likely phenomenon. However, it is suggested that electoral success is highly contingent on the changing judgements of incumbent party leaders, and on the willing- ness of activists to support the parties. While the chaos indicated by pure social choice theory may not occur, elections may well be highly unpre- dictable.224 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States 9.2 Activist Support for the Parties To illustrate the stochastic model, consider Figure 9.1, and suppose \u0002rst that the economic dimension alone is relevant for political policy mak- ing. As before, it will be assumed that there is an electoral distribution of voter bliss points, whose mean is taken as the electoral origin. Ig- noring activism for the moment, then the results of Chapter 7 show that there are two very different possibilities, depending on the parameters of the model. There is a \u0093convergence coef\u0002cient\u0094 (labeled c) de\u0002ned by the valences, \u0015demand\u0015rep, together with the variance of the electoral distribution and the spatial coef\u0002cient, . If the valences are suf\u0002ciently similar (as expressed by an inequality given in terms of c), then both par- ties will position themselves at the electoral origin, and both will gain about 50 percent of the vote. In this case, potential activists are unlikely to be motivated to contribute to the parties. As long as c\u00141;then this convergent situation is stable. On the other hand, if the valences differ, with \u0015dem>\u0015rep;say, and if the electoral variance and are both suf\u0002ciently large, so c >1;then the lower valence candidate will vacate the origin in order to increase vote-share. For purposes of exposition, it can be supposed that conserv- ative economic activists have the preferred position, E. If the Republican candidate moves away from the origin, to a position similar to R, then economic conservative activists would be induced to support this candi- date. The asymmetry induced by this support will cause liberal economic activists at L to support the Democratic candidate. Then R will be pulled further towards E ;while D will be pulled towards L. Moreover, if the marginal effect of activists for the Republicans is greater than for the De- mocrats, then the optimal candidate positions, R and D, will satisfy jRj >jDj:This model implies that once the convergent equilibrium is de- stroyed because of some exogenous change in parameters, and activists become motivated to support the appropriate parties, then convergence can never be recreated. Note that in terms of the model, there is no reason why R should be to the right, and L to the left. However, once the move is made in one direction or the other, then activist support will tend to reinforce the left\u0096 right positioning of the parties. This simple marginal calculation becomes more interesting when there9.2 Activist Support for the Parties 225 226 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States is a second \u0093social\u0094 dimension of policy. Consider the initial positions R and D, on either side of, and approximately equidistant from the origin, as in the \u0002gure. Both Social Conservatives, represented by C, and Social Liberals represented by S, would be indifferent between both parties. A Democratic candidate by moving to position D\u0003will bene\u0002t from activist support of the social liberals, but will lose some support from the liberal economic activists. Note that the \u0002gure is based on the assumption, used in Chapter 8, that activists are characterized by ellipsoidal indifference contours, re\u0003ecting the different saliences they put on the policy axes. The \u0093contract curve\u0094 between the two activist groups, centered at L and S, represents the set of con\u0003icting interests or \u0093bargains\u0094 that can be made between these two groups over the policy to be followed by the candidate. Chapter 8 showed that when activist groups have different saliences, then this contract curve is a catenary whose curvature is determined by the eccentricity of the utility functions of the activist groups. This contract curve is called the Democratic activist catenary . UsinguLanduSto denote the utility functions of the two representative pro-Democrat ac- tivists, then, as in (8.18) in Chapter 8, this catenary a Here L; Sare parameters determined by the activist calculations over support for the party. A move by the Democratic candidate to a position on the contract curve in Figure 9.1 will maximize the total contributions to the candidate. Of course, this position will depend on the relative willingness of the two activist groups to contribute. In the same way, theRepublican activist catenary is given by the contract curve between economic conservative activists, positioned at E ;and social conservative activists, positioned at C :Denoting the utility functions of these activists byuE;uC;respectively, then again by (8.18) the contract curve between these two activists is given by \u0014 EduE dz+ CduC dz\u0015 = 0: (9.2) We can again make the assumption that the marginal contributions of the activists of both parties affect the two parties activist valences \u0016dem and\u0016repby the marginal equations9.2 Activist at appropriate. The four coef\u0002cients in these equations parametrize the willingness of activists to contribute, as well as the effects these contributions have on party valences. These as- sumptions allow us to determine the \u0002rst-order conditions for maximizing vote share. By Theorem 7.2.1, the \u0002rst-order condition for the candidate positions (z\u0003 dem;z\u0003 rep) to be a Nash equilibrium in the vote-share maximiz- ing game is that they satisfy the balance equations . Thus, for each party j=dem orrep; there is a weighted electoral mean for party j, given by the expression dE\u0003 j dzj=X i ijxi; (9.5) and which is determined by the set of voter preferred points fxig:Notice that the coef\u0002cients f ijgfor candidate jwill depend on the position of the other candidate, k:Thebalance equation for eachjis (9.6) As in the previous chapters, the locus of points satisfying this equation is called the balance locus for the party. It is also a catenary obtained by shifting the appropriate activist catenary towards the weighted electoral mean of the party. The gradient vectord\u0016j dzjis called the marginal activist pull for party j(at the position z\u0003 j) representing the marginal effect of the activist groups on the party's valence. The \u0002rst bracketed term in this equation is the marginal electoral pull of party j(atz\u0003 j), and this pull is zero at the weighted electoralmean At any other point, it is a vector pointing towards the weighted electoral mean. To illustrate, the pair of positions (D*, R*) in Figure 9.1 can be taken to represent party positions that maximize vote shares. Indeed, Theorem 7.2.1 asserts that the degree of concavity of the activist functions may be suf\u0002cient to guarantee that this pair of positions is a pure strategy Nash228 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States equilibrium . The locations of the balance loci for the two parties depend on the difference between the exogenous valences, \u0015demand\u0015rep. In particular if \u0015dem-\u0015repis increased for some exogenous reason, then the relative marginal activist effect for the Republicans becomes more impor- tant, while for the Democrats it becomes less important. Theorem 7.2.1 suggets that these PNE will \u0003uctuate considerably from one election to another, as they will depend in a subtle way on the candidates' exoge- nous valences and the response of the various activist groups to the party candidates. The positioning of R* in the electoral quadrant labeled \u0093Conserva- tives\u0094 in Figure 9.1 and of D* in the liberal quadrant is meant to indicate the realignment that took place after the election victory of Kennedy over Nixon in 1960. By 1964 Lyndon Johnson had moved away from a typ- ical New Deal Democratic position, D ;to a position comparable to D*. By doing so, he brought about a transformation that eventually lost the south to the Republican Party. According to the model just presented, such a move by Johnson was a rational response to civil rights demands, by increasing activist support. Although the support by the social liber- als would be small initially at position L, the rate of increase of support (associated with a move along the Democratic balance locus) would be large in magnitude. Conversely the initial rate of the loss of support from Labor would be relatively small. A move by Johnson away from L along the catenary would thus lead to a substantial increase in overall activist support. Moreover, the empirical analysis in Scho\u0002eld, Miller and Mar- tin (2003) suggests that \u0015demfor Johnson was large in contrast to \u0015repfor Goldwater. This suggests that Goldwater's dependence on activist sup- port was greater than Johnson's. This is re\u0003ected in Figure 9.1, where the balance locus for Goldwater is shown to be further from the electoral origin than the balance locus for Johnson. Thus the magnitude ofduC dzprovides an explanation why socially con- servative activists responded so vigorously to the new Republican posi- tion adopted by Goldwater, and came to dominate the Republican pri- maries in support of his proposed policies. These characteristics of the balance solution appear to provide an explanation for Johnson's electoral landslide in 1964. The response by Republican candidates after this election, while tak- ing advantage of the political realignment, has brought about something9.2 Activist Support for the Parties 229 of a dilemma for both parties. This can be seen by considering in detail the balance condition at the position R\u0003, in Figure 9.1. At that point the two activist gradient vectors,duE dz;duC dz;will point away from the elec- toral origin. Because the distance from E is signi\u0002cant, the marginal contribution from economic conservative activists will be negative as the Republican position moves down the catenary. Further movement down the Republican catenary, in response to social conservative activism, will induce some activists located near E to recalculate the logic of their sup- port. Indeed, members of the business community, who can be designated \u0093cosmopolitans,\u0094 and who are economically conservative but relatively liberal in their social values, are likely be concerned about the current policy choices of the Republican President. In parallel, a Democratic position further along the Democrat cate- nary, particularly one associated with a Democratic candidate who has exogenous valence higher than the Republican opponent, would bring into being a new gradient vector associated with activist support from cosmopolitan economic activists for the Democratic candidate. Small moves by such a candidate would induce a signi\u0002cant increase in contri- butions. The dynamic logic of this electoral model is that both parties will tend to move in a clockwise direction as they attempt to maximize electoral response by obtaining support from their respective activist groups. The model suggests that eventually the Democratic candidate will be located close to S while the Republican candidate will be close to C. From then on, populists will dominate the Republican Party and cosmopolitans will dominate the Democrat Party. 9.2.1 Realignment and Federalism The model just presented suggests that realignment of party positions from (D,R) about 1960 to positions close to (S,C) in 2006 takes about two generations. Indeed, Scho\u0002eld, Miller and Martin (2003) suggest that a slow realignment has been going on since at least the election of 1896. The positions of future Republican presidential candidates may closely resemble the position of the Democrat candidate, William Jen- nings Bryan, in 1896, while the positions of future Democratic candidates may come to resemble the position of Bryan's opponent, the Republican230 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States candidate, William McKinley. The reason such a realignment may take many decades to come into being is due to the power of party activists who support the existing realignment at a given time. Consider the New Deal party alignment, based on economic conservatism/liberalism. The Republican activists were small business, professionals, and middle-class people who felt they had a lot to lose by more government regulation/redistribution. Most of the New Deal supporters were northern labor and southern agrarian in- terests who had something to gain by challenging the McKinley north- eastern/business coalition. Many of these Democratic activists resisted the realignment that eventually occurred in the 1960s, when the Demo- cratic Party sponsored civil rights and other socially liberal legislation. This caused the Republicans to react with their southern strategy, attract- ing socially conservative voters who were alienated by this version of liberalism. The question remains however: why didn't this realignment occur in the 1950s or the late 1940s? The slow pace was not because there were no advocates. There were always voices calling for the Democratic Party to be more liberal on the social dimension. The ability to suppress divi- sive social issues reached its limits in 1948, when a \u0002ery anti-segregation convention speech by Hubert Humphrey ignited northern liberals; it also led southern segregationists to walk out and form the States' Rights De- mocratic Party, nominating Strom Thurmond as their presidential candi- date. Although Truman overcame this split to retain the White House, the frightening prospect of losing the Solid (Democratic) South forced Adlai Stevenson to relegate the race issue to the sidelines for two more elec- tions, in the hope of keeping the New Deal coalition alive. The New Deal coalition limped into its third decade by suppressing social policy differ- ences among economic liberals. The slow pace was also not due to lack of incentive for Republicans: many Republican strategists realized they had a lot to gain if the Democratic Party split on the issue of civil rights. However, the New Deal economic activists (both Democratic and Re- publican) all had something to lose by allowing a realignment based on the social dimension. The typical northern Democratic activist \u0096 per- haps a member of a labor union \u0096 was in a strong position of power in the party. The Democratic leadership in Congress knew that they had to consult the unions on major legislation, and defer to them in large part.9.2 Activist Support for the Parties 231 Similarly, southern farmers knew that they were getting a \u0003ow of bene- \u0002ts from their pivotal position in the Democratic Party. They also knew that they would have to forego that position of party dominance if the Democrats ever became serious about civil rights. Thus, New Deal ac- tivists had every reason to try to maintain control of the party machinery (caucuses, the nomination process, etc.) in order to prevent what many nevertheless regarded as inevitable: the eventual emergence of a strong civil rights bill. The same thing could be said of the traditional G.O. P. activists of the New Deal era. They did not have the same control of the legisla- tive process since they were out of power in Congress most of the time, but they still had a lot to lose by a party realignment that emphasized so- cial, rather than economic dimensions of policy. Of course, there were many north-eastern Republicans who were liberal on civil rights, who supported civil rights legislation, and who hated the Goldwater revolu- tion. The Goldwater revolution was a revolution in the Republican Party precisely because it took power away from the traditional G.O. P. ac- tivists and handed it over to western (and eventually southern) business and ideological interests. The traditional G.O. P. activists hated the out- come. The business of the Republican Party became something quite different from the agenda of the Eisenhower period: the \u0002ght for \u0002scal conservatism and low taxes.45 In short, party realignment takes time because the position of a party is not simply controlled by vote-maximizing politicians. Policy choice is constrained by party elites who control party machinery and would rather lose a few elections than change the orientation of the party. Federalism also has an effect. The Goldwater revolution in the G.O. P. started in the 1960s, and was resisted by socially liberal north-eastern Republicans. By 1980, they had de\u0002nitively lost control of the national Republican Party. However, they had not lost control of the local Repub- lican parties in states such as Pennsylvania and Maine. As a result, social liberals from the north-east (like Jeffords and Chaffee, for example) re- 45Nichols 2007 has noted that it was the Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Civil rights legislation had been blocked for 82 years because Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans had been able to stop the required two-thirds majority to effect cloture, bringing an end to a \u0002libuster. The vote for the bill included 37 Republican votes.232 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States mained a diminishing minority voice in the national Republican Party even as the Republican Party came to stand for huge de\u0002cits, opposition to abortion, and constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage. The 2006 election saw the defeat of a few more of these socially liberal Re- publicans. This has made the Republican Party somewhat more socially conservative than it had been before. In 2006, all positions of congres- sional leadership in the G.O. P. are held by southerners and westerners. In contrast, the Democratic Party is now solidly in control of what used to be the heart of the Republican Party: the north-east. Federalism in U.S. politics therefore acts to slow down the pace of realignment. The following two sections of this chapter attempt to draw out some inferences about the past and present from the simple activist model just presented. 9.3 Coalitions of Enemies 9.3.1 The New Deal Coalition The classic example of an unnatural coalition of enemies was the New Deal coalition. It is often forgotten, from the perspective of the 21st century, just how problematic the New Deal coalition was. Prior to Al Smith's presidential race in 1928, the Democratic Party was a so- cially conservative, agrarian party that regularly lost presidential elec- tions. William Jennings Bryan was the party's nominee three times, and he epitomized the anti-immigrant, anti-urban, bias of his nativist supporters.46 Al Smith's nomination in 1928 offered the hope that the Democrats could suppress the social differences between the urban, Catholic and union immigrants of the North and the rural, Protestant, white nativist voters of the South. With the impetus provided by the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was able to make this coalition work by emphasizing the anti-business, pro-government economic liberalism of both southern farmers and northern labor. At the same time, he realized that social issues such as race had to be suppressed as far as possible \u0096 or they would 46See Kazin 2006.9.3 Coalitions of Enemies 233 split the New Deal Democratic coalition down the middle. But the tensions dividing the social liberal and social conservative wings of the Democratic Party could not survive the 1960s, when the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, urban riots, the rulings of a libertarian Supreme Court, and the women's movement all moved social issues to the forefront. President Kennedy was in the uncomfort- able position of being forced to choose between racial liberals and the traditional South \u0096 a choice he postponed making as long as possible. In June1963, shortly after the Birmingham protests, Kennedy committed the Democratic Party to a strong civil rights bill \u0096 despite anticipating that the South's electoral votes would no longer go to the Democratic Party. After the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, Lyndon Johnson told an aide he was afraid that, in signing the bill, he had just given the South to the Republicans \u0093for your lifetime and mine.\u009447After observing the Vietnam peace movement, urban riots, recreational drug use, sexually explicit television, and the women's liberation movement, millions of social conservatives never again voted Democratic, despite their history of support for the economic liberalism of the New Deal. Indeed, 1964 was the last presidential election in which the Democrats earned more than 50 percent of the white vote in the United States. 9.3.2 The Creation of the Republican Coalition It was also in the 1964 election that the \u0002rst tentative steps toward the cur- rent Republican coalition were made. Goldwater saw that opposition to the federal government was a concern shared by Republicans of the west and southern opponents of civil rights. In a 1961 speech in Atlanta, he of- fered up states' rights as the basis for a coalition between anti-integration and anti-regulation forces. \u0093We are not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 and 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are. [School integration is] the responsibility of the states. I would not like to see my party assume it is the role of the federal government to enforce integration in the schools.\u009448Goldwater followed through on this coali- tional strategy (and made himself the \u0002rst choice of the white South) by voting against the Civil Rights Act of that year, and by joining in 47Branch (1998: 404). 48Bass and Thompson (1998: 196-197).234 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States the South's condemnation of the national government, hippies, Vietnam protestors, and do-gooders soft on communism. The Mississippi delega- tion walked out of the 1964 Democratic convention almost to a man, in favor of Goldwater. Figure 9.1 locates Goldwater in the center of the Conservative quad- rant \u0096 conservative on both economic and social issues. By making so- cial issues salient, Goldwater was able to attract many populists to his cause. In 1964, for the \u0002rst time since Reconstruction, Mississippi, Al- abama, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana all cast their electoral col- lege votes for the Republican Party. By all accounts, the most able speech of the Goldwater campaign was given by Ronald Reagan, who had opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and would oppose the V oting Rights Act of 1965. This position helped cement the transformation of the G.O. P. from the nationalist party of Lincoln to the party of states' rights \u0096 a transformation that made possible a coalition of business interests, western sagebrush rebels and southern populists. The election had implications for the long run, as was revealed by Goldwater's explicit courting of Strom Thurmond. As the segregation- ist States' Rights candidate in 1948, the author of the de\u0002ant Southern Manifesto and the \u0002libusterer of both the 1957 Civil Rights Act and the 1964 Act, Thurmond had a great deal of in\u0003uence with the white south- ern electorate. Goldwater not only talked Thurmond into supporting his presidential candidacy (which most politicians of the Deep South were doing that year), he also talked Thurmond into of\u0002cially switching par- ties. Thurmond became the \u0002rst of many successful southern legislators to make the switch, and was, in 1968, in a position to help deliver the mid-South to Nixon.49 InThe Emerging Republican Majority (1969), Republican strategist Kevin Phillips analyzed the long-term implications of the new linkage between Western civil libertarians and southern social conservatives. He argued that a strong dose of southern populism would make the Repub- licans the majority party, by gaining the support of millions of voters, South and North, who felt threatened by the federal government and its sponsorship of civil rights programs. In a comment that rang as true in 49Carter (2000: 329-330).9.3 Coalitions of Enemies 235 2004 as 1969, Phillips noted that the newly \u0093Populist\u0094 Republican Party could \u0093hardly ask for a better target than a national Democratic Party aligned with Harvard, Boston, Manhattan's East Side, Harlem, the New York Times and the liberal Supreme Court.\u009450 Thus, Phillips anticipated a strange resolution to one of the oldest feuds in American politics between agrarian populists (especially south- ern agrarian populists) and Northeastern \u0002nancial interests. Populists and big business had been at loggerheads at least since the time of Andrew Jackson. In 1896, Bryan's \u0093Cross of Gold\u0094 speech symbolized the oppo- sition of southern and Midwestern agriculture to eastern \u0002nancial inter- ests. Similarly, Bryan's fundamentalist attack on evolution at the Scopes trial symbolized the commitment to conservative social ideology among many of the populists.51Bryan's populism did exhibit a degree of isola- tionism, as illustrated by his resignation from the position of Secretary of State, in protest against President Woodrow Wilson's policies during the First World War. Gray (2007: 112) has argued that both U.S. isola- tionism and interventionism have had a basis in evangelical beliefs, and quotes Woodrow Wilson's address to Congress in 1919 on the question of membership of the League of Nations. Wilson declared that \u0093nothing less depends upon this decision, nothing less than liberation and salvation of the world.\u0094 In recent years, this moral, evangelical interventionism has come to prominence in the Republican Party. This kind of intervention- ism appears immune to questions of rational, strategic calculation.52 If anyone had argued prior to 1960 that Wall Street and populists would happily join hands within the same political party, both sides would have laughed at the idea. But as Phillips foresaw, Republicans could (and did) form a marriage of convenience between populists and economic conservatives, in opposition to the federal government as sponsor of the social change catalyzed by the civil rights, women's, consumer and envi- ronmental movements. Since Phillips wrote his book, and especially since the Reagan election of 1980, the Republican Party has managed to maintain a coalition that includes both Populists and pro-business interests \u0096 Bryan and McKinley. 50Phillips (1969: 239). See also Phillips (2006). 51Admittedly, the Scope's trial took place many years after Bryan's presidential ef- forts, but Bryan's role suggests he was consistent in his social conservatism. 52See also Sammon (2007).236 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States It has done so by simultaneously serving the economic interests of busi- ness while advancing the social agenda of the social conservative wing of the party. Each new manifestation of social change \u0096 more sexually explicit movies, the issue of gay marriage, court limitations on prayer in schools \u0096 served to tighten the link between populists and the Republican Party. At \u0002rst, purely symbolic gestures were suf\u0002cient to keep social conser- vatives happy in the coalition; traditional pro-business Republicans had little real commitment to the social conservative agenda, and they were still in command. Reagan offered himself as a hero of social conserva- tive values, but seemed to care a great deal more about dismantling the economic regulatory machinery of the New Deal than advancing fam- ily values. The conservative commentator David Frum complained that Reagan could have ended af\u0002rmative action programs \u0093with a few signa- tures,\u0094 but never (Frum, 1994: 72). Lasch (1991: 515) claimed that \u0093Reagan made himself the champion of `traditional values,' but there is no evidence he regarded their restoration as a high priority. What he really cared about was the revival of the unregulated capitalism of the twenties: the repeal of the New Deal.\u0094 George Bush the elder was espe- cially suspect to social conservatives. He seemed to embody the tolerant cosmopolitanism of his father and other New England Republican liber- als. The question has become, \u0093Who controls the Republican Party \u0000social conservatives with their belief in moral interventionism, or the propo- nents of business?\u0094 9.3.3 Social Conservatives Ascendant in the G.O. P. In the early 1990s, social conservatives became more than a group of citi- zens to whom presidential candidates could appeal once every four years. Social conservative activists began to penetrate Republican state organi- zations, with or without an invitation from established party of\u0002cials and candidates. Kansas is a case in point. In 1991, an anti-abortion program called \u0093Operation Rescue\u0094 tem- porarily closed down Wichita's abortion clinics. This energized social conservatives, who not only participated in larger and larger mass meet- ings, but also organized to take over local politics by electing pro-lifers9.3 Coalitions of Enemies 237 as precinct committee women and men, by taking control of the local party machinery out of the hands of the established moderate forces.53 They mobilized fundamentalist Christian churches, and turned out in un- heard of numbers at Republican primaries. The Kansas state legislature went Republican in 1992, and moderate Republicans fought back with an organization called the Mainstream Coalition. The intra-party \u0002ght has continued until the present day. Social conservatives succeeded in capturing much of the party ma- chinery in other states as well, and they played a prominent role in the ranks of the Republican freshmen who helped capture Congress in 1994. This development was not met with glee by traditional big-business Re- publicans. Only a few months after the Republican victory in Congress, Fortune magazine ran a cover story re\u0003ecting big business's new sense of alienation from the G.O. P. The premise was that \u0093corporate America [is] losing its party\u0094 \u0096 to social conservatives.54Fortune interviewed corpo- rate executives who expressed strong concern about the \u0093growing clout of the Christian conservative movement within the G.O. P.\u0094 Fifty-nine per- cent of the CEOs agreed that \u0093a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one, no matter what the reason.\u0094 Big business, especially eastern business, was run by a well-educated intelligentsia. They had lit- tle in common with the Christian evangelicals who were upset by issues such as prayer in schools, the teaching of evolution, and gay marriage. These economic conservatives saw the key positions in the House and Senate Republican leadership going, in the 1990s, to southerners whose \u0002rst loyalty was to social conservatism, and they foresaw a time when the economic agenda of the Republican Party would take second place to that of the social conservatives. Fortune wrote that, \u0093if the Republican National Committee published a tabloid newspaper, the headline herald- ing the dawn of the Newt Gingrich era might well blare: G.O. P. to big business: drop dead.\u009455 Despite mounting tension, the Republican coalition seemed to \u0002nd a way to reconcile the diverse interests of social and business conserva- tives. In 2000, the Bush campaign managed to mobilize both sides of the coalition once again. The big business community was happy with 53Frank (2004: 94). 54Kirkland (2005). 55Ibid.238 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, who had been their \u0002rst choice for pres- ident in 1996. They liked Cheney's inclusive procedure for setting the Bush energy policy. Pro-business Republicans might be alarmed by the growing power of the Christian right in the party, but they could live with it as long as they received the Bush tax cuts and the loosening of business regulation. Most of the Christian right might not bene\u0002t by tax breaks for millionaires, but they could live with it as long as the Bush admin- istration moved in the direction of an anti-abortion Supreme Court, with Bush himself leading the \u0002ght against gay marriage. By 2006, however, the Republican Party faced some hard choices. With the wholesale political success of the Bush tax plan, and the recent appointment of two conservative judges to the Supreme Court, each seg- ment of the Republican coalition has begun to ask, \u0093But what have you done for me lately?\u0094 Further advances in the Republican agenda are go- ing to be a lot more stressful for the Republican coalition, because both sides care about the same issues \u0096 and they don't agree.56 9.3.4 Stem Cell Research The most striking example of the instability of the Republican Party is a dramatic appeal by Republican John Danforth, retired U.S. Senator from Missouri, and advocate of stem cell research. Danforth warned that his Republican Party has been transformed into \u0093the political arm of conser- vative Christians.\u0094 It is worth giving a long quote from John Danforth (2005) in which he expresses his concerns over the pressure of religious power blocs: When government becomes the means of carrying out a religious program, it raises obvious questions under the First Amendment. But even in the absence of constitutional issues, a political party should resist identi\u0002cation with a religious movement. While reli- gions are free to advocate for their own sectarian causes, the work of government and those who engage in it is to hold together as one people a very diverse country. At its best, religion can be a uniting in\u0003uence, but in practice, nothing is more divisive. For politicians 56As an illustration, in late September, 2007, a group of \u0093pro-family\u0094 leaders\u0094 declared that they were willing to back any third party candidate for president who would join them in asserting the sanctity of human life.9.3 Coalitions of Enemies 239 to advance the cause of one religious group is often to oppose the cause of another. Take stem cell research. Criminalizing the work of scientists do- ing such research would give strong support to one religious doc- trine, and it would punish people who believe it is their religious duty to use science to heal the sick. During the 18 years I served in the Senate, Republicans often disagreed with each other. But there was much that held us to- gether. We believed in limited government, in keeping light the burden of taxation and regulation. We encouraged the private sec- tor, so that a free economy might thrive. We believed that judges should interpret the law, not legislate. We were internationalists who supported an engaged foreign policy, a strong national defense and free trade. These were principles shared by virtually all Repub- licans. But in recent times, we Republicans have allowed this shared agenda to become secondary to the agenda of Christian conserva- tives. As a senator, I worried every day about the size of the federal de\u0002cit. I did not spend a single minute worrying about the effect of gays on the institution of marriage. Today it seems to be the other way around. The historic principles of the Republican Party offer America its best hope for a prosperous and secure future. Our current \u0002xation on a religious agenda has turned us in the wrong direction. It is time for Republicans to rediscover our roots.57 As this quote suggests, there are many potential economic advantages to be gained from medical advances, particularly those resulting from stem cell research. Acquiescence to the policy demands of social conservatives means these gains will be forgone. Danforth has close ties to the educational and business elites in Mis- souri, who foresee immense advantage to stem cell research. Stem cell research promises to be a powerful engine for economic development in the very near future. Aging baby-boomers are spending a lot of money on health care, and would be willing to spend a lot more for the po- tential treatments that might result from a decade of stem cell research. 57Danforth (2005).240 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States Pro-business Republicans, therefore, cannot afford to sit back and let the social conservative wing have its way. So Danforth's attack on the so- cial conservative \u0093control\u0094 of the Republican Party focused on that is- sue. \u0093Republicans in the General Assembly have advanced legislation to criminalize stem cell research.\u009458The legislation is supported by Mis- souri Right to Life and opposed by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Senator Jim Talent was one of the prominent Republicans caught in the cross-\u0002re. He had originally supported a federal bill to op- pose certain aspects of stem cell research, but then very publicly reversed himself. The reversal immediately led to an attack by the anti-abortion Republicans that Danforth found himself opposing. 9.3.5 Immigration One might object that the stem cell crisis is a crisis only among Republi- can elites: Danforth vs. Buchanan. How deeply divided are Republican voters by this issue? The immigration issue has become increasingly important to the entire bloc of Republican voters. The Hispanic-American protests around the country, on 1 May, 2006, were front-page news, and the latest round of anti-immigrant feeling stoked the \u0002res of social conservatives. An Arizona Republican commented on the pro-immigrant protests: \u0093I was outraged. You want to stay here and get an education, get bene\u0002ts, and you still want to say `Viva Mexico'? It was a slap in the face.\u009459 Most social conservatives in the country are wage-earners, so the eco- nomic impact of competing with Mexican immigrants was, no doubt, a factor in their hostility to immigrants as well. Said a construction worker, \u0093They should all be ejected out of the country. They are in my country and they are on my job, and they are driving down wages.\u009460 As an anti-immigrant backlash grew among social conservatives, dozens of Republican legislators promised to oppose the moderate temporary- worker measure in Congress. The authors of the temporary-worker mea- sure, however, were also Republican \u0096 pro-business Republicans who felt that immigration kept America's businesses supplied with cheap labor. 58Ibid. See also Phillips (2006) for the dangers of \u0093radical religion.\u0094 59Kirkpatrick (2006). 60Ibid.9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium 241 Their proposed plan was basically a version of the Reagan amnesty plan in 1986, and supported by the business community. Today, social con- servatives regard the Reagan amnesty as a mistake. Senator John Cornyn of Texas was referring to the Reagan plan when he said, \u0093This compro- mise would repeat the mistakes of the past, but on a much larger scale because 12 million illegal immigrants would still be placed on an easier path to citizenship.\u009461The much more widespread Republican opposition to a similar plan 20 years after the Reagan amnesty is evidence of the in- creased mobilization and in\u0003uence of social conservative activists in the Republican Party. Both immigration and stem cell research point to the dif\u0002culties in maintaining the successful Republican coalition of recent decades. 9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium Chapter 7 has shown that, given voters and activists with different pref- erences in two-dimensional space, there can exist a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for vote-maximizing candidates. At any given time, each party candidate adopts a policy position to balance the centrifugal pull of party activists with the centripetal pull of vote maximization, while also seeking a best response to the position adopted by the other party's candidate. The location of the candidates in equilibrium is not exactly at the cen- ter of the electoral distribution, because of the need to seek resources from party activists, who generally are located far from the center. The more inherently likable a candidate is in the eyes of the public (i.e., the higher the candidate's exogenous valence), the less dependent will the candidate be on the support of activists, and the closer to the electoral center will be the equilibrium position. For example in Figure 9.1, the \u0093balance locus\u0094 for Goldwater gives the possible set of policy positions that he could choose so as to maximize the electoral consequences of activist support from economic and social conservatives. Because Gold- water had a low valence due to the electoral perception of his extremism, his balance locus was far from the center, illustrating his need to get com- pensating activist support. Bush, on the other hand, has been seen in both 61Free Internet Press (2006).242 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States election years as a personally attractive candidate. Consequently, he can afford to take a more centrist position, as shown in the \u0093balance locus for Bush\u0094 in Figure 9.1. The same factor would explain a more centrist balance locus for Clinton in the 1992 election. The \u0093balance locus\u0094 for each Republican candidate can be represented as an arc, revealing possible trade-offs between social and economic con- servatives. As the proportion of resources from social activists increases relative to those from economic activists, candidates in equilibrium will move toward the axis of social activism. Just as Democratic candidates were pulled toward the social liberal position (S in Figure 9.1) during the tumult of the 1960s and 1970s, so Republican candidates have increas- ingly moved toward the social conservative position (C in Figure 9.1) during the 1980s and 1990s. This kind of movement necessarily creates resentment between different factions of the party, especially in the face of con\u0003ict over issues like stem cell research and immigration discussed above. What is the rational best response of Democrats to this movement in the Republican Party? Will the Democratic equilibrium position adjust to these con\u0003icts in the Republican Party? There have been various pre- scriptions for the Democratic Party, and recent events reveal which of these is most likely to be implemented. The \u0002rst prescription is a \u0093Return to the New Deal,\u0094 emphasizing traditional economic liberalism, and the class differences between labor and business.62The problem with this strategy is that it is a losing strategy as long as the Republicans retain the votes of many of the populists of the lower-left quadrant in Figure 9.1. It seems unlikely that social conservatives \u0096 now fully engaged on the is- sues of teaching evolution, abortion, and immigration \u0096 are ever going to return to the party of civil rights, the Kennedy Immigration Reform of 1965, and Roe vs. Wade. Without the populists, economic liberalism mo- bilizes only the \u0093liberal\u0094 voters of the upper-left hand quadrant in Figure 9.1. The second strategy is to soften Democratic social liberalism. There is a lot to be said for this argument, from an electoral perspective. As so- cial policy has come to dominate partisan debate, the median position on social policy is theoretically the winning position. However, the party's 62This is advocated by Frank (2004: 243-246).9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium 243 position is the result of a \u0093balance\u0094 between the centripetal pull of the electorate and the centrifugal tugs of activists who supply the resources necessary for an effective campaign. Moving too far toward the center on social policy runs the risk of losing the base of af\u0002rmative action sup- porters, gay rights supporters, and supporters of women's rights. Since the 1960s, these groups have replaced economic liberals as the primary source of activist support for the party. As mentioned earlier, the optimal balance for vote maximization de- pends on party activism (the marginal contribution rate) and on the non- policy attractiveness (or valence) of the candidate. A candidate with per- sonally attractive qualities, such as integrity or charisma, can afford to move nearer the center of the electorate than a less attractive candidate. A candidate with lower valence is more dependent on the resources mus- tered by party activists, and consequently must move out from the center toward the more extreme policy positions advocated by those activists. So the ability of the Democrats to pick up votes by moving toward the social policy center is contingent on the \u0093quality\u0094 of the candidate, and is constrained by Democratic Party activists. These activists are increas- ingly motivated to contribute on the basis of social issues. Indeed, in the last few years, the issue of war has become important. The Democratic best response to the increasing power of social con- servatives in the Republican Party must be to seek the support of the social liberals who are increasingly disaffected in the Republican Party. This involves a move toward the social liberal axis along what is marked as \u0093the Clinton balance locus\u0094 in Figure 9.1. As populists demonstrate that they are in control in the Republican Party, cosmopolitan voters in the upper-right-hand quadrant are increas- ingly alienated. A vote-maximizing Democratic candidate will inevitably see the political advantage of picking up Republicans who believe in teaching evolution, stem cell research, and a relatively open policy to- ward immigrants. Many Republican employers see immigration as being a constructive force in the American economy, and are opposed to the hard line taken by House Republicans. Further, G.O. P. opposition to stem cell research will alienate millions of educated, professional economic conservatives who are personally concerned about the health bene\u0002ts of stem cell research. Many of these voters have an economic stake in stem cell research, either244 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States as stockholders in bio-engineering \u0002rms, as professionals in the health care industry, etc. Employers, stockholders in bio-engineering, health care professionals \u0096 they are likely to be economic conservatives who have probably voted Republican all their life. What would it take to get them to vote Democratic? Perhaps not much, if social conservatives con- tinue to be intransigent on issues like immigration and stem cell research. As suggested in the next section, an inevitable party dynamic will pull many of those voters into the Democratic Party, bringing activists and candidates along with them. 9.4.1 Party Dynamics Whether undertaken as a consciously chosen strategy or not, the Demo- cratic Party is going to move to the right, on the economic dimension, while staying strictly liberal on the social dimension. It will happen as a result of already-existing pressures driving socially liberal economic conservatives out of the Republican Party. The public perception of each party is determined by the composi- tion of each party's activists. V oters for each party make decisions about whether to become activists based on the relative location of the two par- ties, as determined by the existing mass of activists. If moderate so- cial liberals leave the Republican Party for the Democratic Party, then the social policy differences between the two parties becomes even more salient, and more motivating to social policy activists. Furthermore, as social policy activists are sorted into the two parties, this has enormous implications for potential candidates. Party activists, for example, have enormous in\u0003uence in primary elections, where they constitute a larger proportion of voters who actually turn out, and where they have a big impact on voter mobilization. The increasing dominance of social conservatives in the G.O. P. is best seen in the consequences of their in\u0003uence on Republican Party pri- maries. One consequence will be challenges to Republican moderate (so- cially liberal) incumbents. A second consequence will be that Republican moderates who hope to hold of\u0002ce will simply switch to the Democratic Party. Both of these have the further effect of increasing the polariza- tion of the two parties along the social dimension, while decreasing the economic policy differences between the two parties.9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium 245 9.4.2 Party Challenges While most spatial models of party competition assume a monolithic party actor, the view presented here is that the party is composed of multi- ple groups \u0096 activists of different ideological stripes, and party candidates and leadership who would like to respond to the centripetal force of the electoral center. The primary task facing the Republican Party is the same as it is for every majority party under plurality rule \u0096 to keep the coali- tion together in the face of con\u0003ict among diverse supporters. Just as L. B. Johnson confronted increasing con\u0003ict between civil rights support- ers and the southern elite, Republicans face increasing con\u0003ict between moderate pro-business Republicans and hard-core social conservative ac- tivists. The outcome is likely to be as signi\u0002cant a transformation in the Republican Party as the one that occurred in the Democratic Party 40 years ago. Republicans like Danforth call for the return of the Republican Party to its position in earlier decades: \u0002scally responsible, supportive of business (even in immigration policy), civil libertarian on issues like abortion. But \u0093return\u0094 is something never seen in partisan realignments. One might as well call for a return to the Republican Party of Teddy Roosevelt or Lincoln. Social conservative activists, having captured the state and local machinery of the Republican Party, have no incentive to give it up, even in the interest of greater Republican success. A case in point is Randy Graf, in Arizona's 8th district, which includes the relatively liberal voters of Tucson as well as the conservative ranchers of Cochise County. The seat had been held for 22 years by moderate Republican Jim Kolbe, until he announced his retirement in 2006. The 2006 election was recognized early on to be one in which the Democrats had an opportunity to take back the House; as a result, the Republican National Committee hoped to keep this seat by running another moderate Republican \u0096 Steve Huffman. In fact, the RNC donated at least $122,000 to Huffman's campaign. However, Randy Graf, a former golf pro, challenged the RNC's can- didate. Graf was a founding member of the Minutemen, a conservative anti-immigration group whose members took it upon themselves to pa- trol the border. He was also anti-abortion and against same-sex marriage. While Huffman had the support of the national party, Graf had the whole-246 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States hearted support of the Minutemen and other social conservatives, who felt immigration was directly linked to crime, drugs, and the destruction of American identity. Graf claimed that there was \u0093real fury with Wash- ington,\u0094 and ran with the supporters called Huffman a RINO \u0096 Republican in Name Only, a favorite term used by social conservatives trying to drive social moderates out of the Repub- lican Party. He angrily denounced the Republican Party for supporting his moderate opponent. He won the primary with 42 percent of the vote against Huffman's 38 percent. The Republican National Committee continued to worry about whether Graf could be elected. In the face of polls indicating a large loss for Graf, the RNC canceled $1 million in \u0002nancial support for Graf's ads. De- mocrat Gabrielle Giffords found it easy to stake out a centrist, winning position, and took the House seat away from the Republicans with a 54 percent to 42 percent vote. This election illustrates that parties are not monolithic. Elements of the party \u0096 the candidates and the national committees \u0096 are more con- cerned about electability than ideological purity. The National Republi- can Party would rather support a Republican candidate who is close to his districts' median voter than a social conservative who could lose a House seat for the party. However, warring activists of different stripes are not generally willing to make ideological sacri\u0002ces in the interest of their parties' candidates. At least in Tucson, the Republican Party moved incrementally toward the social conservatives, despite the leadership's at- tempts to apply the brakes! Con\u0003ict within the party played a similar role in the defeat of Lincoln Chaffee. Chaffee is a \u0002scal conservative and social liberal in the mold of New England Republicans going back to the Civil War \u0096 much like Prescott Bush, one-time Senator from the neighboring state of Connecti- cut. Chaffee was the only Republican senator to vote against the Bush tax cuts and against the Iraq war; he also let it be known he was going to write in the name of the president's father in protest against Bush's policies. These actions invoked a conservative challenge in the Republican pri- mary \u0096 from Stephen Laffey, Mayor of Cranston, and pro-lifer. In this case, Chaffee was able to beat back the conservative challenger, at some cost to his election resources. Alienating the conservative wing of the9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium 247 Republican Party left him more vulnerable to a popular Democrat. The Democrat, Sheldon Whitehouse, defeated Chaffee by 53 percent to 47 percent. The result was that Senate Republicans became more homoge- neously conservative on social issues; the prospect of the G.O. P. \u0093return- ing\u0094 to the Republicanism that Chaffee, Jeffords and Danforth remember became even more remote. In Rhode Island and Arizona, primary challenges by conservatives helped undermine the strategy of Republican Party leaders, who hoped to maintain control of Congress by offering strong, uni\u0002ed support for moderates. The challenges by Graf in Arizona and Laffey in Rhode Is- land illustrate in a striking way that the increasing power of social con- servatives is an autonomous force for repositioning the Republican Party. 9.4.3 Party Switches As social conservatives come to dominate the machinery in a given state or electoral district, socially moderate Republican candidates may be forced into the Democratic Party simply because they can no longer hope to win a Republican primary. The normal ambition of politicians trans- forms socially liberal Republicans into moderate Democrats. And once again, the result is increased party polarization on the social dimension and decreased party differences on the economic dimension. A case in point is John Moore, a long-time executive with Cessna Aircraft in Wichita; a pro-business conservative, he was nevertheless un- likely to win a Republican primary for any state-wide position due to his \u0093softness\u0094 on social issues. He consequently converted in 2002, and was elected as the Democratic lieutenant governor. Moore retired in 2006, and the open position brought about an even more dramatic development. Mark Parkinson of\u0002cially switched parties in time to run for the lieutenant governor's position. Parkinson is a for- mer Republican Party Chairman for the state of Kansas, and was elected lieutenant governor on the Democratic ticket. Others in Kansas are going the same route. In 2004, Republican Cindy Neighbor switched parties to run for the state legislature, opposed to a social conservative who had defeated her in the primary in 2004. She was elected in 2006.63 Nor are these ballot box conversions limited to ambitious Kansas mod- 63Milburn (2006).248 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States erates. Perhaps the most striking and visible conversion was that of Jim Webb of Virginia. Webb is a much-decorated Vietnam war veteran who had been Reagan's Secretary of the Navy. As recently as 2000, he sup- ported Republican George Allen to be the U.S. Senator from Virginia. In 2006, he was a Democrat running against Allen. Traditional New Deal Democrats were aghast; but Webb defeated Allen, and his presence in the party moves the Democratic center of gravity to the right on economic policy. Each such switch makes further switches more likely. While Kansas has been seen as a state in which the Democratic Party is all but defunct, the conversion of a small number of socially moderate Republicans to the Democratic Party could easily restore a healthy two-party competition in Kansas. But in the process, each individual conversion changes what it means to be a Democrat . Increasingly, a Democrat is an economic moderate or conservative who is strongly liberal on social issues \u0096 not (as in the New Deal) a strong economic liberal whose Democratic af\u0002liation is a response to class con\u0003ict. These observations are not meant to advocate any particular strategy for either party. Rather, they suggest that partisan change continues to have a certain inevitability about it, despite the fond wishes of entrenched party activists. Each partisan realignment has occurred despite the oppo- sition of existing party activists . Populist Democrats in the 1930s, who had supported Bryan inthe past, were suspicious of the ethnic industrial laborers that the New Deal brought into the party. In the same way, traditional Republican activists were aghast when their candidate Rockefeller was booed for criticizing Goldwater- style radicalism at the 1964 convention.64 Partisan realignment is a dynamic process because of the destabilizing in\u0003uence of vote-maximizing candidates who see opportunities to win elections even at the cost of generating some hostility within the ranks of the pre-existing activist cadres. As a result, partisan identities are al- ways changing, even though there is a tendency to see them as \u0002xed and immutable. The Republican Party in 1868 was the post-civil war party of racial equality through strong national government. The Republican Party in 1948 was the party of the balanced budget and civil libertarian- 64Branch (1998: 402).9.4 The Changing Political Equilibrium 249 ism. Neither of these identities proved to be immutable, and the current identities of both parties are again in \u0003ux. The departure of even a small number of pro-business social liber- als from the Republican Party \u0096 like Jeffords of Vermont or Parkinson in Kansas \u0096 has inevitable effects on both parties. Each such departure increases the proportion of social conservatives in the Republican Party, making it easier for social conservatives to dominate both the party pri- maries and the activists who give the party its image to the nation. This in turn makes it even more dif\u0002cult for social liberals to hope for a success- ful career within the G.O. P. V oters, as well as activists and candidates, adjust. If they are concerned about women's rights or the separation of church and state, they are less likely to vote as Republican and more likely to shift to independent or Democratic status. At the same time, symmetrical adjustments are made in the Demo- cratic Party. Just as Strom Thurmond's conversion to the Republican Party helped trigger a long list of similar conversions by socially con- servative Democrats, so each socially liberal Republican who converts to the Democratic Party makes the social issue that triggered the conversion a more salient aspect of the Democratic identity. The Democratic Party and Republican Party become internally more homogeneous as regards economic policy, and more polarized with respect to social policy. Thus, as social polarization increases between the parties, the eco- nomic differences will slowly disappear. As pro-business social liberals join the Democratic Party, it will become increasingly dif\u0002cult to imag- ine that party going back to a New Deal identity. Just as the New Deal Democratic Party consisted of segregationists and labor unions united on an anti-business platform, the emerging Democratic Party will \u0002nd itself united at a social liberal position, with a centrist position on eco- nomic policy. The proportion of Democrats who adopt a traditional anti- business stance will be reduced. A simple electoral calculus by candi- dates will tend to move them to a Clinton-style moderate position on economic policy \u0096 advocating (among other things), a more inclusive policy toward immigrants, and a more enthusiastic commitment to stem cell and related medical research. Such a rede\u0002nition of the Democratic Party will serve as a catalyst for further change by the Republicans. The potential for these transforma- tions is indicated by Tables 9.1 and 9.2 in the Appendix to this chapter.250 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States These tables show the cross-cutting of the issues of stem cell research and immigration by the yea and nay votes in the Senate on the relevant bills. As Table 9.1 indicates, the pattern of Republican senatorial votes on stem cell research and immigration reform (on 25 May and 18 July, 2006) re- veals some strong clustering, with 15 economic conservatives voting in favor of both measures, and a larger cluster of 27 social conservatives (most of them southerners) voting against both measures. The 32 Re- publican Nay voters were joined by 4 Democrats in the 18 July roll call. On 7 June, 2007, 38 Republicans were joined by 11 Democrats, and the independent Sanders of Vermont in voting against cloture (the cessation of discussion on the immigration bill which needed 60 Aye votes). This vote was essentially repeated on 28 June, killing the proposal until after 2008. From the perspective presented in this chapter, immigration re- form involves both economic interests (pro-business) and the social axis (civil rights), and the policy proposals associated with the bill can be lo- cated in the upper right quadrant. This inference gives a rationale why the Republicans were overwhelmingly opposed, and were joined by a signi\u0002cant number of democrats.65 9.5 The Future of Republican Populism William Jennings Bryan, of course, was an anti-business radical as well as a social conservative. Bryan's social position is now ascendant in the social conservative in the Republican Party. Is it possible to imagine a day in which the Republican Party adopts Bryan's economic radicalism as well as his social conservatism? In the short run, the move by pro-business social liberals from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party will make both parties look 65The ability of the Republican Senators to block legislation was further illustrated on July 18, 2007, when the attempt failed on cloture on discussion of a bill \u0093To provide for a reduction and transition of United States forces in Iraq.\u0094 The attempt only obtained 52 aye votes ( 47 Democrats, 4 Republicans and the independent Sanders of Vermont). The Democrat Party leader, Reid of Nevada, voted Nay with the Repubicans so as to leave open the option of reconsideration of the proposal later. Even with the support of four social moderate Republicans, attempts at cloture on a somewaht different bill on Iraq and an immigration bill involving high school graduates both failed in mid September 2007.9.5 The Future of Republican Populism 251 more moderate on economic policy. In the long run, the same dynamic could actually make the Republican Party more blue-collar than the De- mocrats. Social conservatives in the Republican Party are already quite insistent that the Democratic Party is the party of privilege and elitism. The populist rhetoric adopted by the Republican Party has pictured the Democratic Party as the home of overpaid professors, bureaucrats and social technicians. Democrats are seen as \u0093limousine liberals\u0094 who want to indulge themselves in expensive pro-environmental policy, and who have nothing to lose when wages collapse to the levels of Third World countries. If the Democratic Party continues to pick up social liberals like Jef- fords and Parkinson (either by conscious strategy or just because they have nowhere else to go), then professionals and business leaders in the party will balance the beleaguered unions. These new elements of the party will be on the side of a balanced budget, open immigration, and ac- commodation with business (especially in the new computer and biotech industries). Most dif\u0002cult for traditional Democrats will be the support for free trade among the new Democrats. The economic liberals in the Democratic Party will feel increasingly isolated and alienated. Listening to the populist rhetoric of Republican activists and politicians, blue-collar workers may come to expect the Republican Party to represent their eco- nomic interests, in addition to their social conservative positions. Some Republican politicians, already accepting the social values of blue collar workers, will decide to represent the economic aspirations of their constituents as well. Why not, if professional and business elites are already heading for the door? Indeed, the role model for the complete 21st\u0096century reincarnation of Bryan is already visible: Patrick Buchanan. InThe Great Betrayal , Buchanan sounds like the epitome of the anti- business populist. He blames the business elite for crucifying the working men and women of the country on a cross of free trade. NAFTA, signed by Clinton with Republican votes, is \u0093not sustainable. NAFTA puts U.S. blue-collar workers into competition for manufacturing jobs with Mexi- can workers who earn 10 percent of their wages. . . . American employers now hang over the head of their workers this constant threat: accept re- duced pay, or we go to Mexico!\u009466 66Buchanan (1998: 309).252 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States As Buchanan has demonstrated, it would be a simple matter to take up the populist economic policy along with the rhetoric. Buchanan does not hesitate to point to \u0093corporate executives\u0094 as being complicit in The Great Betrayal : Having declared free trade and open borders to be America's policy, why are we surprised that corporate executives padlocked their plants in the Rust Belt and moved overseas? Any wonder that Nike pres- ident Philip Knight is the \u0002fth-richest man in America, with $5.2 billion, while his Indonesian workers make thirty-one cents an hour?\u009467 Like Phillips in 1969, Buchanan sees the future of the Republican Party in \u0093the new populism\u0094 with both an economic and social agenda: protectionist, and anti-immigration, and anti-capitalist as well as anti- abortion. Buchanan is the model for the Republican incarnation of Bryan.68 In the long run, a Buchanan-style Republican could complete the cycle by forming a new \u0093New Deal\u0094 between rural social conservatives and economic liberals. Changes in party identity will not happen quickly or without a great deal of pain caused by the political dislocation. These transformations will not necessarily result in a single, \u0093realigning\u0094 election. However, as long as Americans understand politics to consist of more than a single di- mension generated by economic ideology, then no majority coalition in the U.S. polity can be immune from the kind of tension that will even- tually lead to its replacement. A second dimension, revolving around race, ethnicity, immigration, and religious values, has always been la- tent, even when it was suppressed as during the New Deal. The multi- dimensionality of U.S. politics is now apparent in contemporary life. Everything that is known about multidimensional two-party politics sug- gests that an inevitable dynamism accompanies American politics. The future decades will reveal the impact of today's ongoing transformation. 9.6 Concluding Remarks The main purpose of this chapter has been to show that convergence need not be expected in party competition. Since activist support is of key im- 67Ibid., p. 16. 68Buchanan (1999) expresses isolationist views that appear similar to those we may ascribe to Bryan.9.6 Concluding Remarks 253 portance in elections in the United States, it can be expected that party candidates will move away from the electoral origin towards the activist catenaries. There is substantial evidence that it is necessary to employ a two-dimensional policy model with both economic and social axes in order to understand American politics. This implies that party success requires the formation of coalitions among actors who have con\u0003icting policy preferences over at least one dimension of policy. A successful party coalition is a \u0093coalition of enemies.\u0094 This can be seen in the re- marks by Republican John Danforth, quoted previously, clearly revealing the increasing hostility between evangelical Christians and the business community within the G.O. P. Since at least the Reagan era, the winning Republican coalitions have consisted of social conservatives (located at Cin Figure 9.1) and eco- nomic conservatives (located at E). However, many of the most salient issues of the 21st century threaten to split this Republican coalition. Stem cell research is important to the pro-business conservatives, but anathema to social conservatives. Mexican immigration helps business by keeping labor prices low, but is regarded with hostility by social conservatives (many of them wage-earners) who see it as a threat to their own liveli- hood as well as to traditional American values. The model developed in this chapter incorporates just this kind of intra-party tension to explain the paradox of non-convergence in Ameri- can party politics. Social conservative activists use new issues like stem cell research and immigration to pull the Republican Party along the cate- nary toward their bliss point at C. Republicans like Danforth see this move as a forfeiture of traditional pro-business ideals: \u0093limited govern- ment,\u0094 \u0093keeping light the burden of taxation and regulation.\u0094 They exert a contrary \u0093tug\u0094 toward E. The combined effects of these two activist vectors must be balanced by an electoral pull toward the center to create a party equilibrium that is characterized by divergent party locations. The equilibria of the Democratic and Republican parties are of course inter-dependent. To the extent that social conservatives are successful in moving the Republican Party location toward their bliss point, the model clearly indicates the Democratic best response. The cosmopolitans \u0096 like Danforth \u0096 have the most to lose by the increasing commitment of the G.O. P. to socially conservative causes. Many of these are professionals or business executives, with sympathy for women's rights, environmen-254 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States talism, and civil liberties, who have always supported Republicans after consulting their pocketbook. But if the Republican Party is seen as the party of strict immigration control (and thus higher wages) and restric- tions on stem cell research (and thus foregone opportunities for growth in new biotechnology industries), then they may change their support. The model indicates that, as the Republican Party moves toward C, then disaffected cosmopolitans may be increasingly tempted to contribute resources to pull the Democrats toward S. A Democratic Party candidate who maintains traditional social liberal positions (in support of African- American voters and womens' rights) while moving toward a moder- ate position in economic policy could obtain signi\u0002cant resources from activists located in that quadrant. Just as the Reagan Republicans con- structed a winning majority by picking up social conservatives, so may a Democratic candidate \u0002nd it possible to construct a new majority by at- tracting economic conservatives who are also social liberals. Taking an emphatic stand in favor of stem cell research and in favor of immigrants' rights could be the kind of signal needed to accomplish this goal. The strategic problem facing the Democratic Party is to take advan- tage of the growing rift in the Republican Party. While many strategists urge the Democrats to return to strong New Deal economic liberalism, this strategy would do nothing to attract disaffected cosmopolitan Re- publicans, and on the contrary would do a great deal to drive them back into a forced coalition with the social conservatives. Nor would a re- version to New Deal liberalism result in a resurrection of the New Deal coalition. Now that issues such as abortion, gay marriage, and the Iraq war have entered into political consciousness, southern and Midwestern conservatives are not going to return to the Democratic Party by promises of protecting unions or increases in the minimal wage. The two-dimensional nature of U.S. politics forces one to the conclu- sion that the next winning strategy for Democrats is to look to the sub- urbs, for moderates who support teaching of evolution, are eager for the health bene\u0002ts of stem cell research, and offended by the effect of the Iraq war on civil liberties. Such a strategy does not require Democrats to compete for economic conservatives with tax cuts, but it no doubt re- quires a moderate economic policy that leaves middle-class voters feeling9.6 Concluding Remarks 255 comfortable voting Democratic.69It may mean de-emphasizing south- ern voters, while searching for the growing numbers of anti-war, pro- environment voters in the West. As the formal model suggests, the other determinant of party loca- tion is party valence. The relative party valence determines whether the trade-offs between party activists occur close to the origin, or at some distance from it. The party with the lower exogenous valence is forced to move out in order to attract what non-centrist support it can from com- mitted policy activists. Current poll results indicate a shrinking valence for the Republican Party. In May 2006, only 37 percent of Americans thought the Republican Party came closer to sharing their moral values (compared to 50 percent for Democrats), and only 22 percent of Ameri- cans thought the Republican Party was more likely to protect their civil liberties (compared to 62 percent for Democrats).70These \u0002gures indi- cate that\u0015dem\u0000\u0015repis increasing, forcing the Republican Party to move out to appeal to its activist base. From the standpoint of this model, the ideal Democratic candidate would be a well-liked economic moderate who is clearly differentiated from the Republicans on the basis of social (not economic) policy. Current events illustrate this chapter's focus on the use of non-policy electoral \u0093valence\u0094 and the policy demands of party activists to resolve the paradoxical non-convergence of the two-party system in the United States. The formal model demonstrates how a divergent equilibrium emerges as each party attempts to balance the centripetal pull of elec- toral politics against the centrifugal pulls from distinct coalitions of party activists. Exogenous shocks, and the emergence of newly salient issues, such as stem cell research, can change the parameters that determine the exact location of a party equilibrium. The ability of each party to main- tain a fragile coalition of party activists with quite different agendas may vary, creating opportunities for the other party to attract increasingly dis- affected activists. Scho\u0002eld (2006a) suggests that extreme con\u0003ict over Times , 10 May 2006, p. A18. Obviously the situation in Iraq had an effect on these perceptions. The recent book by Gore (2007) gives a possible reason for these changes.256 Chapter 9. Coalitions in the United States fragment the activist groups in a society. The result may be that party leaders and candidates become more extreme in the positions they adopt. This would provide an underlying logic to what has seemed a paradox in U.S. politics. Although the electorate seems to be no more polarized than in the past, the parties do seem more polarized.71 71See Fiorina (2005) and McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal (2006).9.7 Appendix: Republican Senator Votes 257 9.7 Appendix: Republican Senator Votes Table 9.1.

[I]t may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will . . . be felt by a majority of the whole . . . and there is nothing to check the to sacri\u0002ce the weaker party . . . . Hence it is, that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths.. . . A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect . . . . The two great points of difference between a democracy and re- public, are \u0002rst, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.. . . [I]t may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the rep- resentatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves. . . . 259260 Chapter 10. Final Remarks [I]f the proportion of \u0002t characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a \u0002t choice . . . [A]s each representative will be chosen by a greater number of cit- izens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more dif\u0002cult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts, by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the peo- ple. . . will be more likely to centre on men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters. The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican, than of democratic government; and it is this . . . which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former, than in the latter. . . . Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens. . . . Hence it clearly appears, that the same advantage, which a repub- lic has over a democracy . . . is enjoyed by a large over a small republic\u0096is enjoyed by the union over the states composing it. . . . The in\u0003uence of factious leaders may kindle a \u0003ame within their particular states, but will be unable to spread a general con\u0003agra- tion through the other states. . . In the extent and proper structure of the union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government.72 In these \u0002nal remarks, I shall try to relate Madison's justi\u0002cation for the republican scheme of representation that he made in Federalist X to the social choice theory presented in the earlier chapters of the book and the empirical work of the later chapters. The key to my understanding of a general theory of social choice is that any polity must, on occasion, face dif\u0002cult choices over what I call constitutional quandaries . Simply put, a quandary is a choice situation where all possible options appear extremely unpleasant, and laden with 72James Madison, Federalist X (1787), in Rakove (1999: 164-166).10.1 The Madisonian Scheme of Government 261 risk and uncertainty.73The constitutional feature of the quandary refers to the likelihood that opinion as regards the correct choice will typically be highly heterogenous. The actual choice will depend on the political mechanisms used by the society, and thus on the constitutional rules that govern political choice. The results from social choice theory indicate that when preferences or opinions are suf\u0002ciently heterogenous, then disorder or chaos can ensue. The process of social decision-making is denoted by correspondence, Q; soQ(x)is the set of outcomes that can come about from x;as determined by whatever social rule or political process is used by the society. The idea of social chaos is that there are conditions under which, starting from almost any x;it is possible to reach almost anypossible outcome y2Qt(x)by reiterating the social rule. In contrast we can identify thecore orsocial equilibrium ,y, to be some \u0093stationary\u0094 outcome such thatQ(y)is empty:An even stronger equilibrium notion is that of an attractor ofQ: that is a single outcome ywithy=Qt(x), which results from anyx;after a suf\u0002cient number of iterations of the rule. As Chapter 4 has shown, for any voting procedure, Q;without a dictator, oligarchy or collegium, with the capacity to control or restrain social choice, then as the dimension of Wincreases then so does the likelihood of voting chaos.74 While these results focused on voting rules, it seems just as likely that chaos can ensue in a society where war is a possibility. When war, or intense and unrestrained con\u0003ict dominates, then we can expect chaos, and unpredictability.75Indeed, this aspect of social choice theory suggests that it is possible that any society can fall into disorder when there is no collegium.76As Keynes (1936) observed, dictators often come to power 73Iraq in late 2007 is such a constitutional quandary for the United States. 74As described in the earlier chapters, a voting rule is characterized by a family of winning coalitions, D. Acollegium is a group of voters that belongs to every coalition inD, but need not itself be winning. An oligarchy is a winning collegium, while a dictator is a single agent oligarchy. 75Bates et al. (2003) have documented over 400 instances of countries falling into political instability in the period 1955 to 2002. 76The classic example of a fall into chaos is France, from the \u0002rst meeting of the Estates General in May 1789, through the execution of King Louis XVI in January 1793, followed by the Terror. This chaos ended when Napoleon took power by coup d'\u00e9tat in November 1799, later being crowned emperor on 2 December, 1804.262 Chapter 10. Final Remarks when the people are in fear of chaos. Madison also made an observation about the need for collegial power to induce stability: for the harmony of that [British] Empire, it is evident I think that without the royal negative or some equivalent controul [ sic] the unity of the system would be destroyed. The want of some such provision seems to have been mortal to the [ancient] Confederacies.77 Federalist X indicates that Madison certainly viewed direct democ- racy as subject to chaos .Since a legislative assembly can be understood as a direct democracy, social choice theory provides a formal basis for Madison's argument about direct democracy and about what he called the \u0093mutability\u0094 of the legislature. The \u0002rst method of mitigating chaos is to impose the concentration of power implied by the existence of a dictator, oligarchy, or collegium. Because a dictator can control every choice, it is very unlikely that such a degree of concentration of power can ever actually occur. However, we can use the term autocrat for one who controls the levers of power of the polity, and has at least the ability to declare war without being constrained by some strong form of political veto.78 Scho\u0002eld (2006a) suggests that a pure autocrat is likely to be will- ing to take extreme risks.79This further suggests that an autocrat will be more risk-taking than an oligarchy or a collegium. In the current situation where the Republican members of the Senate are able to block legislation that is contrary to the policy preferences of the President, then he does have some autocratic power, and I shall use the term weak autocrat to characterize his power. In his writings, Madison expressed concern that the president would gain autocratic power, and to avoid this, the Con- gressional super-majority counter-veto was devised. Thus Congress can 77Letter to Jefferson, 24 October 1787, in Smith (1995: 498). Here, Madison refers to the collegial power of the sovereign by the term \u0093the royal negative.\u0094 78Saddam Hussein may not have had the total power that formally characterizes a dictator, but he certainly was an autocrat in Iraq. Putin also appears to have gained auto- cratic power in Russia. See Jack (2004) and Remington (2005, 2006). On 3 November 2007, Pervez Musharaff moved to consolidate autocratic power in Pakistan. 79No formal reason is given, but the historical examples in Kennedy (1987) and the discussion in Kershaw (2007) of the choices by Axis leaders in World War II lends some support to the hypothesis.10.1 The Madisonian Scheme of Government 263 be interpreted as having collegial power. However, because Congress may be factionalized, it can, as Madison expected, exhibit what he called \u0093mutability\u0094\u0096a degree of disorder or incoherence in the laws that are passed. My understanding of the U.S. Constitution is that the Presi- dential veto was designed to overcome Congressional mutability. It is evident that there may be a tendency for U.S. presidents to dis- play some of the degree of risk preference that characterizes autocrats. I judge that Congress will generally be risk-averse, which is why, I be- lieve, power to declare war resides in Congress. From this perspective, the weak autocracy that I ascribe to the president is an important feature of the U.S. Constitution because risk taking is an essential component of presidential power.80Moreover, Congressional risk-avoidance, or muta- bility, has the effect of delaying the resolution of fundamental constitu- tional quandaries. Typically, a quandary can only be faced if there is a risk-taking leader capable of forcing resolution.81At the same time, the purpose of the Congressional veto, aside from restraining any tendency to full autocracy, is to cause the president to temper his risk-preference with caution.82 In Chapter 5, the concept of the heart, H(Q);was introduced for any method of decision-making, Q. In contrast to the possibility of chaos, it was suggested that the outcomes of political decision-making in a mature democratic society would lie in the heart of the legislature, and this do- main would be relatively constrained by the legislative or constitutional rules of veto and counter-veto, and by the preferences of the legislators. This notion was used in Chapter 6 to estimate the range of possible out- comes in various legislatures based on electoral rules using some form of proportional representation.83In principle, this concept of the heart can be used as a technical device to model the balance of power and prefer- 80Many writers since Schlesinger (1973) have used the term \u0093Imperial presidency\u0094 for the weak autocracy of the president. See also Savage (2007). 81Chapter 9 discusses examples of presidential risk-taking by Eisenhower in 1957 and Johnson in 1964, both of which entailed a con\u0003ict over civil rights between the president and Congress. 82A good example of this is the caution displayed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in late 1941 as he moved the country to a war-footing, paying attention to public opinion and the concerns of Congress (Kersaw, 2007). 83Note, however, in any political game that is essentially zero-sum, as in Iraq at present, the heart will be very extensive and may represent a chaotic situation.264 Chapter 10. Final Remarks ence between President and Congress. This \u0002rst method of attempting to create democratic order depends on balancing power and risk-taking.84A second, quite different method of mitigating disorder depends on basing choice on judgement rather than preference. Madison was very clear in Federalist X thatrepresentative democracy involves the choice of a person . His argument there suggests that he believed that the voters in the Republic could make a sound choice for the Chief Magistrate if their judgements were not contaminated by preferences . As Madison argues in Federalist X, the choice should be for those who \u0093possess the most attractive merit.\u0094 It is important for the con- stitutional balance between President and Congress that the president be elected by a method that gives what Madison called \u0093a probability of a \u0002t choice.\u0094 Since presidential choices will be made in the context of uncer- tainty and risk, it is vital that the electorate use their judgement in making a \u0002t choice for President. Madison clearly hoped that the selection of the President would be founded on judgement, rather than preference, and that this selection would not exhibit the democratic disorder that he be- lieved could render the legislature ineffective. It can be argued that Madison's argument in Federalist X was partly based on his reading of Condorcet's Essai of 1785.85In constrained sit- uations where we may assume that judgements predominate, and voters evaluate the options in a clear-sighted fashion, then their choice of Chief Magistrate may indeed be well formed in the way that both Condorcet and Madison thought possible. My reading of Federalist X is that Madison hoped that, because the election of the Chief Magistrate involved the selection of a person, rather than an option (as in the passage of a law), judgement rather than pref- erence or interest would predominate. On the basis of the work on the electoral model presented in the earlier chapters, I now consider a more general electoral model that incorporates both judgement and preference. 84Madison's argument for the necessity of this balance is set out in Federalist LI. 85Condorcet's Jury theorem in the Essai refers to the probability that a jury makes a correct choice on the basis of majority rule. Scho\u0002eld (2006a) argues that Madison received work by Condorcet from Jefferson in Paris, and acknowledged receipt on 6 September 1787 (Smith, 1995: 492). This suggests that Madison adapted Condorcet's idea during the Fall of 1787, while writing Federalist X for publication on 22 November 1787.10.2 Preferences and Judgements 265 It is entirely possible, however, that beliefs or judgements in the elec- torate can be transformed in a chaotic fashion. Nonetheless, it is possible that electoral belief can be associated with what may be called a core be- lief. Since a core, in social choice theory, is an unbeaten alternative, we can, by analogy, use the notion of a core belief to refer to a belief that has general acceptance in the society.86 The next section presents a general \u0093Madisonian\u0094 model of election, that, in principle, is applicable to any democratic polity. 10.2 Preferences and Judgements As in earlier chapters, we assume that individuals have preferences that be represented in terms of utility functions on some \u0093policy\u0094 space W. This space characterizes both voter interests, and possible eventualities. The spaceWembodies preferences over economic factors \u0096 labor, cap- ital and land \u0096 with an additional political axis involving civil rights or religion. The interests or beliefs of the population or electorate, V(of sizev), are described by a set fxigof \u0093ideal points,\u0094 one for each voter, i. An individual's ideal point in the space, W, is used to describe or represent that voter's interests. In the empirical models discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, the ideal points were obtained from surveys. The set of options, N, of sizen, is a set fzjg, each one being a point inW. In the situation of an election, each element of Nis a declaration of intended or proposed policy. There is one for each candidate, j. While it is usual to conceive of each zjas simply a point, we can easily allow zj to involve various possibilities, associated with differing probabilities of occurrence. The most general form of the model is one where the \u0093latent utility\u0094 86Of course, a core belief can change rapidly. A core belief in the U.S. electorate circa 2003 was that there existed a close connection between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, and this belief provided the justi\u0002cation for the invasion of Iraq. This belief has turned out to be false. By late 2007 a core belief was forming that the U.S. should leave Iraq.266 Chapter 10. Final Remarks Here\u0012T j\u0011imodels the effect of the socio-demographic characteristics, \u0011i; of voteriin making a political choice. That is, \u0012jis ak-vector specify- ing how the various socio-demographic variables appear to in\u0003uence the choice for option j;so\u0012T j\u0011iis simply a number indicating the in\u0003uence ofi's socio-demographic characteristics on the propensity to choose j. The termAij(xi;zj)is a way of representing the \u0093preference disagree- ment\u0094 between the interests of voter iand thejthoption. In Chapter 7, it was assumed that the function Aij(xi;zj) = jjxi\u0000zjjj2was a quadratic function of the distance between xi, the preferred position (or bliss point) of voteriandzj, the declared policy of candidate j. Here jj \u0000 jj is the Euclidean norm and > 0is the spatial parameter. This model is stochastic because f\"ijgis a set of possibly correlated disturbances. The term\u0016ij(xi;zj)is the perception by a voter, i, with beliefs or interests, xi, of the \u0093valence\u0094 of the option presented by the candidatej. This valence is a way of modeling the non policy judgement by voteriof the quality of candidate j. In the general model, the probability, \u001aij, that voterichooses option j is \u001aij= Pr[uij(xi;zj)>u ij(xi;zk)for allk6=j]: We can apply this model in various ways. First, consider the pure preference based \u0093non-stochastic\u0094 or deter- ministic case where all \"ij= 0, and where valence is zero. The early chapters on social choice theory imply that if decision mak- ing is binary (pitting one option against another), and based on majority rule, or more generally on a non-collegial voting mechanism, then dis- order (in terms of the non-existence of a core) can ensue as long as the dimension of Wis suf\u0002ciently large. This theory seems applicable to the case of legislative decision-making, as discussed in Chapter 6. In the stochastic model of elections we have assumed that { \"ijg 6= 0, with {\"ijg={\"jgindependent of i;and also pairwise independent and identically distributed. This model can be interpreted as focusing on the \u0093beliefs\u0094 or judgements of the participants. In particular, if the spatial coef\u0002cient, ;is0then this is a situation of pure \u0093belief aggregation.\u0094 Individuals will choose among the various options with probability de- termined by the valence judgement that they have made. By analogy with the social choice notion, a core belief is one held by a majority of10.2 Preferences and Judgements 267 the society. Condorcet (1785) argued essentially that a core belief would tend to be a correct belief. Roughly speaking, Condorcet's Jury Theorem asserts that, in a binary choice situation, the probability that a majority selects the true outcome will be greater than the probability that a typical individual will select the truth. Rae (1969) and Scho\u0002eld (1972a,b) used a version of the theorem to argue that an uncertain society should choose majority rule since this rule maximizes the probability of a \u0002t choice. Since judgement will vary in a society, the simplest way to model the variation in beliefs in the society is by supposing that all the valence terms,\u0016ij(xi;zj)are zero, but that judgement is determined solely by the socio-demographic characteristics, \u0011i;of the individual. While this would induce some variation in judgements, voting models based on this assumption perform poorly in predicting voter choice. Moreover, the jury theorem depends on the condition of voter (pairwise) \u0093statistical in- dependence\u0094 which is a very strong assumption. Indeed, this assumption would not be satis\u0002ed in the case that voter judgements were based solely on socio-demographic characteristics.87 This suggests considering a more general case with 6= 0;so both in- terests and judgements are involved. As discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, such a model requires considering how the various candidates respond to the pattern of electoral preferences and beliefs. Chapter 7 considered the simplest case of exogenous or intrinsic valence , where\u0016ij(xi;zj) =\u0015j; for alli:The model showed that we can we expect \u0093convergence\u0094 to the electoral mean only in the case that the differences between the candi- date valences f\u0015jgare \u0093low\u0094 (in comparison to the product of and the electoral variance, as expressed by the upper bound on the convergence coef\u0002cient, c). Convergence implies that the mean electoral preferred point corresponds to a core belief about social policy. Indeed, when all parties converge to the electoral mean, then we can view this point as the \u0093social attractor.\u0094 However, as the empirical examples of Israel and Turkey showed, when the valence differences are suf\u0002ciently high, then parties will adopt different policy positions on the principal electoral axis. Parties with the highest electoral valence will position themselves closer to the electoral 87For example, individual preferences in Iraq are very probably determined by such sociodemographic characteristics, and there is little likelihood of the Jury Theorem be- ing valid in this context.268 Chapter 10. Final Remarks center, and depending on the electoral regime, will either gain an electoral majority, or will be at the legislative core. While there may be a core in this situation, it will not be an attractor, since there can exist groups in the society with divergent political beliefs. Thus existence of a core be- lief depends in a delicate way on the distribution of the intrinsic valences or judgements of the electorate, and the response of political agents to these beliefs. It may also be the case that the social decision is the consequence of what is called a belief cascade . As more individuals decide that option zs, say, is superior, then other voters will, in turn, be swayed to form a judge- ment in favor of zs. Statistical independence will not be satis\u0002ed under the conditions of a belief cascade, though it is possible to conceive of sit- uations where a belief cascade can lead to a justi\u0002ed outcome. Examples given in Scho\u0002eld (2006a) suggest that opposing belief cascades can be generated in a population, particularly in a situation of social quandary. The results of Chapter 7 seem most relevant for electoral systems based on proportional representation (PR). The examples also suggest that it is necessary to extend the electoral model beyond exogenous va- lence, by assuming \u0016ij(xi;zj) =\u0015j+\u0016j(zj);for alli:This additional component of belief, \u0016j(zj);called activist valence, is a function of the behavior of activists, but is again independent of i. This model assumes that valence is directly in\u0003uenced by the contributions of activists, and these are indirectly determined by the policy positions adopted by candi- dates or party leaders. Note that as \u0016j(zj)increases, then the probability that a voter chooses option jalso increases. As discussed in Chapter 8, the model implies that parties balance the centrifugal tendency associated with activist support against the cen- tripetal attraction of the electoral center. However, when the electoral rule is PR, then even small parties can gain representation in the legis- lature. This suggests that activist groups with diverse preferences may support parties that are far from the electoral center. Indeed, the logic of the model suggests that activist groups have little incentive to coalesce under PR. Thus, these diverse activist groups will support a heterogenous set of parties. The data presented in Chapter 6 indicates that PR tends to result in a fragmented legislature. The legislative heart was used in this chapter to estimate the range of policy outcomes resulting from coalition bargaining in the legislature. It was only in a few cases, such as Israel10.2 Preferences and Judgements 269 in 2006 and Turkey in 2007, that the valence of the dominant party was suf\u0002ciently high to allow it to adopt a centrist position from which it was able to control the legislative core. It is obviously possible to extend this model, by allowing an indi- vidual's beliefs, or valence, to be a function of the voter's ideal point. While this is theoretically possible, the determination of political equi- libria would be very dif\u0002cult. On the other hand, incorporating socio- demographic characteristics in the model does allow for this kind of vari- ation in beliefs. One of the long-standing puzzles arising from the study of U.S. poli- tics is why precisely the plurality or majoritarian feature of the U.S. elec- toral system generates a two party structure rather than the fragmented political con\u0002gurations that appear to hold under PR.88The discussion in Chapter 9 leads to the conjecture that the plurality electoral system of the United States gives greater power to activists than is the case in poli- ties based on PR. Activist groups seem to face increasing returns to size, because of the plurality electoral system, and this forces coalecence.89 If this hypothesis is valid, then it would provide a reason why political competition under plurality leads to the two-party system. Because there generally will exist two dimensions of policy, the various activist groups will tend to coalesce into at most four separate and opposed groups, and there will be incentives for these four groups to form just two pre-election activist coalitions.90However, even in the United States, con\u0003ict within such activist coalitions at times of constitutional quandary can lead to the collapse or transformation of the two party coalitions, bringing about a realignment of the political system. Figure 10.1 presents estimates of the positions of possible presiden- tial candidates in the 2008 election. We may interpret these positions as indicative of the range of possible activist groups supporting the various 88Riker (1953, 1964, 1987); Duverger (1954); Filippov, Ordeshook and Shvetsova (2004). 89Notice that the the model of Chapter 8 made use of concavity, or decreasing returns, with respect to the effect of the resources of the groups, once they have formed . This is quite different from the possible increasing returns to scale, induced by a plurality electoral system. 90Chapter 9 noted that strong ideological disagreement within one of the two activist coalitions can lead to its collapse and the entry of a third party candidate.270 Chapter 10. Final Remarks candidates. It is likely that by November 2008, these will have coalesced into just two candidate positions. Although the changes wrought by such recon\u0002guration may be the result of transformations in the beliefs of the electorate, the hope that Madison had over the \u0093probability of a \u0002t choice\u0094 will depend on the ability of the electorate to ascertain the quality of candidates through their accurate judgement of the worth of past decisions and the validity of the proposals for dealing with the future. Madison's concern about the \u0093in\u0003uence of factious leaders\u0094 is as relevant as ever.10.2 Preferences and Judgements 271 References and Further Reading Acemoglu, D., and J.
