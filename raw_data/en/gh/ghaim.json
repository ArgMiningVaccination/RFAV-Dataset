She often combines one or more of the following modalities with Acupuncture for best results: [Classical Acupuncture](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/classical-acupuncture) True healing takes place in the physical body and the mind simultaneously. Acupuncture is rooted in Oriental Medicine, a healing tradition which is at least 5,000 years old. It involves inserting very fine needles into points on the skin to treat pain or restore health. Chinese Medicine teaches us that every chronic disease has an emotional component. By treating both, optimal health can be achieved. [Asian Massage Therapy](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/asian-massage-therapy/) Acupuncture treatment of musculo-skeletal injuries and pain is most effective if combined with a few minutes of therapeutic massage. Marie incorporates several Asian styles of massage she has learned over the years, including Tuina, Amma Therapy, Swedish massage and an ancient Chinese abdominal massage called Zang-Fu Acupressure. [Reiki](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/reiki/) Reiki is a simple and natural method of spiritual and physical healing. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with other medical or therapeutic techniques to promote recovery. It can dramatically relieve stress and promote peace of mind. [Upledger CranioSacral Therapy](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/craniosacral-therapy/) CranioSacral therapy is a gentle method of clearing tension and stress from the muscles and tendons, fascia and nervous system to support optimal health. Dr. John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., has developed and taught this system of healing to licensed practitioners of many specialties including Massage Therapists, Physical Therapists, Occupational Therapists and Acupuncturists. [SomatoEmotional Release](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/somatoemotional-release/) SomatoEmotional Release is a process whereby old emotional trauma and its physical component in the body are released, resulting in a more relaxed, healthy state of body and mind. It was developed and taught by Osteopathic Physician Dr. John Upledger. [Health and Lifestyle Counseling](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/health-and-lifestyle-counseling/) Our daily habits have a major impact on our health. The choices we make every day either support the benefit from acupuncture treatments or interfere with our progress. These factors include exercise, nutrition, sleep and stress management. [Moxibustion](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/moxibustion/) Moxibustion is the application of heat to acupuncture needles for the purpose of enhancing the tonifying action of a point or improving the circulation in a specific channel. It can be helpful for patients with fatigue, edema, pain due to cold or patients who are generally weak. [Cupping](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/cupping/) Cupping is a powerful way to draw pathogens out of the body. It can be used at the first sign of a cold to draw the cold and stiffness out of the muscles. It is also helpful in the treatment of muscular pain. Common placement of cups is on the back, abdomen or chest. But they may be used on the limbs also. The suction action of cups can leave a circular bruise which is temporary and lasts up to a week. So if you're wearing a low cut dress to that wedding you may want to wait till after the ceremony to have this done. [Essential Oils](https://marieregisacupuncture.com/redesign/essential-oils/) The application specific essential oils on acupuncture points can have a powerful therapeutic effect. I have found it helpful for many conditions. They are wonderful for anxiety or depression; very effective for the common cold, skin conditions and allergies, and other issues. I generally use a 5 to 10% dilution of a blend of two or three essential oils and give patients specific instructions for applying it at home. General frequency of use for chronic conditions is 3 days on, 3 days off to avoid habituation. Clinical guided imagery and meditation For patients who complain of insomnia, chronic anxiety, or PTSD, meditation is a powerful adjunct to acupuncture to make faster progress. Studies have shown that meditation can help lower blood pressure, support heart health and improve the quality of sleep. Yes! Im Interested In A Free Phone Consultation! Is it safe? Does it hurt?
