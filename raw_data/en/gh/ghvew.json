The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term \"spectrum\" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity. Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate \u2014 autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society \u2014 socially, in school and at work, for example. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms. Causes Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role. Genetics. Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously. Environmental factors. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity \u2014 from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence \u2014 they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs: \u00b7 Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times \u00b7 Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world \u00b7 Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression \u00b7 Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences \u00b7 Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items \u00b7 Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech \u00b7 Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them \u00b7 Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions \u00b7 Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings \u00b7 Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest \u00b7 Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive \u00b7 Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice Patterns of behavior A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs: \u00b7 Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping \u00b7 Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging \u00b7 Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change \u00b7 Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language \u00b7 Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object \u00b7 Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature \u00b7 Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play \u00b7 Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus \u00b7 Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture Risk factors The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both. Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. These may include: Your child's sex. Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are. Family history. Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder. Other disorders. Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use. Extremely preterm babies. Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder. \u00b7 Parents' ages. There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link. Complications Problems with social interactions, communication and behavior can lead to: \u00b7 Problems in school and with successful learning \u00b7 Employment problems \u00b7 Inability to live independently \u00b7 Social isolation \u00b7 Stress within the family \u00b7 Victimization and being bullied HOMOEOPATHIC REMEDIES Homoeopathy today is a rapidly growing system and is being practiced all over the world.
