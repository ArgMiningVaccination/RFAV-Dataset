EVOLUTION & FORMATION OF SETTLEMENTS S.Vishwanath Rao Director (Planning), Hyderabad Metropoliton Develop ment Authority 1. Introduction: a. From Cave to Village: i. When prehistoric man moved from his cave into shelt ers he constructed of boughs and leaves, he was making the first step toward urbanization. ii. Then man cultivated plants, domesticated animals, a nd introduced agriculture. iii. He created possessions in the form of crops, animal s and tools. Possessions bred rivalry, which in turn brought in the need for protection. iv. For protection, families collected into friendly gr oups and formed villages in which the agrarian population enjoyed t he advantages of mutual protection. v. The villages were located on sites offering natural protection of elevated terrain, islands, peninsulas, or they were surrounded with barricades and moats. b. From Villages to Kingdom: i. Man was a gregarious being. He sought companionship of his fellowmen and devised group entertainment and sport s. ii. The village brought something new to the lives of p rimitive man. It introduced the necessity for mutual responsibility and coB operation. iii. There were varied interests common to all inhabitan ts, and they were merged into a form of society, a social and po litical Organisation. iv. The stronghold of the village became an appropriate sanctuary for the altar of his deity. It provided a place for wor ship, a meeting place for assembly, and a center for trade. The env ironment became popular, and urbanization began. v. His protective instinct and selfBpreservation and s uperstition led to personal rivalry within the village, and the most p owerful assumed the role of tribal leadership, maintaining communal order with the aid of cudgel. vi. Rivalry spread between villages, armed conflict ens ued, and barricades were transformed into fortified walls. S everal villages came under the domination of the victorious tribe, and it's leader rose to the position of ruler. In time kingdoms wer e created, and rulers took the titles of king and emperor. c. Development of the City: i. Society has been forged in the crucible of natural forces. In the above scenario, man has faced the necessity to impr ove economic security, correct social maladjustments, discard ma ss superstitions, or resist seizure of power by autocr ats bent upon personal glory and selfBaggrandizement. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 2 ii. Evolving from these conflicts the development of ci ty began and marked the culture of a people. iii. The physical form of cities has been shaped by the economic, social and political forces of society. iv. In history of city development, the primary distinc tion in the pattern of cities is marked by the transitions from a slave to a mercantile economy and from slingshot to gunpowder warfare. Few cities in which great cultures thrived began with a plan. Cities developed by a process of accretionB the growth wer e irregular in form, sensitive to changes in the habits of people, and dynamic in character. Cities began as free cities which men se ttled by voluntary choice. Geometric form was introduced acc ording to the manner in which the land was apportioned / divided among the inhabitants. Colonial cities founded by great state s were given a formal pattern predetermined by a ruling authority. Privileged land owners subdivided their lands into regular form of plots for allocation to settlers. v. Cities have been subjected to the process of contin uous remodeling through the ages, and the variety of forms and desi gns is reflected and stamped on the cities by the motives of the cit y builders, from emperors to subBdividers. vi. A civilization is measured by the monuments it prod uced. Certain cultural characteristics are revealed by these stru ctures. But the city is not the monuments alone nor is it the palac e, the temple or a collection of art objects. It means the whole peopl e who inhabit it, the habitation areas, the shops in which they work, the streets they travel, and the places in which they trade. d. Cities of Ancient Civilizations: i. Early civilizations mostly from 2000 B C onwards, s pread along the fertile valleys of great rivers like Nile (Egypt), TigrisBEuphrates (Mesopotamia), Indus (Indus valley) and the Yangste Bkiang (Chinese), where food, water, and transportation we re at hand. A series of great and small empires rose, waged wars, and fell. The people were slaves of ruling class, and they bowed before the reigning king as before a deity. ii. In Egypt, it was the Pharaohs. They built great tem ples cities, monumental avenues, colossal plazas, and rockBcut t ombs (earlier as mastabas and later as Pyramids ). Towns were built like huge barracks for the slaves and artisans with sunBdried bricks as cells and compartments about common courtyards. Narrow la nes served as open drainage sewers as well as passageways to t he dwellings. Walls surrounded the towns primarily for protection from seasonal floods of the Nile rather than from armies of invad ing enemies. iii. In Indus Valley, Harappa and MohenjoBDaro were prin cipal cities built of burnt bricks. The streets were arranged in a regular pattern with dwellings compactly built about interior court yards. The heights of buildings were established in proportion to the width of the streets, one and two storeyed buildings predomi nating. Sanitation was of a relatively high order with syst em of underground sewers extending about the towns. iv. In Mesopotamia, a series of empires rose and fell, and humble villages along the valley of Tigris and Euphrates r ivers became monumental cities of the kings. Each town was heavi ly fortified with walls as thick as 35 feet to resist the siege of enemies. The stately palace -temple or ziggurat dominated the city, and people Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 3 lived in their urban existence in the shadows of sl avery and superstitious religions and with economic hardships . v. One of the great kings of Babylon, King Hammurabi, seeking to improve the lot of the common people, in 2100 B C c odified his laws of justice. This was also the dawn of building regulations. The concept of safety in the doctrine \"an eye for an ey e, a tooth for a tooth\" was imposedB if the wall of a building shoul d fall and kill the son of the occupant, then the life of the builder's son would be sacrificed. Another king was Nebuchadnezzar who bui lt processional avenues, great walls, monumental gates and hanging gardens in Babylon. e. Cretan Civilization: Around the same time along the Aegean Sea, another civilization rose called the Cretan Civilization which was an enlight ened society in the islands, where the palace served as a center of com munity life. The towns sites without fortified walls offered natural protection by the sea, while in Greece, during the same time, cities devel oped with heavy fortifications and ramparts.. The palace and town h ad highly developed systems of water supply, sanitation and drainage. T he streets were narrow lanes but were paved with stones meandering along the rough topography of the sites. The people enjoyed free ac cess to the sea and entered into trade with other lands. f. Greek Civilization: On the mainland of Greece, during 8 th Century B C, the Greek Civilization succeeded the Cretan Civilization and evolved with acropolis and cityBstates with democracy set in. There were n o palaces, and public buildings were few and simple. For the Greek s the temple was the symbol of democratic way of life and the temple s were built with grandeur. The common assembly place was the openBai r podium and the agora or marketBplace which were center of urba n activity. g. Hippodamus- the Father of Town Planning: Hippodamus, an architect in the 5 th Century BC has been credited with the origination of gridBiron street system to obtain a rational arrangement of buildings and circulation. The city plan was conceived as a design to serve all the people, with the indiv idual house as the common denominator, and the city was limited to 10, 000 populations. Blocks were shaped to provide appropriate spaces fo r the dwellings within them. The functional use of buildings was re cognized in the arrangement of streets and their orientation. h. Roman Civilization: The Romans succeeded the Greeks and set up an impos ing civilization on the very same lands of the Greeks. While the Gre eks were philosophers, the Romans were conquerors, skilled e ngineers and aggressive cityBbuilders with a flair for garguatan scale. They developed water supply and distribution, drainage systems, ho t water systems, great highways, huge monuments, triumphant arches , for and colosseums for sports. The scale of these structure s, the spaces they enclosed and the architectural fitments and sculptu res were imposing. i. The Medieval Town of Europe: By the 5 th Century AD , the Roman Empire had crumbled under the weight of luxury, pomp and ceremony. European civil ization declined, Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 4 trade disintegrated, and the urban population retur ned to rural life. It was the Dark Age. Cities shrank in size and importa nce, and social and economic confusion followed. Feudalism had set in a nd thrived. This gave impetus to return to towns as countryside was not safe, and fortifications were extended to include all dwellin gs that clustered about the castle and church / monastery. This brought in revival of trade and commerce which was advantageous to the feudal lords . Merchants and craftsmen formed guilds to strengthen their social and economic position. The early medieval town was dominated by the church. The church plaza became the market place, and guilds es tablished town hall along with guild halls. The roads radiated fro m the church plaza and market square to the fortified gates, with seco ndary lateral roads connecting them. The pattern was made irregular to confuse the enemy. j. The Neo-Classical City: i. The number of towns in medieval age increased rapid ly with restriction on population. But their size was restr icted by the girth of the fortifications, water supply, and sanitation and the distance across did not exceed one mile. There was no sewage disposal and drainage was by way of streets. Travel was a limiti ng factor, and hence towns were spaced within ready reach of each other for communication and mutual assistance in times of con flicts. Commerce increased between towns and successful mer chants expanded and consolidated their business interest i n several towns, and with the danger from military aggression dimini shing, safety and travel increased. With the rise of the merchant class and church, the feudal lords power declined. In the tow ns there emerged town privileged class, the nobles and the c lergy. Land ownership gradually shifted to the wealthy merchant s. A new economy arose supplementing the feudal economy with money lending, possession and control of money. The manor house of the nobleman grew spacious while the typical dwelling o f the common man remained cramped and moved up in the attics. ii. During this period, the towns reverted to a conditi on inferior to the days Wheel traffic became congested, dark and filth Bridden from refuse thrown from dwelling windows, and provision for elimination of waste was inadequate. Excreta were disposed in c ess pools beneath dwelling floors. Odour from filth in the st reets was overcome by keeping windows or shutters closed. Ven tilation was by way of chimney only. Overcrowding within the sma ll dwellings of the poor increased the hazards to health and the sp read of epidemics. Disease spread rapidly in times of epide micBin the 14 th century AD, the Black Plague wiped out nearly half of the urban population. k. Renaissance and the Baroque City: i. Renaissance began in the early 16 th Century in all fields of art, political thought, culture, buildings, economy, and way of living. Rulers displayed their affluence and power by impro ving their cities. The church participated in this movement. P ractice of art and working in artistic fields became a profession. The basic form of cities did not change, but the structure was dec orated with facades of classic elements. Kings, nobles and Pope s became patrons of the arts and bid heavily for the service s of the growing number of practitioners. The monumental character o f the classic returned to the city. The modeling of spatial forms absorbed the Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 5 attention and skills of the designers and planners, and classic elements were ingeniously assembled to form the spa ces. Space was of unparalleled proportions and scale of incomp rehensible size. ii. Out of the cramped medieval town were carved formal \"squares\". Since fortification was no longer useful, these wer e torn down and boulevards and promenades were laid. iii. An air of grandeur permeated the courts of kings. T ransition from Renaissance period to Baroque Period was in process . iv. In the 18 th Century, the Baroque City expanded , and dominance of the ruler intensified. For example, in Paris the entire city was designed to revolve around the palace with avenues radiating out and scale became grander. In Rome Piazzas became th e focus around which other elements of urban design were la id. l. New Colonial Development: Elsewhere in America which was rife with new settle rs the mood was different. New towns were laid by formal plans to h uman scale, but these were neither revolved around monumental featu res nor were it overpowered by them. The surveyor's compass and sca le dominated not only the town but also the land subBdivisions with rigid gridBiron street patterns. The grid iron pattern adopted in America was not only the simplest form to survey, but also a satisfactory fo rm for the small town or village. A sense of unity was maintained between the town square and dwellings and the agricultural land on outskirt s. m. The Industrial Revolution & Modern Age: With the 19 th Century came the dawn of the Machine Age. The Renaissance and Industrial Revolution transformed t he way cities were built, the way people worked and lived and heralded the advent of the new science age. Transportation of both goods and p eople was revolutionalised. Environmental aspects like public health, public safety and sanitation became paramount in settlemen t planning and habitations. Model towns based on modern town plann ing principles were developed. The concept of building bylaws, lay out and street regulations and Master Plan was evolved. The invent ion of Portland cement, elevator, RCC, modern plumbing system, mode rn road constructions methods changed the way buildings wer e planned, designed and built. * * * Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 6 2. URBANIZATION B. Purushothama Reddy Director of Town and Country Planning, Hyderabad 1. Urban Area: As per Census of India, Urban area is defined as an 'area' which has a. Population more than 5000 b. Population Density 400 persons per sq.km c. 75% of the male working population doing non agricu ltural activities. d. In addition to the above, the State Government may also declare an area as urban for administrative purposes. Urbanization is Measured Based on the Percent Urban Population and UrbanBRural Ratio. 2. World Urbanization: a. As given in at Table 1.1, in the World, about 47 pe rcent population lives in urban areas by 2001. In the More Developed Countries about three quarters of people live in urban areas, in the Least Developed Countries only around a quarter of the population live in ur ban areas. b. When measured in terms of urbanBrural ratio, in the More Developed region of the world, three times as much population lives in urban areas in comparison to rural areas. In contrast, in the L east Developed countries, only about a third of every hundred (per son living in rural areas) lives in urban areas. Among the Continents, the lowest proportion of urban population is found in Asia being only thi rtyBseven percent. Table 1.1 c. The urbanBrural ratios for Africa and Asia are almo st equal being around sixty, which is strikingly much less when compared with Europe, Northern America and South America. Brazil is the m ost urbanized and Bangladesh is the least urbanized among the ten mos t populous countries in the world, with around eightyBone perc ent and twentyBfive percent of population living in urban areas respect ively.

Trend of Urbanization in India: a. India shares most characteristic features of urbani zation in the developing countries. Number of urban agglomeration s / towns has grown from 1827 in 1901 to 5161 in 2001. Number of total population has increased from 23.84 crores in 1901 to 102.7 cr ores in 2001 whereas number of population residing in urban area s has increased from 2.58 crores in 1901 to 28.53 crore in 2001 and the trend of urbanization in India is shown in Table 1.2 and Fig 1.1. India is at acceleration stage of the process of urbanization. Table 1.2 TREND OF URBANIZATION IN INDIA 1901 - 2001 Census Years Number of Urban Agglomerations / Towns Total Population (in crores) Urban Population (in crores) Rural Population (in crores) 1901 23.84 4. Degree of Urbanization in India: a. From table 1.3 it is clear that percent urban has i ncreased from 11% in 1901 to 28% in 2001, whereas percent rural has show n gradual decrease from 89% to 72% over a century. The urbanBrural rat io in 2001 is about 38 which mean that against every 100 ruralites ther e are 38 urbanites in India as per Census, 2001. All these indices pin po int that India is in the process of urbanization and it is at the accelerati on stage of urbanization as represented in Fig 1.2. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 8 Fig 1.2 Source: Census of India 5. Urban Morphology of India: a. As per 1901 census percentage of population in Clas s I, IV, V were 26%, 21%, and 20%, respectively. According to 1991 Censu s, about two third (65%) of the country's urban population lived in Cl ass I towns with more than 100,000 population. In 2001 it has increased t o 69%. Over the years there has been continuous concentration of po pulation in Class I towns. On the contrary, the concentration of popula tion in medium and small towns either fluctuated or declined (Kundu, 1 994). The basic reason for the increasing dominance of Class I town s is graduation of lower order towns into Class I category. It may be observed that in 1901 there were only 24 Class I towns that have gone up to 393 in 2001 which explains largely the increase in the share of popul ation in this size category over the years. However in addition to fac tor of increase in number of large cities, the importance of a faster demographic growth, poverty induced (Mukherjee, 1995) migration to urba n informal sector should be taken into account in making urban struct ure top heavy. This is largely due to the fact that the towns in lower categories have grown in Table 1.3 DEGREE / INDEX OF URBANISATION 1901 -2001 Census Years Percent Urban Percent Rural Urban - Ru ral Ratio (Percent) 1901 10.84 Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 9 size and entered the next higher category (Kundu, 1 994).

Urban Scenario of Andhra Pradesh: a. Andhra Pradesh is the 5 th largest State with Urban Population in India. Urban Population in the State was 18.40 lakhs in 19 01 whereas it increased to 205.0 lakhs in 2001. When compared to State's total population, urban population constituted 9.6% in 19 01, whereas it went up to 27.1% (16 th rank in the country) in 2001. There were 116 towns in 1901 and were increased to 210 in 2001. The pattern of urbanization in the State is more or less similar to the pattern in India, which can be seen in the table 1.6 below. Significantly there is rapid urbanization both at Country and State levels in the last six decades .

Out of 213 towns in the State, the majority of the urban population lives in ClassBI towns. In 1991 the urban population in C lassBI towns constituted 66.9%. i.e. with a population of 119.1 lakhs compared to total 178.1 lakhs urban population in the State. Si gnificantly, though no. of towns are increased in other classes, the percen tage of urban population is decreasing over the years from 1971. 7. Urbanisation of Hyderabad: a. Hyderabad urban agglomeration with a population of 3.68 million in 2001 is India's 6 th largest city and comprises of 17.98% of the urban population of Andhra Pradesh. In 1901, Hyderabad ha d less than half a million population. It became a million plus city i n 1951, with a population of 1.08 million. The City took almost fo ur decades between 1951 B 1981 to add another million people to its fo ld and attain a size of 2.25 million. However, in the subsequent two decade s, i.e., in half the time span, it has grown by more than a million to a ttain its present size which is represented in Table 1.7 and Fig. 1.4. Table 1.7 Fig 1.4 Population Growth in Hyderabad 1901- 2001 Year Total Population Annual Gr.

A look at the annual growth rates in the City revea ls that there have been fluctuating highs and lows, roughly in the ran ge of B1% to 3% between 1911 B 1961. In 1971, the growth rate peake d to 3.5%, which, by 2001, declined to 1.6% (virtually half in 40 yea rs). This could be indicative of the fact that the City is moving towa rds greater demographic stability. c. The comparison of the demographic characteristics o f Hyderabad versus the rest of the state reveals that between 1991B01, the decadal population growth rate for the city is 17% which is more than that of the State at 14%. It has to be noted that the growth ra te for the city has more than halved (from 38% to about 17%) during the same period. Decadal population growth rate in Hyderabad between 1981B91 at about 40% (or, 4% annual growth rate, on an average) was almost 15% higher than that in the rest of the State (Table 1.8). Table 1.8 DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS: HYDERABAD AND ANDHRA P RADESH 2001 8. Million -Plus Cities in India a. Number of million plus cities (table: 8) have incre ased from 5 in 1951 to 23 in 1991 and to 35in 2001. About 37% of the total urban population lives in these million plus/ UA cities.

Basic Feature and Pattern of India's Urbanization: a. Basic feature of Urbanization can be highlighted as : i Lopsided urbanization induces growth of Class I tow ns. ii Urbanization occurs without industrialization and s trong economic base. iii Urbanization is mainly a product of demographic exp losion and poverty induced rural B urban migration. iv Rapid urbanization leads to massive growth of slum followed by misery, poverty, unemployment, exploitation, inequa lities, degradation in the quality of urban life. v Urbanization occurs not due to urban pull but due t o rural push. vi Poor quality of ruralBurban migration leads to poor quality of urbanization (Bhagat, 1992). vii Distress migration initiates urban decay. b. The big cities attained inordinately large populati on size leading to virtual collapse in the urban services and quality of life. 10. Problems of Urbanization: a. Problems of urbanization are manifestation of lopsi ded urbanization, faulty urban planning and urbanization with poor ec onomic base and without having functional categories. i. Due to such urbanization, certain basic problems ar e being witnessed in the fields of: 1) Housing, 2) Slums, 3) Transport , 4) Water supply and Sanitation, 5) Water pollution and Air pollution, 6) Inadequate provision for social infrastructure (sch ool, hospital, etc). ii. Most of these cities using capital intensive techno logies can not generate employment for the distressed rural poor. So there is transfer of rural poverty to urban poverty. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 13 iii. Megacities grow in urban population (Nayak, 1962) n ot in urban prosperity, and culture. Hence it is urbanization w ithout urban functional characteristics. iv. Urbanization is degenerating social and economic in equalities (Kundu and Gupta, 1996) which warrants social confl icts, crimes and antiBsocial activities. * * * Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 14 3. PROBLEMS OF URBANIZATION - NEED FOR PLANNING Maheep Singh Thappar Planning Consultant, Adapt Technologies. 1. THE CHALLENGES: a. Demographic - Reality i. Million plus cities in India have more than doubled in the last two decades from 23 in 1991 to 48 in 2011. ii. The total percentage of urban population living in India has grown from 27.8% in 2001 to 31.8% in 2011. iii. India contains around 18% of the total world popula tion this is a significant figure. b. Economy-Reality i. GDP of some cities is becoming equal or more than a few countries. ii. Metropolitan regions have become the size of states and countries. iii. Large cities that will account for 70% of the net e mployment and 85% of the total tax revenues c. The Socio-Economic reality & The Political Debate i. UrbanBRural Divide. What to focus on? 1) Tackling this issue at a regional level B Provision of Urban Services in Rural Areas (PURA) 2) Balancing the relationship between the city core and the periphery. d. Standards i. Studies have pointed out that Indian cities have on an average 2.7 sq mtrs of open space per capita where the basic mi nimum is 9 and the best in class is 16 sq mtrs per capita. Will t his be sufficient to give a healthy life to all urban citizens? ii. Normal practice of greening cities has been largely limited to the physical space. iii.

TYPES OF MAPS & SCALE OF MAP & DATA COLLECTION P.A.S.M.Lakshman Rao Joint Director (Regular Establishment), Directorate of Town &Country Planning 1. MAPS - Meaning and Definition: a. The map may be defined as the representation of the earth's pattern as a whole or a part of it, or of the heavens on a plane surface, with conventional signs, drawn to a scale and projection to that each and every point on it corresponds to the actual terrest rial or celestial position. The amount of information to be represent ed on the map depends on: (i). Scale, (ii). Projection, (iii). Co nventional signs, (iv). Skill of the draughtsman, and (v) Methods of mapBmaking. b. There are various ways by which the earth is mapped : i. by actual survey with the help of the instruments l ike chain, plane table, prismatic compass and theodolite, etc., ii. by photographs and iii. by freehand sketches and diagrams. iv. Now, by computer maps are being precisely construct ed. Satellites are also being used for mapping large areas of the earth quite accurately. 2. History of Maps: a. For the first time, over 3000 years ago, the Egypti ans prepared more feasible maps, showing particularly land boundaries with a view to making proper assessment of revenue. b. The credit for laying the foundation of modern cart ography goes, in fact, to the ancient Greek geographers whose achievements in this Greek geographers like Aristotle, Eratosthenes and Ptolem y etc. The Greek cartography culminated in the works of Ptolemy. His \"Geographia\" contained a map of the world and other twentyBsix d etailed maps. c. The introduction of airplane photography in the beg inning of the 20 th century ushered in a new phase in topographical sur veying. This meB thod is quicker, cheaper and especially useful for mapping comparatively unknown or unexplored regions of the Chittagong district was prepared on the 6 inches to the mile scale. 3. Types of Maps a. Maps are pictures or representations of the Earth's surface. They show how places are related to each other by distance, d irection, and size. Maps are a way of showing a part of the Earth's sur face on a flat piece of paper Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 27 b. Maps are flat but they are made to represent an are a that is on a sphere, Earth. This can cause what is called distortion (c hanges in the shape of an object). The areas of a map closest to the equa tor have little distortion. The closer a map moves towards the pol es the more distorted the map becomes. For example, Greenland appears to be much larger on a map than it really is. 4. Maps have keys. The objects on a map are represented using symbols. A symbol is a picture on the map that represents something in the real world. To understand the symbols on a map you need a key. Maps use a key, or legend to explain the meaning of each of the symbols used in the map. The key usually shows a small picture of each of the symbols used on the map, along with a written description of the meaning of each symbol. While classifying maps into different categories: a. Scale and b. Purpose or content. According to scale maps may be classified as follow s: 5. Maps have scales. Maps are scaled down so that they fit on paper. W hen scaling down a map, every part of the map is scaled by the same amount. This is done to make sure that every object on the map is the same proportion as everything else on the map. Because the Earth is round, and maps are flat, it is impossible to create a map wit h a perfect scale. Some parts of the map will be too large, while others wi ll be too small. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 28 You can read a map or globe. We can identify locat ions on the Earth's surface by using a grid system of latitude and longitude. Lati tude gives a north and south direction and longitude gives an east and west dire ction. This system helps us in measuring distances and finding directions betwe en places on the Earth's surface. The starting point is the prime meridian, with represents 0\u00ba longitude. The exact opposite position at 180\u00ba is called the I nternational Date Line, which is where the date actually changes. a. Cadastral maps: The term cadastral is derived from the French word cadastre meaning register of territorial property. The cadastral map s are drawn to register the ownership of landed property by demarcating the boundaries of fields and buildings etc. They are especially prepa red by the government to realize revenue and tax. The village maps of our country may be cited as example, which are drawn on a very large scale, varying from 16 inches to the mile to 32 inches to the mile so as t o fill in all possible details. b. Topographical maps : The topographical maps are also prepared on a fairl y large scale being based on precise surveys. They show general surface features in detail comprising both natural landscape and cultural land scape. Unlike cadastral maps, the scale of topographical maps var ies in general from one inch to the mile to 1/4 inch to the mile. They do not show boundaries of individual plots or buildings; it is rather the principal toB pographic forms like relief and drainage, swamps an d forests, villages and towns and means of communication, etc., that ar e depicted on them. b. Wall maps : Drawn boldly so that they may be used in the classB room. The world as a whole or in hemispheres is distinctly represented on the wall maps. c. Chorographical or Atlas maps : The Atlas maps are drawn on a very small scale and give a more or less highly generalized picture regarding the physical, climatic and economic conditions of different regions of the earth. The map is, however, named after its content when o nly one aspect or feature is shown. For example, if only means of com munication roads, railways, airways, etc.,Bare shown it may be called communication map . A population map denotes distribution of man over an area. When many features are shown on a map, it may be na med either after the main idea reflected by it or according to the total aspect shown by it. For instance, the map showing the distribution of impor tant agricultural, Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 29 mineral and industrial products, with important cen ters linked by various means of communication may be termed economic map b ecause from it the nature of economic development of the region may be interpreted. d. Climate Maps B give general information about the climate and precipitation (rain and snow) of a region. Cartogra phers, or mapmakers, use colors to show different climate or precipitati on zones e. Economic or Resource Maps B feature the major types of natural resources or economic activity in an area. Cartogra phers use symbols to show the locations of natural resources or economic activities. For example, wheat on a map of Maryland tells you that wheat is grown there. f. Physical Maps B illustrate the physical features of an area, suc h as the mountains, rivers and lakes. The water is usually s hown in blue. Colors are used to show relief\u2014differences in land elevati ons. Green is usually used at lower elevations, and orange or brown show higher elevations. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 30 g. Political Maps B do not show physical features. Instead, they sho w state and national boundaries and capital and major citie s. A capital city is usually marked with a star within a circle. h. Street Maps/Road Maps B street maps illustrate smaller areas such as towns and cities. People use street maps to find d irections to a place they want to go. A road map shows the highways or inters tates. These maps are also used to find directions. i. Topographic Maps B include contour lines to show the shape and elevation of an area. Lines that are close together show steep terrain, and lines that are far apart show flat terrain. Many h ikers use topographic maps, especially in areas where there are no roads with signs. Geologists depend on topographic maps to record the types of r ocks. Engineers use Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 31 topographic maps when they are planning roads, buil dings, or other human-made structures. j. Thematic Map: A thematic map is a map that focuses on a particul ar theme or special topic and they are different from the six aforementioned general reference maps because they do not just sho w natural features like rivers, cities, political subdivisions, elevat ion and highways. If these items are on a thematic map, they are background in formation and are used as reference points to enhance the map's theme . 5.2. Importance and Uses of Maps : No other science is so much dependent upon maps as are called isohyets, (isopluves ), isotherms and isobars, etc., respectively. All t hose maps in which lines of equal values are shown are called isopleth maps. The distribution of sheep or horse or any other object may be shown by putting dots of uniform size, each dot representing a defin ite number or quantity; these are called dot maps. 6. Scales a. Definition : The scale indicates the proportion which a distance between two points on a map bears to the distance between the correspo nding points on the actual ground. If for instance, an actual dista nce of 5 miles is represented on the map by a distance of 1 inch, the scale is 1\" = 5 miles. According to our need we can have \"small scales\" an d \"large scales\". The scale we choose primarily depends on i. the size of area to be mapped, ii. the amount of details to be shown, and iii. The size of the paper. b. \"Small scales\" show miles to the inch; as, for inst ance, the cycling and motoring maps which are generally either 1 mile to the inch or 2 miles to the inch. The atlas maps are drawn on a still sm aller scale. These may vary from a few miles to the inch to several hu ndred miles to the inch. \"Large scales\" are scales of inches to the mi le. Navigator's charts and property survey plans, for example, are drawn o n large scales of say 6\" to 1 mile, or 25\" to 1 mile or even larger. 6.2. Representation : There are three ways in which the scale is depicted on the map. a. By such a statement as \"3 inches to the mile\" or \"1 /3 mile to the inch.\" Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 32 We are familiar with inch distances and, thus, can easily read off miles on the map. b. By a graphic scale as shown in Fig. Here a straight line is divided into a number of equal parts and is marked to show what th ese divisions represent on actual ground. c. By a Representative Fraction. d. This expresses the proportion of the scale by a fra ction in which the numerator is one and the denominator also in the sa me unit of length. For example, if the Representative Fraction (Common ly written as R.F.) is stated to be 1/100,000, or 1: 100,000, this mean s that one unit on the map represents 100,000 of the same unit on the ground. This unit may be an inch or a centimeter or any other foreign unit. The advantage of expressing the scale in terms of the R . F. is that one can judge distances on a foreign map even if he is not familiar with the linear measurements of that country. Thus R.F = map distance / ground distance Now the R.F. is always expressed in terms of a frac tion in which the numerator is one. We have 2\" = 63,360\" ... 1\" = 63,360/2 R.F. is 1/31,680 o r 1:31,680. 6.3. Design and Division of Scales : a. The scale should always be expressed on a map in al l the three ways mentioned, i.e., (a) there should be a linear scale , (b) the scale should be stated in figures e.g., 1/1 = 1 mile, and (c) th e R. F. should also be mentioned. On a manuscript map which is to be print ed on the same size the scale may be indicated as above but if the map is to be reduced or enlarged for printing, the scale may be conveniently shown only in a graphic form. b. The length of the scale should be between 4 to 6 in ches and thus a round number should be guessed which could be repre sented by a length between 4\" to 6\". c. It is convenient to make the scale represent distan ce which is a multiple of 10. d. There are two designs of Scale division. i. Fully divided: The scale is divided into small divi sions throughout its length. ii. Open divided: The scale is divided into large divis ions called \"primaries\" and the First primary on the left is su bdivided into smaller divisions called \"secondaries. This type is more convenient for drawing 6.4. Use of Graphic Scale : a. To measure distances between two points on the map: b. To measure out a certain length from the scale: 6.5 Comparative Scales: a. Different Units: b. Time Scales: c. Pace Scales: d. Revolution Scales: 6.6 Special Types: If the contours on a map are drawn at an interval o f 100 feet, then the Vertical Interval (V.I.) is said to be 100 feet. Th e horizontal distance between Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 33 two successive contours is the Horizontal Equivalen t (H.E.), and, obviously, its length varies with the degree of slope. The ste eper the slope the smaller the Horizontal Equivalent. a. Square Root Scales : Sometimes in geographical maps for showing the dist ribution of certain quantitative elements the use is made of circular g raphs (also known as pie graph). Here the area of the circle is made pro portional to the quantities represented. The area of a circle being and the value of being constant, it is obvious that the radius will be pro portional to the square root of the quantity. b. Cube Root Scales: Sometimes in statistical maps instead of circles, s pheres are drawn to represent different quantities. The volume of the s pheres is proportional to the quantities represented by each sphere. Since the volume of a sphere is 4/3 or the cube roots of the quantities w ill be proportionate to the radii of the spheres. c. Scales of Verticals : Aerial photographs are sometimes used for the map to get detailed information about the natural and cultural features of an area. The most common types are the vertical photos. d. Perspective Scales : A Perspective scale is used in landscape drawingsBb lock diagrams, fieldB sketches, etc. A perspective scale decreases from t he foreground to a vanishing point on the horizon (Fig. ) in which the lines A B, CD and E F are indicating the same elevation on the ground t hough they are decreasing in length. e. Diagonal Scales: A diagonal scale can be conveniently used for divid ing a short line into equal parts. f. Vernier Scales: The vernier is a device which enables a fraction of a division to be estimated with accuracy. g. Enlargement or Reduction of Scales: This means the changing of the scale of a map or a portion of it. The enlargement is chiefly done (I) to get a base map o n which details may be added later by survey and (2) to get more space for labeling further information. Reduction might become necessary, say, to combine four large scale maps into one. a. Square Method : i. The method of enlargement or reduction is to work b y squares. The map to be enlarged or reduced is divided into any s uitable net work of squares. Then on a sheet of paper squares are dr awn representing the squares to be reproduced on the ne w scale proportionately larger or smaller. Enlargement or r eduction is usually done by squares because certain maps are al ready divided Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 34 into squares and the time to divide the map into sq uares is saved. Otherwise any other convenient figure, e.g., a tria ngle can also be used. ii. After the original map has been divided up into squ ares and squares have been drawn on a fresh sheet of paper p roportionately larger or smaller details are carefully transferred square by square. First the prominent marks like rivers, roads, railw ays, etc., are lightly sketched in and then other details are inte rpolated later. iii. So, calculation is only necessary to find out the s ize of the squares required on the new scale to represent the squares on the original, and size can be found out from the proportion. iv. New scale / Old scale = X. b. Similar Triangle Method : This method is used for reducing or enlarging a nar row area, such as a road, railway, river, canal which would otherwise b e very difficult. Suppose in Fig. the river between A and B is to be reduced on the scale of 8:3. c. Instrumental Methods : The instrumental methods of the reduction and enlar gement of maps involve the use of proportional compasses which are stated below, i. Pantograph, ii. Eidograph, iii. Camera Lucida, iv. Photostat and photographic equipment. 7. Panthograph : The pantograph comprises a framework of four tabula r barsBtwo large ones and two short ones; freely hinged together at the j oints to form a parallelogram and is mounted on small wheels (casto rs) which give it free movement. Its working is based on the principles of similar triangles and its precision on a number of factors amongst which the most important is the accuracy with which the jointed parallelogram has b een constructed by the makers. The instrument is generally used for reduct ion of plans, charts and maps. It can also be used for enlargement, but in s o doing, even a little error in the movement of the tracer point on the or iginal map will appear several times magnified on the enlarged copy. 8. Photostat and Photographic Methods : Photostatic or photographic methods of enlargement and reduction are, no doubt, the costliest of all the methods so far disc ussed but at the same time are capable of giving the highest degree of precisi on. However, the operation of the Photostat machine is not simple and it requi res one to be fully familiar with their various parts and their functio ns. The quality of the reduced or enlarged print depends largely upon the accurate working of such photographic processes as focusing, exposing, preparation of solution for developing and fixing, washing, drying, and tri mming. 9. Combining Scales: Sometimes it becomes necessary to combine maps of two adjacent areas on different scales into a map d rawn to a scale different from either For example, if we have two maps with F. 1:10,000,000 and 1:20,000,000, and we are required to draw a new map on a scale of 1: Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 35 15,000,000, we can cover the first map with one inc h squares and the second map with half inch squares and then the size of the corresponding squares on the new map will be 2/3 inch. See Figs. 10. Scales from the Length of a Degree of Latitude: The length of a degree of latitude on a straight me ridian is approximately equal to 69 miles and this fact can be utilized to find the R. F., if the scale is not given on the map. For example, the length of on e degree of latitude on a given map is found to be 1.2 inches; the R. F. is e qual to 1.2 / 69 x 63,360 = 1 / 3,643,200 11. Measurement of Distance: Some difficulty lies in the measurement of the length of irregular lines on a map, such as roads, railways, rivers. The following methods may be followed: (i) if the line is not too irregular it will be convenient to mark off short straight portions on it with dividers and their values may be enumerated to give the length. (ii) A piece of thread or fine wire may be spread along the line following each curve, and then stretched along a scale to give the length. 12. Measurement of Area: Square Method: If maps are drawn on squared paper the area can be easily calculated. Supposing if a map on a scale of 1\"= I mile has bee n drawn on a squared paper showing one inchBbig squares subBdivided into oneBtenthBinch small squares, the area of the map can be calculated by f irst counting the number of complete big squares and then the number of small squares within the boundary. In counting the small squares the fractions which are more than half within the boundary can be taken as complete squares and those which are less than half can be neglected. In this case I sq. inch= I sq. mile and if there be 20 complete big squares an d 35 small squares within the boundary the area of the map will be 20+ 3.5 sq. miles = 23.5 sq. miles. *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 36 2. TYPES OF SURVEY & SURVEYING TECHNIQUES P.Anvesh Assistant Director, CUDS, Dr.MCR HRD 1. TECHNIQUES The techniques used for surveying and land measurem ent are dependent upon the type of survey being conducted. In this se ction there are two choices: 2. TYPES OF SURVEY A simple classification is: a. Land surveys, which fix property lines, calculate l and areas and assist with the transfer of real property from one owner t o another. b. Engineering surveys, which collect the data needed to plan and design engineering projects. The information ensures the n ecessary position and dimension control on the site so that the struc ture is built in the proper place and as designed. c. Informational surveys obtain data concerning topogr aphy, drainage and manBmade features of a large area. This data is portrayed as maps and charts. 3. Another way to make a simple classification is: a. Geodetic surveys are precise and over large areas r equire the curvature of the earth to be considered. Distances and angle measurements must be very, very accurate. A wide va riety of techniques are used including triangulation, traver sing, trilateration, leveling and astronomical direction fixing. b. 2. Plane surveys, which consider the surface of the earth to be a plane. Curvature is ignored and calculations are pe rformed using the formulas of plane trigonometry and the properties o f plane geometry. These may be considered accurate for limited areas. c. SubBcategories of the major classes provide more in sight into the various fields of surveying as follows: i. Property surveys determine boundary lines, property corners, rightsBofBway provide data necessary for the prepar ation of land subBdivisions. ii. Cadastral surveys are executed by the Federal Gover nment in connection with the disposal of vast areas of land known as the public domain. iii. Route surveys are necessary for the design and cons truction of various engineering projects such as roads, railway s, pipelines, canals and power lines. iv. Industrial surveys, or optical metrology, are used in the aircraft and other industries where very accurate dimensiona l layouts are required. v. Topographic surveys are performed to gather data ne cessary to prepare topographic maps. These are multicolor cont our maps Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 37 portraying the terrain; and rivers; highways, railw ays, bridges and other manBmade features. vi. Hydrographic surveys map the shorelines of bodies o f water; chart the bottom of streams, lakes, harbors and coa stal waters; measure the flow of rivers; and assess other factor s affecting navigation and water resources. The sounding of dep ths by radar is involved in this type of survey. vii. Mine surveys determine the position of underground works such as tunnels and shafts, the position of surface stru ctures and the surface boundaries. viii. Aerial surveys use photogrammetric to produce a mos aic of matched vertical photographs, oblique views of land scape and topographic maps drawn from the photographs. ix. Construction surveys fix elevations, horizontal pos itions and dimensions for construction projects. x. Control surveys provide basic horizontal and vertic al position data. These are called datum. For most surveying wo rk the vertical position of points in terms of height abov e a curved reference surface is mean sea level. xi. Techniques 4. TRIANGULATION 5. TRILATERATION 6. TRAVERSE 7. LEVELING 8. RADIATION 9. Triangulation a. Triangulation consists of a series of connected tri angles which adjoin or overlap each other, angles being measured from d etermined fixed stations. Triangulation reduces the number of measu res that need to be taped and for this reason is often a preferred m ethod of survey. A known baseBline measurement is required. Three exam ples of triangulation systems are shown below. b. A single chain of triangles is a rapid and economic al system for covering a narrow strip of land. A chain of quadril aterals is more accurate with checks being made by various combinat ions of angles Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 38 and sides as the survey proceeds. Larger areas use a central point arrangement. A point to note is that all angles sho uld be more than 20\u00b0. Angles less than 20\u00b0 are not considered valid for fixing position. They introduce inaccuracies. This is much the same in navigation where a fix by two bearings requires an angle of in tersection of approximately 90\u00b0, and for three bearings approxima tely 60\u00b0. Angles less than 30\u00b0 are not acceptable. 10. Trilateration Trilateration uses electronic distance measuring eq uipment to directly measure the lengths of the sides of triangles from which the angles can be calculated. It is a very useful method for rough te rrain where positions can be accurately carried forward and is seen as an alt ernative method to triangulation. 11. Traverse a. A traverse consists of a series of lines, whose len gths and directions are measured, connecting points whose positions are to be determined. The route of the traverse line can be a djusted for obstacles such as rough or timbered terrain, swampy land, buildings and areas of heavy traffic. A traverse may be eithe r open or closed as shown below. b. An open traverse begins at a point of known positio n and ends at a station whose relative position is unknown. This ty pe of traverse is frequently used for preliminary surveys for highway s. A closed traverse begins and ends at the same point whose po sition is known. An example of this type of traverse is a perimeter survey of a tract of land. 12. Leveling Leveling is the operation of determining difference s of elevation by measuring vertical distances directly on a graduate d rod with the use of a leveling instrument such as a dumpy level, transit or Theodolites. This method is called direct leveling or differential le veling. Indirect leveling can be done using the principle that differences in ele vation are proportional to the differences in atmospheric pressure. The differ ence in elevation between two points can also be determined trigonometrically using vertical angles and horizontal or inclined distances. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 39 13. Differential leveling Benchmarks are very important in leveling. They are permanent objects of known elevation located where there is least likeli hood of disturbance. They may be a metal or concrete post set close to the gr ound, a notch in a tree root or a peg or spike in a tree. 14. Radiation Radiation is a surveying technique often used in co njunction with a plane table. From a fixed position directly above the cor responding location on the ground bearings are taken to various points at the boundary of the survey area. The bearing lines are drawn on the paper on t he table. Distances to the points are measured and then converted to the requi red scale on the survey sheet. Radiation surveying can be performed in a si milar way directly on the ground taking bearings and distances from a fixed p osition and recording them for later work. Similarly plane table surveyin g may be used with other techniques such as a traverse or triangulation. *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 40 3. HOUSE NUMBERING SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL BODIES -CASE STUDY OF HYDERABAD V.R. Satish Chandra Former Director, House Numbering Cell, GHMC & B. Purushothama Reddy, Director of Town & Country Planning 1. Need for House Numbering System: House Numbering is the very basis for the location of all households and all the buildings in a given settlement whether big or small or urban or rural. It serves several purposes, official as well as nonBof ficial, requiring the location of the citizen at his household or the location of a house. It is, therefore, very essential to have a uniform and permanent Hous e Numbering System throughout the country. The advantage of having a good system of house numbering is obvious and it is in the interest of p ersons living in the houses as well as the local authorities and the Government to maintain the house numbering. The updating of the house numbering is v ery much essential in view of the purposes explained above. A good and un iform system of house numbering should be able to serve the purpose of al l. In fact at present there is anarchy in assigning the house numbers as the nu mbers are assigned by the tax officer of a Local Body whenever people com e up for payment of property tax for the first time or some times the p eople themselves assign the house numbers without any basis. 2. Efforts made for a Permanent House Num bering System in Andhra Pradesh: During 1951 Census an attempt was made to introduc e a good system of house numbering throughout the State by the former Composite Madras State Government and by the erstwhile Hyderabad Sta te Government. But the system of the house numbering then introduced w as not maintained continuously and hence, during the 1961 Census the house numbering had to be got updated. In view of the imperative need for a good house nu mbering felt by the various agencies, the Registrar General of Census, India, h as suggested to all the State Governments about the implementation of the s cheme on Permanent House Numbering on a scientific and systematic basi s. But in practice, the updating of the house numbering was not done regula rly and the periodicity of the assignment of the house numbering in the Sta te differs from settlement to settlement. 3. Types of House Numbering System: In Urban areas of Andhra Pradesh, the following th ree systems of house numbering are in vogue. i. Ward - Block - House Numbering System: In certain towns and particularly in Hyderabad Ci ty and all the towns in Telangana area the city or town is divided into wards , which are serially numbered. Each of these wards is further subdivide d into blocks and these blocks are numbered in a series in each ward. The blocks are demarcated to form compact areas with a reasonable number of houses so as to avoid the allotment of unduly large serial nu mbers to individual Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 41 houses. The houses within each such block are numbered continuously following some order either clockwise or starting f rom NorthBEast and ending towards SouthBWest and so on. The actual nu mber painted on each house consists of three elements, viz., the wa rd number, block number and the house number. Thus a house with a n umber as 16B2B 186 indicates that it is House No.186 in Block number 2 of Ward No.16. ii. Locality / Ward - Street - House Numbering System : Under this system the town is divided into Wards or wellBestablished Localities or Mohallas , which are commonly recognised and have some wellBknown locality name. Such localities are assi gned serial numbers. Within each such locality all the streets are numbered off serially. The houses in each street are then numbered by a separate ser ies. iii. Ward or Block - House Numbering System: Under this system, a town is merely divided into Wards or Blocks with some definite boundaries and then the houses in the entire ward or block numbered in one continuous series. The house numbe r under this system is a composite one made up of two elements, viz., the Ward or Block number and the House number, e.g. 6-50. 4. Efforts made for a Permanent House Numbering System in Earstwhile- MCH: a. Hyderabad is the 6 th largest city in India. The geographical area of th e ExB Municipal Corporation (MCH) is about 172 Sq.Kms. As per 2001 Census the population of Hyderabad is 36, 12, 427 and the growth rate is 21.85%. The jurisdiction of the ExBMCH is divided into two divisions as Hyderabad division and Secunderabad division for administrati ve convenience. Hyderabad division is divided into 23 wards and eac h ward is further divided into blocks. There are 164 blocks in the Hy derabad division. In Secunderabad division the area is divided into 12 w ards and 72 blocks. This three digit house numbering is in vogue since 1951 and is being applied to election work and the Census work also. b. For administrative convenience the Hyderabad divisi on with 23 wards is divided into 6 Circles and the Secunderaba d division is divided into 12 wards and having one circle. c. Under Section 418 of HMC Act 1955, the Commissioner, may from time to time, with the sanction of the Corporation, dete rmine the name by which any street shall be known, cause to put up or paint the name of the street and with the sanction of Corporation determi ne the number by which any premises shall be known and by written no tice require the owner of any premises either to put or paint or num ber on such premises or the work shall be executed under the orders of t he Commissioner duly collecting the charges from the owner. d. The Secretary, General Administration (AR & T) Depa rtment in his DO Lr. No. Nil, dt.18.7.1977 has suggested that the prevai ling house numbering consisting of three digits viz., WardBBlockBHouse N umber has to be replaced by the Locality and House Number as 20, Malakpet instead of 16-11-20 to facilitate the public. He has stated that such system is in vogue in Bangalore, Madras and desired to examine w hether the same Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 42 system could be followed. After thorough discussion s it has been decided to adopt WardBBlockBHouse numbering system. with lot of efforts, it has been decided to under t ake house-numbering system in MCH with the following objectives: i) To revise the boundaries of the existing blocks in each ward of the Municipal Corporation so that they can be compact a nd visible and , ii) To evolve a system for numbering the streets and re Bnumbering the houses with reference to the street numbers. The rules are also framed \"Hyderabad Municipal Corp oration (Naming and Numbering of Roads and Streets and Numbering of Str eets and Numbering of Houses) Rules 1995\" to govern the house numbering s ystem in MCH limits. 5. Procedure adopted in the New System of House Number ing in MCH. In the new House Numbering System the entire city i s delineated into Localities with Streets and Main Roads. 1. The entire city is thus delineated into 254 Localities and 133 Main roads. 2. The Premises are numbered in the Localities and Mai n Roads separately in a continuous series. 3. The Ward Boundaries are not disturbed while dividin g it into Localities as delineation of Ward boundaries is done based on cer tain parameters and the existing data of all municipal functions are ba sed on ward boundaries. Hence any change in ward boundaries may dislocate t he entire administration. 6. Delineation of Localities Localities are delineated in each Ward, with the fo llowing parameters: Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 43 a. The Locality is viable in terms of area and populat ion and has distinct boundaries. b. The name of the area is prominent with reference to Name of the Colony, Revenue Village, Post Office, MCH Council ward etc. c. The Area is delineated with reference to Ward bound ary, Broad Network of roads, Physical Boundaries like Watercourses, Dr ains, and Railway Lines etc. d. While delineating the areas smaller localities, col onies, slums that are locally known with reference to prominent locality name are included and comprehensive area is delineated. e. Each Locality is given a Code number. 7. Delineation of Main Roads: Certain areas are known with reference to roads, Ar eas, which abut main roads, are delineated and given separate number. T hus these areas may form part of two or more localities, since there ar e different localities on either side of the main roads. The Main Roads have unique code for easy identifica tion and for further applications if any. 1. Assignment of House Numbers: a. Each premises is assigned with one number. b. Vacant sites are also assigned with numbers. Depen ding upon the size of the vacant site or land the numbers are reserved an d the series is continued. c. Each Apartment / Commercial Complex is assigned, wi th one general number. Each Flat / Shop / Unit is assigned with byBnumbers. d. Slums which would normally have number of temporary and small structures, prone for changes in their size and pat tern are given one, two or block wise numbers for easy location of the hous es or depending on the structural conditions, each premises is numbered fo r easy identification of the premises. e. Normally numbering in a locality starts from the co rner nearer to the City center. f. The street, which is nearer to the City Centre , will be numbered as street number one. Any number in a locality can be located even without a street number, since the premises are numbered in a single continuous series. g. Similarly numbering on a Main Roads will be done fr om one end of the road to the other end and continue the series on th e other side till the starting end. A locality may abut main road / road s where there will be separate series of numbers. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 44 9. Preparation of Correlation Statements & Localit y Maps: a. The correlation statements showing the old and new house numbers, name of the owner, no. of floors, usage of the buil ding etc is to be prepared by conducting house to house survey. b. Based on the field survey Locality Maps are prepare d duly showing the old and new numbers, streets, main roads, premises numb ers, street wise house numbering statement etc. Brochures to be prin ted for each locality map which will be handy for using the same. c. Statement showing the correlation statement of the old & new house numbers Table 1 10. Installation of Signboards and Number Plates: After preparation of the House Numbering Maps, for the convenience of the public and for identification of houses, signboards and number plates are to be erected as follows Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 45 a. Street signboards Showing the street No. House Nos. falling in the st reet and Locality Name are installed at entrance and end of the streets. b. Main Road Sign Boards showing the main road and house numbers to be erected at the starting point, mid point and at the end point. c. House number plates: Square shapes for the houses abutting to Main Roads and Round Shape for houses abutting to Street s are to be fixed. d. Each Locality is assigned a Specific Colour: The street signboard, Main Road Board, house number plates will have the same colour as base and the letters are in white colour. e. Locality Maps to be erected in 3 or 5 prominent localities in the locality. f. Pamphlets showing the locality maps with Main road No., street No. Old and New house nos. will be prepared for public circulation. g. The Correlation statements showing old and new house numbers will be circulated to all the needy departments. 9. Uniqueness of the new house numbering system of MCH : The New House Numbering System is unique and very s imple & convenient not only for the people but also for various admini strative and statutory purposes such as Elections, Census, Posts & Telepho nes, Police, Registration etc. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 46 10. New Address of a Household: Ex: a. If abutting to a Main Road: Mr.xxx 45, Tank Bund - Assembly Road, HYDERABAD. PIN: b. If abutting to a Street in a Locality. Mr.abc, Street No.3, H.No.125/5, ABIDS, HYDERABAD. PIN: 11. Unique Code: A Unique 14 - digit code can be generated from the New House Numbering System which can be used for variou s administrative purposes including designing GIS for the City. Ex: 1. For identifying a premises (house) / unit in the city 12. For identifying some of the other utility codes usi ng the codes of Localities, Main Roads, Premises Number and Unit Nu mber: Item Code MCH Ward Code 01...35 Locality Code 001 B 254 Main Road Code Ring 101...109 001...099 Premises Number 0001...9999 Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 47 Item Code Unit Number 0001...9999 Usage of the Building U01...U20 Tax Zone Code T001...T999 Trade Code TR01...TR25 Slum Code S001...S999 Street Light Code SL001...SL999 Dust Bin Code B001...B999 Water Supply Connection Code W01...W99 Electricity Connection Code EC01...EC99 Drainage Connection Code D01...D99 13. By following the above codes the following utilitie s will be easily located spatially and it will be convenient for the concern ed departments to easily monitor and manage the system.

PREPARATION OF GENERAL TOWN PLANNING SCHEME AND DETAILED TOWN PLANNING SCHEME UNDER A.P.T.P ACT 192 0 A. Sri Rami Reddy Former Director Town & Country Planning, Hyderabad 1. Introduction: i. A Master plan or a Development plan or G.T.P scheme may be defined as a general plan for the future layout of a city showin g both, the existing and proposed streets or roads, open spaces, public buil dings, residential, commercial areas etc. Thus the G.T.P scheme aims at controlling the future growth of a Town or urban area along pre con ceived and predetermined paths. Generally the perspective peri od for the G.T.P scheme or Master plan is two decades in order to me et the future requirements considering its role, the potential an d problems. ii. In India, the idea of preparation of development pla n is understood to have been flourished after 1915 when the Bombay Town Pla nning Act was passed and was soon followed by the Madras Town Pla nning Act in 1920. The first comprehensive Act requiring the preparati on of development plans and authorizing its enforcement is the Bombay Town and Country Planning Act, 1954 which actually came into force i n 1957. This Act required the preparation of development plans by th e concerned local bodies within a specific period. iii. A G.T.P scheme or Master is an ideal plan showing t he full development of a Town or urban area at some future date. At the sa me time it should be sufficiently elastic. It is therefore, not a fixed plan, but it is possible to amend it from time to time to keep it in pace with any to accommodate the new Development of any revised estimate of the futu re growth and requirements of the Town. iv. A Detailed Town planning scheme is covered by a par t of the Town or a part of General Town planning scheme. The GTP schem e covers all the Land uses with proper infrastructure are achieved t hrough the proper implementation of schemes. 2. Objects of G.T.P Scheme Following are the main objects of preparing a Maste r plan for the town: i. It aims at intelligent and economic spending of the public funds for achieving welfare of the inhabitants in respect of amenity, convenience and health. ii. It arranges the pattern of a town in such way so as to satisfy the present requirements by the coming generation. iii. It helps in restricting the haphazard and unplanned growth iv. It places various functions which a town has to per form in physical relationship of each other so as to avoid the chanc es of mutual conflict v. It removes the defects of uncoordinated physical gr owth of the various components of town due to the fact that it consider s the entire city area or town as planning and development entity.

MASTER PLAN AND ZONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN PREPARED UNDER AP URBAN AREAS (DEVELOPMENT) ACT, 1975 V. Venugopal Reddy, Former Director (Planning), Hyderabad Metropoliton Development Authority 1. Introduction a. A development plan or a master plan may be defined as a general plan for the future layout of a city showing both the existi ng and proposed streets or roads, open spaces, public buildings, etc. A dev elopment plan is prepared either for improvement of an old city or f or a new town to be developed on virgin soil. Thus, a development plan aims at controlling the future growth or a town along preconceived and pred etermined paths. b. The concept of development plan was taken up to pro vide an instrument for preparing a framework incorporating various tow n improvement schemes and programmes.

NEED FOR REGIONAL PLANNING & DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT PLANNING P. Thimma Reddy Addl. Chief City Planner, Greater Hyderabad Municip al Corporation 1. Concept and Meaning of Region A 'region' in planning terms can be administrative or at leas t partially functional, and is likely to include a network of s ettlements and character areas. RegionBarea larger than the community three locality groups a. Neighbourhood: A group of people experiencing social interaction w ith in a localized area with one or two social institutions as the local po int or means by which the area can be identified physically is thus a nei ghborhood. b. Community is the first social group in modern life that appr oaches self sufficiency (a group is self sufficient when it pos sess most of the (important) major social institutions. c. Region Delineation i. To divide the space into relatively homogeneous uni ts ii. To further our analysis and understanding of specif ic studies 2. Purpose of the Region Delineation: a. Delineation of the space into homogenous units b. To study the human association with in a specific r egional environment c. To facilitate comparison 3. Definition of region is limited by the purpose a. A large tract of land; a country; a more or less de fined portion of earth's surface, as distinguished by certain natural featur es, climatic conditions, a special fauna and flora or the like b. An area, space, or place of more or less definite e xtent or character. c. Any portion of space considered as possessing certa in characteristicsBMill d. An area of earth's surface differentiated (from adj oining areas) by one or more features or characteristics which give it a me asure of unity, According to the criteria employed in differentiati ng regions are termed as physiographic regions, political regions and econom ic regions. e. An area homogenous with respect to certain announce d criteriaBJames f. Any portion of earth's surface where physical condi tions are homogeneous can be considered to be a region in the geographic senseBJoerg g. A region is a complex of land, water, air, plant, a nimal and human beings, having spatial relationship, which constitute a def inite portion of earth's surfaceBHerberor h. An area with in which historical and environmental factors have combined to create relatively homogeneous social structure a nd a conciseness of individually 4. Types / Classification of regions a. By using indicators Single factor regions e.g. Physiographic, Agricult ure, Economics Composite regions e.g. backward regions b. Based on relationship i. Macro e.g. India ii. Meso e.g. South India Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 76 iii. Micro e.g. Tamilnadu c. Based on administrative convenience Region makin g forces i. Geographic and physiography ii. History iii. Culture 5. Principles Specific interventions and solutions will depend en tirely on the needs of each region in each country, but generally speaking, reg ional planning at the macro level will seek to: a. Resist development in flood plains or along earthqu ake faults. These areas may be utilised as parks, or unimproved farml and. b. Designate transportation corridors using hubs and s pokes and considering major new infrastructure c. Some thought into the various 'role's settlements i n the region may play, for example some may be administrative, with others based upon manufacturing or transport. d. Consider designating essential nuisance land uses l ocations, including waste disposal. e. Designate Green belt land or similar to resist sett lement amalgamation and protect the environment. f. Set regional level 'policy' and zoning which encour ages a mix of housing values and communities. g. Consider building codes, zoning laws and policies t hat encourage the best use of the land. 7. Regional Planning Regional planning & development deals with designin g, placing infrastructure & other elements across a large area /region. Regional planning zones encompass several towns, cities or e ven parts of different states. Each planning zones could have their own pl anning offices in realm of \"Urban Planning\". The concept is encapsulated in sp atial planning using a Eurocentric definition. Regional planning is antici pating the needs of a community or group of communities before those need s arise. A planning region is (or should be) large enough: a. To enable substantial changes in the distribution o f population & employment to take place within its boundaries. b. But small enough for its planning problems to be ta ckled effectively. c. It should have a viable resource base, a manpower b ase, and internal homogeneity/cohesiveness. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 77 8. Need For Regional Planning a. The area outside the proposed urbanisable limits of towns and cities were not really seen as problem area in the past bu t economic growth and migration fuelled Urbanisation. b. Mega and metropolitan cities expand; the planning e xercise has to increase its scope to the city's region encompassin g the surrounding hinterland by developing satellite towns. c. Unplanned development of urban fringes and out grow ths. d. Unplanned development of fringe areas leads to the lack of public facilitiesB public open spaces, health centers and schools & degradation of environment as the required sanitary and water d isposal services are not provided. 9. Regional Vs. Master Plan 10. Types of Regions Regional planners predict how & where the populatio n of a region is going to grow over the next decade & recommend building of r oads & other infrastructure to support that growth before it happens. 11. Regional Planning Process a. Regional Planners work with the local governments, within their regional planning zone to discuss such issues as regional la nd use community & Economic development, longBrange & environmental pl anning, along with Housing Types of Regions: /square4 Metropolitan Regions /square4 Urban/Congested Regions /square4 Climatic Regions Backward Regions /square4 Resource Regions /square4 Mineral Regions /square4 Manufacturing Regions /square4 River Valley Region (DVC ) Regions in Multi-level planning: /square4 National level /square4 level /square4 Rayalaseema Region Telangana Region level and /square4 Micro level. Regional Plan: /square4 Analysis of overall settlement hierarchy & allocation of economic activities as per the potential of the settlements /square4 Analysis of different order to settlements to achieve balanced development of the region, /square4 Efficient placement of land use, infrastructure and settlements for expected growth. Master Plan: /square4 Analysis of availability of existing physical and social infrastructure facilities /square4 Analysis of holding capacity of city as whole duly taking into future urbanizable area. /square4 Policies for densification, reB densification , renewal/redevelopment and /square4 Issues like disaster management, environment management, heritage conservation Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 78 b. Regional planning often walks a fine line between s erving the needs of the community, protecting the environment and taking in to account the rights of individual land owners & community members at re gional scale. c. Regional planners depending on circumstances may se rve exclusively as an advisory board, as a research arm of the member cities, or as a governmental entity that approves Building permits or neighborhood plans in the region or in unincorporated areas of t he region. 12. Regional Planning Examples a. In the past many regional plans like Dandkarnaya re gion, Damodar Valley region, South East Resource region, Singrauli regio n, Western Ghats region, Chandigarh inter state region were formulat ed but not really implemented on account of absence of enabling legis lation. b. Perhaps, the only successful examples of regional p lanning efforts in India among others the National Capital Regional Plan, Mu mbai Metropolitan Region Plan, Bangalore Metropolitan Region Plan, Hy derabad Metropolitan Plan and Delhi Metropolitan Area Plan. 13. Conclusion a. Regional planning is the science of efficient place ment of infrastructure and zoning for the sustainable growth of a region. b. Advocates for regional planning such as new Urbanis t Peter Cal Thorpe, promote the approach because it can address regionB wide environmental, social, and economic issues which may necessarily r equire a regional focus. c. In most European countries, regional and national p lans are 'spatial' directing certain levels of development to specific cities and towns in order to support and manage the region depending on speci fic needs, for example supporting or resisting, Polycentrism. 'State of the World's Cities 2010-2011'- UN-HABITAT a. MegaBregions are becoming the new engines of global and regional economies; Urban sprawl is becoming a global trend that widens the urban divide; Many cities in the world are faced with accommodati ng an increasing number of displaced people; b. By2050 more than 50% of the populations is urbanize d occupying 5% of the Land Area DISTRICT PLANNING - NECESSITY & BACKGROUND 1. Definition: District Plan in in short it is a Regional Plan at Micro Level. An integrated plan for the local government sector in a district covering the sectoral activities and schemes assigned at district level & below, ov er laid on spatial plans which are implemented through local governments. 2. Necessity: District is the most suitable administrative unit for decentralized planning as it possesses the required heterogeneity . It is small enough to include people into planning process, implementation and to improve productivity. District planning is an im portant tool to direct investments in districts and areas which lag behind in develop ment. 3. Background: With the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments, decentralization of planning is emphasized and meth odology changed. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 79 4. Critique: In most States, DPCs are yet to function as envisag ed in the Constitution. They neither consolidate nor prepare draft district developmental plans and do not prepare spatial plans which are important for taking \" locational decisions \". 5. Preparation of District Plan a. District Planning committee is created as per artic le 243 ZD of the constitution of India for planning at the district and below . b. Planning starts with the preparation of vision documents by district planning committee (DPC). c. The committee consolidates the plans prepared by the Panchayats & the Municipalities in the district & prepares a draft development pla n for the district. d. The sequence in the preparation of district plan ca n be as follows: e. Preparation of District Vision, Block Vision & Gram Panchayat level vision. i. Preparation of participatory plan involving Gram Panchayats to Zilla Parishad . ii. Preparation of plans by Urban Local Bodies . iii. Consolidation of plans prepared by Local Bodies by Dist. Plng. Committees. 6. Structure of DPC 7. District Visioning District vision document will cover the following /square4 Agriculture and allied sectors. /square4 Availability and development of water sources. /square4 Industries - especially traditional , small industries including food processing. /square4 Infrastructure including power . /square4 Drinking water and sanitation. /square4 Literacy , school education. /square4 Health and medical facilities. /square4 Poverty reduction and basic needs . /square4 Gender and children. /square4 Social justice - SC / ST, Persons with disability etc. /square4 A vision document is for 10 to 15 years is to be prepared by the district and for each local government based on a participatory assessment . /square4 The DPC may hold formal interactions with local governments and other key stakeholders on this and then finalize it. /square4 The document should clearly identify the key reasons for backwardness / development shortcomings and address issues impeding development . Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 80 8. Mandal Vision a. The vision document for each mandal need not be completely different because the agro-ecological conditions of some planning units at this level may be same, particularly when a district is divided into a large number of Inter Mediate Panchayats as in the case of Andhra Pradesh . b. Even though the same vision is adopted for some blo cks / mandals, it is necessary to have the vision owned by the Intermediate Panchayat . i. This exercise will be done by a team of experts at block level. ii. The same team will be responsible for plans at the GP level. iii. However, the team will take some members like professionals or retired persons belonging to the area to assist the team in the preparation of the plan. iv. The general formats for planning at the lowest unit level viz., GP or ULB will be prepared at the district level and they will be adopted with certain modifications at the block level. v. Vision of the Gram Panchayat will also be prepared accordingly. The vision of the GP will be based on the Socio-economic Profile of the GP and views of the GP . 9. Plan for Grama Panchayat / Municipality a. At the third stage, the plan at the GP or ULB will be prepared. This will be prepared by the team with the help of people's participation . b. The team will first interact with the GP and prepar e a vision on the lines of the district vision . c. Once the Gram Panchayat vision is approved, the tea m will conduct several Group Discussions to find out the potentials , needs and constraints of the village economy in Gram Sabha. d. The felt needs of these communities and the support needed for improving their livelihood conditions will be elicited. Once this exercise is completed, it will be discussed in the Gram Sabh a. e. This approach will help to study the situation thoroughly and prepare the plan. In particular, all the schemes CSS State sponsored schemes will be examined thoroughly with a view to understa nd their suitability to the area. 10. Plan for Mandal Panchayats a. The above three steps followed the top down approach in the preparation of the district plan. After this GP Plan is prepare d and no plan is ready at higher levels except the vision. b. The Plans at the higher levels will be prepared in the next steps. In this step, the GP plans will be consolidated and put before the IP. c. In the GP plans, the benefits of some of the scheme s will go beyond the GP and such schemes may figure in the other GP plans a lso. d. Hence, they have to be separated and duplication has to be avoided. Similarly, some schemes which provide benefits beyond the GP level may not be identified in any GP. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 81 e. The Mandal Plan has to identify those schemes / projects . This exercise will be done at the meetings of the Intermediate Panchayat level. 11. District Plan a. The final stage is the preparation of the District plan. b. This will be finalized after the Mandal Plans are finalized in the same way as the Block Plan is finalized on the basis of the GP Plans in the Block. c. The schemes that will not figure in the Block Plans , but are essential for the development of the district will be identified at this stage. d. Further, an attempt will have to be made to achieve functional and spatial integration and use the norms for the provision of social infrastructure. e. The above five steps will help in the preparation o f the perspective plan . f. To work out the annual plans, the financial resources available have to be taken into account. g. The local government component of the District Plan would emerge out of the resource envelope containing the following sour ces of funds: i. Own resources available for development. ii. Transfers by State Finance Commission for developme nt purposes. iii. Finance Commission grants passed on by the State Governmen t. iv. Untied grants for local planning. v. Grants in respect of Centrally Sponsored Schemes etc. 12. Integration of Entire Local Plans a. In realizing district vision, district plans will n eed to be put together from all sources including, CSSs, special programmes such as Employment Guarantee, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, Rural Health Mission, GrantsBinBaid for specific purposes from F inance Commission, Bharat Nirman etc. b. Therefore consolidation is a task that goes much be yond compilation and connotes a degree of value addition through int egration of local plans. 13. Spatial integration This would mean integration of schemes such as roads that run through one or more Panchayats. Such kinds of Multi Panchay at infrastructure projects could be taken up with proportionate contr ibutions from the Panchayats concerned dovetailed into the funding av ailable from above and entrusted to one local government for execution. 14. Sectoral integration This relates to the integration that takes place wi thin a sector. For instance, an integrated approach to agricultural development would require the integration of several schemes relating to agricult ure, such as horticulture , drip irrigation , high yielding varieties and integrated pest management . 15. Conclusion a. In short, the district planning starts with a vision and end up in an integrated plan for the district. b. Preparation of a district vision is the first signi ficant event in district planning. On the basis of district vision document, a plan will be prepared at the Gram Sabha level. The Gram Panchayat may finalize its plan bas ed on priorities emerging from the Gram Sabha and earmarking sugges tions for the Intermediate Panchayat. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 82 c. Projects and activities which can be implemented at the Gram Panchayat level should be included as \" Gram Panchayat Plan \". d. Those projects and activities which can be implemen ted only in more than one Gram Panchayat, will be forwarded to the Interm ediate Panchayats to be considered for inclusion into the \" Intermediate Panchayat Plan \". e. Based on the Gram Panchayat Plans, the intermediate Panchayat Plans and District Panchayat Plans, the District Planning Committee shall finalize the District Plan for the District and wil l form part of the State plan . * * * Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 83 6. RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLANS K.Anand Babu Addl. Director of Town & Country Planning Pradeep B Kumar Town Planning Assistant , O/o DT&CP 1. Definitions a. A resource development plan is simply a written plan to guide a nonprofit organization's immediate fundraising and longerBter m resource development efforts. The purpose of a resource deve lopment plan is to ensure that the fundraising activities are carried out effectively, with all necessary tasks completed in time to contribute to the overall effort and allow the organization to meet its fundraising obje ctives and make the organization sustainable in the long term. b. Resource development planning has two main phases: gathering information and creating the plan. 2. Contents of a Resource Development Plan A resource development plan can take many different forms. The only requirement is that it be complete and clear. Usual ly, it is helpful to start out with a oneByear plan, although one may also want so me longerBterm objectives. 3. What Goes into a Resource Development Plan? A Resource Development Plan should be practical and easy to use. It should include the following kinds of information. a. Total funding needs for the year as well as needs by project or component b. Specific objectives i. Types of funders ii. Resource development capacity within the organizati on c.

TRANSPORTATION PLANNING - REGIONAL CONTEXT A. Sri Rami Reddy Former Director Town & Country Planning, Hyderabad 1. Introduction The traffic and transportation planning is concerne d with the preparation of traffic and transportation plans to ensure a safe, orderly and fully integrated transportation system. This phase of activity conce rns itself with the relation of land use with transportation and study of travel characteristics .On the analysis of the results of such a study mathematica l models are formulated to predict how a system will behave under a given s et of conditions, alternative solutions for the development of the st reet system are then thought out and are evaluated for their comparative merits and demerits. The optimal solution is then selected and implement ed. 2. Role of Transportation in Regional Context Transportation contributes to the economic, industr ial, social and cultural development of any country. Transportation is vital for the economic development of any region since every commodity pro duced whether it is Food, clothing, industrial products or medicine nee ds transport and production and distribution stages. 3. Economic Activity and Transport The economic activities are the processes by means of which the products are utilized to satisfy human wants. Two important factors well known in economic activity are: i. Production or supply and ii. Consumption for human wants or demand. 4. Social Effects of Transportation Progress follows the lines of transportation. Popul ation always settled along the river shores, road sides and near the railway s tations. In the present concept of transportation network, this kind of rib bon development is greatly discouraged. Attempts are being made to decentraliz e the population centers away from the sides of the main transportation rout es. Thus town planning patterns are rapidly changing .to avoid congestion around the populated areas suburban living and industrial enterprises ar e developing. These suburbs and satellite towns, acting as counterBmagn ets should be linked up with transit systems. The various social effects of transportation may be further elaborated as follows: a. Sectionalism and Transportation: Improved transportation has important implication i n reducing sectionalism within the country and also outside the country. Un der -developed colonies and tribes are improving their living condition sin ce the distances have been reduced with short time of travel. More frequent tr avels in other parts of the country and outside the country tend to increase kn owledge of other sections of the community. The international understanding f or the better peace and order also improves with efficient network of trans portation. b. Concentration of Population into Urban Area : The improved transportation network brings prosperi ty to the urban population. The prosperity and employment opportuni ties of urban areas Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 86 attract the population from other areas resulting i n enhanced economic activities. Adequate mass transportation facilities are needed to cater for the internal movements in urban area such as daily move ments to factories, offices, schools, hospitals and other social needs. Efficient rapid transit facilities are necessary for subBurban and interBci ty long distance travel for business needs, social visits and tourist activitie s. This also encourages the people to live in places away from their work cente rs, thus helping to decrease the growth of slums in urban areas. In gen eral the transportation facilities are essential for the well being of the community. c. Aspect Of Safety, Law and Order : For rushing aids to effected area, transport is a m ust. To maintain law and order at home, it is required to have an efficient system of transport network. To defend the territory of the country against the external aggression and to guard the borders with foreign territories, transpo rt facilities are needed to reach the farthest distances from the head quarters or capitals. This alone may be a sufficient reason to develop a transport n etwork which may not involve any economic and social benefit directly. 5. The Elements of Regional Transport & Planning a. Regional transport planning involves development of transport system in such a way that it provides easy access to the faci lities/activities within the region. Transport infrastructure should offer e conomical, efficient, comfortable and attractive mode of transport. Such a System should satisfy the need of the region in the context of na tional, regional and local transportation. b. The elements of regional transport Planning incl udes: i. Road transportation ii. Railway transportation iii. Water transportation iv. Air transportation v. Pipeline/tube transportation 6. Road Transportation The classification of rural roads (non urban) in In dia is based on I.R.C. The classes are a. Express way b. National Highway c. State Highway d. District Roads e. Major District road f. Minor District road g. Village Roads a. The Kanpur road development plan (1981B2001) of Ind ia has introduced the concept of primary, secondary and tertiary syst em of roads. Primary system comprises of Expressways and National Highwa ys, the Secondary system consists of State Highways and Major Distric ts Roads; other Districts Roads and the village roads together form the tertiary road systems. b. While major roads - Expressways, National Highways, State Highways and Major District Roads connect different cities acros s the length and breadth of the country, Other District Roads and the villag e roads play an Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 87 important role in gearing up backward areas and the accelerating their socio economic development by connecting them with the major roads. The rural roads are understandably of a lower order , yet, are necessary for the development of villages providing the basic and in most cases providing accessibility. 7. Functions of Traffic Engineering: 8. Collection, analysis and interpretation of data p ertaining traffic. The traffic engineering is to organize and impleme nt various surveys and studies aimed at collection of data pertaining to t raffic characteristics. The studies include a. Origin and destination survey b. Volume counts c. Speed, travel time and delay measurements d. Accidents Statistics e. Parking characteristics f. Pedestrian behavior and use of streets g. Capacity studies h. Economics loss caused by inferior traffic facilitie s 9. Traffic Design This part relates with geometric design of Highways and streets, intersection design, schemes for grade separated interchanges, d esign of streets and on street parking facilities and design of terminal fa cilities for trucks and buses. 10. Measures for Operation of Traffic For efficient and safe operation of traffic the fo llowing measures such as: a. Legislation and enforcement measures for regulating the driver vehicle and road users like the pedestrians, cyclists and m otor cyclists. b. Management measures such as one way streets prohibi ted turnings at junctions and tidal flow arrangements exclusive bus lanes etc. with a view to get the maximum use out of the available st reet facilities. c. Measures for regulation of parking of vehicles. d. Traffic control devices such as traffic signs, traf fic signals, pavement markings and channelization techniques to guide and secure the safe and efficient flow of traffic. 11. Administration: Traffic Engineer is to organize and administer the various Programs intended to secure safe and efficient traffic in Towns and c ities and also associated with the legal and administrative frame work of the city department dealing with educational, legislation &enforcement measures . 12. Geometric Design: Is an aspect of road design dealing with the visibl e dimensions of a road way. The safe, efficient and economic operation of a roa d is governed to a large extent by the care with which the geometric design has been worked out. Efficient and comfortable operation of traffic is p ossible one if the design elements have been meticulously considered. A well designed road has to be consistent with economy. The design elements are ho rizontal and vertical alignment, sight distances, cross section component s, lateral clearances, intersection treatment, control of access etc Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 88 13 . Points are to be considered for Geometric Design While designing the road some points are to be cons idered while selecting design standards. a. The volume and composition of traffic in the design Right of way should be the basis of design b. Faulty geometries are costly to rectify at later da te and so due consideration should be given to geometric design a t the initial stage itself. c. Design should be consistent and the standards propo sed for the different elements should be compatible with one another. d. The design includes geometrics of the road signs, m arkings, lighting, intersection access control etc. e. The way should be considered as an element of the t otal environment and its location and design are to be part and parc el of environment and also to control pollution. 14.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS K.V. Subba Reddy Former Joint Director of Town & Country Planning 1. Introduction: a. Constitution is the supreme law of the Country. The present constitution of India has come into effect from 26.1.1950. The c onstitution established a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democr atic, Republic of India. It established the parliamentary form of Government and provided fundamental rights to the people. A federation with strong centralizing tendency, Independent Judiciary, Secular State, Sin gle Citizenship and fundamental duties for citizens, are high lights of constitution. Any Act, rules & regulations made by the government should n ot infringe rights envisaged in the constitution. There are three important branches of Government vi z., i. The Legislation. ii. Judiciary and iii. Execution. b. The Parliament has legislative powers, Supreme Cour t has judicial powers and the Administrators have executive powers . The administrative authorities are empowered to take pr eventive steps, such as Law and Order, Licencing, rate fixing etc,. Thes e preventive measures save the people from unnecessary harassment and lit igation. \"Welfare of the people is the philosophy of our Constitution be sides law and Order\". Taking this inspiration, the Parliament and State L egislature have enacted several Acts. c. If any legislation is made beyond the scope of the authority conferred by the statute or if it is conflict with the delegatin g statute or if it is against the procedural aspects, it will be held as \"UltraBV irus\" by the courts. The courts can declare, squash or setBaside any legisla tion, when it is found to be unBconstitutional, in consistence, unBreasona ble, malafied exclusion of judicial review or retrospective effec t. If any procedures prescribed in the Act, such as publication of draft rules, laying on the table of the legislature, consultation with public etc., are not followed while formulating the rules and regulations under t he Acts, they will be held ultraBvirus by the courts. Therefore due care should be taken while formulating rules and regulations by the executives . 2. Functions and Powers of Executive: a. The Parliamentary functions of executives are execu tion of laws evolving and implementing the Government policies, providing public health, safety and morality standards of life in the nation. For t he performance of these vast and large functions and for the best administr ation, and to obtain required goals, they need powers. Such powers are d elegated by legislature to Administrators. It has also become n ecessary team power them with discretionary powers for the speedy and e fficient administration. These vast discretionary powers whi ch are vested with executive should be used for public welfare and sho uld not be used for selfish needs. It is a general rule the court shoul d not interfere with administrative functions and Actions taken by admin istrative Authorities Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 94 in exercise of discretionary powers. But too much o f discretionary power causes abuse of powers. Therefore judicial review o ver wide and arbitrary, discretionary powers and Actions is felt necessary to keep administrative officials within their boundaries. The judicial rev iew will be on; i. Failure to exercise discretion. ii. Excess or abuse of discretion. iii. Violation of fundamental rights. There are 4 kinds of judicial remedies, such as; i. Prerogative remedies i.e. writs. ii. Statutory remedies i.e. Civil Suits, appeals. iii. Equitable remedies i.e. declaration, injunctions et c., and iv. Common law remedies i.e. Tortuous liability of Gove rnment, Contractual liability of Government. b. Therefore, the administrators should be wellBversed with the Acts, rules and regulations and the procedures in implementing the laws and also in suing their discretionary powers since any Action t aken against the law will invite interference by judiciary. c. The principles of \"Natural justice\" should not viol ate while implementing the Acts, rules and regulations by the executives. The principles of Natural justice are i. Notice i.e., 1 st stage of fairness and ii. Hearing which is 2 nd stage of fairness. 3. Acts, Rules & Regulations: a. The Parliament and state legislature make various A cts within the preview of the constitution of India to ensure adeq uate social and economic living conditions for the people of the so ciety. The Acts may relate to law and other, prevention of abuse of pow ers, licencing, taxation and registration of properties, Municipal Administr ation and Town Planning etc., The Acts are prepared by the adminis trations taking into consideration of various needs for socioBeconomic d evelopment of the people and after obtaining cabinet approval they wi ll be placed before the legislature (State Assembly or Parliament) for enac tment. b. The rules are made for implementation of the Acts, enumerating the procedures, executive powers and requirements. Thes e rules are made by the concerned departments in consultation with law department and approved by the cabinet. The rules made by the Gove rnment should be placed on the table of the legislation in its next session. c. The regulations are made by the Government for issu ing licences and permission or control of development or taxation et c,. The regulations should be made as per the provisions of the Act and rules and should be duly notified for public comments before issue of f inal orders. d. The ByeBlaws are made by the local bodies within th e preview of the Act and rules for rendering services viz,. licences for water supply connections, sewerage connections etc. Ex:B ByeBlaw s relating to appointment of Standing Consents, Licenced Surveyor s and plumbers etc,. 4.

APTP ACT 1920 is An Act exclusively dealing with To wn Planning in A.P, upto 1975. In 1975, APUA (Dev.) Act 1975, was enact ed for constitution of Urban Development Authorities in A.P. The Act, 1 920 envisages preparation of Master Plans for all the local bodie s within 4 years form their constitution as Municipalities. The DT&CP, is appointed by the Government, under this Act. Since the local bodies do not have technical expertise and manpower for preparation of M.Ps. (Ge neral Town Planning Schemes) DT&CP has taken up the responsibility of p reparation or M.P. under this Act. b. The Master Plan consists of land uses i.e Residenti al, Commercial, Industrial, Public and SemiBpublic roads etc., and they are prepared in scientific manner taking into consideration of soci oBeconomic development of the settlement. Procedures followed for preparation of Master Plans : a. The Base map of the Town and vicinity area is prepa red by conducting physical survey or using the areal photography/Sate llite imageries. b. The existing land use structural conditions, detail s of public and semiB public building etc., are marked in the plans by co nducting survey. c. Demographic, SocioBeconomic, infrastructure data wi ll be collected from primary and secondary sources. d. The data will be analyzed and necessary projections and requirements for future planning period of 20 years are made to provide facilities, infrastructure for the plan period. e. The proposed land use plan and report are prepared and submitted to Government for formal approval of the proposals. f. The draft Master Plan proposals are sent to Municip al Council for notification calling for objections and suggestions from the public. g. The objections and suggestions received from public are enumerated and examined and necessary changes. If required, wi ll be carried out in the proposals. The final proposals are adopted Muni cipal Council will be submitted to the Government for final sanction. h. Sanction of Master plan will be notified for the in formation of the public in A.P Gazette and news papers. The Master plan consisting of zoning regulations, w hich prescribe the minimum requirements for the construction of buildi ng development of lands. It should be implemented by the executive Au thorities from the date of sanction of Master plan. 8. Master Plan Zoning Regulations: a. The Zoning Regulations are issued along with the Ma ster Plan (General Town Planning Schemes) sanctioned by the government as per the APTP Act 1920. b. The Zoning Regulations are intended to control the bulk of building, use of building and provision of parking space etc., wh ich are not mandatory under building rules and layout conditions. i.e, so me of the provisions missing in building rules and Layout rules are inco rporated in Zoning Regulations. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 99 c. The Zoning Regulation consists of the Regulation fo r land use control as per Master Plan (General Town Planning Schemes) and Regulations for building control. d. Land-Use-Control: 1 Residential Use a) Low density b) Medium density c) High density d) Intensive density 2 Commercial Use a) Local Commercial b) General Commercial c) General Commercial 3 Industrial Use a) Light Industrial b) Heavy Industrial c) Special Industrial 4 Public and Semi-Public use zone B 5 Agricultural Use Zone Apart from this three is circulation pattern i.e, hierarchy of roads which consists of widening of the existing roads and new road which should be taken into consideration while allowing the developments. Presently, the land use classification is done in a simpler format; i.e. Residential, Commercial, Industrial etc without fur ther sub- classification. e. Zoning Regulation - 2: The definitions and general information given in this regulation are very important and should be no ted carefully. f. Zoning Regulation - 3: Uses permissible in various land use zones are given. In each landuse zone the uses permitted are divided into three parts.They areB In Part 1 : Uses permissible by local authority are given. In Part 2 : Uses permissible on appeal to the competent authority i.e, DT&CP / UDA are given. In Part 3 : The uses prohibited are given. g. Zoning Regulation - 3 (a): Provides Special Regulations for detached and Semi Detached building which consists of plot size, frontage of plots, no. of floors, plot coverage, setBback lines. h. Zoning Regulation - 3 (b): Provides special regulations from tenamental and storied flats i.e., plot size, no. of floors, m aximum floor coverage (FAR, FSI) lifts, parking and garbage. i. Similarly special regulations are provided from lig ht industry, Heavy industry, Special industry, public and semiBpublic uses. j. The Annexure give the list of services industries, light industries, heavy industries, Special industries, Noxious industries and also the list of industries exempted for taking permission. Only the industries listed in the annexure are allowable in the light, heavy, spe cial industries use zones in usual courses. k. The roads proposed in the Master Plan should be ver ified correctly and the site effected for road widening and new roads shoul d be taken over through registered gift deeds before releasing buil ding permissions. No construction should be allowed in the road widening portions. 9. A.P.

FIRE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS 1. INTRODUCTION: a. Precautions from fire is more safe, easy and econom ical than fighting the fire. Whether it is in a forest or in a settlement, fire is always destructive and danger to life, property, environment etc. The occurrence of fire is an irreversible chemical process. The occurrence of fi re in buildings is not only dangerous to human lives but also to property. Irrespective of the use of the building and size of the structure the n ecessary precautions have to be taken to save the life and valuable prop erty from the fire accident. In case of residential buildings it is mo re important to take all necessary steps not only to prevent fire but also t o combat the fire if it occurs, because the residential buildings are alway s with people living in it. b. Not only the use of the building but the height of the building has got a major role in combating the fire. More the height o f the building, it is more difficult to fight the fire and causes more th reat to the lives of the inmates of the building and also to the property. c. There is a need to have proper blend of inbuilt Fir e Safety measures in view of difficulties in extinguishing Fires from ou tside. If proper Means of Escape are not provided, Smoke and Poisonous Gases from Fire may cause suffocation and deaths. 2. NEED FOR FIRE SAFETY IN BUILDINGS: The Fire Fighting and Rescue operations in the resi dential buildings are very difficult due to the following characteristics of F ire accidents. a. Intensity of Fire is severe in view of use and stor age of highly inflammable materials such as LPG (Cooking Gas), Fu rniture, Carpets, Curtains, Plastics, etc., b. Occupation of the Building by different types of pe ople. c. Fire and smoke spread through vertical openings suc h as Staircases, Lift shafts, Service Ducts, Air Conditioning ducts, etc. , d. Smoke filled building makes it difficult to locate the seat of Fire. e. In the absence of Electricity, Fire Fighters have t o carry equipment up the stairs. f. Lack of adequate access around the building makes i t difficult for Fire Engines to maneuver effectively. g. Suffocation due to CarbonBdiBoxide and Carbon Monox ide causing large number of deaths. h. Parking in the set back open spaces causes obstruct ion for movement of Fire Units. i. Lack of adequate water storage in the premises for Fire Fighting. j. Fire spreads fast due to high wind in upper floors. : k. Close proximity of flats/ apartments (residential b uildings). a. There is need to provide inbuilt safety measure during construction stage itself in the interest of safety of the inmates as Fire Fighting externally is very difficult in High Rise Buildings . Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 124 3. CLASSIFICATION OF BUILDINGS AS PER NATIONAL BUILDIN G CODE: a.

UNAUTHORIZED CONSTRUCTIONS IN URBAN LOCAL BODIES K.Purushotham Reddy Joint Director of Town & Country Planning a. Due to rapid pace of urbanization, there is a great er spurt in construction activity in urban areas to meet the increased deman d for buildings due to migration from rural areas, coupled with general ec onomic development of these areas. In this process of development, it is noticed that large number of unauthorized buildings are cropping up in all ur ban areas. The unauthorized constructions have become a menace and this has to be curbed at the initial stage itself. The main functi on of the Town Planning officials particularly at the field level is to bri ng the developments coming up in an orderly manner and to stop the illegal develo pments so as to facilitate healthy and good living conditions to the people. b. Reasons for unauthorized constructions 1. Eagerness of applicant for maximum utilization of s ite to get maximum returns; 2. High land cost and smaller plot sizes; 3. Building regulations not being accepted by applican ts; 4. NonBregulation of unauthorized layouts both by owne rs and authorities; 5. Land use controls; 6. Ineffective and Inadequate development control mach inery; 7. Dependence on lower staff for detection, issue of n otices and demolition; 8. Frequent interference of Courts in Unauthorized Con structions; 9. NonBfixation of clear responsibilities on lower sta ff, officers and Municipal Commissioners; 10. Lack of coBordination between parastatal department s Viz. Electricity, Water Supply, Engineering, Revenue, Health (Trade L icences) etc., for controlling unauthorized development activity; c. Necessity of controlling unauthorized constructions 1. Unauthorized Constructions are seriously affecting the planned development of the city causing various problems to community at large; 2. Unauthorized Constructions are affecting the genera l health of the occupants denying them natural light & air; 3. Serious traffic problems are created on account of not providing required parking space; 4. Provision of urban Infrastructure is becoming an up hill task on account of unauthorized and irregular development of buildi ngs; 5. Roads with proper width and adequate open spaces co uld not be provided due to unapproved layouts; 6. Change in usage of buildings is creating problems t o traffic, safety and health of the residents of the neighbourhood. d. Major types of violations in unauthorized construct ions 1. Projections/ Extension of RCC roof into the all rou nd setbacks. 2. Enclosing open balconies into built up area; 3. Covering the duct portions; 4. Covering the off set portions; 5. Covering the totBlot; 6. Reducing the common area & converting into built up area; 7. Reduction of allBround setbacks; Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 135 8. Construction of additional floors; 9. Conversion of parking places at stilt, cellar & sub Bcellar into saleable/ habitable areas: 10. Conversion of normal residential building into Flat s; 11. Conversion of residential buildings into commercial purpose; e. Constraints in controlling unauthorized constructio ns 1. Lack of awareness among the citizens regarding the necessity of having a building with adequate open spaces to provide nat ural light and ventilation; 2. Lack of professionalism among the builders, license d architects, structural engineers about the necessity to constru ct building as per building regulations; 3. Gross inadequate Town Planning staff in ULBs to reg ulate unauthorized constructions; 4. Lack of modern equipment and trained personnel to d emolish unauthorized constructions; 5. Lack of willing coBoperation from police authoritie s to Town Planning staff in demolition of unauthorized constructions; 6. Stay orders, status quo orders by various Courts ev en in the absence of issuance of notices by Municipal Authorities; 7. Absence of Building Appellate Tribunal to try Town Planning cases exclusively as in the case of several other matters like Land Grabbing, Consumer Courts; 8. NonBinsistence on submission of Occupancy Certifica te to get essential services namely Electricity, Water, Sewerage etc: 9. Registration of unauthorized constructions without sanctioned plan from the Corporation. 10. Lack of support to the administration from the Loca l Leadership. f. Preventive action for regulating unauthorized const ructions : In addition to levy of heavy fines on unauthorized constructions, there is every necessity to initiate preventive action for r egulation of unauthorized constructions. The following preventive measures ar e suggested for controlling unauthorized constructions: 1. Simplification of the Rules and Procedures for easy understanding by the public and implementation and codification of a ll Rules, Byelaws and orders as one Building Code for all ULBs/UDAs 2. As already stated, there is no awareness among citi zens regarding advantages of complying with building rules in the construction of buildings. Hence, it is suggested that Awareness Ca mpaign may be launched with various stakeholders regarding the ne cessity and advantages of complying Building Byelaws as is bein g done in the case of health campaign. 3. Municipal Authorities may publish booklets regardin g the procedure to be followed for obtaining building permission and t he consequences of resorting to unauthorized constructions. In fact, a publicity campaign may be launched in this matter, as is being done in the case of health programmes. 4. ULBs may publish a Monthly Bulletin pertaining to b uilding permissions granted and Layouts approved with all d etails and this may be made available to the public at a reasonable cost. In addition, list of unauthorized layouts and unauthorized const ructions may be included in the bulletin. The above information may be posted in the Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 136 Web site also. 5. It is noticed that several citizens and NRls are pu rchasing apartments and open plots without fully apprising the transact ions and later on facing innumerable problems in the enjoyment of the property. Hence, it is suggested that a Counseling Center / Facilita tion Center may be opened in the ULBs with participation of all concer ned Departments / Institutions to provide, among others, the followin g information at a reasonable cost within a stipulated time. a. Ownership information of the property in question a s per records available in ULBs/ Revenue Department; b. Approval of Layout by competent authority; c. Approval from the competent authority for construct ion of a building; d. Land Use as stipulated in Master Plan and Zonal Dev elopment Plan; e. Usage of the building as per sanctioned plan; f. Any other information as deemed fit by the authorit y; This information may be posted in the Web site of U LBs. 6. It is suggested that third party inspection may be conducted on the status of constructions in plots exceeding 500 sq.m trs by engaging licensed technical personnel. Monthly status report s shall be submitted by licenced technical personnel on paymen t of prescribed fee. Guidelines may be evolved for the engagement o f technical personnel for third party inspection. 7. Further there is no modern equipment and trained / skilled personnel to undertake demolition of deviations and unauthori zed constructions The ULBs may outsource the activity relating to dem olition of deviations and unauthorized constructions by engagi ng qualified agencies for this task. 8. Separate Tribunals for trying Town Planning matters may be set up with a Town Planning member on the Board. g. Statutory Provisions to take action against unautho rized Developments: 1. A.P. Municipalities Act 1965 i. While dealing with the unauthorized constructions a nd deviations/ violations, the Municipalities should i dentify such constructions at the initial stages and they should take action as per the provisions of AMP Act 1965. ii.

PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP K.Anand Babu Addl. Director of Town & Country Planning Pradeep B Kumar Town Planning Assistant, O/o Directorate of Town & Country Planning 1. What is PPP in infrastructure? a. Physical infrastructure, such as roads, water and s anitation networks, and transportation systems, involve large investmen ts that can put a strain on the public purpose. This strain is especi ally great for countries, such as India, whose economies is undergoing rapid development and urbanization and has a great need for expanded infr astructure. b. PublicBprivate partnerships (PPPs) are increasingly being used by governments and public sector authorities throughou t the world as a way of increasing access to infrastructure services for their citizenry and economies at a reduced cost 2. A PPP typically has the following characteristics: a. The private sector is responsible for carrying out or operating the project and takes on a substantial portion of the associate d project risks b. During the operational life of the project the publ ic sector's role is to monitor the performance of the private partner and enforce the terms of the contract c. The private sector's costs may be recovered in whol e or in part from charges related to the use of the services provided by the project, and may be recovered through payments from the public secto r d. Public sector payments are based on performance sta ndards set out in the contract e. Often the private sector will contribute the majori ty of the project's capital costs, although this is not always the case It will often be necessary to build or add to exist ing assets in order to meet the infrastructure needs of the economy and us ers. However, an important part of the infrastructure PPP concept is that: i. A PPP is focused on outputs, and ii. The outputs of the PPP are infrastructure services , not infrastructure assets . a. The reason for the focus on outputs and services ra ther than assets is to encourage efficient use of public resources and imp roved infrastructure quality. b. A PPP brings the public and private sectors togethe r as partners in a contractual agreement, for a preBdefined period (eg . 30 years) matched to the life of the infrastructure assets used to provi de the services. The private partners (investors, contractors and operat ors) provide specified infrastructure services and, in return, the public sector either pays for those services or grants the private partner the ri ght to generate revenue from the project. For example, the private partner may be allowed to charge user fees or receive revenue from other aspe cts of the project. c. The best PPPs will have the public and private part ners working together to build and sustain a longBterm relationship that is of benefit to all. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 156 3. Advantages of PPP The advantages of PPP include: a. Access to private sector finance b. Efficiency advantages from using private sector ski lls and from transferring risk to the private sector c. Potentially increased transparency d. Enlargement of focus from only creating an asset to delivery of a service, including maintenance of the infrastructure asset d uring its operating lifetime e. This broadened focus creates incentives to reduce t he full lifeBcycle costs (i.e., construction costs and operating costs) All of these provide strong reasons in favour of us ing PPPs in India and elsewhere. 4. Access to private sector finance India has a very large infrastructure need and an associated funding gap. PPPs can help both to meet the need and to fill the funding gap. PPP projects often involve the private sector arranging and prov iding finance. This frees the public sector from the need to meet financing r equirements from its own revenues (taxes) or through borrowing. 5. Higher efficiency in the private sector A well designed and managed PPP should take advant age of the potential for efficiency gains from using the private sector. 6. Increased transparency in the use of funds The key to increased transparency and reducing oppo rtunities for corrupt practices is the release of information to the publ ic domain, for use in the media and by interested and concerned individuals, NGOs, and the private sector participants themselves. 7. When should PPP be used? The use of PPP for infrastructure projects should o nly be considered when: a. The public sector environment is suited to supporti ng PPPs b. The project is suitable to being carried out as a P PP c. The potential barriers to successful project implem entation have been identified and can be overcome d. Given that these conditions are satisfied, the proj ect must be commercially viable for the private sector and offe r value for money (VFM) for the public sector * * * Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 157 7.

TOWN PLANNING FEE AND CHARGES (SCHEDULE OF RATES ) B.Purushothama Reddy Director of Town & Country Planning 1. The Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) responsible for provi ding civic service are facing acute shortage of capacity and resources. Mo st Urban Local Bodies are starved of resources on account of their inabil ity to effectively use their revenue raising powers, particularly, relating to L and and Property. The increase in population will further aggravate the a lready overburdened ULBs with regard to the financial selfBsufficiency. More the population means more the services required and which require more money. The Central and State Governments support is negligible and unless the ULBs make their own efforts it would be very difficult t o survive and there is every possibility that the basic services required to be provided to the citizens will be paralyzed beyond cure. To come to the rescue of the ULBs to give financial support, there are some statutory powers which need to be rationally and judiciously implemented for a health y and sound financially viable ULB. 2. Land is a major financial resource to a Local Body in urban areas. Whenever any permission is given by a local body, t here are various components under which fee and charges are levied. Urban land is also a major resource for urban development through the us e of the various instruments through the enabling statutory powers u nder the respective Acts. 3. The following are the various Acts governing the pe rmissions being accorded to the citizens in urban areas in Andhra P radesh. a. A.P. Municipalities Act, 1965. b. Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. c. Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Act, 2008. d. A.P. Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975. e. A.P.

Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 202 5.18 In addition to the above the following are als o some of the tools where land is found as a resource. a. Sale of Bits and Pieces of Land: Many Municipalities and Municipal Corporations own small and large extents of lands. The small pieces cannot be used p roductively for any public purpose like parks or playgrounds. Some of t hese are already under encroachment for a long period of time. In vi ew of this position, a scheme of sale of bits and pieces of lands, which are becoming liabilities to the civic bodies and not earning any returns, may need to be implemented. As there is already a Government Or der permitting Municipalities to sell small extents of useless bit s and pieces of land, it is proposed that the scheme may be implemented in a ll urban local bodies in the interest of effective land administra tion and also to raise resources. b. Leasehold to Freehold: Most Municipalities have not been able to administe r their leased properties for a long time. There is no point in ke eping records for properties whose lease period goes up to 99 years. Such records are seen to be lost in many cases and most urban local bodies are found to be poor in recordBkeeping. In many cases vested int erests have also resulted in the lease papers not being traceable. I t is proposed that all municipal bodies go in for a LeaseholdBtoBFreehold conversion scheme following the pattern adopted by the Delhi Developm ent Authority and some State Governments. The leasehold properties ma y be converted to freehold subject to payment of certain portion o f the market value. c. Road Widening Scheme: The Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) has be en undertaking road widening on a massive scale by using planning permission, including Floor Space Index, as a resource. With th e objective of facilitating the widening of roads to decongest Hyd erabad, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has granted special po wers to the Commissioner, MCH. The latter is competent to grant permission to those surrendering land for road widening to take u p additional construction over and above that permitted by the Z oning and Building Regulations. Land surrendered horizontally is compe nsated by additional construction vertically. The Municipal C orporation rebuilds the demolished compound walls and other structures. The extent to which vertical construction is to be permitted depe nds on the extent of land surrendered by parties and the prevailing FSI in the area. If there is no scope for going vertical, the landowner can a vail Transferable Development Rights for using the same elsewhere or selling to others. In some cases even the construction of buildings fo r nonBresidential use (commercial/institutional) is permitted to indu ce landowners to part with valuable land for road widening. Through the process of using FSI as a resource. d. Building Penalization / Regularization Fee: There are number buildings constructed with deviati on or without approval in many of the urban areas. The existing s tatutory provisions may not contain any such mechanism to allow regular izing such structures. In the absence of this many buildings r emain illegal and due to this many of the building owners suffer as t hey may not either sell or go for any additional constructions. The lo cal body is also helpless as they can either demolish such structure s or officially allow such structures to remain like this. But in Andhra Pradesh under previous BRS or present BPS schemes could regulariz e many such Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 203 buildings. It also helped in improving the financia l resources of the ULBs. e. Layout Regularization Fee: Similarly there are number of plots / layouts witho ut approval. Due to this the plot owners are unable construct in an aut horized manner. LRS helped many plot holders to get their plots reg ularized and this also resulted in improved financial position of the ULB and the ULB could provide the basic amenities in the town.

INVENTORY OF ASSETS & ASSET MANAGEMENT Extracted from \"Manual of Assests and Assest Managem ent prepared by CGG\" 1. Classification of Assets The classification of fixed assets can be done in s everal ways - functionB wise for example water works and sewerage and drain age or natureBwise such as plant and machinery, etc. The APMAM) provid es a structure for fixed assets classification based on a mix of 'func tion' and 'nature'. 2. Infrastructure Assets APMAM prescribes fixed assets to be divided into tw o main categories: a. Infrastructure Assets; and b. Other Assets 'Infrastructure assets' are longBlived capital asse ts associated with governmental activities that are normally stationar y in nature and can be preserved for significantly greater number of years than other capital assets (e.g. roads, bridges, tunnels, drainage systems, wa ter and sewer systems, dams, and lighting systems) Buildings are excluded from the definition of infrastructure assets, unless they are an ancillary part of a network of infrastructure. As per IPSAS (International Public Sector Accountin g Standards), 'infrastructure assets' usually display some or all of the following characteristics: a. They are part of a system or network; b. They are specialized in nature and do not have alte rnative uses; c. They are immovable; and d. They may be subject to constraints on disposal 3. Asset Classification as per APMAM The account coding structure prescribed in APMAM cl assified assets into 11 major groups, all under the broad head of 'Fixed As sets': a. Land b. Buildings c. Roads and Bridges d. Sewerage and Drainage e. Water Works f. Public Lighting g. Plant & Machinery h. Vehicles i. Office & Other Equipments j. Furniture, Fixtures, Fitting and Electrical Applian ces k. Other Fixed Assets Among these, items (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) can be classified as 'infrastructure assets'. 4. Land : Land includes parks, playgrounds, agricultural land , dhobighat, dumping ground, cart / rickshaw / taxi (other than undergro und taxi stands) / cycle stand, parking places (other than those which are c overed) and any vacant site on which no construction has taken place. Wher e assets such as Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 213 buildings, roads, bridges, etc, are constructed on land, all land (including covered land) should be shown under this head. 5. Buildings (including Structures): a. Buildings include officeBbuildings, schoolBbuilding s, publicB conveniences, hospital, dispensaries, maternity and child welfare centers, shopping complexes, town hall buildings, c ommunity centers, staff quarters, restBhouses, workshop buildings, st ores buildings, covered taxi stands, covered parking areas, lavator y blocks, urinals, garbage collection points, etc. b. Structures include public fountains and others whic h cannot be classified as buildings, but are nevertheless of a permanent natu re. Land under buildings should be separated and shown distinctly under 'Land'. 6. Roads & Bridges : This includes several types of assets including roa ds, pavements, footpaths, bridges, subways, over bridges, flyovers, culverts, and causeways. 7. Sewerage and Drainage : This includes items like roadside drains, undergrou nd drains, sewerage network etc., Plant and machinery for pumping stati ons including pumps would be classified under this head. If land and bu ildings for sewerage are already classified under 'Land' and 'Building' earl ier, they should not be included here. 8. Water Works : This includes all items related to water works such as bore wells, treatment plants, reservoir, overhead tanks, pipelines, plant and machinery for water works etc. If land and buildings for Water Works ar e already classified under 'Land' and 'Building' earlier, they should no t be shown here. 9. Public Lighting : This covers all assets related to lighting and incl udes electrical installations like transformers, cables, lamps, fittings and pole s. Any electrical installations other than for public lighting would be covered under the head 'Furniture, Fixtures & Electrical Appliances.' 10. Plant and Machinery : Plant and machinery include all engineering equipme nts like road rollers, bull dozers etc. medical equipments used in hospita ls, dispensaries and maternity centers, scientific equipments, generator s etc. This will not include plant and machinery used specifically in wa ter works, pumping stations, sewerage treatment plants etc. which are already classified under those heads. However, plant and machinery used for other purposes should be included under this head. 11. Vehicles : Vehicles include all types of trucks, water tankers , buses, jeeps, cars, twoB wheelers, threeBwheelers and loaders, etc, mobile m achinery such as Road Rollers and Bulldozers would not be classified as v ehicles, as their primary purpose is not transportation. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 214 12. Office & Other Equipments : All items of office use such as computers, peripher als, photocopy machines, typeBwriters, communication and telecom equipments would be recorded under this head. Other equipment (which may not be used in office) should also be recorded under this head. 13. Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings & Electrical Applianc es : a. They include metal as well as wooden chairs, tables , racks, cupboards, water coolers, fans, airBconditioners, refrigerator s, TVs, etc. Items which can be classified as Office and Other Equipment sho uld be first classified under that head, else, should be include d here. b. It would also include all types of installation cab les, lamp posts, mercury vapor lamps, sodium vapor lamps, light fittings, po wer points, etc. used in the buildings and other premises used by the ULB (other than those used for streetBlighting as they are included under the heading 'Public Lighting'). 14. Other Fixed Assets : a. This will included all other assets not specificall y covered in any of the earlier heads. It will include for instance, intang ible assets such as software, rights etc. b. Specific assets with different valuation or reBuse norms (such as heritage assets, works of arts etc.) may also be classified as separate subBgroups under this head. 15. Issues in classification : There are a few fixed assets where classification, at times, may lead to confusion. The following may be adopted for such as sets: 16. Traffic signals : Traffic signals, if any, are to be classified as pa rt of 'Other Fixed Assets'. 17. Network of pipes : There is sometimes a question of whether the networ k of pipes within the total land of a water works is to be taken as part of 'Sewerage & Drainage', or as part of 'Water works'. Whatever falls within the identified area of the 'water works' is to be taken as a part of it. 18. Fountains and decorative structures : To be taken under 'Buildings' which includes all ci vil structures. 19. Road over-bridge : To be taken under 'Roads and Bridges' 20. Mobile generators : It should be taken as part of 'Plant & Machinery'. 21. Earth moving equipments : It should be included under 'Plant & Machinery'. 22. Status and Monuments : Where the valuation and reBuse policy is substantia lly different from other buildings, this should be shown as a separate subBg roup under 'Other Assets'. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 215 23. Works of Art and History : Assets like paintings, manuscripts etc, should be t aken under 'Other Assets'. Heritage Buildings and structures, if they are different in nature from 'Buildings' may also be classified in 'Other A ssets'. 24. Minor Movable Assets : Like office phones, calculators, tools etc. If thes e are below the threshold for capitalization as per the accounting policies (see next chapter), they should not be capitalized. If they are beyond the threshol d, they should be grouped appropriately under 'Office Equipment', 'Plant & Ma chinery or 'Other Assets'. 25. Stand-by equipment and servicing equipment : Machinery spares which are not specific to a partic ular item of fixed asset but can be used generally for various items of fixe d assets should be treated as inventories for the purpose of AS 2 and such mac hinery spares should be charged to the statement of income and expenditu re as and when issued for consumption in the ordinary course of operation s; otherwise it shall be capitalized as per AS 10. StandBby equipment such a s generator or a water pump is fixed asset by itself and should be treated as such. 26. Major Spare Parts : AS 10 states that if some spare parts can be used o nly in connection with a specific item of fixed assets and their use is expe cted to be irregular, then, they should be capitalized separately at the time o f their purchase. So far as classification is concerned, such spares should be tagged to the item of equipment to which they refer. 27. Capital Work in Progress : a. In addition to the above categories, one more categ ory is important 'Capital Works in Progress'. This includes costs of constructing fixed assets before construction is substantially complet e. The identification of an item of construction as 'Capital Work in Prog ress' means that the item is intended to be capitalized once it is compl ete / put into use. b. Capital Work in Progress (CWIP) is included in the 'Fixed Assets' group of assets but is only an interim account, until the asset is put into use. In particular i. CWIP is not recorded in any of the 'asset' register s. Instead, a separate CWIP Register is maintained to record prog ressive bills for construction; ii. Any amount paid for purchase / construction of an a sset which has not been completed / put to use should be shown as CWIP and recorded in CWIP Register; iii. No depreciation is charged on CWIP since the asset has not been put to use; iv. The asset should be transferred from CWIP to Fixed Asset Register when it is put into use. Hence, CWIP register shoul d be reviewed regularly for such items. 28. Suggested coding of Assets : a. A proper classification of fixed assets should empl oy a code for each asset. By using the code, a ULB becomes ready for c omputerization of its Fixed Assets Management System. Further, with s uch a code, it is easy to crossBclassify data and to roll up categori es to have the Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 216 possibility of making a wide variety of reports. Th e classification code is for the group of fixed assets: GROUP MINOR HEAD CODE i) Land : 10 ii) Buildings : 20 iii) Roads & Bridges : 30 iv) Sewerage and drainage : 31 v) Water Works : 32 vi) Public Lighting : 33 vii) Plant and Machinery : 40 viii) Vehicles : 50 ix) Office & Other equipments : 60 x) Furniture, fixtures, fitting and Electrical appliance : 70 xi) Other Fixed Assets : 80 b. Further classification to group heads can be ma de based on the need of the ULB, and should be aligned to the Accounting Ma nual and Fixed Asset Registers. The suggested structure of coding is as follows: i. Major Head Code B xxx ii. Minor Head Code B xx iii. Detailed Head Code B xx iv. Ward Location Code B xxx v. Serial Number Code B xxx c. The minor head code and detailed head code for the group of assets are provided in the APMAM. The ward location code is th e location of asset with 3 digits and the last level would be the seria l number of the asset with 3 digits. 29. Record Keeping - Fixed Asset Register : a. Once the assets have been identified, listed and va lued by the ULB, their record needs to be maintained and continually updated. This is achieved through the Fixed Asset Register (FAR). If the FAR is not continually updated, the efficacy of the entire ass et identification, valuation and management will be greatly reduced. b. The FAR will form the basis for further planning an d maintenance under the Asset Life Cycle Management (ALCM) strate gy for the ULB. Hence, this document will have a record keeping and planning function. 30. Using IT for asset management : a. Since most ULBs will have a large number of assets, it would be most efficient to use appropriate IT tools for their man agement. Asset tracking can be done through FARs which can be main tained on databases. Maintenance plans and schedules can be b est managed through project management and resources scheduling software. Preparation of various reports should be automated and schedules (such as for depreciation) generated through softwa re. b. Most of these functions can be achieved through bas ic computer applications and minimal programming. It is strongl y emphasized that ULBs should not, at the initial stages at least, lo ok to use complex ERP systems which are difficult to implement. * * * Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 217 CHAPTER - VIII GOVERNMENT SCHEMES 1. HOUSING SCHEMES V.R.Satish Chandra Former Director, House Numbering Cell. 1. Introduction House and Human being canBnot be separated Housing is a fundamental requirement of Human being. Housing is a accepted as a responsibility of welfar e state. Housing as important role in social environment. A house is not a merely shelter for the family. (li ke it is said at houses are built by hands while homes are made by h earts). Directive principles of the constitution say that a t social just is shall be achieved with the growth. In developing economy like India there is a mismatc h between Housing supply and demand. Like rate of construction in housing in India is be low 3 houses per 1000 population for year. Given recommendation say desired rate shall be 10 h ouses per 1000 population for year. To achieve self sufficien cy in housing by the turn of the country. Which proves that even in 2011, there is large defi ciency in housing even today in India. Homelessness and houseless ness are universal probl ems. (It is not only economical but varies factors like care city l ivable land, exorbitant land values, absence of basic services e tc.) Providing housing is a dynamic process. Housing doesn't end with four walls and a roof. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 218 In order to understand what housing is and the proc ess in world then we have no different step like a Historical growth and human settlements and housing problems. What is difference between house and housing. Housing in the context of SocioBEconomic element of a country. Housing in the context of social welfare and policy . Housing is sub system in a larger system of human s ettlements. Assess housing needs and demand in given country at given time. Housing policies and programme every five years. Public participation in housing and role of benefic iary is in housing development. Role of self help housing and added self help housi ng. To know the problem of the urban poor and informal sector. Role of housing coBoperatives. To know the Cost efficiency in all components of ho using system. To understand Importance of land reforms housing ma nagements or entire process of monitoring system. Need for research development programmes. To know the dangerous slums squatters settlements. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 219 If other words, unable to provide required amenitie s at the pace required. Because in 1901 urban growth was 10.5% incase 12.5% in 1931 , 17.6% in 1951 and 24.5% in 1981. and so on. That backlog was 13 million houses in 1981. It is backlog is in 2007B2008 is 24.71 Millions. This process urbanisation are mainly because in the Industrialization in the context of agriculture de velopment and rural transformation which expects control rural u rban migration. In order to access the housing shortage which is im portant step to be taken. To identity the problem in detail like what is magn itude housing shortage. There fore data has to reliable organized and corre ct. Reports of National sample's Survey etc., updated f rom time to time are major sources of information on housing. To understand the basic problems Housing design. Different accepts of Housing finance. Roll of certain public sector agencies in providing shelters like national NHB, LIC, HDFC, HFC and KUNFC etc. To know the important scene of taking up in public program such as site and service of slum, up gradation etc., Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 220 To know the signification housing survey's and Hou sing statistics. How to compute the housing shortage is quantitative and qualitative term of the above topic only 2 are deep in detail like. Housing Shortage: When ever you of housing there is a always a word u sed like housing shortage. 2. Housing Shortage :B Housing Shortage is important but it is a complicat ed subject. Though makes it a look simple from out side It requires a reliable data base. For example national census and hand books, Repor ts of NSS updated from time to time, by field surveys are the major sources of information and Housing statistics. The data so collected shall have problem at a given time, at given place, is a number of Households or either Housele ss or substandard Houses like slums and Squatter settle ments. Housing Shortage is nothing but subtracting total n umber of dowelling houses in a settlement, from the number o f households. This is only numerical shortage or that is Quantita tive shortage. This numerical shortage can be of two types. One qu antitative two qualitative. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 221 Qualitative shortage indicates number of uninhabita ble houses among the existing stock computed on the basis of some standards. These Standards vary from region to region, depends upon the climate, family size, income BBB etc. In other words housing shortage quantitative or qua litative shortage. In housing standards play an important role This can be done by fixing space standards,structur al standards and quality standards. Space standards deals with size of rooms ventilatio n and minimum standards of doors and windows etc.,. In structural standards deal with material used for construction of different component like foundation, super structur e or roofing. One the basis of structural conditions a house can be classified of pucca or kachha house. 3. A Pucca Type (House): Is one having walls made of burnt brick, metal shee t and roof of stones or cement concrete. Pucca are those where ro of is of tiles with GI sheets or any other metal, AC sheets or | R cc roof | etc. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 222 Life span expected of minimum 25 years from the dat a of survey. To find out deficiency in housing as recommended by NBO that kachha type houses in rural areas and kachha type in urban areas are considered as substandard. Required demolition / Replacement.based on this hou sing shortage is calculated in 2007B2008 is 24.71 millio ns. 4. Need for housing survey: a. In planning nothing is possible without statistical data so also in housing. b. In ordered to know future requirement it as to be p rotected properly . Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 223 2. REMUNERATIVE & NON REMUNERATIVE SCHEMES Venkata Ratnam Chief Planner, GVMC 1. Introduction: a. The process of urbanization helps an economy to ach ieve rapid economic growth, with rapid urbanization; there is a possibility of deterioration in the physical environment and quali ty of life in urban areas. This resulted in widening the gaps between d emand and supply in the provision of urban infrastructure facilities. b. There is a need to have qualitative improvement in the civic amenities. Municipal Services, infrastructures facilities on a n increasing scale through a comprehensive approach it is also necessa ry to ascertain availability of physical, financial and institution al resources and strategies to be adopted to meet the growing needs. The development activities under various schemes ca n be broadly classified in to 1) Remunerative Schemes and 2) NonBRemunerative Scheme s. 2. Remunerative Schemes : - a. If the income generated from a scheme is sufficient to repay the loan amount with interest, such scheme is included in th e Remunerative category. b. Urban local bodies were encouraged to undertake dif ferent remunerative schemes such as construction of commer cial complexes, market complexes etc., to augment their source of i ncome. 3. Good will Auction Mode: - a. As a part of generating adequate resources to the U LB's to meet their capital expenditure, the ULB's may take up the cons tructions of commercial complexes on the land belonging to the U LB. b. Generally, the ULB's have been permitted under the relevant acts to takeBup the constructions of shopping complexes and letting them to the public on public auction. The auction of shop i s on monthly rental basis. c. It has become necessary to find out ways and means to improve the receipts of ULB's as well as to find out resources to takeBup construction of shopping complexes. d. The Government of A.P. in their orders G.O.Ms.No. 3 89 MA Dt. 24B09B 2004 have issued orders that the Municipal Corporat ions and the Municipalities can takeBup the constructions of sho pping complexes on the lands belonging to them duly following the pro cedure mentioned herein. e. Whenever a Municipal site for constructions of shop ping complex is identified the Municipal Commissioner should prepar e an appropriate design. He should enlist one or two local architec ts (at district level) for the preparation of detailed designs and estimates. f. The Architect should have a good reputation and sho uld be an Income Tax Assesses. A maximum of one of the project cost can be paid as consultancy fees to the Architect. No advance payme nt of consultancy fees will be made to the Architect. 50 % of the fee will be paid after Technical sanction of the estimate is obtained from the Superintending Engineer (PH) or the Engineer -inBChief (PH) as the case may be . The Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 224 remaining 50% will be paid after the administrative sanctions for the project is received from the Government. g. The design has to be got approved by the Director o f Town and country Planning and the estimate has to be got approved by the Superintending Engineer (PH) or the Engineer -inBCh ief (PH), as the case may be, as per the existing rules. h. As a measure to raise revenues for the construction s of shopping complex, the proposed shop rooms (as per the approv ed design) have to be put to public auction. The public auction should be on the basis of the NonBrefundable Deposit (Goodwill). i. The lease period should not exceed 12 years and the lease period id initially for 5 years. The lease can be renewed for 3 years @ 33 1/3 % excess over the lease amount. j. The Municipal Council can fix a reasonable monthly rent for the proposed shop rooms and the auction should relate t o goodwill amount, The goodwill amount may be collected in four instal lments i.e. 25 % immediately after approval, 25 % when the construct ion come up to lintel stage, 25 % after the roof is laid , and the balance 25 % when the shops are handed over. k. The project should get the administrative sanction of the Government before putting the shops to public auction. The bid of goodwill in the public auction needs to be accepted by the Council. l. The identification of site, appropriate selection o f Architect design, publicity, auction of shops on the basis of goodwil l and execution of work need be supervised by a Committee at the Distr ict level. The Committee will be formed by the Collector & Distric t Magistrate and shall consist of the Regional DirectorBcumBAppellate Commissione r of Municipal Administration, the Superintending Engine er (PH), the Regional Deputy Director of Town Planning and the C hairpersons and the Commissioners of the Municipalities concerned. m. Constructions of shopping complexes should be done economically with cement flooring and minimum electrical points. The lessees may be permitted to take flooring and electrical points as required by them at their own cost. They shall not disturb the main str ucture of the shop rooms but they can make internal arrangements at th eir, own cost to suit the business. They shall bear the maintenance charges of the shop rooms. n. The shop rooms shall be handed over to the lessees within a period of one year from the date of entering into agreement w ith the Municipality after payment of initial deposit. o. The transaction should be in writing and the releva nt agreements should be registered as per law. p. The usual reservation for SC, ST and physical handi capped in the matter of letting out the shops will continue follo wing all the above guidelines and procedure. 4. Land Pooling Scheme: a. As we know, land is precious resource for any devel opment or project. Due to so many reasons, land acquisition could not be concluded for development projects. In this scheme, the small pie ces of land are pooled from various land owners, a layout will be p repared and developed land will be shared among the land owners and ULB as per the understanding. b. The Government of A.P. in their orders G.O.Ms.No. 8 75 MA Dt. 04B12B 2007 have approved the proposal for acquiring Ac. 226.54 cents of land at Gollapudi and Jakkampudi Villages to take u p 15,000 houses Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 225 of weaker sections of Vijayawada Municipal Corporat ion under JNNURM scheme on sharing of net developed land at t he rate of 60:40 share, without cash compensation in the proposed co lony, in exchange of the land acquired from such land owners by conse nt award under section 31 (4) of the L.A. Act subject to condition that the proposed colony does not involve allotment of any Government land. c. Accordingly, the land was acquired from the land ow ners and the Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has constructed the housing complex under JNNURM in an extent of Ac.96.55 leavi ng the remaining land to an extent of Ac. 129.99 to the land owners duly developed with infrastructure. 5. PPP in Urban Sanitation:- a. The cities are bearing the brunt of rapid Urbanizat ion and urban sanitation and sewerage sector has not kept pace wi th this growth. It is now widely accepted that Government alone will be u nable to meet the infrastructures requirement, both interms of financing the infrastructure and also interms of meeting the deli very standards. Public private partnerships represent an option to augment the Government infrastructure delivery standards. b. The agency like \"Sulabh\" \"Toilets and Toilets \"etc will be identified by tender process of public conveniences at the requir ed places. The agency shall complete the constructions with in sti pulated time and operates the public convenience as per terms and conditions as may be agreed by both the ULB and the agency. The agenc y shall collect user charges from the users. 6. PPP in Waste to Energy:- a. Waste Management poses a major challenge to the env ironment in the 21 st century. In a climate of public concern, conflicti ng rhetoric from suppliers and interest groups, rapidly changing reg ulation and guidance, and continuing economic pressures, waste management requires a strategic framework. Waste to Energy mus t be a major element of this strategic framework. b. It is estimated that India currently generates about 1.60 lakh MT of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) every day. Large majori ty of this waste goes to urban landfill sites. Municipal Corporations across the country have already acknowledged the acute shortag e of landfill sites and are in search for desperate measures. c. Conversion of waste into various energy forms offer s great potential. But, it is also a significant revenue source. The p rocess not only addresses the environmental issues related with was te but also generates much needed energy. d. In this scheme the public partner i.e. ULB is to g ive required land on nominal lease basis and ensure the agreed quantity of solid waste. The end products are compost, ecoBbrick or sand and green coal. Project viability of waste processing projects depends upon sale of power, sale of manure / compost etc. In our state w aste to energy projects were installed at Hyderabad and Vijayawada . 7. Non-Remunerative Scheme:- a. All other schemes which are not included in the rem unerative category are classified as NonBRemunerative Scheme. b. The ULB's also undertake Non BRemunerative Scheme in the in terest of general public. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 226 c. Some of such schemes are given below: i. Development of parks and play grounds:- In thickly populates towns and cities, parks and pl ay grounds functions as a lung space and recreation place. ii. Traffic and Transportation Projects:- Due to enormous increase of vehicular traffic as we ll as pedestrian, there is an imperative need to take up the traffic and transportation projects such as formation of new roads / link road s; road widening, junction developments etc., even though t hey are not Remunerative. iii. Slum Improvement Schemes:- d. As a process of rapid urbanization people from rura l areas migrate to urban areas and due to lack of resources, they live in substandard environment thereby creation of slums with unBhygie nic conditions. e. The ULB's are taking up the slum improvement scheme with the aid of some international agencies like DFID and by the as sistance of the Government of India under various schemes like EI S chemes; JNNURM some of the other NonBRemunerative Schemes includes constructions of school buildings, constructions of office buildings , maintenance of Burial grounds etc. 8. CONCLUSION: a. With the rapid urbanization in urban local bodies, there is a need to have qualitative improvement in civic amenities, Mu nicipal Services, infrastructure facilities through a comprehensive a pproach. b. The functions / developmental activities under various schemes can be broadly classified into i. Remunerative Schemes which generate income to ULB's and ii. NonBRemunerative Schemes which are to be undertaken by ULB's in the interest of general public even though they do not generate income. c. Sometimes, schemes which are initiated as Remunerat ive may become NonBRemunerative due to lack of proper planning. For instance, a shopping complex constructed without demand survey or without proper design as per market trends will become a burden to ULB thereby become NonBRemunerative. d. Likewise, some NonBRemunerative schemes can be transformed to Remunerative with proper planning and by tapping th e market potentiality. Waste to energy project in solid wast e management, can be a remunerative by proper management. e. NonBRemunerative schemes like junction developments , Foot over bridges, BusBshelters etc. taken up under PPP made by giving advertisement rights to the developer/ Agency can c onstruct and maintain the project at this cost and entitled to m ake advertisements at the said project for a specified period. The agency may pay royality also to the ULB. *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 227 3. JAWAHARLAL NEHRU NATIONAL URBAN RENEWAL MISSION (JNNURM) AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT SCHEME FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM TOWNS (UIDSSMT) S.Devender Reddy Addl. Director, MA&UD 1. Introduction Rapid urbanization has paved to a multi lateral dev elopment of the cities, the increase in population, plus the influx of rura l poor migrants streaming into the cities has led to the increasing need to r ework and extend the existing urban infrastructure to meet the ever incr easing demand of the urban population. While the future of the country i s in the growing cities the challenge is in meeting up to the demands for i nfrastructure and facilities in these urban areas. It is in this cont ext that Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission; a seven year reform linked urban development programme was launched in December, 200 5. The programme is administered by two Ministries in GoI, i.e. Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Ministry of Housing and Urba n Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA). The MoUD administers two components, i.e. Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UI&G) and UIDSSMT (Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns) , aimed at creation of cityBwide infrastructure such as water supply, sanitation, se werage, solid waste management, transportation, renewal, etc. The Minis try of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA) administers the remaining two components, i.e. BSUP (Basic Services for Urban Poor) and IHSDP (Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme) , aimed at development of housing, infrastructure, and social amenities in slums. 2. The Mission Mission Statement: The aim is to encourage reforms and fast track planned development of identified cities. Focus is to be on efficiency in urban infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms, com munity participation, and accountability of ULBs/ Parastatals agencies to wards citizens. 3. Objectives of the Mission The objectives of the JNNURM are to ensure that the following are achieved in the urban sector; a. Focussed attention to integrated development of inf rastructure services in cities covered under the Mission; b. Establishment of linkages between assetBcreation an d assetB management through a slew of reforms for longBterm project sustainability; c. Ensuring adequate funds to meet the deficiencies in urban infrastructural services; d. Planned development of identified cities including periBurban areas, outgrowths and urban corridors leading to dispersed urbanisation; e. ScaleBup delivery of civic amenities and provision of utilities with emphasis on universal access to the urban poor; Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 228 f. Special focus on urban renewal programme for the ol d city areas to reduce congestion; and g. Provision of basic services to the urban poor inclu ding security of tenure at affordable prices, improved housing, wate r supply and sanitation, and ensuring delivery of other existing universal services of the government for education, health and social sec urity. 4. Scope of the Mission The Mission shall comprise two SubB Missions, namel y: a. SubBMission for Urban Infrastructure and Governance : This will be administered by the Ministry of Urban Development t hrough the SubB Mission Directorate for Urban Infrastructure and Go vernance. The main thrust of the SubBMission will be on infrastru cture projects relating to water supply and sanitation, sewerage, solid waste management, road network, urban transport and redev elopment of old city areas with a view to upgrading infrastructure therein, shifting industrial and commercial establishments to conform ing areas, etc. b. SubBMission for Basic Services to the Urban Poor: T his will be administered by the Ministry of Urban Employment an d Poverty Alleviation through the SubBMission Directorate for Basic Services to the Urban Poor. The main thrust of the SubBMission will be on integrated development of slums through projects fo r providing shelter, basic services and other related civic amenities wi th a view to providing utilities to the urban poor. 5. Strategy of the Mission The objectives of the Mission shall be met through the adoption of the following strategy: a. Preparing City Development Plan: Every city will be expected to formulate a City Development Plan (CDP) indicating policies, programmes and strategies, and financing plans. b. Preparing Projects: The CDP would facilitate identi fication of projects. The Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) / parastatal agencies will be required to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for unde rtaking projects in the identified spheres. It is essential that projec ts are planned in a manner that optimises the lifeBcycle cost of projec ts. The lifeBcycle cost of a project would cover the capital outlays and th e attendant O&M costs to ensure that assets are in good working con dition. A revolving fund would be created to meet the O&M requirements of assets created, over the planning horizon. In order to see k JNNURM assistance, projects would need to be developed in a manner that would ensure and demonstrate optimisation of the li feBcycle costs over the planning horizon of the project. c. Release and Leveraging of Funds: It is expected tha t the JNNURM assistance would serve to catalyse the flow of inve stment into the urban infrastructure sector across the country. Fun ds from the Central and State Government will flow directly to the nodal agency designated by the State, as grantsBinBaid. The fund s for identified projects across cities would be disbursed to the UL B/Parastatal agency through the designated State Level Nodal Agency (SL NA) as soft loan or grantBcumBloan or grant. The SLNA / ULBs in turn wo uld leverage additional resources from other sources. d. Incorporating Private Sector Efficiencies: In order to optimise the lifeB cycle costs over the planning horizon, private sect or efficiencies can be Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 229 inducted in development, management, implementation and financing of projects, through Public Private Partnership (PP P) arrangements. 6. Duration of the Mission The duration of the Mission would be seven years be ginning from the year 2005B06. Evaluation of the experience of implementa tion of the Mission would be undertaken before the commencement of Elev enth Five Year Plan and if necessary, the program calibrated suitably. 7. Expected Outcomes of the JNNURM On completion of the Mission period, it is expected that ULBs and parastatal agencies will have achieved the followin g: a. Modern and transparent budgeting, accounting, finan cial management systems, designed and adopted for all urban service and governance functions b. CityBwide framework for planning and governance wil l be established and become operational c. All urban residents will be able to obtain access t o a basic level of urban services d. Financially selfBsustaining agencies for urban gove rnance and service delivery will be established, through reforms to ma jor revenue instruments e. Local services and governance will be conducted in a manner that is transparent and accountable to citizens f. EBgovernance applications will be introduced in cor e functions of ULBs/Parastatal resulting in reduced cost and time of service delivery processes. 8. A snapshot of JnNURM programme in Andhra Pradesh In its final year of implementation the JnNURM prog ramme has been a big step in improving quality of life of citizens in ur ban Andhra Pradesh. The benefits of the programme have already begun accrui ng to citizens, with as many as 20 urban infrastructure projects and constr uction of 86,301houses houses having been completed under BSU P. The programme has generated a favorable environment for adoption of key governance reforms at the State and ULB levels. It has encoura ged urban managers to evolve city development strategies in consultation with communities and address long standing problems in civic infrastruct ure and issues of delivery of basic services and housing in a holisti c manner. 9. Service Delivery in JnNURM mission cities of Andhra Pradesh Andhra Pradesh has received sanction for 251 projects to be implemented in 89 ULBs out of the 125 ULBs in the State at a project cost of Rs. 11, 877.58 crore with Additional Central Assistance (ACA) of Rs 6466.29 crore , under the ongoing Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The component wise details of the projects sanctioned are as follows: a. 54 projects under Urban Infrastructure and Governan ce (UI&G) costing Rs. 5267.50 crore; b. 36 projects costing Rs. 3010.20 crore under Basic S ervices to the Urban Poor (BSUP); c. 84 projects costing Rs. 2460.78 crore under Urban I nfrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDS SMT); and Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 230 d. 77 projects costing Rs. 1139.08 crores under Integr ated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP). 10. A status on sanctions and progress of projects in t he State: a. Out of the 54 Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UI&G) projects sanctioned under the programme, 20 projects have be en completed at a cost of Rs 2636.28 crore against the total projec t cost of Rs. 5267.50 crore, in the Water Supply , Storm Water Drains , Underground drainage , and Roads segment and 12 projects are proposed to be complet ed by September 2011 and 22 projects are underway, slated for completion by March 2012. b. Out of 1, 31,321 houses sanctioned for three Mission Cities under the Basic Services for the Urban Poor (BSUP) component, 86,211houses have been completed and the value of expenditure incurred was Rs 2176.59 crore against the total project cost of Rs 3010.20 crore. 45,020 houses are proposed to be completed by March 2012. c. Under Urban Infrastructure Development for Small and Medi um Towns (UIDSSMT), 36 projects costing Rs.718.57 crore have been completed against a project cost of Rs. 2460.78 cro re, by paving way to grounding of continuous water supply , improved infrastructure through underground drainages , CC roads and healthier environment through s olid waste management projects.35 projects are proposed to be completed by September 2011, and 15 projects are proposed to be completed by March 2012 d. Out of 47,896 houses sanctioned under Integrated Housing & Slum Development Programme (IHSDP) , 21,503 have been completed at the cost of Rs.624.16 crore as against the total pr oject cost of Rs 1139.10 crore and 6,549 houses are proposed to be c ompleted by September 2011 and 18, 844 houses are proposed to b e completed by June 2012. 11. Benefits of the Programme: a. Benefits of the programme are palpably impressive a cross the State of Andhra Pradesh under the Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UI&G) component a population of 60 lakh in the Mission c ities of Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada have benefi ted with continuous water supply through the accrual of 685 MLD and 4.18 lakh water connections . While the completion of 193 kms of storm water drains has improved the living conditions of 70 lakh people , the addition of 85 MLD underground drainage , in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada has benefitted a population of 11 lakh through 85 thousand connections issued. b. The Basic Services to Urban Poor (BSUP) scheme is designed to strive for integrated development of slums by providing ho using, including development of infrastructure facilities in slums e ither as inBsitu slum improvement or rehabilitation of slum people to the relocated area. A slum population of about 10 lakhs will benefit by occupying about 1.80 lakh houses by June 2012. c. Efforts to improve the infrastructure in the Small and Medium towns have fructified wherein hitherto levels of service delivery of basic services including water and underground drainage r equired improvement on account of want of capital investmen t in renewal, augmentation, and expansion of infrastructure ameni ties. The last mile coverage through 100% water supply 47 towns has raised the bar to provide 3.5 lakh new water connections in 61 ULBs with the addition of 736 MLD to an existing capacity of 521 MLD in 61 towns . Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 231 292 kms are covered through storm water drains in 9 ULBs covering 100% of the areas in the towns. Laying of 280kms of roads in 4 ULBs has resulted in ease of traffic, and improved mobil ity for the citizens. d. As the Integrated Housing & Slum Development Progra mme (IHSDP) aims for having an integrated approach in ameliorat ing the conditions of the urban slum dwellers that do not possess adeq uate shelter and reside in dilapidated conditions. About 30 lakh slum population from 1379 slums will benefit by way of improved infrastructure in terms of a road network of 1450 kms, there will be better livelihood options because of a healthy environment due to the constru ction of 1950 kms of drains . As the IHSDP programme aims at holistic developm ent of the urban slum community 228 community centre/informal centers will become the cynosure for women and youth empow erment programmes in the State *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 232 4. RAJIV AWAS YOJANA (RAY) B.Ramesh Babu Addl. Mission Director, MEPMA 1. Introduction Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) scheme was announced by the Govt. of India with a vision of \"Slum-free India\" with inclusive and equitable cities in which every citizen has access to basic civic and social services and decent shelter, through encouraging States/ Union Territories to ta ckle the problem of slums in a definitive manner. 2. General Conditions of Slums in Andhra Pradesh : Majority of the slums in Andhra Pradesh are inhabit ed by slum dwellers with low incomes, lack of tenure security, substand ard and dilapidated housing with poor ventilation and lighting, poor en vironmental conditions like squalor, water contamination, lack of sanitati on and unhygienic conditions. The slums are plagued by inadequate wa ter supply, toilets, access, street lighting, and proper drainage dispos al. They also lack critical social infrastructure like Urban Health Centers, Pr imary Schools, Anganwadis, Community Halls, livelihood development centers and night shelters etc. Thus the environmental, social and ec onomic conditions of slum dwellers result in low human development, whic h will in turn lead to their lower productivity and lower contribution to the city's economic development. 3. Basic data on slums in Andhra Pradesh: In AP, there are 125 ULBs in which there are a tota l of 7447 slums (5367 notified, 2012 nonBnotified and 68 slum pockets) wi th 18.99 lakh slum households and 89.54 lakh population residing in sl ums. Of the 7447 slums, 4638 are nonBhazardous and nonBobjectionable slums (62%), 2809 are hazardous / objectionable slums (38%). Majorit y of these slums (4119) are located on Govt. & Municipal lands (55%). 4. RAY 1 st Phase 27 ULBs a. Mission Cities - 4 (GHMC, GVMC, VMC, TMC) (newly added) c. Pilot towns (for slum household survey) - 3 B Chirala, Dharmavaram, Suryapet d. 1 st phase ULBs have submitted their tentative SlumBfre e City Plans of Action. They have been consolidated and the State S lumBFree Action Plan has been prepared and submitted to Government. 5. Steps involved in the Preparation of Slum Free City Plans: a.

Implementation of the approved DPRs 6. Housing, Environmental & Social Infrastructure Requ irements: a. In all 1 st Phase RAY ULBs the assessed requirement of housing units is based on the availability of pucca houses construct ed under different schemes and urban poor living in katcha and semi pucca houses. The existing housing stock in the 1 st year slums is 88,812 pucca houses, out of which 14,165 have been constructed under IND IRAMMA and 1394 have been constructed under JnNURM. Under RAY the ULBs have proposed 1,00,888 new houses of which, 98,883 houses in 939 slums under inBsitu redevelopment and 2005 houses i n 11 slums under relocation, which will replace the existing katchcha and semiB pucca houses in the proposed 1 st year slums. b. The 1 st Phase ULBs have made an assessment of onBsite and offBsite infrastructure requirement, duly considering the ex isting infrastructure. The total requirement under infrast ructure is Rs.1477.22 Crores, out and solid .98 c. The social infrastructure (preBschools (Anganwadies ), primary schools; urban health centers and dispensaries, livelihood c enters, multipurpose community resource centers, parks and playgrounds) requirement for the 1 st Year of RAY is Rs.207.87 Crores. More than 50% of the social infrastructure cost goes to preBs chools (Anganwadis) and primary and centers and 7. Andhra Pradesh State expectations from RAY: By tackling the shortages in housing, environmental and social infrastructure in the 1 st phase ULBs under RAY, the state of Andhra Pradesh envisages that all the slum dwellers will b e provided with decent and affordable housing with property rights, access to basic civic amenities Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 234 and social infrastructure. Similarly, the state en visages the inclusion of remaining ULBs under RAY to make Andhra Pradesh Slu m Free.

NATIONAL URBAN INFORMATION SYSTEM R.Hari Prasad Assistant Director of Town & Country Planning 1. Introduction The Ministry of Urban Development has launched the National Urban Information System (NUIS) Scheme during the Tenth F ive Year Plan (March 2006) to develop GIS databases for 137 towns/cities (now 152) in the country in two Scales i.e., 1:10000 and 1:2000. In addition, utility mapping on 1:1000 Scales will also be undertaken for 24 towns (now 22). Collection of NUDB&I data for 153 ( 137 NUIS Towns and 16 UNCHS Towns) now 168 (152 NUIS Towns and 16 UNCH S Towns). Total outlay of the Scheme is Rs. 66.28 Crore of which 75 % will be borne by the Central Govt. and the 25% will be StateBmatching sh are. 2. Objectives of NUIS Scheme a. The objective of NUIS Scheme is to establish a comp rehensive information system in the urban local bodies for pl anning, management and deBcentralised governance in the con text of provisions of scientific planning and implementatio n of the 74th Constitution Amendment Act (CAA) and to this end th e specific objectives are as follows: b. Develop attribute as well as spatial data base for various levels of urban planning and decision support to meet require ments of urban planning and management by i.

The images for mapping will be corrected/ registere d using Global Positioning System (GPS) from the ISRO/DOS GPS libr ary points. d. Ground Profiling/Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques will form the base for mapping underground utilities at 1:1,000 f rom 1:2,000 databases in selected towns for coreBarea planning. e. Geographic Information System (GIS) will form the c ore of NUIS Scheme spatial database. The GIS techniques will be used to develop integration/ application software that will generat e outputs for planning and management. f. Standardized GISBbased application packages that wi ll allow users in Towns/States to extract specific inputs for their p lanning process. g. Application packages that will be linked to the NUI S Scheme database of each town and ported onto the NUIS Scheme system of the town h. The source and methods in the development of Nation al Urban Databank and Indicators (NUDB&I) would involve the following: i. The NUDB&I database for each town to support planni ng and management in relation to actual departmental funct ions as identified will be generated/ compiled by the ULB to be linked to the spatial database. j. The data so generated will be processed to derive i ndicators to support NUO. k. Application packages for these indicators extractio n will be developed so that they can be aggregated at national level to support country level urban indices in turn to be transmitted in th e Global Urban Observatory (GUO) of UNCHS . 5. Deliverables a. The end product of the NUIS Scheme deliverables wou ld amount to the following: b. An urban, standardized GIS database of 1:10,000 to enable preparation of development/ master plan and 1:2,000 GIS database to monitor and implement most of urban local body func tions specified in the 12th schedule of 74th CAA and 1:1000 Utility GI S database for utilities planning.

Capacity Building One of the important requirements of NUIS Scheme is the availability of trained manpower in towns and States. The training is anticipated at 3 levels: a. Operators and Technicians level - which will be mainly to train State/Town personnel on how to generate inputs, mai ntain and operate the NUIS Scheme and database. Details of de sign of NUIS Scheme will also be covered. This will be of 4Bweek s duration. b. Planning level - mainly to train State/Town personnel on using the NUIS Scheme and database for generating inputs for urban planning and management. This will be of 2Bweeks duration. c. Administrators level - mainly as an orientation on NUIS Scheme. This will be of 3Bdays duration. 7. Mode of Implementation a. Given the widely varying range of tasks in the NUIS Scheme involving multiple agencies including Central, State, Local B odies and Private Sector, the implementation mechanism becomes fairly complex. The magnitude of the work being very large, there will be need to involve not only multiple government agencies, with technic al expertise, but also the involvement of competent private sector, w ho can contribute specific services in the field of GIS and Remote Se nsing. b. The structure of implementation and management can be broadly grouped under Central, State, local bodies and priv ate sector defining specific roles in the Scheme as given below: 7.1 National/Central 7.1.1 Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) a. The NNRMS SCBU would be the apex coordinating, guid ing and reviewing body for the NUIS Scheme chaired by the S ecretary (UD), to provide necessary policy and technical direction. b. The Town and Country Planning Organisation (TCPO), under the Ministry of Urban Development would be the nodal ag ency, which will function as NUIS Secretariat with full responsibili ty to implement National Urban Information System (NUIS) Scheme wit h identified NUIS Scheme Coordinator as the head and other appro priate technical and administrative staff to manage the mission. 7.1.2 Support Agencies A NUIS Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprisin g of Deptt. of Space, Survey of India, National Informatics Centre, selec ted State Nodal Agencies etc. would be constituted by MOUD for coordinating the technical implementation and resolve technical and managerial issues (standards, system specification, Quality Assurance procedures, reviews/ evaluation Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 240 etc). The NUIS Technical Advisory Committee may est ablish necessary subB committees to address specific technical issues if required. 7.2 State As part of NUIS Scheme implementation, the respecti ve State Governments will have the following obligations: a.

The State Governments/ NUIS Scheme State Coordinati on Committee (SCC) may recommend and encourage involvement of th e private sector or adopt publicBprivate partnerships to the extent possible. i. Private sector could mainly provide services and pr oducts for the NUIS Scheme. It may have a major role to play, espe cially when a large amount of human resources are required. ii. The NUO study may also be undertaken by competent p rivate and autonomous agencies at the discretion of the State Nodal Agency. b. Thus, the implementation of NUIS Scheme must be an interBagency effort, under the lead of MOUD and the involvement of all the above. 7.6 Review and Monitoring The NUIS activities are proposed to be reviewed on a regular basis, as follows: a. Annually by the NNRMS SCBU - especially to monitor/ review overall progress and achievements and address any interBage ncy issues. b. Quarterly once, by the i. NUIS Scheme Technical Advisory Committee - especial ly to oversee the progress of technical issues and also to overse e the technical implementation. ii. The NUIS Scheme State Coordination Committee (SCC) shall meet every quarter and the terms of reference will inclu de the following: c. Periodically monitor the progress of funds mobiliza tion and implementation of various projects taken up under t he Scheme; Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 242 d. Minor changes within approved projects maybe permit ted by the NUIS Scheme State Coordination Committee (SCC) during th e course of implementation. Every such change should be intimat ed to the MOUD/TCPO. e.

BHUBHARATHI K. Vidyadhar Additional Mission Director, MEPMA 1. Background a. To achieve the objective of providing the property title certification system in AP, Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) h as initiated a unique project \"Integrated Land Information System (Bhu Bharati)\", which is the first initiative of its kind in the co untry. Accordingly, the Govt., in G.O.Rt.No.158, Revenue (SS1) Departme nt, dt. 28B01B 2005, have sanctioned pilot project for Nizamabad D istrict. The pilot project is nearing completion .The reform brings ab out convergence of 4 Departments, namely Survey and Land Records, Regist ration, Revenue, and the Urban Local Body. b. The major objective of the current eBGovernance pro ject is creation of accurate spatial database using advanced surveying technologies like aerial photography, ETS, DGPS and also creation of Title Register , which provides the conclusive title to the legal owner of the land parcel. The project, which will be undertaken unde r the Bhu Bharati initiative, will also implement and adopt e-governance using IT applications, including GIS and MIS, for providing the land related services to the citizen in an unified manner through Citizens' Service Centers in the state. c. The project is the first initiative of its kind in the country. The creation of GIS database pertaining to all properti es located in Villages and Cities is necessary to enhance revenue and also for efficacious management of Rural urban infrastructure management and planning, so as to enable implementation of key policy decisi ons. d. The project shall result in increase in collection and coverage of property tax , introduction of unique Property Identification Nu mber (PIN ) for each property, and sharing of information, i. e. convergence, across departments and stakeholders on property and title related information in the ULBs. Presently, local bodies d o not have such information. Hence, property related data proposed for collection under the project will be used for enhancing the revenue of the ULBs. e. The principal aim of the project is transformation from department centric approach to service-centric approach in land administration, which would be characterized by an integrated syste m for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, analyzing and displ aying data about parcel/property and its use, ownership and developm ent. The system shall deliver the services to Citizens through a un ified interface, i.e. Citizen Service Centers/Providers/Internet. 2. Service Offered: All the land related functional will be delivered t o the citizen through a single window. The services to the citizen will be provided through the multiple channels viz., ILIS Service Centers, ILIS Portal, and ILIS Service Providers. The core services rendered through the p roject to citizens shall include Property Title Transfer, Property Transacti on History, Property Tax Assessment and Payment information, Land Use Certif icate, Changes in Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 244 Land Use, copies of Building and Layout Plans, subd ivision of parcel and property, etc. The project provides updated basic c adastral information with land use, building foot prints, road & rail network and also other topographical information required for preparation and revision of master plan. 3. Business Model The project is selfBsustainable. The proposed PPP model is BOT process in which a private organization builds, operate and tr ansfer to the government at the end of the contract period. Land information will be priced for sale and appropriate user charges regime will be introdu ced. SLA's are defined to the operator to deliver the services in a specif ied time frame. 4. Current Scenario: a. In Andhra Pradesh State, the creation and maintenan ce of records/information relating to land and property i s done under the auspices of four different agencies i. Survey and Land Records Department , which conducts cadastral surveys and creates and maintains basic records for each village ii. The Revenue Department, which administers Land Records by way of updation of titles iii. The Registration Department, which undertakes registration of deeds pertaining to transactions of land involving sale, mortgage, gift etc. iv. The Urban and Rural Local Bodies, which maintain ownership information necessary to collect property taxes, an d undertake planning and developmental activities within Pancha yat and municipal towns and cities. b. As seen from the above, a citizen has to approach S urvey Department for survey and subdivision or taking a copy of Tipp ons/FMB, Revenue Department for various certificates or changes to b e incorporated in Record of Rights, the Registration Department to se ll his property or carry out any transaction on his property and for p ayment of tax on urban properties or verification of layout approval etc., he has to approach the Corporation or Municipality or the loc al Gram Panchayat. As a result, citizens are facing serious problems. 5. Project Objectives: The high level objectives of the Bhu Bharati are a. To serve as record of conclusive title of all land parcels b. To provide services in an integrated, efficient and cost effective manner and c. To provide authentic land attribute information on a real time basis to all its users. 6. Components of the project a. Spatial data creation b. Aerial Photo Acquisition c. Surveying d. Control Points e. Title Enquiry f. Application development, g. Procurement of Software and Hardware h. Establishing Data Centers i. Institutional development Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 245 7. Project Implementation a. A Project Implementation Committee (PIC) and a Proj ect Management Team (PMT) is constituted to implement and monitor the project. b. Assistance is taken from the National Remote Sensin g Agency (NRSA), NIC. Apart from the above departments, information available with the other departments is also utilized, like the IRIS f rom the Food and Civil Supply department and UnifyBx Gateway from eBseva. NISG is opted as the Project Management Consultants. Through Impleme ntation Agency (IA), the project will be completed 8. Geodetic Network: a. Establishing of Ground Control Network (GCN) is the key activity in Bhu Bharati project. The major objective of this Co ntrol Network is to facilitate the future resurveys. The accuracy of da ta received through Resurvey depends on the established Ground Control Network. Hence, the Ground Control Network is established using acc urate differential Global Position System which produces the accuracy in millimeters. b. The Ground control is carried out in 3 phases in th e following order i. Primary control points using DGPS ii. Secondary control points using DGPS iii. Tertiary control points using Electronic Total Stat ions c. The primary control points are also used for the ae rial triangulation and block adjustment for densifying the control data in each photograph and used to generate digital orthophotos. The secon dary control points are generated using three base stations of the prim ary control data. Primary and Secondary control points are selected i n such a way that they are evenly distributed all over the Project ar ea. 9. Primary Control Points The primary control points are identified and monum ent using RCC pillar and each Primary control point is assigned with Uni que Number which will be engraved on the monument. The location sketch of the control points is also made available for future identification. 10. Secondary Control Points The network of Secondary control points is atleast one secondary control point and one auxiliary point for every Village set tlement and in every ward of Urban Local body. The network is planned to dist ribute the control points evenly throughout the area resulting on an average of one point for every 5 Sq Kms of area. These Secondary control points are monumented using RCC pillar and each Primary control point is assign ed with Unique Number which will be engraved on the monument. 11. Tertiary Control Points a. One tertiary control points are selected with an in terval of 500 meters. These control points are given a unique identificat ion for future reference. Points for tertiary controls are selecte d based upon the nature of its longevity, permanency inter visibilit y etc., strategic locations like black top roads, mile stones, bridge /culverts, rock exposures road junctions. BiBjunctions/ TriBjunctio ns survey stones will be selected for establishing these control points. However, the tertiary control points are to be provided in Urban Local bo dy area also by Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 246 planting stones for further property field survey. This tertiary control data will be used for further parcel survey and gen eration of cadastral maps of individual parcels and properties. b. The most important feature in Tertiary control surv ey is to close the traverse at the same location where it was started. Ideally both starting and closing coordinates should match, but generally that does not happen and there will be a difference which is call ed the Closing Error. This closing error will be adjusted and distributed to all the points according to the standards, which is called as Erro r Distribution. Error Distribution is possible only when the error is wit hin permissible limits. If the error is not adjustable then once again the traverse will be made by taking all necessary precautions. 12. Guidelines for Monumentation a. The locations for these control points are selected taking into consideration the following points. b. Area free of obstacles like tree cover, tall buildi ngs, HT power lines etc., in order to ensure good satellite signals for the G PS observations. c. The points will be located at safe places like gove rnment buildings/schools/offices to ensure safety to the p illars. d. The points where they are easily approachable by ro ad e. The points are generally located close to good land marks for easy identification during the course of the project imp lementation. 13. Proposed Survey Methodology a. After testing the various survey methods and based on the analysis of the results of various survey methods, the followin g survey methodology is finalized and adopted. b. In this method the demarcators would use the bromid es in the field and demarcate the boundaries on the bromide prints with narrow tipped high quality pen as shown by the enjoyer in the pre sence of adjacent enjoyers. The same will be transferred onto compute r loaded with digital ortho the same day evening in the Urban cen ter. The Land Parcel Map will be printed and distributed to the Owner of the property on same day evening or on the next day morning. Owners are also invited to view their parcels on the computer if they so de sired. The following were some of the outcomes of using this method. c. Productivity is at 50B80 parcels per day per Team. i. Levels of accuracy were being maintained as the dem arcators themselves were transferring the points to the lapt op. ii. Property owners are able to get the information the y desired by the next morning. iii. If any objections by the Property owner will be rec tified on the same day or next day by revisiting the filed. d. It was therefore decided to refine and further elab orate this method as it seemed the most promising. e. If they noticed any discrepancies in the distribute d LPM. The generated Town/Village maps and LPM will be published in the office of Grampanchayath/Municipality /Municipal Corporation/ Nagar Panchayaths for a specific period. After expire of the period, 9(2) notices along with a copy of LPM will be served to the indi vidual Owner and if any objections are received from the Owners are rec orded. 14. Property Register/Land Register a. The Property information is collected during survey and will be computerized. The columns in Property Register are House No. /by Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 247 Number, Extent (Old), Name of the Owner as per regi ster document , Occupier Name, Plot area and Plinth area as per gr ound position, Tile Number/Chaltha Number, Nature of Land, Premises or unit use, No. floors of building, built up area , Signature of Ow ner, Signature of Surveyor, Remarks. b. The collected Field information will be computerize d as per the format. Both the map and the field register are integrated and stored in GIS format. Which is the flexible tool for querying, re trieving and updating both graphical and textural data. Parcel Maps and T own Maps/Village maps are generated from the created database in the approved templates. 15. Title Enquiry a. The titling under the proposed Act is contemplated as 3 stage process i. After the survey team has prepared survey record th e title team consisting of a Dy.Tahsildar, Revenue Inspector and functionaries from Urban Local Bodies will verify the Property re gister (prepared during survey), the existing registration documents , claims made by the property holders etc. On the basis of this, they will come to a preliminary conclusion and place entire record befo re the Designated Officer for a decision. In this process it is also contemplated to constitute a Dispute Reddressal Com mittee consisting of Town elders and an Adjudication Team consisting of Revenue officers to minimize the disputes. ii. The Designated Officer will be a Revenue officer in the rank of a Deputy Collector. He shall verify the records, come to a conclusion in respect of title of every property and record hi s findings. Wherever there are counter claims and he is not abl e to decide, he shall refer it to the Bhu Bharati Tribunal. The fin dings of the Designated Officer will be recorded in a register c alled \" Provisional Register of Titles (PRT)\" . All the cases referred by him to the Bhu Bharti Tribunal will be recorded in another registe r called 'Register of Disputes (RoD)' . There can be several Designated Officers in the district depending upon the work. iii. Bhu Bharati Tribunal will be consisting of an offic er in the rank of Joint Collector with jurisdiction over entire distr ict. He shall decide the cases referred to him by the Designated Officer s as well as the references filed directly by the landowners against the decision of the Designated Officers. He will give his findings after hearing the concerned parties and looking in to evidence under the summary enquiry process. This officer will be exclusively p osted for this work. iv. Appeals against the orders of the Bhu Bharati Tribu nal will go to an Appellate Tribunal consisting of a judicial officer in the rank of senior Civil Judge (District Judge) posted exclusiv ely for the purpose. He shall hear appeals against the orders o f the Bhu Bharati Tribunal. v. The second appeal against orders of Bhu Bharati App ellate Tribunal shall lie with High Court of Andhra Prades h who will be requested to set up a special bench to hear these a ppeals. vi. Operation of Provisional Register of Titles (PRT) w ill be notified in the Gazette and Bhu Bharati will start operating fr om this date. However the titles will not assume conclusivity und er the PRT. A time of 3 years will be provided for any property h older to make a reference to the Tribunal against an entry in the P RT. If no reference is made within a period of 3 years, all t he entries in the PRT will become final and move to 'Register of Titl es (RT)'. All the Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 248 references and appeals made to the title adjudicati on channels will be recorded in the 'Register of Disputes' and a cor responding mention will be made in the PRT/CRT. The decisions of this channel will also be recorded in the PRT, CRT and R OD. Once an entry is moved to RT it will be conclusive and ther e will be no further challenge. vii. All the disputes pending in various courts will be made compulsorily registerable with the Bhu Bharati. The owners will be on the Plaintiff to register it with the Bhu Bharat i within 60 days of commencement of the PRT in case of existing suits a nd before filing the suit in respect of suits arising later. A corre sponding provision will be made for lapsing of suits for nonBregistrat ion with Bhu Bharati. b. Entries will be made in the 'Register of Disputes' in respect of all the pending suits in various courts with a correspondin g entry in the PRT/RT. c. Bhu Bharati Act will also provide for compulsory re gistration of all the Government transactions on land viz., acquisition, assignments, alienations etc as well as General Powers of Attorn ey, Equitable mortgages and Wills involving immovable properties. d. There will be a Register of Charges/covenant, which will record special charges, covenants, and encumbrances agreed upon by the parties while transferring properties or later. The entries in this register will also be flagged in the PRT/RT. e. In a sense a reading of PRT/RT along with the Regis ter of Disputes and Register of Charges/Covenants will give a complete picture about title of a given property. f. Mutation on transfer of title and conferment of tit le will be automatic. For acquisition of title by succession a provision will be made for compulsory registration of Wills involving immovabl e properties. For the intestate succession, a succession certificate will be granted by the Bhu Bharti authority, which will be valid for all purpo ses. Disputed cases will be decided by the relevant court of law. Appea ls on a succession certificate granted by the Bhu Bharati authority wi ll lie to the District Court. g. The Register so prepared will be linked to the lega l owner through IRIS mapping. IRIS mapping is so far the most foolproof way of personal identification. Integration of record with owner's identity will enable easy verification of identity and helps in ensuring that only the legal owner gets to transact on his/her property, thereby reducing fraudulent transactions and litigation. 16. Application Development The Spatial and attribute data is integrated and a central repository of land information system is developed. An appropriate GIS application will be developed to search, retrieve and manipulate the GI S database and a web based application will be developed to operate from the Service centers and to carryout the transactions. Data Centre and Disas ter Recovery Centre will be setup to store the entire database. The Service centre as connected to the Data Centre through a dedicated internet connection provided by the APAksh Broadband Services. The Data Centre and Disa ster Recovery Centre are connected in asynchronous mode for efficient da ta flow.

BEST PRACTICES IN DEVELOPMENT CONTROL C.Sekhar Reddy Vice President, CREDAI 1. A P Building Rules 2006-a tool for Mass Housing a t an Affordable Price a. Concept of FSI is done away, a revolutionary & succ essful reform postB Indian independence. b. For Buildings whose height is above 5 floors, Govt. has introduced Impact Fee. A winBwin situation. Mass housing at an affordable price, huge source of income to ULB for provision of civic construction and a healthy competition among builders. A level playing field is also created. c. For a given Plot, the height of the building is dec ided with respect to the plot size and the abutting road width. d. Uniform Setbacks for all types of buildings e. Self enforcement: 10% of built up area will be hand ed over to ULB as performance security by an affidavit (at the time o f release of Sanctioned plans). It will be documented in the pro hibitory register and will be released only after obtaining OC. OC proced ure is made simple and easy. f. Built in mechanism against the indiscriminate use o f FSI. Impact Fee is charged higher for top floors, high cost of proport ionate parking floors (in some cases the parking area has to be sold at l oss) & high cost of construction for high rise buildings has to compete against nonB multistoried buildings. Market forces (purchasing c apacity of buyer in that locality)/land value will decide the height of the building/ FSI of a given plot. 2. The Result of Best Practice: a. Built up area is made available at an utmost afford able price when compared to other Metro & II tier Cities. b. Success of self enforcement: As per GHMC survey, 97 % of projects have obtained OC, as compared to pre Building Rules 200 6 era of less than 0.1%. c. Thousands of court cases were pending against the A pplicants before the issue of Buildings Rules d. 2006. But now the number of cases filed in negligib le. e. High density of population will recover the cost of infrastructure within the least f. Period, cost of services per Dwelling Unit / per sf t of built up space will be reasonable. PPP model in civic infrastructure wi ll hence be viable. 3. Auto DCR (on line Approval) b. Cities like Delhi, Thane & Indore have initiated on line approval of Building / Layout permissions c. In Pune, Municipal Corporation, Applicants can subm it plans for approval and start construction upto 75% of permiss ible built up area. Karnataka has also initiated the same policy. d. Bihar government has empanelled the Consultants for approval of Plans e. HMDA has initiated Green Channel for approval of Bu ilding/Layout permissions, within 7 days by out sourcing the empa nelled consultants Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 260 for the scrutiny of title & Town planning norms. GH MC has also announced to implement Green Channel. 4. Land Pooling/Joint Development a. Joint Development Policy adopted by VUDA has been b eneficial for Farmers/Owners and VUDA. a. Fully developed plots of 1800 sq yards per acre of land was given to Farmers and the net realization of 1800 sq yards wa s much higher than the sale of one acre raw land. The response has bee n overwhelming and encouraging. The neighboring owners have volunteere d to part their land for joint development. b. Best practices to be adopted-need for a Comprehensi ve Real Estate Regulation & Development Enabling Act b. GOI has just released Draft Real Estate Regulation & Development Bill 2011, for public comments. If it is implemented, 90 % of self employed/ technocrats/small & medium builders will be out of business and future housing stocks will be reduced to 1/4 th . It will create a huge short fall of housing. Cost of built up area will i ncrease steeply. This bill will become an extra window. c. GOI estimates there is a short fall of 26 million h ouses, whereas experts estimate it is about 40 million units. There is no alignment between Ministries of GOI, State, and ULBs as a result an a pplicant has to approach 40 agencies to get 170 documents for getti ng building permission. Thus confusion is created, there is a d ouble & multiple taxation, no input credit is given, as a result in India an affordable housing is taxed @ about 36%. Under JNNURM reforms, Registration charges have increased to double because of adoptio n of composition scheme. Shelter tax & reservation of EWS & LIG unit s in private sector is most impracticable, no equity, indirect tax, ant i affordable housing and making shelterless middle class employees to pa y for the cross subsidy for EWS & LIG. d. 26 million shelterless people needs a Comprehensive Real Estate Regulation & Development Enabling Act to provide Af fordable Housing, livable cities with proper civic infrastructure and also to take care of: i. Single Window Act for plan approval: Empanel consul tants to issue NOCs, all Central & State Ministries to deleg ate their powers to local bodies for implementation of their stipula tions. Plan approvals to be issued on line and ii. Cap on over all taxation, not to exceed 15%: Collec tion of all charges, Fee, VAT, etc on per SFT of built up area basis by a single agency. Registration Charges (including Stamp Duty, TPT & Fee) not to exceed 3%. Avoid double & multiple tax, allo w input credit. iii. Quality service on time by all the agencies in real estate sector iv. Govt agencies not to sell their properties in publi c auction leading to speculation/inflation and as a result housing be comes unaffordable to people. v. Action against cartalisation of Building materials manufacturers vi. Home loan interest to be made available at reasonab le rate and also housing projects to be funded on priority basi s vii. Promotion of investor friendly policies and develop ment of planned Real Estate sector. viii. Playing a role of Rating agency and safe guard the interest of end user ix. EWS & LIG (up to 60 sq mtrs) housing: with the help GOI/JNNURM/RAY/State funds and part of Impact Fee ( collected for higher FSI) to be utilised to extend affordable EMI (interest rate Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 261 @ 3%, EMI works out to Rs 555/B per month per Lakh) to empower the economical weaker section people to buy dwellin g units as per their choice of location & project. Empanelled cons ultants can approve plans and issue OC. These projects should b e left free from all taxes, fee, VAT, Service tax, Registration Charges etc, NOCs, Land use(except recreation & Water body). The services of promoters of such projects to be recognised and awa rded/honored at state and national level. x. Property Tax to be collected on per sft per year ba sis irrespective of self occupied or rented and citizens can make 'e' p ayments as per built up area owned by them. Only 15 days rent to b e charged towards property tax. xi. Preparation of Master Plans to be based on the Gove rnment's proposed policies to attract investment, expected G DP of city, employment to be created. To encourage walk to work culture, to avoid pollution and traffic issues, integrated Town ship policy to be promoted. Excess supply of residential, commercial, institutional etc land use provision and access (through proposed road network) in Master Plan will bring down the land prices and speculation activities. One of the best examples can be cited a s Outer Ring Road of Hyderabad with connecting Radial roads. xii. Skill Development & Up grading of Construction Work ers, Technicians, Engineers etc xiii. Registration of Sale Deed to be linked to Title gua rantee to safe guard the interest of the citizen TRAI has reduced cell phone tariff from Rs 17 per m inute to 45 paisa, similarly the best practices of Comprehensive Real Estate Regulation & Development Enabling Act must work towards creati ng quality affordable housing for all. *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 262 CHAPTER-XI TRAINING AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT & PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT 1.

Becoming aware of these barriers to effective liste ning can allow you to work towards focusing on the message and the intent ion, rather than on distracters. d. There are five methods to handle conflict: i. Running away ii. Being obliging to the other party iii. Defeating the other party iv. Winning a little/ losing a little v. CoBoperating e. Which method do you typically follow? Use the follo wing chart to list situations in which you use these methods. Flee Oblige Defeat Win/Lose CoFoperate f. Resolving conflict is an art of communication, as a re listening and trying to come to a happy solution for everyone. Ta lk about what is bothering you, listen to the other party's explanat ion, and come to a solution that satisfies both you and the other pers on. This usually works. CoBoperation reduces anger, stress, and frus tration. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 264 7. Working in Teams a. The amount of work to be accomplished in today's wo rk environments has increased about as fast as the technological ad vances have permitted. Since the work to be done is often compl ex, requiring the expertise of several individuals, teams are formed to meet deadlines, project requirements, and budgets. b. Employers greatly value individuals who can work ef fectively in teams because they can i. contribute efficiently to the organization's goals, ii. complete complex projects rapidly, and iii. respect other team members' thoughts and opinions. c. Listen to what people have to say, and help them in any way you can. Communicate ideas at staff meetings even if you hav e not fully thought the ideas through. You may be surprised that with t he ideas and creativity of your coBworkers, your idea can be bro ught to fruition. Consequently, you may be asked to lead a team proje ct; don't hesitate to take charge when appropriate. 8. A Leadership Definition by Ken Valenzuela, BeALeader.Net Chief Editor If you want to do or understand something, you star t by learning what it is. Leadership is no exception. After reading several b ooks on the subject, I think that the best starting definition of leadersh ip you can use is: 9. \"Leadership is the ability of developing and commun icating a vision to a group of people that will make that vision true.\" I know this may sound simplistic but to me is a gre at point to start reviewing and looking to leadership 10. Who's a Leader then? a. Someone who has a vision can communicate it and mak e it happen. I like this definition because is concise and pract ical. Almost everybody understands it and can grasp the essence of leaders hip. b. One of the key concepts behind leadership is ACTION . A leader has to develop a vision, has to communicate it and has to achieve it. Action is in the very essence of the leader's existence. c. In order to achieve the vision (or goal) the leader has to master five practices, as Barry Posner and Jim Kouzes state in \"The Leadership Challenge, 3rd Edition\". The practices are: i. Challenge the Process ii. Inspire a Shared Vision iii. Enable others to act iv. Model the Way v. Encourage the Heart d. In every single practice mentioned there are commit ments that the leader has to work on. i. To Challenge the Process , the leader has to search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow and improve. He has to experiment and take risks consta ntly. ii. To Inspire a Shared Vision , the leader has to evision the future imagining exciting and ennobling possibilities. He also has to enlist others in a common vision by appealing to shared as pirations. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 265 iii. To Enable others to Act , the leader has to foster collaboration promoting cooperative goals and building trust. The leader has to strengthen others by sharing power and discretion. iv. To Model the Way , the leader has to clarify his personal values and set the example aligning actions and shared val ues. v. To Encourage the Heart , the leader has to recognize contributions by showing appreciation for individual excellence. The leader has to celebrate the values and victories by creating a sp irit of community. 11. Credibility a. After twenty years of research Posner & Kouzes foun d that people want leaders who are credible. If there's no credibility there's no leadership. The authors state that credibility is the foundatio n of Leadership. b. They also state that there are four characteristics that a leader must have to be credible: honest, forwardBlooking, compe tent, and inspiring. They found that when there's a high degree of credi bility you can expect to see the following behavior: i. People are proud to tell others they're part of the organization. ii. They feel a strong sense of team spirit. iii. They see their own personal values as consistent wi th those of the organization. iv. Feel attached and committed to the organization. v. Have a sense of ownership of the organization. 12. Leadership and Change a. Leadership is most often recognized where changes t ake place. In changing times, is when leadership or the lack of i t is evident. This opens up the question: Do we need leaders? b. If leadership (or lack of it) is evident in changin g times, then is no surprise that more than ever we need leaders. We ar e living in this fast paced society, with even faster changing habits and trends, with uncertainty all around us. Many great leaders recog nized this lack of leadership in this world, and current events (War c onflicts, Global Warming) make this issue more relevant than ever. 13. A Model for Understanding Leadership Just as I have mentioned, leadership has four eleme nts: Vision, Communication, Achievement, and lying under them is CREDIBILITY. It's impossible to understand or even imaging leadership without any of these. In the next weeks I'll jump into each of the compon ents of Leadership to explain them in detail. 14. Summing up To become a leader, you have to develop a vision, b e able to communicate that vision, and inspire the group you'll work with to achieve it. You must have credibility. You have to build that credibilit y before you can lead. Do not compromise your honesty, be competent in whatev er you do and be aware (forwardBlooking). Change is everywhere, ever yday you must face it and be flexible enough to adapt yourself to lead. 15. Other Definitions for your thought: a. \"Leadership is a relationship between those who asp ire to lead and those who choose to follow\". (Kouzes & Posner, 2002). b. \"Leadership is the ability to step outside the cult ure... to start evolutionary change processes that are more adaptiv e\" (E.H. Schein, 1992) Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 266 c. \"Leadership is the process of making sense of what people are doing together so that people will understand and be comm itted\" (Drath & Palus, 1994) d. \"Leadership is about articulating visions, embodyin g values, and creating the environment within which things can be accompli shed\" (Richards & Engle, 1986) e. \"Leadership is the ability of an individual to infl uence, motivate, and enable others to contribute toward the effectivenes s and success of the organization...\" (House et al., 1999) f. \"Leadership is the ability of developing and commun icating a vision to a group of people that will make that vision tru e\" (Valenzuela, 2007) 16. How to Work in a Team a. Working in a team involves a delicate balance of pe rsonality, expertise, and coBoperation. For a team to function, everyone must keep the best interests of the project, the company, and the team in mind. b. Many factors influence how a team functions: i. Corporate culture and employee morale ii. Management and leadership style iii. Deadlines iv. Scope of the project v. Expertise vi. Other team members c. These variables determine how problems are solved a nd decisions are made, who does the work, and when the outcomes are implemented. More importantly, they often influence how the team members interrelate. NonBverbal cues, such as facial expres sion, gestures, and body language are good indicators of the degree of coBoperation you can expect from every member of the team. d. Here are general tips for helping teams work effect ively: 17. Before the meeting a. Read the agenda the day before the meeting b. Prepare information you will need to provide at the meeting 18. At the meeting a. Always arrive on time b. Take cues from the team leader who usually introduc es topics and keeps the meeting on schedule. c. Listen carefully to ideas presented by all team mem bers d. Participate in brainstorming ideas e. If you don't agree, try to find something positive to say about the idea, then present your opinion in an objective manner f. Take notes and create a personal \"To do\" list 19. Between meetings a. Do the assigned work with the deadlines in mind b. Communicate with relevant team members to sustain t he project momentum and accomplish tasks c. Contact the team leader if you perceive any problem s or issues that can pose a delay to the project. 20. Tips for Public Speaking a. Know the needs of your audience and match your cont ents to their needs. Know your material thoroughly. Put what you have to say in a Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 267 logical sequence. Ensure your speech will be captiv ating to your audience as well as worth their time and attention. b. Practice and rehearse your speech at home or where you can be at ease and comfortable, in front of a mirror, your family, friends or colleagues. Use a tapeBrecorder and listen to yourself. Videota pe your presentation and analyze it. Know what your strong and weak poin ts are. Emphasize your strong points during your presentation. c. When you are presenting in front of an audience, yo u are performing as an actor is on stage. How you are being perceived i s very important. Dress appropriately for the occasion. Be solemn if your topic is serious. Present the desired image to your audience. Look pl easant, enthusiastic, confident, proud, but not arrogant. R emain calm. d. Appear relaxed, even if you feel nervous. Speak slo wly, enunciate clearly, and show appropriate emotion and feeling r elating to your topic. Establish rapport with your audience. Speak to the person farthest away from you to ensure your voice is loud enough t o project to the back of the room. Vary the tone of your voice and d ramatize if necessary. If a microphone is available, adjust and adapt your voice accordingly. e. Body language is important. Standing, walking or mo ving about with appropriate hand gesture or facial expression is pr eferred to sitting down or standing still with head down and reading f rom a prepared speech. Use audioBvisual aids or props for enhancem ent if appropriate and necessary. Master the use of presentation softw are such as PowerPoint well before your presentation. Do not overBdazzle your audience with excessive use of animation, sound cli ps, or gaudy colors which are inappropriate for your topic. Do not tort ure your audience by putting a lengthy document in tiny print on an over head and reading it out to them. f. Speak with conviction as if you really believe in w hat you are saying. Persuade your audience effectively. The material yo u present orally should have the same ingredients as that which are required for a written research paper, i.e. a logical progression from INTRODUCTION (Thesis statement) to BODY (strong supporting arguments, accurate and upBtoBdate information) to CONCLUSION (reBstate thesis, summary, and logical conclusion). g. Do not read from notes for any extended length of t ime although it is quite acceptable to glance at your notes infrequent ly. Speak loudly and clearly. Sound confident. Do not mumble. If you mad e an error, correct it, and continue. No need to make excuses or apolog ize profusely. h. Maintain sincere eye contact with your audience. Us e the 3Bsecond method, e.g. look straight into the eyes of a perso n in the audience for 3 seconds at a time. Have direct eye contact with a n umber of people in the audience, and every now and then glance at the whole audience while speaking. Use your eye contact to make everyo ne in your audience feel involved. i. Speak to your audience, listen to their questions, respond to their reactions, adjust and adapt. If what you have prepa red is obviously not getting across to your audience, change your strate gy midBstream if you are well prepared to do so. Remember that communica tion is the key to a successful presentation. If you are short of time , know what can be safely left out. If you have extra time, know what could be effectively added. Always be prepared for the unexpected. Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 268 j. Pause. Allow yourself and your audience a little ti me to reflect and think. Don't race through your presentation and lea ve your audience, as well as yourself, feeling out of breath. k. Add humor whenever appropriate and possible. Keep a udience interested throughout your entire presentation. Rem ember that an interesting speech makes time fly, but a boring spe ech is always too long to endure even if the presentation time is the same. l. When using audioBvisual aids to enhance your presen tation, be sure all necessary equipment is set up and in good working o rder prior to the presentation. If possible, have an emergency backup system readily available. Check out the location ahead of time to ensure seating arrangements for audience, whiteboard, blackboard, lighting, location of projection screen, sound system, etc. are suitab le for your presentation. m. Have handouts ready and give them out at the approp riate time. Tell audience ahead of time that you will be giving out an outline of your presentation so that they will not waste time takin g unnecessary notes during your presentation. n. Know when to STOP talking. Use a timer or the micro wave oven clock to time your presentation when preparing it at home. J ust as you don't use unnecessary words in your written paper, you do n't bore your audience with repetitious or unnecessary words in y our oral presentation. To end your presentation, summarize y our main points in the same way as you normally do in the CONCLUSION o f a written paper. Remember, however, that there is a differenc e between spoken words appropriate for the ear and formally written words intended for reading. Terminate your presentation with an intere sting remark or an appropriate punch line. Leave your listeners with a positive impression and a sense of completion. Do not belabor your clos ing remarks. Thank your audience and sit down. o. Have the written portion of your assignment or repo rt ready for your instructor if required. *** Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 269 2. TIME MANAGEMENT [Extracted from 'Handbook on Time Management Skills ' developed by CGG, Hyderabad] Understanding Time Management \"We all have time to either spend or waste and it i s our decision what to do with it. But once passed, it is gone forever.\" h Bruce Lee (\"Zen in the Martial Arts\" by Joe Hyams) Every individual on earth has the same amount of ti me B 60 seconds in a minute; 60 minutes in an hour; 1,440 minutes in a d ay; and 525,600 minutes in a year. While a vast majority of people confesses f altering to come to grips with it, extremely few can claim to have made the most o f it. How is it that they have got it all done? It's because they have managed a w ay to figure out how to manage their time effectively. Internationally known authority on time management Dr. Alec Mackenzie in his book 'The Time Trap' argues that the very idea of t ime management is a misnomer because one really cannot manage time in t he way other resources can be managed: Time cannot be manipulated. Dr. Mackenzie contends that when it comes to time, one can only manage oneself in relation to it . One cannot control time as one can control other resources - one can only cont rol how one uses it. In the world in which we live, time cannot be replaced or reBcreated. It is therefore not for us to choose whether we spend or save time but to choose only how we spend it. How much time do you spend each day on the followin g time stealers? Watching TV Reading Newspapers / Magazines excessively Idle chat, gossip and telephonic talk Opening and sorting mail Returning telephone calls Meetings Paying bills DayBdreaming Fretting over personal problems Caught in traffic snarls Planning how to change things Waiting for things to happen Taking naps Eating snacks between meals Drinking Smoking Shopping Wagering money Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 270 How can you get an extra hour out of each day? Here are some tips to help you squeeze those extra minutes out of your day. Of course, you can adapt these so that they will fit i n with your situation. 1. Get up earlier 2. Watch less TV (I mean how many Law & Order spinoffs does one need to watch?) 3. Avoid allowing others to waste your time 4. If you don't have to drive to work, use that time t o study or plan. If you do drive to work listen to a motivational tape on the way to work instead of that mindless dj talk. 5. Organize your work; do it systematically. 6. Make creative use of lunchtime. 7. Delegate authority if, possible. 8. Spend less time on unimportant phone calls. 9. Think first, and then do the task. 10. Do what you dream about doing, instead of just drea ming about it. 11. Work hardest when you're the most mentally alert 12. Eliminate activities that make the smallest contrib utions to your life. 13. Always do the toughest jobs first. 14. Before each major act ask, \"Is this really necessar y?\" 15. Choose interesting and constructive literature for spare time reading. 16. Learn how to sleep. Sleep soundly, then work refres hed. 17. Skip desserts. 18. Stop smoking. 19. Write notes or letters while waiting for others. 20. Always carry an envelope with paper in it and a few stamps. 21. Combine tasks that are done in the same area. 22. Be prompt for all appointments. 23. Lay out your clothes the night before.(I need to re member this myself) 24. Call on specialists to do work that you cannot do e fficiently 25. Learn to read more rapidly. 26. Take a nap after dinner. Then take a shower. Begin the evening hours relaxed and refreshed. 27. Avoid interruptions. 28. Avoid making a big production out of tiny tasks. 29. Search out job shortcuts. 30. Know your limitations. 31. Work to your full capacity. I know it's tough to br eak bad habits. However, it Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 271 is necessary to make sacrifices so that your busine ss can be successful. Don't try to implement all of these ideas at once. Implement them one at a time and repeat them until they become a part of your da ily routine. Source: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=DeAnna_Spe ncer Time management expert Alec Mackenzie in 'The Time Trap' narrates an anecdote that underscores the importance of priorit izing activities. As the story goes, an efficiency consultant by the name of Ivy Lee was meeting with the president of a large steel mill. The presi dent, one Charles Schwab, was interested to find out how he could increase perfor mance. Lee was telling Schwab how he could provide him with advice to bett er manage the company. Schwab, however, was not interested because he did not want more knowledge. Instead, he wanted to find out how to get more done within available time, and he was willing to pay anything within reason for su ch advice. Lee said that he could help him increase his efficiency by at least 50% provided he could have about 20 minutes of his time. After Schwab consented, Lee gave him a blank piece of paper and told him to write down the six most important things he wanted to accomplish tomorrow. Schwab thought about it and completed the task in a bout three minutes. Then Lee instructed him to order these things from most important to least important. That, too, took very little time. Now the executive was instructed to keep the list until the following morning, at which time he was a sked to look at the first item and to start working on it until it was completed. After that he was told to work on task number two and so on until the end of the d ay. Lee further advised Schwab not to worry about those tasks that he could not get done, since it didn't matter because they would not have gotten done anyw ay. Then Schwab was asked to repeat this process every working day. Lee then told him to try this system as long as he likes. Lee als o asked Schwab to have his employees try this system and, if it worked, to sen d him a cheque for whatever the idea was worth to him and the company. After se veral months, Lee received a cheque for $25,000 and a letter in which Schwab sai d that this was one of the most profitable ideas that he had ever been taught. It is further reputed that the consistent application of this strategy helped to t urn this small steel mill into Bethlehem Steel. Managers must realize that they cannot simply do ta sk or activity they take up. Given the constraints of time and resources, they h ave to be selective and consciously choose to spend time on what is most im portant to them. They have to keep in mind is that whenever they start an acti vity or task, they are inevitably ruling out everything else they could ha ve done with that time. Which of the following Time Enhancers have you trie d lately? Listen to radio and TV news shows to keep up on the latest news; this should enable you to skim through newspapers and magazines . Limit recreational TV watching to one hour a day. Limit all casual, idle, or gossip chatter to five m inutes. Open and sort through mail as soon as it arrives at your desk or home; handle each piece only once. Using the \"automatic dialing and redial'' telephone to speed up making and Andhra Pradesh Town & Country Planning Training Man ual Directorate of Town & Country Planning 272 returning phone recalls. Use a timer to help you limit phone calls to less t han five minutes. Hold as few meetings as possible; use an agenda and stick to it; limit the time to no more than one hour for each meeting. Pay each bill on the day it arrives in the mail, ke eping the entries in your checkbook accurate and up to date. Use daydreaming as a form of stress release or rela xation, and limit it to a total of fifteen minutes per day. Get professional help for personal problems if you find thinking about them occupies a lot of your free time. Use a tape recorder with ear phones to listen to mo tivational tapes, relaxation tapes, or soft relaxing music when in traffic or on a commuter bus, train, plane, etc. Use a daily schedule book or \"date minder\" to creat e a log of scheduled activities to help you review your success at manag ing your time. Bring books and mail to read or a tape recorder to listen to when you have appointments where you know you will be waiting for a length of time. Eliminate naps and extend your nightly sleep time o r increase your daily exercise schedule to increase your energy level. Eliminate snacking between meals; eat three balance d meals a day Give up smoking (cigarettes, cigars or pipes). Give up the need for a \"quick one'' at your local b ar, tavern, or lounge. Exchange alcoholic consumption time for exercise or some other time enhancer. Go shopping with a list, stick to the list, and lea ve when you have completed your list. Avoid browsing shopping unless it is a planned soci al, couple, or family shopping activity. Find alternative leisure activities that require no betting of legal tender. It is said that time and tide waits for none so our attempts would be to make the best use of time and prevent others from wasting ou r time too. So be wise in managing your time.
