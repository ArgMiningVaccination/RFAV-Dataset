Boost Your Immune System with Herbs Boost your immune system with herbs. Adaptogenic herbs are essential for helping protect the body from cancer, according to Donald Yance, Jr., author of Herbal Medicine, Healing & Cancer (Keats, 1999) and a certified nutritionist and clinical herbalist in Ashland, Oregon. \"Adaptogenic herbs are the most effective way of protecting the body from the stressors that cause cellular damage,\" Yance says. Take one or more of these protective herbs daily: Ashwaganda (Withania somnifera) is one of the most important herbal tonics in Ayurvedic medicine. Often referred to as \"Indian ginseng,\" ashwaganda strengthens overall vitality and has been shown in studies to have immune-enhancing and anticancer effects. Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is used in Chinese medicine to strengthen the protective energy of the body. Clinical studies show astragalus stimulates white blood cell activity and increases the production of interferon, both vital components of the immune system. Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus), also called Siberian ginseng, increases endurance for both physical and mental tasks. Many studies have shown the herb increases resistance to stress; it helps neutralize free radicals, enhances immune function and strengthens the adrenal glands to better cope with stress. Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) helps the body adapt more easily to physical and emotional stressors by strengthening the functioning of the hormonal system, especially the adrenal glands. Ginseng also has been shown to have immune-enhancing and anticancer properties. Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis) has been valued for centuries in Chinese medicine for its adaptogenic properties. It improves both physical and mental functioning; it also protects against cellular damage and enhances detoxification.
