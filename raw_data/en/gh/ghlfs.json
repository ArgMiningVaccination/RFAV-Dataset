In fact, homeopathy is an important part of the healthcare systems of many major industrialized nations - including most of Western Europe. What's more, there are at least 70 hospitals in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, Spain and the U.K. actively integrating homeopathy into patient care (see attached list). Homeopathy is also actively practiced by physicians in 40 out of 42 European nations. There are also hundreds of hospitals in south Asia - India in particular - that integrate homeopathy into patient care. It should be noted that in all comparative effectiveness studies of homeopathy, its integration into health care resulted in better outcomes for patients with improved safety. Those that included cost-effectiveness analysis showed no additional cost or reduced costs. A recent economic analysis of the French healthcare system (ranked #1 in the world by the World Health Organization) produced data that examined three types of cost: consultation, prescription and total costs. Overall health expenditure was 20% less for patients consulting homeopathic family physicians in France compared to conventional family physicians ($78.70 US vs. $98.91 US). The lower cost of medical prescriptions for homeopathic family physicians was partially offset by higher consultation costs. Homeopathic physicians prescribed far fewer potentially hazardous drugs including psychotropics, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.2 How can the U.S. begin to get healthcare costs under control while better managing problems like pain management and the end of the antibiotic era? We can do like the rest of the industrialized world - and bring homeopathy into our hospital systems as an adjunct system of care.

Homeopathy is inexpensive, effective, and inherently safe. When properly utilized, homeopathy makes it possible to make what already exists currently in the conventional health care system, more effective. For example, homeopathy makes it possible to avoid overuse of antibiotics, reserving antibiotics for when they are actually needed. Homeopathy also reduces the need to rely on dangerous and addictive painkillers in various situations including postoperatively, and after injury. Among many other benefits, homeopathy also helps reduce the incidence of polypharmacy. Positive results such as these are achieved because homeopathy is a well-developed system of individualized medicine.. Those who use homeopathy consider it a \"designer\" medicine, customized to their specific needs. We are concerned that the proposed Draft Guidance on homeopathy will undermine the right of individuals to choose homeopathy, and also undermine the very important role homeopathy has to play in addressing these health problems. This paper gives an example of how homeopathy can address serious problems in our current healthcare system - specifically the issue of highly addictive pain medications and their overuse. It is important that FDA actions strengthen rather than undermine homeopathy so that it can meaningfully contribute to and support the American healthcare system. "}
