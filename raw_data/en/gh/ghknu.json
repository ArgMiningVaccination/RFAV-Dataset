The author recognises that many individuals who suffer TBI now surviv e although the nature of the disabilit y has serious implications for thei r immediate family. Hence, the focus is on service provision for individuals wit h traumatic brain injuries and their carers. The general thrust of the argument is that services for individuals are patchy and services for carers are patchier still. Given that the results were obtained from a self-completed survey of departments the view s of carers are not obviousl y present . For example, although a ll departments surveyed claimed to have respite facilities available for carers only a quarter could provide a contact name. This leads to the conclus ion that such services are aspirational rather than actual. The report suggests that on the evidenc e provided serv ices for individuals with TBI and their fami lies are not seen as a priority area. To address this it recommends that departments use an additional class ification to accommodate the needs of TBI sufferers and their fami lies. 5Author/s Chesson, R., Maehle, V., Wardell, F.

At home with family Personality changes, and cognitive disabilit y harder to deal with than physic al impairments. Grief for \"lost\" child. These are the least \"visible\" effects of BI but the 17hardest to deal with and the ones which loc al services tended to offer least help with (in the view of families). Areas of conflict: disagreements about leve ls of autonomy; probl ems of trying not to upset person \"walking on eggs hells\"; abus e and ill te mper, anger , frustration of person with BI.

Chapter 16, 'Outline of Prof essional Help', reviews help that is available from (1) the NH S and (2) social servic es departments. It is very factual, concentrating on information about the ro les of different professionals and how they might help sufferers and their carers. It also includes telephone numbers for organisations to contact for advice on professional help. I do not think this is the sort of informati on that the review is look ing for. Chapter 26, Patients' and Carers' Rights, contains information about sufferers' basic NHS rights to health and social se rvices, mentioning relevant pieces of legislation e.g. the Chronically Sick and Dis abled Person's Act 1970 and the Disabled Person's (Services, Consulta tion & Represent ation) Act 1986.

Lack of knowledge about spinal inj ury among professional s outside specialist facilities eg those in receiving ho spitals (A&E). Views of Stoke Mandeville generally v. positive. Avai lability of some accommodation for relati ves valued. Howev er some reservations about: blunt delivery of negative prognosis; visiting times precluded contact with medical staff which carers would hav e valued; limited interactions with social workers (though so me were experienced as supportive); Some kind of keyworker approach advocated - (I don't know if they do this now, they may d o.) Also would have liked a system of case c onferences - don't know if they do thi s now either. Howev er someone wit h whom relatives could have a continuous r elations hip while person in hospital would be valued. Unquestioning assumption by professi onals that carers would assume responsibility for care, not liked. Teachin g sessions re physical care were, if they happened at all, generally too little too late. Sensitive negotiation of caring activities 23needed. Bowel evac uations a problem whic h should be openly but sensitively discussed, and taught to those who were going to do it. 2/3 rated info provision inadequate. La ck of information on benefits, services, physica l/emotional im pacts of injury. Ditto sexu ality and fertility. Some would have liked acces s to counselling - or someone to talk to. (subsequently the hospital has introduced relatives days which were val ued by those who had been to them, but seen as not enough - trying to do too much and not enough recognition of differences between patients and t hus caring responsibilities.) Post discharge Having to change their role. Extent and meaning of role change influences how people perceive (feel about) their lives. Important to under stand experience of individual in context of their social env ironm ent. Conceptual framework helps to suggest explanations for some of the reported variability in responses. Number of physical caring tasks perfo rmed tended to decrease over time (compared with immediate pos t discharge) except aid with bowel management and \"organisational\" management. Also decreases in % reporting disturbed sleep (1 in 4 at most). Decline in leisure and social activ ities outside the home (major ity). Inaccessible buildings one reason, along with lack of toilets suitable for disabled people. Holidays problematic. Many felt initially unprepared for extent of care which would be required. However just over half said the amount had decreased since dis charge. Uncertainty over how much the person s hould be expec ted to do for themselves a problem for carers. Malaise Inventory Scores indicativ e of nos. of symptoms outsi de the normal range. \"A number\" expressed desire for counselli ng. A few had paid priv ately for it. Some worries about the future and own ageing. Concern about keeping up c are among those who were older. Most felt there had not been negative effects on children or siblings. Generally not an expectation that th ey would help wit h care, though they did some tasks they might otherwise not have done. Sometimes benefits from e.g. father being around more. 24 On the whole people reported the quality of the relationship with their injured spouse to be unchanged, though there were a few reports of deterioration, and a few of improvement. Carers get the brunt of any emot ional outbur sts/frustration etc. Parents caring support each other (mostly) Role cha nge: this study include d wives only, no husbands. Half took on more house maintenance, car maintenance etc. A few of the husbands (with SCI) did more childc are than they had before. How much this mattered depended on how rigid gender divisions had been before and w hat kind of expectations prevailed in the social e nvironment. Carers comm ented on need to be aware o f the possibility of taking over too much. Parents felt less role change but some had anticipated changes in retirement l ike greater freedom and more breaks which they now did not get. Informal networks generally important source s of help/support. Public ignorance of spinal injury a problem. Relativ es usua lly have no real idea what is involved.

The authors claim from t he literature that inhab itants of rural areas have more long -term illness than their urban counterparts. They also have fewer se rvices and where these exist they are morel likely to be refused in pref erence to informal arrangements. This clearly places more burden of care on family members. The study aimed to describe the overall le vels of social support available, to describe the sources of this suppor t and to examine any apparent gender differences. Data was derived from a secondary study and 303 indiv iduals (the well partner) responded to a mailed questionnair e. Findings were tabulated and compared with findings from other samples. From this it becomes apparent that:- \u00be Rural care-givers report the lowe st levels of perceived support \u00be Rural care-givers have very similar resources in terms of numbers o f people they could turn to as were reported elsewhere \u00be Rural care-givers are more likely to use friends and neighbours as sources of support. When considering the impac t of gender on the sample it was found that:- \u00be Women with ill spous es repor ted higher leve ls of social support than vice- versa 27\u00be Men with ill spouses reported that t hey preferred to rely on their own devices \u00be Neighbours were used as resources more by women with ill spous es than vice-versa \u00be Religion was reported as a source of strength more by women than by men The authors conclude that pr ofessional support services ought to be aware of the relianc e on friends and neighbours by those in rural environments when targeting their interventions. 28 Author/s Brown, J.B.

Given the design of the study any carer views elic ited must be treated with caution as they are not necessarily representative of the caring exper ience per se but more of the experience of an ethnic minority receivi ng potentially ine quitable treatment within an institutionally racist environment. In this case, the condition (CP) may be incidental to the broader agenda. To generate data interviews were carried out with variety of health professional as well as with 20 South Asian carers. However, it should be noted that, 'this paper draws heav ily, though not exclus ively on the data from service professionals '. In this detail the impact of carer views is further diluted. To justify their investigat ion the authors point to a hi gher incidence of CP in South Asian communities and a lack of k nowledge about the needs of carers. The higher incidence is never fully explained although concluding remarks refer to a medical focus on genetic causes of CP which seems to conflict with carers views who see poor medical care as signific ant in the condition. This is a major point that needs much fuller consideration. 36Ultimately the politic al and policy oriented nature of the piece obsc ures the voice of carers. 37 Author/s Mapp Ref No CA00 56 Title (first 4 w ords) A world apart Year of publication 1995 Research methods Quantitative Q ualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (USA) User's Long Term Condition Brain Injur y Confidence Rating High Medium Low N/A Review er's initials HR Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : This is a discussion article whic h quotes a director of Headway who reports that relatives of people with head injury report the ten most difficult problems after head injury are: personality changes, slowness, poo r memory, i rritability, bad temper, tiredness, depression, rapi d mood changes, tension and anxiety, threats of violence. 38 Author/s Cheeson, R.

Efforts were made to recruit carers below retirement age. Sample was somewhat skewed, in sense that many carers recruited through the MS Society. Also interviewees were a selective group in that they volunteered so might not be ty pical of carers of people with MS. Research undertaken in Scotland: Aberdeen, Argyle and Clyde, Edinburgh and Orkey (nb: different legislation in Scotland, e.g. Community Care and Health (Sc otland) Bill. Key findings relating to use of health and social care services were: In most cases, services provi ded only where the person with MS was highly dependent, and in several cases services had only been recently provided. Some carers reported paying for help with housework; this applied to households were levels of disability were lower. Few carers indicated that comprehensive packages of care, including health and social care, were in place. Main issues related to delays in services being provided, the need for information and difficulties in acce ssing services and allowances. Carers would have welcomed a more proactive approac h on the part of service providers, as they or the person they cared for had been reluctant to seek help. 39 Carers described feeling 'abandoned' at the time of diagnosis, even though they felt that their lives were affected too. Over two-thirds reported a lack of information at this critical point. Information was required on: benefits, housing adaptations, equipment, relevant services, the disease it self, coping strategies. Some carers reported a need for em otional s upport and counselling. Several carers suggested that heal th professionals lac ked knowledge of MS. Needs relating to housework and personal care were more likely to be met than those of a psyc hological nature. It appeared from the interviews that carers were more likely to feel 'on top of the situation' and less likely t highli ght they own unmet psychological needs where services were in place. Several carers rated services very highly. Occupational therapists were often identified as particularly helpful. Even wher e regular help was obtained, carers often pr ovided considerable assistance themselves and/or paid for additional se rvices (e.g. cleaning) or items of equipment (e.g. one carer/patient contributed \u00a33,500 to a special showed; council paid anot her \u00a32,000; other items includ ed an 'elect ric' bed and transport/paying for taxis). Carers in Orkney were unusual in ex press ing high lev els of satisfacti on with services, especially in relation to the integration of health and social care services About two-thirds of interview ees had specially adapted bathrooms and modifications (grab rai ls or ramps ). Carers expressed dissatisfaction wit h respite care. It w as seen as unsuitable for care reci pients, who were then unhappy (and so were carers), one got an infection whilst using hospital respite facilities and came out 'worse than he went in'. Ot her criticisms included that respite was boring, with little stimul ation or activities. Author was surprised to find that care rs had low lev els of contact with the voluntary sector, even though many recr uited through the MS Society. The only other organisation commonly referred to was Crossroads. Crossroads was seen to be fulfillin g an important ro le in service provision, but not perceived as providin g emotiona l support for the carer or as fulfilling advocac y or lobbying functions. Organisations such as Carers Scotland , the Coalition of Carers or the Princess Royal Trust for Carers were little mention ed. Neither did carers tend to visit/use carers' centres and speak with staff there. 40 Author/s Robinson, I. and Hunter, M.

The concluding section (Section 5) of this second report is a rewritten version on one section from the first r eport, and the reader is told that it needs to be read in conjunction with both repor ts. Section 5 of the pr esent report refers to tables and figures which do not seem to be included in the document. Data gathering for the present report i nvolved a range of methods: focus groups, critical incident analys is; and the Delphi technique. Information was collected in six different areas of the country from people with MS, their carers and professionals. The following iss ues are discussed in the report. Male carers have particular diffic ulty in convincing professional staff (social services and nurses, for ex ample) of their competence in relation to domestic and personal care . Carers face a more general problem in convinc ing professional staff of that they have their own particular expertise based on experience. The impression of many carers is t hat, in most of their contacts with service providers, the main aim appears to be to prevent them from getting the services, aids and ada ptations needed, even though they also appear to be eligible for the m. There is too much 'battling with bureaucrac y'. There are major co -ordination problems within and between health and social servic es. Services often appear to lack the 'common sense' needed to be able to adapt rules and procedures to the everyday needs of carers There is concern about the in creasing discrepancy between the rhetoric of ' patient care' delivered th rough 'patient's or client's charters' 41and what many carers experienc e in practical terms as a worse service on the ground, e.g. services, and access to those services, has not changed at all, and in resource te rms might even have become worse. 'Out of hours' services can be ve ry poor, yet MS and its problems are experienced 24 hours a day and have to be managed on that basis. Finding an advocate is often seen as the only way through the system, but it is not always pos sible to find one who supports carers' views rather than their own. Respite care is often welcomed in principle, but is a double edged sword in practice as concerns are expressed about the nature and quality of care in these settings. Carers might wish to join the person with MS in respite care and share the 'break', but this often proves di fficult or impossible, which can put an additional strain on an already stressed relations hip. Day care may be undertaken as a 'warehous ing' process for people with MS. S taff qualific ations, expe rience and commitment may be very low, especially in som e local auth ority day care centres. Medical and health problems may not be recognised or managed effectively in day centres. There can be major problems when younger people with MS are mixed with older e lderly peop le in respite care facilities. Carers can feel forced into seekin g long-term residential care because of the lack of (modest) additional serv ices in the community, resulting in a signific ant breakdown in the relationship and much extra public cost. Information needs are one of the mo st substantial and long term needs of carers. The communication proc ess at the time of diagnosis is particularly important, and it is not hel pful if doctors are over-protective and reluctant to give the diagnosis at an earl y stage, or communica te it in such euphemistic terms that th e carers (and patient) do not know what has been communicated. A fast track to relevant information is important at this early critical stage, as it can impact on the whole process of dealing wit h MS in the first few months, and possibly the first few years. Carers wanted accessible and relevant guidance and support independently of governm ent agencies, healt h trusts and authorities. Greater attention needs to be pai d to establishing a standard and supportive information system at the time of diagnosis. Community 42based systems of info rmation are very patch y and subject to change through changing policies and resource allocations. Male carers often felt that support groups and similar activities were not for them. They wanted immediate and practical help and a break from MS, rather than to keep talking about the disease and associated problems and issues. The value of counselling was questionabl e. For the most part, carers' immediate concerns were very practical. Many carers managed dealing wit h the problems and issues of MS through informal channels and proces ses, rather than through the more formal structure of counselling that many pr ofessionals see as a key first requirement . 43 Author/s MS Society (Foley F. the author) Ref No CA00 67 Title (first 4 w ords) Relationships and intimacy: the..

Well designed and exec uted, but findings can not be generalised to the general population of carers of people in H.K. because of: No control group of non carers; Sample drawn from a support group and questionnaires completed by people supporting members to a hos pital/support facility; Homogeneity among carer group - all commi tted to caring for the person with epilepsy hence no less well adjust ed indiv iduals in the sample; Small sample size (65) The study used rating scales of mood, qual ity of life and intensity of epileptic and psychosocial variables. About half of participant carers reporte d experienc ing less satisfactory psyc hosocial adjustment than the general population. 22% had severe levels of anxiet y and 14% severe levels of depression; 75% had below average scores on the quality of life measure. Contrary to findings of previous studies , care-givers of people with additional illnesses or learning disabilities were not more distressed than care-givers of people with epilepsy only. About 50% of carers reported receivin g adequate levels of support - mainly from families but also from agencies. The latter contradicts the common belief that Asian families are reluctant to accept support due to the association between dependency and shame. 51Factors positively ass ociated wit h carers ' well-being and qual ity of life were: perceived level of support; and participation in social and leisure ac tivities in the absence of the patient.

Da te were then subject to statistical manipulation. From thi s the following results are available:- \u00be The majority of the relative s endorse positive experienc es \u00be Most frequently reported concerns were around fear of t he future, stress associated with caring and financial worries. Cautions Less stress was identified in this study . The authors believe that this may be due to the severity off the TBI in the study or a lack of sensitivity in the instruments measuring stress. The sampling may also have influenced the overall reporting of positive experiences. The relatively early timeframe also s uggests that a longitudinal study could reveal different results. The lifestyle of the TB I indi vidual pre-injury also s eems to affect the outcome for the S O who report more negative ex periences where the TBI patient had a troubled history.

The chosen method was a postal ques tionnaire asking for completion of the Virginia Traumatic Brain Injury Fami ly Needs Assessment Survey . This was sent to people identified via the 1995 - 1997 records of the Virgin ia Brain Injury Central Re gistry. The study reports diminished quality of life among care-givers after four years, compared to before the injury. Un met needs persist and the authors claim that these have changed, t hough this is based on the per ception that the rank ordering of needs differs in important respects from that found in studies conducted shortly after the injury - this wa s a cross-sectional study . After four years Health Information (51.4%) and Involvement with Care (47.9%) needs were most often rated as met. Instrumental Support (31.5%) and Profession al Support (28.3%) were most often rated as not met. The authors use their findings that care rs quality of life declines ov er time, while needs change to signal the importanc e of professionals recognis ing and responding to such longer term issues. However, as they acknowledge the study has limitations which call the robus tness of their findings into question: - small (57) and self-selecting sample - unverifiable (sent and returned by mail) questionnaires - brevity of the qualit y of life assessment In addition, the study's cross-secti onal design means that change in needs over time w as inferred, rat her than directly observed. 78Author/s Tyerman, Booth Ref No CA01 38 Title (first 4 w ords) Family Interventions after Traumatic Year of publication Research methods Quantitative Q ualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (USA) User's Long Term Condition Brain Injur y Confidence Rating High Medium Low N/A Review er's initials HR Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : This article is a review of a how a community service in the UK provides family services to famil ies affected by TBI to help manage the disruption and distress families ' experience.

Pr ogrammes varied from behaviour al to cognitive interventions to help carers adjust to particular problem behaviours in the brain injured person. Only one study used standard ass essment tools. The remainder used a variety of methods including self -repor t measures and interviews. All interventions were reported as beneficial to carers. Overall the studies reviewed were f ound to be limited by biased sam pling, non-standardised outcome measures, us ing subjective methodologies and a lack of control samples .

It claims to be the fi rst study of this population to conduct formal psychiat ric evaluations using clinician- administer ed structured diagnos tic interview methods. The bulk of findings reported relate to the service user and reveal 's triking' findings which contradict the commonly held view that rates of clinical depression among this group are much higher than in the general population, and increase with progre ssive deterioration. In relation to care-givers, tw o important findings are flagged. First, care-givers were as likely to be clinically depressed as patients - and access to psychiatric treatment se emed to be inversely related to care-giver burden. Secondly, perceived c are-giver burden was positively associated (counter- intuitively) with finding positive meaning in care-giving. (The suggestion is made that, with increasi ng burden the impulse to find meaning gr ows.) There is also an important finding on the high concordance of distress between patients and care-givers. Taken together, these findings lead the authors to point to the importance of responding to psychological distress/depre ssion in care-givers, not only for 88their own sakes but because this may lead to improvement in the mental health of the patient. This is a well-conducted explorat ory study. Howev er significant weaknesses include: Sample recruitment - the ma jority were participating in a trial at a clin ical facility, which might either select more optimistic patients or affect their spirits Patient characteristics - most were mobile Self-selection for the study - more opt imistic patients might have agreed to participate Small num bers - 56 patients and 31 care-givers. 89 Author/s Kosciulek, J.F.

The results indicate bo th stability in coping p atterns and change over time. Consistenc y was found in relation to one broad dimension, which reflected cognitive v ersus behavioural coping. In relation to the second broad dimension change was found - fr om brain injury - focused coping to family to community fit at time one, to seeking professional help versus intra-family coping at time two.

It further recognises the stresses that family members suffer in this role and sets out to test two methods of offering educ ation and support: the traditional on-site, face-to-face intervention and the telephone support group. A quasi-experimental design com paring two group types (telephone n=52 and face-to-face N=39) across time (9-10 w eeks per group over two years). Three psychometric tools were used to test the mood profile of participants who were caring for an adult with a brain injury on a before during and after basis. The areas addressed were family func tion, care-giver burden and care-giver distress. The highly technical nature of this study means that carer experience is heavily mediated by the statistical analys es. Four hypotheses were advanced. 1 participation will hav e a posit ive impact on family function 2 participation will produce r eduction in care-giving burden 3 participation will reduce care-giver distress 4 participa nts will rep ort similar leve ls of satisfaction with the group experience On point one the FAD (60 item self -assessment checklist) was used to determine family function. There was no significant difference between 95telephone groups (TG) and on-site gr oups (OG) though both groups scored well when compared with non-clinical groups. On point two the Care Burden Inventory showed that TG reported signific antly lower levels of stress and this was maintained over time. Point three; the OG again reported mo re distress than the TG. However, across time both groups reported a r eduction in distress, even when measured against deterioration in the condition of the i njured person. Point four; high lev els of satisfacti on were reported by both groups with TG showing slightly better completion and attendance. For rural dwellers it appears that a telephone support group can be as effective as face-to-face intervention. It is als o very cost-effective. The authors want to see more research on why rural groups are apparently so self-sufficient (see CA020). 96 Author/s Perlesz et al Ref No CA01 68 Title (first 4 w ords) Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury Year of publication 1999 Research methods Quantitative Qualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (USA) User's Long Term Condition Traumatic Brain Injury Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials HA Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : Unsure about the robustness of this lit erature review; no details whatsoever are given about the basis on whic h the 37 studies inc luded in the review were selected. The review focuses on relatives' stress and burden, and how researchers have gathered and presented their outcome data. It does not discuss carers' exper iences of health and social care services. Authors include cross-sectional studi es identifying high levels of distress in relatives of people with TBI, as well as longitudinal re search tracking relatives' responses for up to 20 years, giving a slightly mo re comprehensive picture of outcome. Whilst some studies report that s pouses and parents do not exper ience signific antly different l evels of stress and burden in caring for a partner or adult child with TBI, many authors continue to suggest that care-giving spouses in TBI populat ions are at great er risk for distre ss than care-giving parents. There is a short discussion of different family assessment measures used by TBI researchers, and thei r respective reported strengths and weakness es. In the concluding s ection, the authors state that the findings from the studies inc luded in the revi ew confirm that TBI can have a negative impact on family members, however it is pertinent to note that not all families and family members are necessarily affected in this way. 97 Author/s Holland D. and Shigak i C.

Caseness via DIS-R diagnostic interview About 1 in 3 indiv iduals were depressed at both points 44% depressed at neither point. (time since injury 2 to 72 months) Best (in fact only significant) predictor of depression was a previous (prior to injury) depressive episode. No relation ship with time since injury or severity of inju ry No differences between spouse and parent ca re-givers - possibilit y of a difference had been predicted Reports that past research demonstrates: 'Personalit y changes and decreased emoti onal control appear to cause greater distress in family members than ph ysical or cognitive limitations.' Howev er care-giver reports of 'changes in inhibitory control and emotional changes ' weren't predictive of depression either. Therefore one can't rule out the possib ility that high rates of prevalence of depression among care-givers of people who experienc e TBI are a reflection of the fact that people who exper ience TBI tend to have relatives who are depressed anyway. This is possible, they argue, given evidenc e that men with alcohol dependence or antisocial per sonality are over-represented among those who 101experience TBI, and other evidence shows that males with these characteristics have an inc reased incidence of depressed fema le relatives. Quite a few complex methodological iss ues here but certainly poses some interesting questions about received wisdom. 102 Author/s Hickey, A.M. et al Ref No CA01 79 Title (first 4 w ords) The relationship between post-trauma...

The study was well designed and conduct ed but its quality is compromised in the following respects: - its internal valid ity is compromised by the selection of the 30 coping behaviours used, as opposed to any other group of items - findings ar e not generalisa ble because the sample was not a probability sample, and the study was cross-sectional - the study did not attempt to asse ss the utility of different coping behaviours, only their use The study found that while there were similarities in the coping behaviours used in the earlier study, there w ere also differences - possibly due to the different social and ser vice contexts of the tw o samples.

Isolation is a key theme among care gi vers along with blame, guilt , anger, unresolved grief, stigma and social withdrawal. Care givers need practical information such as legal and financial is sues as well as family and carer support and education on features and impact of head injury its- self.

Used three instrument s to record fami ly socio-demographic data, coping behaviour and general functioning. The analysis used cluster analys is to identify cop ing strategies families used and multiple re gression analys is to examine the relations hip bet ween family coping with head injury and family adaptation. Cluster analysis of 30 coping behaviour s yielded a 5-cluster solution, with clusters that were distinct and bas ed on family stress theory and empirical family stress and head injury rese arch. Regression analysis produced a signific ant result, resulting in the selecti on of 2 of the 5 family coping variables (positive appraisal and fa mily tension management) which explained 43% of the variance in family adaptation. The study thus found t hat familie s use a variety of coping strategies and that 2 of these influenc ed family adaptation. This study has serious weakness es in design which mean t hat it s findings cannot be generalised. These include: - internal validity is compromised by the selection of the 30 family coping behaviours used in the study - a di fferent list might have produced different results - ditto the use of frequency of behav iours as a measure of coping - use of a non-probability sample dr awn from a support group, and from participants in an on-goi ng longitudinal study 116- use of cross-sectional data to investigate adaptation over time - lack of a controlled experimental des ign, which means the study can only be regarded as descriptive , rather than explanatory. 117 Author/s Leach, L.R., et al (4 authors) Ref No CA02 07 Title (first 4 w ords) Family Functioning Social Su pport Year of publication 1994 Research methods Quantitative Qualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T 4 Location of stud y UK Other USA User's Long Term Condition Brain Injur y Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials SB Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : This study sought to examine how changes in family functionin g post trauma 'impacted' the adjustment of the individual with TBI.

The study found that social support was not predictive of depression - but that effective use of problem solving and behavio ural coping strategies by families was signific antly related to lower leve ls of depression in the person with TBI. This study is, however, very flawed: - the accounts of family functioning were taken only from the brain- injured person - - the sampl e is very small, self-s electing, contained lar ger numbers of women than in the general population of people with TBI, and is dominated by people with low and moderate levels of depression - it fails to define either coping or social support - the design lacks a before - baseli ne - element; and does not use a control The findings are therefore rather suspect. 118 Author/s Allen, Linn, Gutierrez, Willer Ref No CA02 10 Title (first 4 w ords) Family Burden following traumati c Year of publication 1994 Research methods Quantitative Q ualitative Mixed Lit. re view Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (US A) User's Long Term Condition Brain Injur y Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials HR Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : Burden lev els between carers w ho were parents and spouses wer e compared in this article.

Very little information is provided in rela tion to the way carers were included in the case-management model, but it appears that, apart from the early provision of advice and information, they did not receive assessments or interventions focusing on their specific needs or characteristi cs.

This retrospective study used a convenience sample (n=51) to explore care- giving activities performed by children for adults with a variety of chronic physical illnesses. It sought to disco ver the positive and negative effects of the experience. Purely demographic information reveals that some childr en began performing caring tasks from as young as age 9, with th e duration of caring extending from 8 months to 25 years. Cari ng activities undertaken range from helping with personal care (feeding, bathing) to assisting with medication (changing dressings, giving medication), to hous ework (cleaning, shopping) to spending time (reading, talking). \u00be Carers reported feelings of pride and responsibilit y but also of feeling helpless due to lack of knowledge, parti cularly about what to do in a crisis. \u00be Some carers felt that the experie nce had brought them closer to their family although where there was more than one child provid ing care there was potential for conflict. \u00be Interruption to friendships was repor ted, with some respondents indicating they lost fri ends because of thei r domestic commitments although others report that friends und erstood and even helped out. \u00be Those of 'dating' age either didn't or dated early as a means of escaping the home situation. 127\u00be When reflecting on the experience re spond ents thought it had made them more caring as adults. Some, however, still have feelin gs of resentment or guilt. Some still feel they have to take care of every one and eve ry situation. \u00be There was a general c onsensus that children now should be involv ed in similar situations in order that t hey are valued as part of the family. Respondents particularly felt that children should have full knowledge of the condition that affects an adult. \u00be On the parameters of care-giving re spondents felt that where a child's education or developmental needs were being curtailed then more outside help should be given. The study suggests that those who reported negative experiences tended to have been involv ed in prolonged caring. The authors also suggest that professionals who dis charge individuals to care in their own home must ascertain whether children are likely to be involved in delivering this care. More research is needed determine how much is too much. 128 Author/s Knight, R.G., Devereux , R.C., Godfrey, H.P .D.

Two types of data were generated: a psychological questionnaire measured stress a saliva sample was taken for hormonal assessment at which time participants were given an influenz a injection at a later time a blood sample was taken for immune assessment With the emphasis on clinical inv estigation the carer experience is largely absent here. But from the findings the following results are available:- \u00be There was only limited evidence of p sychological morbidity in MS ca re- givers compared to non-care-givers. T he authors attribute this to the fact that the emotional impact is attenuated in younger people. \u00be They also s uggest that distress due to the role is similarly attenuated due to age. Caution is need in int erpreting thes e findings. The study could not demonstrate whether younger care-giv ers have a more preserved immune response or whether they simply have less stress. 131The issue of contrasti ng findings betw een control/experimental groups is also questioned.

The subjective notion of burnout is her e preferred to other measures which collapse many variables into one scale. The authors then hypothesise that carers who experienc e underbenefit and underinvest ment in their relationship will be more prone to burnout. They also appreciate that marital quality as a variable might influenc e perceptions of i nequity in the rel ationship and so cast it as antecedent in determining burnout. By doing so they note that other causal/theoretical constr ucts are available. (The notions of underbenefit and underinves tment were constructed around domains identified by the participants themselves) from this sample/study it is possible to deduce that:- \u00be Partners of cancer patients rated the quality of their relationship signific antly higher than thos e with partners who had MS \u00be Care-giver s who regard their relations hip in a negative light experience more inequity \u00be The relationship between inequit y and burnout is identical between the two groups The authors suggest that depersonalisat ion and personal accomplishments are two areas that future research needs to investigate. They further feel that a longitudinal study would yield more promising results . 134 In summary, the heavily statistical natur e of the analys is obscures the actual carer experience.

This study aims to account for why and how some care-givers experi ence benefits in performing the caring role. Specifically the study investi gates how carers find meaning in general terms as well as finding meaning directly related to their care. The study hypothesis es that those who can find meaning in these two areas will have increased well-being. Rating scales and checklists were completed by 58 carers and the results subjec t to statistical analysis. Results suggest that finding meaning in gene ral is more important than finding meaning s pecific to the caring role. This is at odds with the emphasis in the care giving literature that focuses on helping care-givers to develop coping strategies. The authors note that interviews woul d enhance the data since this would allow for more exploration of how carers experience their world.

Very little research had prev iously been conducted in relation to care-givers' experienc e over the course of the disease. The three were: role strain; care-giver situation; and care-giver characteristics. Care-giver strain was found acros s all stages of the diseas e, but accumulated signific antly as the disease progressed. The authors acknowledge that the cross- sectional natur e of the study and the probably unrepresentative nature of t he sample under mine its strength. Further research should address this, and also develop and evalua te interventions which will reduce care-giver strain at different stages of the disease. Nevertheless the study provides str ong justification for clinicians and health/social care professionals to asse ss the presence of care-giver strain early in the disease's progression, and at intervals as it progresses. 149 Author/s ELLGRING, H. et al.

They found that stressful ness appears related to aspects of care- giving related to intrapersonal factors e. g. anxiety, fatigue while aspects of care- giving that caused les s stress appeared more interpersonal e.g. relative's behaviour on the care giver, famil y relations. The article highlights that professionals need to be awar e of the stress factors for carers and plan servic es appropriately. Carers under high lev els of stress repor ted poorer fami ly functioning than those reporting low levels of stre ss. Therefore stress is re lated to family environment which may have a knock on effect on the patient's well being. Duration of condition was not related to stress and a significant relationship was found between care for older patients and gr eater family cohesion. Older care- givers appeared related to less conflict.

The study also seeks to contribute to a paucity of literature on this particular subject. Eight pairs of sufferers/carers were in terviewed to generate data. Inclusion criteria demanded that the pai rings had been extant for over six months. Al l respondent s lived at home. ALS does not impair memory or intellect but is physically debilitating. All sufferers had impaired speech which precluded the use of recording equipment. One suffe rer had lost the power of speech and responded by writing down their thoughts. Sufferers and carers differ in how they perceive their own needs, in how they view, judge and evaluate the disease, and how they cope with it s progress. In summary:- \u00be Carers tend to want more in formation about the disease. \u00be Carers tend to feel insecure. \u00be Carers feel a great need to talk about the burden of care. \u00be Some carers tend not to want to think about the future. Because ALS is a specific condition the authors feel that the conclusions are easily generalised to provide support for other sufferers and their carers. 159References to follow up:- Payne, S.

Key Findings were: Sources of stress were: health issues, fa mily/marital interactions, care giving burden and work due to conflict between care giver and employee role There were three ident ified coping models: Externals: spouses with limited coping stra tegies and limited social support. Had higher depression and care-giving burden. Considered the 'high risk' group. Characterised by being older with longer period of marriage Internals: spouses with adequate coping strat egies and social support. The 'well adjusted group'. Scored low on care -giving burden, depression and social role dissatisfaction Multi-cont rols: mid-range coping strategies and adequate social support. H ad mid range adjustment scores and lower scores for depression and emotional care-giving than spouses in the external group. Characterised by being younger wit h less years marri age than the 'externals '. The author found that s pouse and persons with SCI experience the same processes of stress and adjustment. He proposes that rehabilitation professionals need to attend to both pat ient and spous es needs to ensure best therapeutic results. C ounselling was advoc ated. 170The article also highlights that serv ices need to be culturally relevant for Chinese persons with SCI and their spouses .

It finds that care-giving can be seen as a developmental process over the i nitial year. The study has found that anxiety is the bes t predictor of the variability in the initial levels of physica l symptoms reported by the carers. Physical symptoms also predict ed anxiety and depres sive behav iour in the carers. Younger carers experience more anxiety and low positive affect initially. Depressive behaviour was associated with lower positiv e affect and the authors suggest that this may be due to restricted social contact. Over time it is the emergence of expre ssive support that is the best predictor of change in depressiv e behaviour and anxiety among the carers i.e. more support less anxiety and depress ion. 174 Author/s Scott Richards, J.

They want to discern whether such findings are applicable in the spinal cord injured (SCI) and their spouses. They reason that since SCI sufferers are often younger adults there may be important differenc es in how people cope. Participant s (n=124) were taken from a longitudinal study into long-term SCI outcomes. The majori ty (90%) were wo men. Four established rating scales were used to measure stress, depression, life satisfaction and quality of life. All were subject to statistical analyse s. The overall pur pose was to quantify how spous es were feeling. On depression it was found that:- \u00be Spouses c aring were generally more depressed than the injured partner (and more depressed t han non-caring spouses). On Quality of Life and Individual Needs:- \u00be Caring spouses rated the importance of having children higher than the injured partner Further analysis showed that it w as caring spouses only (n=80) w ho accounted for these di fferences (i .e. spouses who didn't perform a caring role reported no difference in needs, depression or quality of life). Caring spouses reported signific antly higher stress, burnout, anger and resentment and poorer well-being. 176Despite the equal split between inj uries incurred pre and post marriage (38/42) the only discer nible differenc e was that spouses of partners who incurred the injury after marriage complained of more fatigue. The authors highlight the poi nt that outside help in car e-giving will ease the burden ONLY if it is care-giving and NOT t he severity of the injury that causes problems. They are also cautious about the gender imbalance (only 10% male in the sample) and the overall sample size. 177 Author/s Calne, S.

The inference made is that as the carer' perceived burden increases s/he is less able to support the PD sufferer's managem ent of the condition - and that rehabilitation nurses can help bot h to reflect on this and find ways of maintaining disease management by the pati ent. Major weaknesses of the study include its in ability to test whether, in fact, as the condition progresses and with it t he patient's ability to manage the condition the care-giver's burden increases; possible lack of representativeness of the sample; and inabilit y to be sure that the questionnaires were completed independentl y by patient and care-giver. 179 Author/s Anderson, M.I., Parment er, T.R., Mok, M.

The literature sugges ts that neurobehavioral problems are related to stress reacti on in carers and this study supports these findings. The study hypothesis ed that family func tioning will mediate the relationship between the neurobehavioural pr oblems of TBI and psychological distress in the care-giver. Data was gener ated from respondents (sample size n=64) via a series of self-assessment scales and the variables operationalised via established test instruments. The carers' experienc e is described mostly in statistical form. From this it is apparent that carers experience distress grouped arou nd behavioural, communication and social problems.

Burden was determined via a rating scale (Zarit Burden Inventory). Four indep endent variables (Activities of Daily Liv ing/ADLs, perceived s ocial support, psychological well-being and m arital satisfaction) were measured and were shown to be si gnificant predictor s. Measurement instruments consistently re turned alphas of above 0.77. The care giving experience is reported exclusively in nu merical/statistical form. From this it is apparent that:- \u00be Women in this study reported almost twice the burden as the male care- givers. \u00be Couples on lower income reported more burden than better off couples. \u00be The severity of the PD is directly related to increased assistance with ADLs and in turn this i ncreases the level of perceived burden. The study did not examine the use of support groups and there is conflicting evidenc e on their efficacy. Respite for care-givers is recommended.

Results show that:- \u00be The majority of the control group fe lt poorly informed when compared to both intervention groups. However, this did not reach statistical signific ance (p 0.01) \u00be 52% of the control group showed signi ficant emotional distress after 6 months. This was greater than both intervention groups but again it did not reach statistical significanc e \u00be (p 0.01) The authors feel that by setting the p value so low they may have committed a type 2 error (not being able to reject the null hypothesis as false). That they did not use the Neyman- Pearson lemma suggests a poor grasp of statistical 197signific ance. These methodologic al shor tcomings reduce confidence in the results. 198 Author/s Smith, J.E., Smith, D.L. Ref No CA05 08 Title (first 4 w ords) No map, no guide....

Data gener ated at interview reveals four mai n themes that account for the carer experience. 1: the search for information 3: the need to speak for the survi vor 4: navigating the syste m 1 Much of the 'search for informati on' began at the em ergency room where families felt that they were given info rmation but could not relate it to their experience. There was a prevalent feeling that prof essionals tended to emphasise the seriousness of the injury , thereby denying hope, while all the families wa nted was hope. (see CA142) 2 Care-giv ers were generally not prepar ed for the long-term effects. They reported stress, burn-out and givin g up, not because they didn't care, but because they couldn't cope. Speaking of the changes in the injured person they spoke of loss and grief for the person they used to know. 3 care-givers felt the need to advocat e for their family member and this frequently brought them into direct c onflict with health professionals and sometimes with the TBI individual themselves. 199 4 one indiv idual reports that they needed someone who k new their way around the system 'because if you don't, you're sunk'. Much of the conflict here focused on the discharge of t he TBI individua l. Family members didn't know how to access services.

The paper also inc ludes two commentaries on its content. One, from a professor of nursing, comments on and supports the substance of the account given in the paper, and particularly on: the importance of recognising and responding to the variability of family situations; the possibly unhelpful use of the notion of 'crisis' ; and the ethical is sue of who bears responsibility for the care of people with ve ry severe impairments.

Three sources contributed to the assessmen t: 1) the injured person. 2) carers. 3) a neurologist. Carers views are considered only in so far as they might contribute to an overall evaluation of psychosocial outcomes. This contribution is appar ently particularly effective in providing information on so cial and behavioural domains where the injured person tends to have impaired judge ment. In thi s case carers' views are purely functional in terms of the overall aim of the study and are not extensively sought or described. Outcomes were measured on a battery of rating scales and were subject to a variety of statistical manipulation. The authors conclude that neurologists must make use of carers' assessments in compiling their evaluations of treatment. 220 Author/s Hermann, Freyholdt, Fuchs, Wallesch Ref No CA10 23 Title (first 4 w ords) Coping wit h chronic neurolog ical Year of publication 1997 Research methods Quantitative Q ualitative Mixed Lit. re view Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other Ger many User's Long Term Condition Parkinson s and stroke Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials HR Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : The article analyses the coping strategi es and psychosocial alterations in patients with PD and CVA and their relatives .

The paper does not build on, or refer to, previous literature in this field or on caring generally . Methodological aspec ts of the su rvey are very poorly reported. The findings reported are, however, pl ausible, and echo findings from other studies of carers of people with MS, and with other conditions. So, for example, the impact of MS on carers was found to be considerable, or very considerable; adequate support from external agenc ies was not frequently present; the carer's quality of life deterio rated over time, and mirrored that of their family member with MS , to a considerable extent. 'The care-giving role is often complex, can be stressful, and may not be well und erstood by those distant from the actual situation. ' Whether carers felt they had a normal life outside caring was a strong predic tor of adjustment to th eir circumstances. The key role of nursing is emphasised in the paper, though this is reported as an 'impress ion' from the study ra ther than an explicit finding. The study points to the need for more consistent, and better resourced, policies and services for carers. Of parti cular interest to UK policy makers is the NZ attendant care programme, f unded by the Department of Social Welfare, which facilitates the continued employment of some care-givers who might have to reduce working ho urs or withdraw from employment. This appeared to play a valuable role, even if it was not universally available. 225 Author/s Good, D.M., Bower, D.A., Einsporn Ref No CA11 71 Title (first 4 w ords) Social Support: Gender Differences Year of publication 1995 Research methods Quantitative Qualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other USA User's Long Term Condition Multiple S clerosis Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials SB Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : The principal weaknes ses of this otherwise well designed and conducted study, acknowledged by its authors, are it s relianc e on a small, self-selected, convenienc e sample in a limited geographic area. Probably as a consequence the sample is almost uni versally white and middle class. Further weaknesses are the smal l (65) sample size and reliance on self- completed questionnaires, which attrac ted a relatively low response rate (57%). The study's purpose was to investigat e gender differences in the social support of spouse carers of people with MS . (It drew strongly on Lazarus and Folkman's theory of stress and coping. ) Strong gender differences were found: female care-givers scored signifi cantly higher than males on the total number of resources available, percei ved social support and the perceived availability of friends and self-help groups. The authors see the study's impor tance as lying in its potential to promote effective nursing interventions wit h the care-giver of the person with MS - though it has similar implications for those assessing needs for, or providing, social care. If the nurse uses knowledge abo ut gender differences (particularly men's lower access to re sources and social support), then the care-giver will be strengthened a nd it will be less likely that families will deteriorate, or even disband, in the face of chronic illness.

Howev er, the planning process takes acco unt of the contribution to care made by informal carers and includes th eir exper iences, albeit in statistical/tabulated form. Data was collected and tabulated in order to provide a model whic h could act as predictor for quality of lif e. As part of this proce ss interviews wit h carers on the subject of quality of lif e for the brain injured indi vidual revealed similarity with direct reports on issues such as memory loss, ability to concentrate, irritability a nd headac hes.

Further strained carers reported less feelings of sympathy towards the patient with MS than unstrained carers which may be a result of loss of patience due to pressure.

(measured using BSI - Brief Symptom Inventory). (only 20% showed elevated depression scores, more (around 30%) showed elevated (above popl. norms) sco res on scales reflecting psychoticism, hostility and anxiety. This could be because they are feeling overwhelmed, isolated, inadequate, confused, unable to concentrate and as if they might be going cr azy. The authors caution against interpreting BSI sca le elev ations as direct indications of psychopathology. Levels of self-reported perceived stress (Likert scale) di d not differ between spouses and parents, but spouses were significantly more likely to achieve 'caseness '. Male care-givers of female patients had significantly higher GSI (Gobal severity index) score than other gender combinations . GSI reflects general psychological distress. Other research apparently suggests male care-givers more likely to use ineffective coping styles, and it's mo re of a change of role for them. 250No signific ant effects (on GSI or perceived s tress) of time since injury or length of coma. Interpretati ons of greater 'caseness' among spouses: Deprivation of reciprocal and equitabl e adult relationship, loss of emotional support Need to take on additional role s outside gender exp ectations Disruption of sexual r elations hips Parents feel easier about explaini ng/living with foibles and behavioural problems of their children (i.e. they don' t expect to approve of, or be thought responsible for, everything they do), and caring for their children is less of a role change even though it is stressful. Acknowledges one difficulty is that they have no information about pre-existing problems, and their distributi ons, and so analysis tends to assume that these were like those in the rest of the population - which may not be true if people with TBI are drawn disproportionat ely from certain Groups. Clinica l implicatio ns : majority of carers did not report elevated distress levels; however support groups, individual or mari tal counselling could be useful for some; need for support for families to continue to be availa ble in the long er term; services may currently be offered in early stages of recovery which people may actually need later; particular attention to the needs of spouses and male care-givers needed. 251 Author/s Kosciulek J. and Pichette E.

Suggests that the 'dilemma of disability faced by male care-givers' can be summarised in 3 observations. 1. Male care-givers are expected to simultaneously be the care-giver, the primary breadwinner, the childrearer , and to do so without showing any signs of weakness (visible sympt oms of stress or emotion). 2. Male care-givers must deal with t he perception that as men they are incapable of taking the role of pr imary care-giver and cannot be trusted to take on such responsibilities. This presumption is particularly predominant amongst professional female care-givers. 3. There is a shortage male care-giver role-models or mentors. This can result in male care-givers in asking for and receiving less social and professional support than their female counterparts. 258 Author/s Thomas, S. and Sweet nam, C.

The aims of this stu dy are to 'explore coping methods employed by PD patients and their carers using Quality of life and depression scales. Carer views as such were not discussed, nor were experiences of health and social services. Results suggest that the coping met hods of patients and carers were found to be roughly similar with the ex ception being that patients employed more 'avoidance coping' than carers. Depression in carers correlated moderately with both depression and poorer cognitive functioning in patients. Impaired cognition in patients was found to have a poo r association with increasing depression and avoidance coping in carers. The paper suggests that additional qual itative work is needed bec ause it is unlikely that the medical symptom s of PD alone cannot explain the multidimensional nature of the patient's and carer's experience. 262 Author/s Gold-Spink et al Ref No CA44 82 Title (first 4 w ords) Uncertainty in Illness and Optimism Year of publication 200 Research methods Quantitative Qualitative Mixed Li t. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (USA) User's Long Term Condition Multiple S clerosis Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials SS Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : Aim of study: to investigate the p sychological consequences of MS within individuals. Further, to examine t he psyc hological effects of MS on intimate partners of MS patients. Two hypot heses: 1. MS patients and their partners w ould have difficulty understanding the illness and digesting to it. Levels of optim ism relate to levels of adjustment. 2. MS has a negative impact on marital relationships. METHOD: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - measures frequently and intensity of depression symptoms. Life Orientation Test - measures dis positional optimism. High scores = high levels of op timism, low scores = low leve ls of optimism Dyadic Adj ustment Scale - measures ma rital satisfaction as perceived by each individual in relationship Mishel Unc ertainty in Illness Scale - m easures patient's level of uncertainty about the illness, and assesses the amount of ambiguous an complex information received by patient and their partners. High scores = high levels of uncertainty, low scores = low levels of uncertainty. 263Activity of Daily Living Self-Care Scal e for Persons with MS - assesses what activities patients with MS are able to perform on a daily basis. Measures symptom severity in individuals with MS. RESULTS: A positive relations hip between depre ssion and uncertainty. This may be explained by: 1.The fact that depression causes pati ents to view information as ambiguous . 2. The fluctuating nature of the illness 3. Chronic nature of the illn ess causes depre ssion Inverse relationship between pat ients' optimism and depression. Strong relationship bet ween patients and par tners' high level of uncertainty - because healthcare professional may be providing couples with inc onsistent ambiguous information about the disease process. A trend between patients' level of functi oning and level of marital relationship satisfaction. Partners may feel more satisfied when patients have high lev els of functioning of daily activities. The study had several limitations which bi ased the results. The majority of couples had a high lev el of relationship satisfaction. The patients had quite mild MS. There was no ethnic minorit y couples or homosexual couples who participated in the study. This would have probably c aused significant differences to the findings. 264 Author/s Coombes, R Ref No CA45 08 Title (first 4 w ords) On the shoulders of children Year of publication 2001 Research methods Quantitative Qualitative Mixed Lit. review Other Typolog y T1 T2 T3 T4 Location of stud y UK Other (USA) User's Long Term Condition Epilepsy Confidence Rating High Medium Low Review er's initials AMC Please e-mail this form to Stephen Piper sp29@y ork.ac.uk Please write below key p oints from the text relatin g to carer' s experiences of caring for a person with a long-term condition : This brief journalistic r eport describes one case in which a teenager is heavily involv ed in caring for an older sibling who has epilepsy as well as other disab ilities.

The stages of physical decline are well described alongs ide the adaptations the carer has to make. It is suggested that pre-morbid personality and, in the case of couples, their relationship, can affect the wa y the patients views themselves. The satisfaction the patient feels with the s upport is often more important than the numbers of people inv olved in pr oviding it. On coping the literature suggests tha t: studies so far have concentrated on the patient and research on carers has received little attention. On stress it seems that care-giver depression is related to both the impact and the burden of caring. Burden appears to reduce when the task of caring is shared by other family members. Stress increases over time when there is low social support for the carer. Stress is strongly correlated to the degr ee of physical disability and mental limitation. The act of care-giving itself is dom inated by the 'on-off' demands that characterise the condition. The care-givers social horizons are restricted the more the disease progresses. 269The care-givers need to develop s ome exper tise in administering medicatio n. Routine can be disrupted by 'spur-of-t he-moment' family visits and these can be upsetting for both patient and care-giv er if the patient is experiencing difficulties with their symptoms. In summary, attitudinal stance and psyc hological adjust ment (i.e. coping) have a significant effect on adaptation to the disease by sufferers. More research on the effects on carers is called for. 270 Author/s Zeigler E.
