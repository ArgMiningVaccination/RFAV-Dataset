CHANGES FOR 2018-2019 On page 5 we removed from the margin the sentence about ordering bulk quantities of the FAFSA on the Web worksheet, and we added a note about the Department no longer printing or mailing FSA publications. We added to the margin note on page 7 about Renewal FAFSA reminder emails. We mentioned a second announcement that also discusses other emails that the Department sent to students about the IRS DRT and the IRS's program to provide low-income filers with tax preparation services. We removed the paragraph about the Research and Customer Care Cen - ter (RCCC) from the margin of page 8 and the pertinent bullet from the list in the margin of page 9. The RCCC has been retired effective May 31, 2018. On page 9 we added a margin note stating that when students first submit a FAFSA late in an award year, they can receive aid not just for the remainder of the year but also for any payment periods they completed ear - lier in the year if they were eligible for aid at the time.This guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students begin the aid process\u2014filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA \u00ae) form, verifying infor - mation, and making corrections and other changes to the informa - tion reported on the FAFSA.IntroductionAVG-2 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019 FSA HB August 2018In the margin note on page 12 about the Social Security number (SSN) and Pacific island residents, we added a paragraph about what must be done when these students do not use the same pseudo-SSN across award years. Also on that page, we rewrote the text in the body of the page pertain - ing to SSN to explain what options students have when they enter the wrong SSN. We also cite the relevant electronic announcement. On page 14 we added in the margin note defining graduate student a sentence explaining what three years of full-time study means in terms of credit hours. On page 15 we expanded the information about the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) and removed it from the regular body text. We explained, among other things, that data transferred with the tool will be masked and not viewable by students and parents, and we linked to three electronic announcements that give greater detail about the effects resulting from the change to the DRT. We combined the two bottom paragraphs on page 16 into one section titled \"Married filing separately.\" On the same page, we removed the margin note about prior-prior year data. On page 27 we added the last two sentences to the paragraph about emancipation and guardianship explaining that generally legal guardianship is not the same as legal custody. We also added the last sentence on that page, which states that students who are 22 or 23 years old may answer \"Yes\" if they meet the requirements of homeless unaccompanied youth. Prior to 2018-2019 that was limited to students 21 and younger. In the first paragraph on page 79, we note that while graduate students often can only receive unsubsidized Title IV aid, if they are awarded Fed - eral Work Study, which is subsidized, they need to complete verification if selected for it. We updated and added to the margin note on page 81 about verification for students and schools affected by federally declared disasters. Also on that page, we revised the second-to-last paragraph to empha - size the importance of timely and accurate reporting of V4 and V5 verifica - tion results. We are aware that not all schools are reporting these results as required. On page 82 we updated the margin note pertaining to the HEROES Act. We replaced the margin note about the tax return transcript matrix on page 83 since the 2018-2019 matrix was released on June 6, 2018. We updated the discussion about tax filing extensions on page 84 and indicated that the relevant verification requirements only apply to those who have received an extension beyond the normal six months.AVG-3 Introduction FSA HB August 2018We updated the guidance in the margin note on rollovers on page 85. Also on that page we replaced the paragraph on obtaining a verifica - tion of nonfiling letter from the IRS or other relevant tax authority since that requirement has been reinstated for 2018-2019. In the paragraph preceding that one, we clarified that when a student's spouse is a nonfiler, the student may certify on the spouse's behalf that he or she has not filed a tax return and is not required to. On page 86 we changed our guidance regarding amended tax returns to allow for the use of IRS DRT information on the ISIR record as an alternative to the tax return transcript. The amended return is still required though. We advised that when schools are aware that an amended return was filed, they must submit to the CPS any nondollar changes on the FAFSA and any dollar changes of $25 or more. And we added what to do in rare cases when the IRS changes a taxpayer's return even though he or she did not file a Form 1040X. At the end of the first margin note on page 86, we added the sentence stating that \"recomputed per computer\" amounts may be ignored for veri - fication. We also added a margin note about other IRS transcripts that are acceptable for verification. On page 86 we added guidance about the special situation when students receive an automatic zero EFC. In the sixth bullet on page 89, we included guidance stating that you do not have to collect proof of high school status for graduate students if entry into their program required two years' worth of undergraduate study. In the margin on page 90 we noted that when checking identity, it's okay if the unexpired ID used will expire later in the award year. We also noted that schools determine which of their staff are authorized to review identity. In the middle of page 91, we added a sentence from the online verifica - tion Q's and A's about changing a student's status to unmarried. In the second-to-last paragraph on page 92 we added a sentence clarify - ing that if you are required to submit changes to a student's FAFSA because of verification, you must submit all changes, including those of less than $25. We added a couple margin notes on page 92: one explaining why schools on the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 and Reimbursement payment meth - ods cannot make interim disbursements, and one explaining when schools can delay disbursing Title IV aid in cases where they are verifying items that they selected rather than the Department. We changed the third bullet on page 95 to clarify that when a student fails to submit verification documentation, the school may not disburse or originate any additional Direct Loans, including subsidized, unsubsidized, and PLUS loans.AVG-4 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019 FSA HB August 2018On page 96 we removed the margin note about the Quality Assurance Program, which has ended, and we added a margin note about when verifica - tion ends. We added guidance to the second paragraph on page 113 clarifying that while it is generally correct that schools must complete verification before making professional judgment (PJ) changes, it is not necessary to verify information that will be completely removed as a result of PJ. On page 116 we removed the body text about code 399 and the special conflicting information that arose between the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 award years. But we modifed and retained a relevant margin note since 399 codes will continue through the first half of 2018. We added the second-to-last sentence in the first paragraph on page 117 to clarify that students who are younger than 24 may qualify for a homeless unaccompanied youth determination. We also removed the definition of \"youth\" in the margin and the last paragraph on page 118 because that guid - ance is 2018Glossary CFR DCL To be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA. It collects financial and other information used to calculate the expected family contribution (EFC) and to determine a student's eligibility through computer matches with other agencies. The FAFSA is the only form students must fill out to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra information from students except for verification or resolution of conflicting information. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as packaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must take the information into account when awarding Title IV aid. TYPES OF APPLICATIONS Most students use FAFSA on the Web to apply for federal student aid, but there are other options. FAFSA on the Web (FOTW or fafsa.gov ) Students can complete an application online at https://fafsa.gov / and send it directly to the Central Processing System (CPS). They can also correct previously submitted data that was not imported from the IRS. Help is avail - able for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243). FAA Access to CPS Online You can submit a student's application data at FAA Access to CPS Online ( https://faaaccess.ed.gov ). You can also connect to the site through EDExpress. Before submitting the data, print the signature page/FAFSA summary for the student (and parent if appropriate) to sign, or have the student fill out and sign a paper FAFSA. As noted at the end of Chapter 2 , you will need to retain either the signed signature page/summary or signed FAFSA for your records, even if the student doesn't receive aid or attend your school.FAFSA on the Web worksheet To make using the Web application easier, ED produces the FAFSA on the Web worksheet, which can be printed from the website. Advantages of electronic filing We strongly recommend electronic applications over the paper FAFSA be - cause of the following benefits: Faster processing Fewer errors and rejected applica - tions because internal and end-of- entry data edits ensure that required fields are completed and conflicts are resolved prior to submission Skip logic, which helps \"shorten\" the form by allowing applicants to skip over questions that don't pertain to them Availability of online helpThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR The laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA \u00ae) form, and its online version is FAFSA on the WebSM (FOTW \u00ae). End of printed publications As of August 30, 2018, the Department will no longer print or mail FSA publica - tions, except the paper FAFSA. Publica - tions will still be available online for users to download and print. See the May 23 , 2018, announcement .AVG-6 Application and Verification Guide August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Paper (PDF) FAFSA Department no longer prints the FAFSA. More than 99% of appli - cations are filed electronically, so the only paper option is the PDF FAFSA, which students can get at fafsa.gov . They can print the PDF and fill it out by hand, or they can type their data on the PDF before printing and mail - ing it. If needed, they can request single copies from the FSAIC by calling 1-800-433-3243. FAFSA on the phone Students who have limited or no Internet access and face pressing deadlines can choose to complete and submit their application by call - ing 1-800-433-3243, telling a representative they would like to fill out their FAFSA over the phone and providing their information. This typically takes about half an hour. Students will receive a paper student aid report (SAR) 7-10 days later, which they (and their parents, if appropriate) must sign and return. Because this is not the preferred method to apply for aid, it should be used sparingly and only by those students identified previously. FSA ID Students (and parents) use the FSA ID to log on to fafsa.gov and other FSA websites\u2014the National Student Loan Data System StudentLoans.gov , and the TEACH Grant website\u2014with a username and password they create. They can find out more about the ID and can create one online. See the electronic announcement of April 18, 2017 , for recent information about the ID. Renewal FAFSA A student who has received an FSA ID and who the year before had a successful match on Social Security number (SSN), name, and date of birth with the Social Security Administration (SSA) is eligible for a renewal FAFSA. When he logs on to fafsa.gov , he will be asked if he wants to pre-fill some of the application with data from the prior year. By choosing this op - tion, he can review each pre-filled item, correct any that has changed, and provide new information as needed. If an aid administrator's school does not appear on the renewal application, she can use the student's data release number (DRN) to access the application on FAA Access. In October-December 2017, students with a valid email address in the CPS who submitted a FAFSA for 2017-2018 and have not done so for 2018- 2019 will receive an email informing them of the recent FAFSA changes and encouraging them to complete the new application. In January 2018, renewal-eligible students who still have not submitted a 2018-2019 FAFSA will receive a renewal reminder as in previous years. PROCESSING THE FAFSA Paper FAFSAs go to the FAFSA processor for data entry and then to the CPS. Applications that are signed and submitted on the web go directly to the CPS. If a web applicant indicated she would sign electronically later or send a paper signature page, her FAFSA goes to a signature hold file for up to 14 days. If some type of signature is not received in that time, the application will be sent to the CPS but will be rejected; it won't be processed again until a signature is received.Websites for students https:// fafsa.gov FAFSA on the Web Make corrections to the application Check status of application Online SAR FAFSA4caster, which allows future college students to estimate what their EFC might be and what kind of federal student aid they might be eligible for when they apply for aid https://fsaid.ed.gov FSA ID website https://studentaid.ed.gov Higher education portal for students https://www.nslds.ed.gov Students' loan database https://studentloans.gov Loan information and counseling FAFSA filers under the age of 13 Because the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohib - its any entity, including a government agency, from electronically conduct - ing business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or younger cannot complete the FAFSA online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, they or a parent or legal guardian, financial aid administrator, or high school counselor can fill out the appropriate award year PDF FAFSA and mail it to Federal Student Aid Programs Attn: COPPA/CORR Process Building 3 1084 South Laurel Road London, KY 40744 Such applicants are not to provide an email address on the application or with any correction that might follow. After the FAFSA is submitted, it will be processed and a paper SAR will be sent to the student and a regular ISIR will be sent to schools. See the electronic announcement from 8/4/16 for more information.AVG-7 Chapter uses application data to calculate the EFC and to match against several databases: those of NSLDS, the Department of Defense, the Depart - ment of Justice, the SSA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the Department of Homeland Security's database of noncitizens and the Se - lective Service System registration database. The CPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student reported the parents' mari - tal status as married but reported the household size as \"2,\" the edit checks would catch the inconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the CPS may be able to calculate an EFC based on assumptions. For applications that your school submits through FAA Access, you can anticipate certain assumptions and correct or override information on the student's FAFSA submission. Students who submit applications using fafsa.gov can also correct or override some of the CPS edits before submitting the application. OUTPUT DOCUMENTS: THE SAR AND ISIR After processing is complete, the CPS produces output documents or records that show the information the student originally provided, the EFC, the results of the eligibility matches, and information about any inconsisten - cies identified through the CPS edits. If the CPS was unable to calculate an EFC, the output record will not show one. There are two types of output documents: the Institutional Student In - formation Record (ISIR), which is made available electronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA (or added later) and their state agency, and the Student Aid Report (SAR), which is sent to the student or made available to her online. FAFSA on the Web demo You can use the FAFSA on the Web demonstration to train financial aid staff or to show students how to use the on - line application. Go to http://fafsademo.test.ed.gov and type in eddemo for the user name and fafsatest for the password.Renewal FAFSA and students from Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia Because students from the above Pa - cific islands, known collectively as the Freely Associated States, are not eligible for an FSA ID (for lack of an SSN), they can't pre-fill data on FAFSA on the Web. But an FAA can use FAA Access to CPS Online to enter and access renewal applications for these students if they meet the renewal application eligibility requirements. Renewal FAFSA reminders For more information see the electronic announcements on 10/12/17 and on 1/5/18 . The latter announcement also explains (and gives samples of) emails that were sent to students to encourage them to use the IRS DRT as a FAFSA cor - rection and to inform them about an IRS program to provide free tax preparation services for low-income filers. Paper FAFSA FAFSA Processor Central Processing System (CPS)FAFSA on the Web FAA Access to CPS Online SAR EFCISIR EFCSocial Security 2018Glossary CFR DCL You will receive an ISIR for the student only if she includes your school on her FAFSA. If your school is not listed, you can request an ISIR for her through FAA Access by adding your federal school code if you have her DRN, which authorizes your access to the student's application information. The DRN appears in the upper right corner of the first page of the SAR and at the top of some of the correctable pages. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept SARs from students, but you cannot require them to submit SARs in order to receive aid. If you don't have an ISIR for a student, your federal school code must be added to her re - cord so an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electroni - cally via fafsa.gov (the student) or FAA Access (the school); however, you can require students to use a SAR to make corrections. If you don't have an ISIR for a student who provided a SAR or SAR Acknowledgement, you must use the SAR or the acknowledgement to award and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also ensure that your school code is added to the student's CPS record (see page 94). The SAR arrives in one of three ways. (1) Students who give an email address will receive an email with a link to an online SAR. (2) Students who don't give an email address and who apply with a PDF FAFSA will receive a paper SAR. (3) Students who don't give an email address and who apply elec - tronically will receive a paper SAR Acknowledgement, which has fewer and less detailed comments than the SAR and can't be used for corrections as the SAR can. If a student or parent signature is missing, students will receive a paper SAR, which they must sign and return for processing to continue. The SARs and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from the matches and edits described here. For some of these there will also be a C code, which you must resolve before paying the student aid. For instance, if a student has defaulted on a federal student loan, the SAR and ISIR will note this in several places, including comments to the student and the NSLDS financial aid history page. For other problems, the SAR and ISIR will show that the student's ap - plication has been rejected and no EFC has been calculated. The SAR will tell the student how to remove the reject by providing signatures or more information or by correcting errors. Reject codes are given in the FAA In - formation section, and a complete list of reject codes is in The ISIR Guide 2018-2019 .2018-2019 Summary of Changes for the Application Processing System Go to https://ifap.ed.gov and select Publications > Summary of Changes for the Application Processing System > 2018-2019.

For the 2018-2019 award year, applications are accepted beginning October 1, 2017, and will be accepted through June 30, 2019. The CPS must receive a student's electronic FAFSA by June 30, 2019. A paper FAFSA must be legible, and it must be mailed to the Federal Stu - dent Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA in time for the processor to receive it by June 30, 2019. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An electronic application cannot be received before October 1, 2017, and if it is received after June 30, 2019, it will not be processed. A paper application received before October 1, 2017, or after June 30, 2019, will be returned un - processed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after October 1, 2017, it will be accepted, but the student will receive a rejected SAR asking him to date and re-sign the SAR and return it for processing. For other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for the 2018-2019 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available on the IFAP website under \"Federal Registers.\" For these deadlines, the date the CPS processed the ISIR transaction is considered to be the date the institu - tion received the ISIR. On the SAR, SAR Acknowledgement, and ISIR print - out, the processed date is above the EFC on the first page.Reach FSA You can call a single toll-free number, 1-855-FSA-4-FAA (1-855-372-4322), to reach any of the following FSA contact centers for schools: Campus-Based Call Center CPS/SAIG technical support COD School Relations Center eZ-Audit Help Desk Foreign Schools Participation Divi - sion G5 Hotline NSLDS Customer Support Center Nelnet Total and Permanent Disabil - ity Servicer School Eligibility Service Group At this single number you can get more information about the various call cen - ters or connect directly to the center you need.

Valid SAR or ISIR definition A SAR or ISIR on which all the informa - tion reported on a student's FAFSA is ac - curate and complete as of the date the application is signed. 34 CFR 668.2 Aid for late FAFSA filers Students who don't submit the FAFSA till later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including com - pleted payment periods, as long as they were not ineligible at the time. See the section on retroactive disbursements for completed periods in Volume 3 .AVG-10 Application and FAFSA is organized as steps, each consisting of a group of related questions. There are also instructions on how to fill out the form. The guidance in this chapter supplements those instructions, and students can get similar advice on filling out the FAFSA online at https://studentaid.ed.gov . The parents mentioned are those of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on the SAR, ISIR, paper FAFSA, and FAA Access. As of the date the FAFSA is signed, it is considered a \"snap - shot\" of the family's information that can be updated only in certain circum - stances and only for certain items; see Chapter 4 . STEP ONE: GENERAL STUDENT INFORMATION Purpose: This step identifies the student and establishes his aid eligibility based on factors such as citizenship, educational level, and Selective Service registration (see also Volume 1: Student Eligibility ). In Step One, 31 questions are included to help the school package awards and to eliminate the need for students to fill out a separate state or school financial aid form. Student's name (1-3). The name, along with other identifying information, is used for several data matches. Because the U.S. Department of Education (ED) matches the student's name and Social Security number (SSN) with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name here should match the one in the SSA 's records, i.e., as it appears on the student's Social Security card. Permanent mailing address (4-7). This is the student's permanent home address, with two exceptions: incarcerated students should use the address of the facility they are in, and homeless youth should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a relative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school's address as long as they have contacted the school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as incarcerated and homeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address on the FAFSA.Paper FAFSA steps Step One \u2014General student information Step Two \u2014Student/spouse income and assets Step Three \u2014Dependency status Step Four \u2014Parents' information (dependent students only) Step Five \u2014Independent student data Step Six \u2014School information Step Seven \u2014Signature(s) Completing the FAFSA Information for students is online at https://studentaid.gov/resources . You may want to link to this reference from pages that students use on your web - site. Scroll down the page for the guide Completing the FAFSA . You can also download FAFSA on the Web graphics to use on your website: https://studentaid.gov/about/link .Filling Out the FAFSA The FAFSA form is the first step in the financial aid process. Because it's important to complete the form correctly, this chapter discusses some of the more difficult questions that arise. While the chapter more closely follows the organization of the paper application, the guidance applies equally to fafsa.gov . To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the expected family contribution, refer to Chapter 3 .AVG-12 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB 2018 Student's SSN (8). Students must have an SSN to apply for federal student aid except as noted in the margin. If they submit a FAFSA without an SSN, the FAFSA will be returned unprocessed. To get an SSN or to find out what the number is if the Social Security card was lost, they must contact the local SSA office. Call the SSA at 1-800-772- 1213 for more information. Students who enter the wrong SSN on their FAFSA can correct it in a few ways: through the school, by submitting a corrected paper SAR, or by filing a new FAFSA. If they don't have a copy of their SAR, they can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center (1-800-433-3243) and have one sent to them, which they can correct and mail to the address on the SAR. However, correcting the SSN through the school or with the SAR will not change the number in the student's identifier; that will remain the original SSN and may later cause confusion. Completing and submitting a new FAFSA solves this problem. Note that there are other rare instances where a student must submit a special \"correction application. \" See the June 22, 2017, announcement for more information. Student's email address (13). If the student provides this address, he should get an email with a link to his online SAR data within one to three days after the CPS receives his application. The Department will also use this email address to correspond with him regarding his ap - plication and FSA ID. Citizenship status (14). Examples of eligible noncitizen categories are given in the FAFSA instructions, and a detailed discussion of citizenship issues can be found in Volume 1: Student Eligibility . Only U.S. citizens or certain classes of noncitizens are eligible for Title IV aid; however, other students can still submit the FAFSA because they might be eligible for aid from institutional, state, or private sources that do not have the same requirements but use FAFSA information. Student's marital status (16 and 17). This is marital status \"as of today\"\u2014the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4 . Student's state and date of legal residence (18-20). This is used to figure the allowance for state and other taxes for the EFC calculation. It also indicates which state agency should receive the student's FAFSA information. States have varying criteria for determining whether the student is a resident for purposes of their financial aid. However, residing in one state for five years will meet any state's criteria. Therefore, a person answering \"Y es\" to Question 19 will likely meet the residency requirements of the state reported in Question 18, while the state eligibility for a person answering \"No\" will depend on the date reported in Question 20 and the state's requirements. Conviction for possessing or selling illegal drugs (23). Students convicted of a federal or state offense of selling or possessing illegal drugs that occurred while they were receiving federal student aid STEP 1 Questions 8-20 Student information The SSN and certain Pacific island residents Persons from the Republic of the Mar - shall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau (the Freely Associated States or FAS) typically do not have SSNs. Students who are filling out a FAFSA for the first time and who indicate that their state of legal residence is one of the above Pacific island groups should enter \"666\" for the first three digits of their SSN, and the CPS will assign them an identifica - tion number. Students from the FAS who have submitted a FAFSA before and were issued such a pseudo-SSN will enter it in the SSN field. It is important that they use the same number on all subsequent FAFSAs because it allows for more accurate information on Pell Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU). See the relevant electronic announce - ments from October 7, 2011, and November 20, 2013. If a student does not use the same pseudo-SSN across award years\u2014if on a subsequent FAFSA he either gets a new pseudo-SSN and uses that or if he uses a real SSN that he obtained from the SSA\u2014the school must contact the COD School Relations Center so the multiple student records can be merged into one and the correct LEU can be calcu - lated. Also, when Pacific island students file with a real SSN, schools will need to have an alternate way, other than the pseudo-SSN, of identifying that popula - tion to ensure that the correct award limitations (see Volume 1, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook) are in place for those the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 should still complete and submit the FAFSA because they may be eligible for federal aid, and even if they aren't, they may be eligible for state or institutional aid. Students who use fafsa.gov and answer \"Y es\" to Question 23 will immediately receive a series of questions to determine their eligibility. Students who fill out a paper FAFSA and answer \"Y es\" to this question will receive a worksheet with their SAR to determine whether the conviction affects their eligibility for federal student aid. If the date they regain eligibility falls before July 1, 2018, the worksheet will instruct them to change the response to a \"1, \" indicating full eligibility for the award year. If the date falls between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, they will not be eligible for part of the award year and will need to change the response to a \"2. \" If the date falls after June 30, 2019, the students' response will remain a \"3. \" They will not be eligible for federal aid during the entire award year unless they complete a qualified drug rehabilitation program or pass two unannounced drug tests given by such a program. For more information, see Volume 1: Student Eligibility . Students who leave Question 23 blank cannot be paid Title IV aid until they respond by submitting a corrected SAR or ISIR. Highest level of school completed by student's parents (24 and 25). Some state agencies use this information to award grants and scholarships. Father and mother are defined here as the student's birth or adoptive parents but not stepparents, guardians, or foster parents. This definition is unique to these questions\u2014all others use the definition on page 28. High school completion status (26). The student indicates one of the following: high school diploma, General Educational Development (GED) certificate or state equivalent test, homeschooled, or none of the above. None of the above includes those who have the equivalent of a high school diploma (see Volume 1 , Chapter 1 , of the FSA Handbook) other than a GED certificate or state equivalent test. State tests (or state-authorized examinations, as referred to in 34 CFR 600.2) are those that states approve and award certificates and/or transcripts for. They include tests comparable to the GED (i.e., they are created and distributed by a test publisher), such as the High School Equivalency Test or the Test Assessing Secondary Completion, as well as those established by states, for example, the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE). California considers a passing grade on the CHSPE to be equivalent to a diploma. High school (27). This question asks for the name of the high school where the student received or will receive her diploma, as well as the city and state where it is located. On fafsa.gov , the student will be able to choose the name from a list or type in the name if the school is not on the list. See Volume 1 , Chapter 1 , of the Handbook about checking the validity of a high school education.STEP 1 Questions 23-27 Student information Undergraduate student definition An undergraduate student is one who is enrolled in a program that usually does not exceed four academic years or a longer program that leads to a first degree at the baccalaureate level. Students in programs longer than five years are considered undergraduates for only the first four years. For the FSEOG, Pell, and TEACH Grant programs, a student is an under - graduate only if he has not earned, or completed the requirements for, a bachelor's or professional degree. Stu - dents enrolled in a postbaccalaureate program as described in 34 CFR 686.2(d) and 690.6 are still undergraduates for receiving TEACH and Pell grants. Students in dual degree programs that confer a bachelor's degree and either a graduate or first professional degree are undergraduates for at least the first three years of the program. The school determines at what point after three years they cease to be undergraduates. 34 CFR 668.2(b)Same-sex marriage and the FAFSA In 2013, in United States v. Windsor , the Supreme Court ruled that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitutional because it violates the principles of due process and equal protection. As a result, same-sex cou - ples who have married in a domestic or foreign jurisdiction that recognizes the marriage should complete the FAFSA as a married couple regardless of whether the jurisdiction in which they reside or the student attends school recognizes the marriage. This applies to indepen - dent students and to the parents of de - pendent students. See DCL GEN-13-25 for more DCL FSA HB August 2018 First bachelor's degree (28). The student indicates whether he will have a first bachelor's degree before July 1, 2018, because eligibility for Pell and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants (FSEOGs) is almost exclusively restricted to students who have not received a bachelor's degree or completed the requirements for one. See \"Pell Grants\" in Chapter 6 of Volume 1: Student Eligibility regarding degrees from unaccredited and foreign schools, which can count as bachelor's degrees for Pell and FSEOG eligibility. Student's grade level at the start of the school year (29). This is not based on the number of years the student has attended college but on work completed toward the degree/certificate. For instance, a full-time student might attain second-year grade level after one year of study, while a half-time student would take two years to reach that level. Interest in work-study (31). The student indicates whether she is interested in receiving Federal Work-Study (FWS). This helps the school in packaging her award. If she isn't sure about wanting FWS, she should answer \"don't know\" so she will be considered for it; later she can decline any aid she doesn't want. STEPS TWO AND FOUR: INCOME AND ASSETS Purpose: Questions 32-45 ask for the student's and spouse's income and assets. Step Four collects similar information about parents' income and assets, so the following discussion also pertains to parents. If the student or her parent wasn't married in 2016 but is married when the application is signed, the student also needs to provide income and asset information for the new spouse. If the student or her parent was married in 2016 but is separated or divorced or the spouse has died when the application is signed, the student or parent doesn't provide income and assets for that spouse even though the information may be on the 2016 tax forms. The FAFSA asks for income and taxes paid according to lines on the IRS tax forms for 2016, the \"base year\" for 2018-2019. Data from the completed tax year is used as a predictor of the family's financial situation for the current year. In the rare instance that 2016 tax data is not available yet, best estimates can be used on the application. However, the student is asked to correct this information later when the tax return is filed. The FAFSA also collects information for certain investments and other assets. Applicants only report the net worth of assets instead of reporting the value and debt. They should report asset amounts as of the date the application is signed . Tax return filed and tax filing status (32-35, 80-83 for parents). These questions ask if a 2016 tax return was completed, which return was or will be filed, what the filing status was or will be, and whether the student or parents were eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ. The answers are used in part to identify if the student is eligible for the simplified needs test or the auto zero EFC (see the margin note on page 17) and to find inconsistencies between the FAFSA and the tax return.Income and assets HEA Sec. 480(a), (b), (f), (g)STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 28-35 and 80-83 Grade level, tax return, and filing status Income earned from work and the IRS 1040 form The FAFSA instructs the applicant to sum lines 7, 12, and 18 of the 1040 form and box 14 [code A] of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) as an option for determin - ing the income earned from work. But when the values of lines 12 or 18 or box 14 are negative, this will reduce the total and can wrongly affect the Social Security allowance. If values from lines 12 or 18 or box 14 are negative, treat them as zero when determining the in - come earned from work. Income earned from work and combat pay Because combat pay is not counted as untaxed income and is removed from the AGI when it is taxable, it should not be included in the income earned from work. Graduate or professional student definition A graduate student is one who: is not receiving aid as an undergraduate for the same period of enrollment; is enrolled in a program above the bach - elor's degree level or one leading to a professional degree; and has completed the equivalent of at least three years of full-time study, either before entrance into the program or as part of it. Measured in credit hours, three years of full-time study must be at least three times the annual minimum for full-time study: 72 (24 \u00ce3) semester or trimester hours or 108 (36 \u00ce3) quarter hours. 34 CFR CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 IRS Data Retrieval Tool The IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) allows students and parents who are using fafsa.gov and who have already submitted their federal tax return to electronically retrieve their tax data from the IRS database. The ISIR will show that data was imported and if it was altered. All students and parents of dependent students who indicate on the application that they have already filed a federal tax return and who are otherwise eligible to use the DRT will be directed to do so. Beginning with the 2018-2019 award year, the actual values of the imported data will not be viewable by students and parents (they will, however, still appear on the ISIR). This is to enhance security and privacy and to prevent the misuse of sensitive tax-relat - ed data. See the electronic announcement of May 3, 2017 . Because aid officers and other officials will be able to see the transferred data, and in keeping with the expectation that they protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, they must not disclose income and tax information from the FAFSA with the applicant, his spouse, or his parents unless they can authen - ticate their identity. For example, a student appearing in person and presenting an unexpired, valid, government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license would be an effective way to authenticate his identity. See the September 5, 2017, announcement for more information. As a result of IRS data being masked, students and parents will not be able to change it on the FAFSA; the financial aid office will need to make corrections. Also, rollovers will be handled differently. If the DRT transfers a non-zero amount into the untaxed pen - sion or IRA distribution field, the applicant will be asked if any of it is due to a rollover. If he answers yes, he will then enter the rollover amount, which the CPS will subtract when calculating the EFC. And because of the data masking, students and parents who file a joint tax return will not be able to transfer their income earned from work but will have to manually enter those amounts. The income earned from work of single persons will, however, continue to transfer. See the August 7, 2017, announcement . When the ISIR shows an IRS Request Flag value of 06 or 07, schools will need to contact the student or parent. A value of 06 in - dicates that after the DRT was used and the FAFSA was submitted, the student or parent changed an item on the FAFSA (e.g., the date of marriage) that would have made the person ineligible to use the DRT. The school must contact the student or parent to determine if all of the transferred data was correct or if it needs to be corrected. A value of 07, which is new for 2018-2019, is an indication from the IRS that the student or parent used the DRT but also has filed an amended tax return for the relevant year. Be - cause the data that was transferred will be from the original return and not the amended one, the school must contact the student or parent and make any applicable corrections to FAFSA items, regardless of whether the application was selected for verification. New for 2018-2019, ISIRs will display IRS Data Field flags that indicate if any individual item was transferred from the IRS and if it was subsequently changed. A flag value of 1 will indicate that the datum was transferred and was not changed. Such items do not need to be verified if the student is selected for verification. However, when there is a Request Flag value of 06 or 07, the above guidance must first be followed. The August 7 announcement has more information. There will be two new comment codes for 2018-2019, also due to the IRS data masking, that schools must respond to: code 400 for parents and 401 for students. When an ISIR indicates either of these codes, the school must check the FAFSA to see if any of the fol - lowing conditions exist and make necessary corrections: 1. The student or parent is a tax filer and the AGI transferred from the IRS is zero, but the total income earned from work is greater than zero. 2. The total of the taxable income offsets (see page 19) for the student or parents is greater than the AGI transferred from the IRS. 3. Any of the untaxed income items (see page 21) for the student or parent is greater than or equal to the AGI transferred from the IRS. The school may need to contact the student or parent for an explanation of one of the above conditions and to determine if any of the associated FAFSA items need to be corrected. Also, comment codes 400 and 401 can be considered resolved if (V1 or V5) verifica - tion is completed for the same ISIR. Again, see the August 7 announcement for more.AVG-16 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Zero income Occasionally an applicant will report no income for the base year. This can occur when the family has tax write-offs that produce a negative AGI or when the applicant neglected to report untaxed assistance. Zero income is noted in our CPS edits and may increase the likelihood that the applicant will be selected for verification. If the CPS does not select the student for verification, you may still choose to ask her for further information about her means of support during the base year. Also, you may use professional judg - ment (PJ) to adjust the income line items to reflect income the family receives that doesn't appear on the tax return. Any cash support for the student, other than support from a parent for a dependent student, counts as untaxed income and must be reported. In-kind help (see page 23) from a friend or relative is not considered untaxed income, but you may use PJ to account for the value of that in-kind support. For example, you could adjust the room and board component of the cost of attendance (COA) for a student who lives with his aunt and eats meals with her family. Married filing separately When a student and spouse or a dependent student's parents file separate and different types of returns, what type should be indi - cated in Question 33 or 81? In such cases, IRS Form 1040 and foreign tax returns are considered comparable, while forms 1040A and 1040EZ are comparable to tax returns from the five inhabited U.S. territories: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the North - ern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The former take precedence over the latter; for example, if a student filed a 1040A form and his spouse filed a foreign return, he would answer foreign tax return to question 33. When comparable but different returns are filed, the IRS return takes precedence and is indicated. If the above student's spouse filed a Puerto Rican return, then he would answer 1040A or 1040EZ to the question. If one spouse files separately and the other does not file a return but has some income, how do you figure the AGI? Add the income earned from work (e.g., earnings from the W-2 form or any other earning statements) of the spouse who does not file a return to the AGI (as given on line 37, 21, or 4 of Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ respectively) of the spouse who does and enter the sum on the appropriate AGI line of the FAFSA. Adjusted gross income (AGI) and other tax data (36-40, 85-89 for parents). Dependent students report these items for their parents. Each question gives the line reference to the 2016 IRS tax forms. Though students and parents may manually enter their IRS data in the FAFSA, they are strongly encouraged to transfer it with the DRT because that method is accurate, efficient, and useful for verification. Filers of a joint return who are divorced, separated, or widowed when the application is signed won't be able to copy the information from the tax forms or transfer data with the DRT. Instead, they must figure out how much of the income and taxes paid is attributable to them and not their spouse. For more on this calculation, see \"Using a joint return to figure individual AGI and taxes paid\" in Chapter 4 . If the student, spouse, or parents were not required to file a tax return, the student should still report any income earned from work in lines 39-40 (student and spouse) and lines 88-89 (parents). The W-2 form and other records of work earnings should be used to determine these amounts. Do not include combat pay (see the margin note on page 14). Income earned from work is used to calculate allowances for the Social Security and Medicare tax (aka the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or FICA tax) and for the added costs incurred by working families. For non-tax filers it will also be used in place of AGI and will cause the application to be rejected if it is above the tax filing threshold.EFA or not? Sometimes it is difficult to account for an outside financial award. If a student receives the award because of post - secondary enrollment, it counts as estimated financial assistance (EFA) if it is not considered wages for employ - ment according to federal or state rules, or if it is considered wages and is based on need. Any amount that appears as income on the tax return will also be included on the appropriate line of item 44 or 93 on the FAFSA. If the award is considered wages for employment but is not based on need, then it is not EFA and it remains in income.STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 36-40 and 85-89 Income and other tax the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 For a fiscal year tax return, as opposed to one for the calendar year, the applicant should report information from the fiscal year return that includes the greater number of months in 2016. If the student or parents filed a tax return using something other than a common IRS form, such as a foreign or Puerto Rican tax form, the student should report on the FAFSA the amounts (converted to U.S. dollars) from the lines of the form that correspond most closely to those on the common IRS forms. Assets (41-43, 90-92 for parents). An asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA collects current (as of the day of signing the FAFSA) data about cash, savings and checking accounts, investments, businesses, and investment farms. Most assets are investments such as college savings plans, Coverdell education savings accounts, real estate, installment and land sale contracts (including mortgages held), trust funds, mutual funds, money market funds, UGMA and UTMA accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks, stock options, bonds, commodities, and precious metals. If the asset isn't a business or investment farm, it is reported as an investment. The FAFSA asks for the net worth of investments, which is their total current market value minus their associated debts. If their net worth is negative, the student reports a zero. Similarly for businesses and investment farms , the current net worth is reported for land, buildings, machinery, equipment, livestock, and inventories. The current market value of a business or investment farm is reduced by the debt owed on it to determine the net worth. Business or farm debt means only those debts for which the business or farm was used as collateral. Excluded assets\u2014the following are NOT reported on the FAFSA: Possessions such as a car, a stereo, clothes, or furniture A family's principal place of residence , even if it is part of a business A family farm (including equipment, livestock, etc.) if it is the principal place of residence for the applicant and his family (spouse or, for dependent students, parents), and the applicant (or parents of a dependent student) materially partici - pated in the farming operation Family-owned and controlled small businesses (which can include farms) that have 100 or fewer full-time or full-time equivalent employees. \"Family-owned and controlled\" means that more than 50% of the business is owned by persons who are directly related or are or were related by marriage. (Family members do not have to be counted in the household size for this question.)STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 41-43 and 90-92 Assets Simplified needs test The law provides a \"simplified EFC\" calculation for a student who meets certain income and tax filing requirements. If the applicant is eligible based on the information on the FAFSA, the CPS will automatically exclude assets from the EFC calculation. However, some states and schools require this information for their own aid programs.Other tax forms The following tax forms are considered alternatives to a U.S. Form 1040A and 1040EZ: the income tax returns required by the tax codes of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Information from these tax returns would be reported on the FAFSA in the same manner as U.S. tax information, and copies of these forms can be used for verification in the same way as U.S. tax forms are. Amounts are already reported in U.S. dollars, and the school should look at tax return line items that are comparable to the IRS line items for verification.AVG-18 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Qualified education benefits Qualified tuition programs (QTPs, also known as section 529 plans because they are covered in section 529 of the IRS tax code) and Coverdell education savings accounts are grouped together in the law as qualified education benefits and have the same treatment: they are an asset of the owner (not the beneficiary because the owner can change the beneficiary at any time) except when the owner is a dependent student, in which case they are an asset of the parent. When the owner is some other person (including a noncustodial parent), distributions from these plans to the student count as untaxed income, as \"money received. \" When a parent owns a plan for a child and the parent is filing a FAFSA as a student himself, the plan counts as an asset on his FAFSA. States, their agencies, and some colleges sponsor qualified tuition programs. The IRS mentions two types of QTPs that are commonly called prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans. States may offer both types, but colleges may only sponsor prepaid tuition plans. Prepaid tuition plans allow a person to buy tuition credits or certificates, which count as units of attendance. The number of units doesn't change even though tuition will likely increase before the beneficiary gets to use the tuition credits. They are an asset of the plan owner, and their worth is the refund value of the credits or certificates. College savings plans allow a benefactor to deposit money into an account that will be used for the beneficiary's college expenses. The buyer does not pre-purchase tuition credits as with a prepaid tuition plan. Rather, this type of plan is essentially a savings account, and its value as an asset is the current balance of the account. Coverdell education savings accounts, or ESAs, are another tax-advantaged savings vehicle for college education. They are treated the same as college savings plans: the current balance is an asset of the account owner. As long as distributions from QTPs and ESAs do not exceed the qualified education expenses for which they are intended, they are tax-free, so they will not appear in the next year's AGI. They should not be treated as untaxed income (except in the cases mentioned above) or as estimated financial assistance. For more information on these benefits, see the IRS's Publication 970, T ax Benefits for Education . Reporting \"take-back\" mortgages In a take-back mortgage, the seller of a house finances a portion of its cost for the buyer, who repays this additional mortgage to the seller. The seller reports the inter - est part of any payments received from the buyer on Schedule B of IRS Form 1040. Therefore, if a student or his parents report such interest on the tax return, it likely indicates an asset that should be reported on the FAFSA: the value of the take-back mortgage. There would be no debt reported against this asset. For example, if a dependent student's parents sold their house for $200,000 and financed a take- back mortgage of $40,000 to the buyer, the parents should report $40,000 as the net worth of the investment. The worth will decrease each year depending on how much of the principal the buyer paid back that year. This concept applies to other forms of seller financing of the sale of a home or other property.UGMA and UTMA accounts The Uniform Gifts and Uniform Trans - fers to Minors Acts (UGMA and UTMA) allow the establishment of an account for gifts of cash and financial assets for a minor without the expense of creating a trust. Because the minor is the owner of the account, it counts as his asset on the FAFSA, not the asset of the custodian, who is often the parent.STEPS 2 & 4 Qualified tuition programs Fiscal year return example Owen's parents file a fiscal year tax return. They start their fiscal year in September. The return they filed for the fiscal year starting in September 2015 includes eight months in 2016. The re - turn they filed for the fiscal year starting in September 2016 only includes four months of 2016. Therefore, they should use the information from the tax return for the fiscal year that started in Sep - tember 2015.Rental properties Rental properties are an asset. A unit within a family home that has its own entrance, kitchen, and bath (therefore a rented bedroom would not count) and that is rented to someone other than a family member counts as an asset. To calculate its net value, multiply the net value of the entire structure by the fraction the rented space represents. Similarly, if a family owned a 10-unit apartment building and lived in one of the apartments, 9/10 or 90% of the net value of the building would be an asset. At times a student or parent will claim rental property as a business. Generally, it must be reported as real estate instead. A rental property would have to be part of a formally recognized business to be reported as such, and it usually would provide additional services like regular cleaning, linen, or maid service.AVG-19 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Retirement plans and whole life insurance. The value of retirement plans\u2014401(k) plans, pension funds, annuities, noneducation IRAs, Keogh plans, etc.\u2014is not counted as an asset, but distributions do count as income; they appear in the AGI if taxable and in questions 45 and 94 if untaxed. Similarly, the cash value or equity of a whole life insurance policy isn't reported as an asset, but an insurance settlement does count as income. The full amount of the distribution is reported, whether it was a lump sum or annual distribution, and it will count as taxable or untaxed income, as appropriate. An exception to reporting pension distributions is when they are rolled over into another retirement plan in the same tax year. Excluded assets for Native American students. The law (see HEA Sec. 479C) excludes reporting any income and asset of $2,000 or less per individual payment (any amount over $2,000 is reported as untaxed income) received under the Per Capita Act or the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. It also excludes any income received under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act or the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. Per capita distributions or the proceeds received from the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations\u2014a tribal purchase of fractionated lands as a result of the Cobell settlement under the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 1305)\u2014should also be excluded. Taxable income offsets (44 and 93). These questions total certain types of income and other monies that are excluded from income in the need analysis. The CPS subtracts these excluded amounts from the AGI when calculating the EFC. a. Education tax credits. These are the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits; the FAFSA refers to lines 50 and 33 on the 1040 and 1040A tax returns respectively. See the margin note. b. Child support payments. Count payments made during 2016 because of divorce, separation, or legal requirement by the student, spouse, or parent whose income is reported on the FAFSA. Don't include support for children in the household (see the example in the margin). Also, don't count child support received for a child in the household size; that is considered untaxed income. c. Taxable earnings from need-based work programs. This includes earnings from Federal Work-Study and need-based employment portions of fellowships or assistantships. The student uses the W-2s or other records she received for this income. d. Student grant and scholarship aid. A student reports only the amount of grants and scholarships received that is taxable income. This includes grant and scholarship (not employment) portions of fellowships and assistantships, as well as taxable stipends and employer tuition reimbursements. Include also AmeriCorps benefits (awards, living allowances, and interest accrual payments) except American Opportunity credit Part of this credit can be refundable, that is, payable to tax filers even if they do not owe any federal income tax. The nonrefundable portion appears on the same lines of the tax return and the FAFSA as the Lifetime Learning credit. The refundable portion appears on line 66 of the 1040 form and line 40 of the 1040A. It does not appear on the lines of the FAFSA for the education tax cred - its, nor does it count as untaxed income. Reimbursements and stipends Employers often help with education costs by paying stipends or reimburs - ing employees for classes taken. These benefits count as estimated financial assistance (or reduce the cost of atten - dance) even if they aren't received until the end of the class(es) and are contin - gent on earning a minimum grade. Any taxable portion received in the prior year and appearing in the AGI is entered in Question 44 or 93.When there are U.S. and foreign tax returns When a student or parent has returns from both a foreign nation and the United States for the same tax year, they should use the data from the U.S. return when filling out the FAFSA.STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 44 and 93 Excluded assets and income offsetsAVG-20 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Reporting trust funds Trust funds in the name of a student, spouse, or parent should be reported as that person's asset on the application, generally even if the beneficiary's access to the trust is restricted. If the settlor of a trust has voluntarily placed restrictions on its use, then the student should report its present value as an asset, as discussed below. If a trust has been restricted by court order, however, the student should not report it. An example of such a restricted trust is one set up by court order to pay for future surgery for the victim of a car accident. How the trust must be reported depends on whether the student (or dependent student's parent) receives or will receive the inter - est income, the trust principal, or both. In the case of a divorce or separation where the trust is owned jointly and ownership is not being contested, the property and the debt are equally divided between the owners for reporting purposes unless the terms of the trust specify some other method of division. Interest only If a student, spouse, or parent receives only the interest from the trust, any interest received in the base year must be reported as income. If the interest accumulates and is not paid out, the recipient must report an asset value for the interest she will receive. The trust officer can usually calculate the value of the interest the person will receive while the trust exists. This value represents the amount a third person would be willing to pay for the interest income. Principal only The person who will receive only the trust principal must report as an asset the present value of his right to that principal. For example, if a $10,000 principal reverts to a dependent student's parents when the trust ends in 10 years and the student is receiv - ing the interest, he would report the interest he received as income and report as a parental asset the present value of his parents' rights to the principal. The present value of the principal can be calculated by the trust officer; it's the amount that a third person would pay for the right to receive the principal 10 years from now\u2014basically, the amount that one would have to deposit now to receive $10,000 in 10 years. Both principal and interest If a student, spouse, or parent receives both the interest and the principal from the trust, the student should report the present value of both interest and principal, as described in the discussion of principal only. If the trust is set up so that the interest accumu - lates within the trust until it ends, the beneficiary should report as an asset the present value of the interest and principal that she is expected to receive when the trust ends. Ownership of an asset In some cases the ownership of an asset is divided or contested, which can affect how the student reports the asset. Part ownership of asset If the parent or student has only part ownership of an asset, the student should report only the owned part. Generally the value of an asset and debts against it should be divided equally by the number of people who share ownership unless the share of the asset is determined by the amount invested or the terms of the arrangement specify some other means of division. Contested ownership Assets shouldn't be reported if the ownership is being contested. For instance, if the parents are separated and can't sell or borrow against jointly owned property because it's being contested, the parent reporting FAFSA information would not list any net worth for the property. However, if the ownership of the property is not being contested, the parent would report the property as an asset. If ownership of an asset is resolved after the initial application is filed, the student can't update this information. Lien against, and imminent foreclosure of, an asset If there's a lien against the asset, the net value of the asset is determined by subtracting from its total value any associated debt as well as the amount of the lien. If foreclosure of an asset is imminent, the net value of the asset would still be reported until the party making the foreclosure completes legal action to take possession of the asset. If the status of the property changes after the application is filed, the student can't update the asset information.AVG-21 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 those for health care or child care. The filer usually writes the taxable amount of the grant or scholarship separately on the tax form next to the line where wages and other earnings are reported. If the amount was reported this way, the student can copy it from the tax form. e. Combat pay. Enter only the portion that was included in adjusted gross income. This should be zero for enlisted persons and warrant officers (including commissioned warrant officers) because their combat pay is entirely nontaxable. For commissioned officers generally, combat pay in excess of the highest enlisted person's pay (plus imminent danger/hostile fire pay) is taxable. To determine the taxable amount, find the total combat pay from the serviceperson's leave and earnings statements and subtract the untaxed portion, which is reported in box 12 of the W-2 form with code Q. See IRS Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide , for more information. f. College cooperative education program earnings from work. The student uses the W-2s or other records she received for these earnings. Untaxed income (45 and 94). These questions total the untaxed income, some of which is reported on the tax form even though it isn't taxed. A student who hasn't filed a return will have to estimate these amounts, and students or parents may need to separate information from a joint return. a. Payments to tax-deferred or sheltered pension and savings plans (paid directly or withheld from earnings). This includes untaxed portions of 401(k) and 403(b) plans. These types of payments are listed in boxes 12a through 12d of the W-2 and will have one of the following codes: D, E, F, G, H, or S. Note that employer contributions to these plans shouldn't be reported as an untaxed benefit. b. Deductible IRA or Keogh payments. Payments to an IRA or Keogh plan that are excluded from taxation are reported as untaxed income. These amounts appear on the tax return. c. Child support received for all children. d. Tax-exempt interest income. Certain types of interest, such as interest on municipal bonds, are tax-exempt. This amount is on line 8b on both the 1040 and 1040A forms. e. and f. Untaxed IRA distributions and pension or annuity payments. A tax filer determines how much of his IRA distribution or pension or annuity payment is taxable when he completes his tax return. The applicant reports the untaxed portion, which is determined from the tax return, but should not include rollovers (transfers of funds from one IRA to another). g. Housing, food, and other living allowances. Some people, such as clergy, receive these allowances as compensation for their jobs. Money received to pay for rent should also be reported, as should the free use of a house or apartment (the rent or market value of a comparable Child support payments example Steven and his wife each have a child from a previous relationship who doesn't live with them and for whom they pay child support. Because Steven provides over half of his daughter's sup - port through his payments, he counts her in his household size. Therefore, he doesn't report the amount of child sup - port he pays on his FAFSA. Steven's wife isn't providing over half of her son's support, so he isn't included in Steven's household size. Therefore, Steven can report the amount of child support his wife pays.STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 45 and 94 Untaxed income Health savings accounts Health savings accounts (HSAs) resem - ble tax-deferred pension and savings plans more than flexible spending ar - rangements; for example, the balance in an HSA persists from year to year, while that in a flexible spending arrangement must be spent on qualified expenses by the end of the year. Therefore, treat tax- free contributions to an HSA as untaxed income; these will appear on line 25 of the 2016 IRS Form 1040. The balance in the account does not count as an asset, nor would distributions from it count as untaxed income when they are used for qualified medical expenses. Distribu - tions not used for qualified expenses are subject to income tax (and a pos - sible penalty) and will be counted in the adjusted gross income.AVG-22 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 house or apartment can be used). Similarly, if the student received free room or board in 2016 for a job that was not awarded as student financial aid (including resident advisor positions that provide free room and board as part of the student's non-need-based employment compensation), she must report the value of the room and board as untaxed income. Members of the U.S. military report their basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) but not their basic allowance for housing (BAH). h. Veterans' noneducation benefits. This includes disability, the death pension, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), and Veterans Affairs (V A) educational work-study allowances. i. Any other untaxed income not reported elsewhere. This includes disability (but not Social Security disability), worker's compensation, tax-free contributions to HSAs (see the margin note), interest income on education IRAs, untaxed portions of Railroad Retirement benefits, black lung benefits, refugee assistance, the untaxed portion of capital gains, and foreign income that wasn't taxed by any government and isn't part of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. j. Money received (45 only). The student reports any cash support he received, but if dependent he does not count his parents' support, with one exception: money from a noncustodial parent that is not part of a legal child support agreement is untaxed income to the student. Cash support includes money and gifts and housing, food, clothing, car payments or expenses, medical and dental care, college costs, and money paid to someone else or paid for on his behalf. For example, if a friend or relative pays his electric bill or part of his rent, he must report the amount as untaxed income. If he is living with a friend who pays the rent and the student's name is on the lease, the rent paid on his behalf counts as cash support because he is responsible for payments that his friend is making. Note that only the student reports this item\u2014it does not appear in the parents' question. Tips on reporting benefits: The student reports the actual amount of benefits received during the year, even if it is an underpayment or an overpayment that will be cor - rected in the next year. However, if the underpayment or overpayment was adjusted in the same year, only the net amount received during that year would be reported. Benefits the student or parent receives on behalf of anyone included in his FAFSA household size count as income to him unless the person is an adult, e.g., a grandmother (a child would not count) who receives the benefits in her name. Such a person is not included in the house - hold size if benefits in her name total more than half of her support. Income and benefits NOT to be included: Student aid is accounted for in packaging (see Volume 3: Calculating Awards and Packaging ); it does not count as income in the calculation STEPS 2 & 4 Questions 45 and 94 Untaxed income Box 14 items on the W-2 Schools are not required to review in - come listed in box 14 of the IRS's W-2 form. There are a few reasons for this. Several of the items the IRS suggests could be reported in box 14 are cap - tured already on the FAFSA (in adjusted gross income for instance); also, em - ployers could include in box 14 certain nonelective pension plan contributions, and nonelective contributions should not be counted in the need analysis. Finally, because no employer is required to provide information in box 14, it is unlikely that employers will be consis - tent in what they report there. But if you are aware that a box 14 item should be reported\u2014i.e., if it represents discretionary income\u2014you should count it on the pertinent line. For exam - ple, clergy parsonage allowances often appear in box 14, and you would count that on line g of Question 45 or 94.Independent student with parental support example Doug is a graduate student, so he's independent even though he still lives with his parents and has no income of his own. Although the FAA at his school can't make him a dependent student, she can decide to use professional judg - ment to add an amount to his untaxed income to account for the in-kind sup - port his parents provide.Extended foster care payments Foster children who meet certain crite - ria can receive benefits until age 21. If these extended payments are under the authority of Title IV, Part E, of the Social Security Act, they are not reported on the FAFSA. If they are paid under some other authority, e.g., a state foster youth support program, they are reported as untaxed income to the student in Ques - August 2018 of the EFC. Student aid includes tuition benefits a parent receives for a dependent, such as those from the parent's employer. Student aid that was included in the AGI is reported separately as an exclusion so that it can be subtracted from income. Veterans' education benefits. Appendix A in Chapter 7 of Volume 3 for 2017-2018 has the list of excluded benefits. See also the pertinent electronic announcement from 2009 . The value of on-base housing or the BAH for students or parents in the U.S. military. However, the BAS does count as untaxed income. Rent subsidies for low-income housing. Payments and services received from states for foster care or adoption assistance, under Part A or Part E of Title IV of the Social Security Act (e.g., Wisconsin's Adoption Assistance Program, which facilitates the adoption of children with special needs). Per capita payments to Native Americans. See page 19. Heating/fuel assistance. This includes payments or allowances received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act (LIHEA). Payments under the LIHEA are made through state programs that may have different names. Flexible spending arrangements. These are employee benefit programs, sometimes called \"cafeteria plans. \" Neither contributions to nor payments from these programs should count as untaxed income. Welfare benefits, untaxed Social Security benefits, and the earned income and additional child tax credits. Welfare benefits are means- tested state or federal supplementary assistance. Examples are benefits from Medicaid (including the Children's Health Insurance Program), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Combat pay, foreign income exclusion, and credit for federal tax on special fuels. In-kind support is other than money, for example, friends or relatives giving the student food or allowing him to live with them rent-free. That support isn't included as untaxed income, though you may use professional judgment (e.g., by reducing the cost of attendance or increasing income) with students who receive such in-kind support. This is not the same as housing and other allowances received as compensation for a job, which, as stated earlier, must be reported. If the student is living with someone who is paying living expenses, it can be difficult to determine whether the support is cash support or in-kind support. The basic rule is: if someone pays a cost the student is obligated to pay, the amount counts as cash support.Dependent benefits example Stanislaw's uncle Yvor lives with him and receives a small disability payment each month. This amount is paid directly to Yvor, so Stanislaw doesn't report it as income when he completes the FAFSA. The payment is small enough that Stanislaw is still providing more than half of Yvor's support, and because he expects to continue to provide more than half support during the award year, he includes Yvor as a dependent in his household size. However, starting the July after the current award year, Yvor expects to also start receiving a pension. The combination of the pension and the disability payment will be enough that Stanislaw won't be providing more than half of his uncle's support and therefore won't be able to include Yvor in his household size after this award year.STEPS 2 & 4 Untaxed income not reported on the FAFSA Puerto Rico tax exemption Act 135-2014 amended the Puerto Rico tax code to exempt from income taxa - tion (but not from Social Security and Medicare taxation) up to $40,000 of in - come for employees 16 to 26 years old. The exemption is due to last through December 31, 2019. For student tax filers who receive the exemption, because the EFC for - mula uses AGI for tax filers, the exempt amount should be included in the income earned from work and in other untaxed income. For students who do not file a return and are not required to file, the exempt amount should be included in the income earned from work only and not in untaxed income. This is to avoid double-counting the amount because for non-filers income earned from work is used in place of the AGI.AVG-24 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA 2018 Dependency statusSTEP THREE: DEPENDENCY STATUS Purpose: The law governing the FSA programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student's support, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of his parents for aid eligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from his parents does not affect his dependency status. For the 2018-2019 year, a student who meets any of the following criteria from HEA Sec. 480(d) is independent; he was born before January 1, 1995; is married as of the date he applies; will be a graduate or professional student when the award year starts; is currently serving on active duty for purposes other than training; is a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces; has dependents other than a spouse; was an orphan, foster child, or ward/dependent of the court at any time since the age of 13; is an emancipated minor or in legal guardianship or was when he reached the age of majority in his state; or was determined at any time since July 1, 2017, to be an unaccompa - nied youth who was homeless or self-supporting and at risk of being homeless. If a student is considered a dependent of his parents, their income and assets must be included on the FAFSA. The CPS will calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student's contribution to derive an EFC. In unusual cases an aid administrator can determine that a student who doesn't meet any of the independence criteria should still be treated as an independent student. (See \"Dependency Overrides\" in Chapter 5 .) Married (47). The student must answer this question according to her marital status at the time the FAFSA is signed; after that, she cannot update FAFSA information for changes in her marital status except in limited instances; see Chapter 4 . A student who is only engaged answers as unmarried unless she waits until after the wedding to complete the FAFSA. For this question a student is considered married if she is separated or planning to divorce or if she has a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law mar - riage in her state. A student who was independent only because she was married becomes dependent for the next award year if she divorces and cannot answer \"Y es\" to any of the dependency questions. Graduate or professional study (48). The FAFSA asks if the student will be working on a master's, doctorate, or graduate certificate program at the beginning of the school year. A student who is a graduate or professional student is independent for purposes of Title IV aid.Early exit cadets Students who attend a U.S. military academy or military academy prepara - tory school and are discharged other than dishonorably prior to commis - sion are veterans for FSA purposes but might not be veterans for VA purposes. These students' match re - sults will likely show that they aren't veterans. As with other students who receive these match results, if an early exit cadet meets one of the other cri - teria for independence, no resolution is required. But if he meets no other independence criteria, he must pro - vide the school with documentation that shows he was a cadet of a military academy or its preparatory school.Military service academies and preparatory schools U.S. Military Academy (West Point) U.S. Naval Academy (Annapolis) U.S. Air Force Academy U.S. Coast Guard Academy U.S. Merchant Marine Academy U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School Naval Academy Preparatory School U.S. Air Force Academy Preparatory School Example: surviving parent and stepparent Al's parents divorced when he was seven. His mother later remarried, and Al lived with her and his stepfather, who did not adopt him. His mother died last year, but his father is still living. Al doesn't meet any of the independence criteria, so he's a dependent student. Because his father is his only surviving parent, Al needs to report his father's information on the form, even though he's still living with and being supported by his stepfather.AVG-25 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Graduate and professional students aren't eligible for Pell grants, so a student who incorrectly answers \"Y es\" to this question must submit a correction before he can get a Pell grant, even if he is independent for another reason. Students should fill out the FAFSA based on their expected grade level at the beginning of the award year. If a dependent student completes her undergraduate program during the year and begins graduate school, she can update the answer to the dependency question so that the CPS can reprocess her application, or the aid administrator at the graduate school can recalculate her EFC and use it to package her graduate aid. Member or veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces (49 and 50). Veterans and persons on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces (the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard) for purposes other than training are independent. Veterans are those who were in active service and were released under a condition other than \"dishonorable. \" This includes those who fraudulently entered the service, as long as their entire period of service was not voided. There is no minimum amount of time the student has to have served to be a veteran\u2014even one day counts and even basic training (boot camp) counts\u2014but it does have to be active service. (See the following rules for reservists.) This is less stringent than the V A 's definition of a veteran for receiving certain V A benefits. The application also tells students to answer \"Y es\" to the question about veteran status if they aren't yet a veteran but will be by June 30, 2019. Students who attended a U.S. service academy or preparatory school (see margin note on page 24) for at least one day and were released under conditions other than \"dishonorable\" count as veterans for Title IV purposes. Students serving in ROTC or currently attending a U.S. military academy are not veterans. Members of the National Guard or Reserves are only considered veterans if they were called up to active federal duty by presidential order for a purpose other than training. It does not matter how long the active duty lasted or if the student returned to reserve status afterward, but, as with the other qualifying veterans, the student must have had a character of service that was not \"dishonorable. \" Children and legal dependents (51 and 52). Students who have legal dependents are independent. Legal dependents comprise children (including those who will be born before the end of the award year) of the student who receive more than half their support from the student, and other persons (except a spouse) who live with and receive more than half their support from the student as of the FAFSA signing date and will continue to do so for the award year. The same criteria apply to household size.STEP 3 Questions 48-52 Dependency status Legal dependent examples Laurel is going to college and is her cousin Paul's legal guardian. Paul receives Social Security benefits, but because he's a minor, the benefits are paid to Laurel on his behalf. These benefits provide more than half of Paul's support. Because Paul lives with Laurel and will be supported by her (through the Social Security benefits) throughout the award year, Laurel answers \"Yes\" to the legal dependent question. If Paul didn't live with Laurel, she would have to answer \"No\" to the question. Alan pays $4,000 to support his girlfriend, Cathy, who lives with him. She has earned income of $3,000, and she receives $200 a month ($2,400 a year) from her parents. She uses all of this for her support. Alan cannot consider Cathy a dependent since the $4,000 he provides is not more than half of her total support of $9,400. In April 2018 Anika applies for aid for 2017-2018. One month prior to that, her cousin Bettina came to live with her. Even though Anika provides all of her cousin's support, the one month of support she has given plus the two months left in the award year would not amount to more than 50% for the entire year, so she can't consider Bettina her dependent for 2017-2018. If Bettina had moved in just before the midpoint of the year, Anika would have been able to count her as a dependent for 2017-2018.AVG-26 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Veteran match (for Question 50) If the student answers \"Yes\" to the question about veteran status, the CPS performs a match with VA records to confirm that status. The VA sends the result back, which appears as a match flag in the FAA Information section of the output document. For flags 2, 3, and 4, a comment and a C flag will appear on the SAR only if veteran status is the sole reason that the student would be indepen - dent. See the guide SAR Comment Codes and Text: 2018-2019 on the IFAP website. Successful match (match flag 1) There won't be any comments on the output document if the VA confirms that the student is a veteran. Not a veteran (match flag 2) A student will receive this flag if the VA database indicates he is not a veteran. If the student answered \"Yes\" to one of the other de - pendency questions, he is independent based on that question and can receive student aid without resolving his veteran status. If the student answered \"No\" to all the other dependency questions and he believes he is a qualifying veteran, he should provide the financial aid office at his school a copy of his DD214 (the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, with \"Character of Ser - vice\" as anything but \"dishonorable\"). If it shows that he is a veteran, he can receive aid as an independent student. A dependency override is not necessary because the CPS accepts his \"Yes\" answer to the veteran question. If a National Guardsman or a reservist who served on active duty (for other than training) did not receive a DD214 but can obtain a letter from a superior officer that docu - ments the call-up to active duty and that classifies the character of service as anything but \"dishonorable, \" the student will be con - sidered a veteran for FSA purposes. If the student turns out not to be a veteran, he will need to change his answer to the question from \"Yes\" to \"No\" and provide parent information, including a parent's signature. If the VA match problem is due to an error in the VA's database, the student should contact the VA and correct the error. A subse - quent transaction will then redo the match with the VA. Not in database (match flag 3) Much of the guidance above applies for students not in the VA database: if the student is independent for a reason other than be - ing a veteran, she doesn't need to resolve the problem before receiving student aid, although she should have the VA correct its database if it's wrong. If she answered \"No\" to the other dependency questions, she must either correct any problem with the VA, provide documentation showing she is a veteran or will be one by June 30, 2019, or, if she is not a veteran and will not be one by that date, provide parent data and change her response to the question from \"Yes\" to \"No. \" Active duty (match flag 4) If the student is currently on active duty, he isn't a veteran yet, but if his active duty will end by June 30, 2019, he counts as a vet - eran for dependency status. Because he should have answered \"Yes\" to the active duty question, he would be independent by that criterion and wouldn't have to resolve this situation. Documentation of foster youth (for Question 53) If you have cause to require documentation from students who indicate that they were in foster care since turning 13, the follow - ing are examples of documents that could attest the student's former foster youth status: a copy of a court order; the statement of a state or county child welfare agency; the statement of a private provider agency that delivers child welfare services; or the statement from an attorney, guardian ad litem, or court-appointed special advocate documenting the person's relationship to the student as well as the latter's foster youth status.AVG-27 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 When a student applies after the award year has begun, in order to count a person not her child as a dependent, the support already given that year plus the future support must total more than 50% for the whole year. See the margin example. Orphan, foster child, or ward of the court (53). A student who was an orphan \u2014both her parents were dead\u2014when 13 or older is independent even if she was subsequently adopted. Likewise, a student who was at any time since the age of 13 a foster child or a ward of the court is independent even if her status changed later. A student is a ward of the court if it has assumed legal custody of her. In some states the court may impose its authority over a juvenile who remains in the legal custody of her parents; such a student is not a ward of the court. Also, incarceration of a student does not qualify her as a ward of the court. In some states the phrase \"ward of the state\" is used. This is considered the same as a ward of the court for dependency status as long as the student is a ward of the state not due to incarceration. Emancipation and legal guardianship (54 and 55). Students are independent if they are, or were upon reaching the age of majority, emancipated minors (released from control of their parent or guardian) or in legal guardianship, both as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of the students' legal residence at the time of the adjudication. While the basis for emancipation can vary by state, the emancipation must be determined by a court, not by an attorney. Students in legal guardianship to their parents\u2014for instance, if they are disabled adults and under their parents' care\u2014are not independent for Title IV program purposes by this criterion and would answer \"No\" to Question 55. They should also answer \"No\" and contact your school if custody was awarded by a court and the court papers say \"custody\" instead of \"guardianship. \" Most states have a clear definition of legal guardianship that is distinct from custody, but if a given state does not, you should consult your school's legal counsel for help with this question. Unaccompanied homeless youth (56-58). A student is independent if at any time on or after July 1, 2017 (irrespective of whether he is currently homeless or at risk thereof), he is determined to be an unaccompanied youth who is homeless or is self-supporting and at risk of being homeless. This determination can be made by: a school district homeless liaison, the director (or designee) of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or the director (or designee) of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program. Depending on the district, these authorities may choose to make this determination only if the student is receiving their programs' services or if, in the case of a school district homeless liaison, the student is in high school. An FAA may also determine this; see Chapter 5 . Beginning in 2018-2019, students who are 22 or 23 years old may also answer \"Y es\" to these questions.Student living with relatives example Millie's father is dead, and her mother can't support her, so she is living with her grandmother. Her mother doesn't pay any money for her support. Millie doesn't meet any of the independence criteria, so she has to provide parental information. Because her grandmother hasn't adopted her, her grandmother isn't her parent. Millie will have to pro - vide information about her mother on the form unless there are unusual circumstances that would warrant a de - pendency override or her receiving only unsubsidized loans. In any case, the school might use PJ to account for the grandmother's support.STEP 4 Questions 53-58 Dependency status Dependent student household size example Lydia is a dependent student, and her parents are married. Her brother Ron is 26, but his parents still provide more than 50% of his support, so he is included in the household size. Her sister Elizabeth is attending college but is an independent student and isn't supported by their parents, so she isn't included in the household size. Her sister Susan is not attending college but is working and supporting herself. However, if Susan were to apply for student aid, she would be considered a dependent student, so she is included. Therefore, the household size that Lydia reports for her parents is five.AVG-28 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Other sources of support for children and other household members If the student is receiving support to raise her child, is the child still considered a legal dependent? If one or both of the student's parents are directly or indirectly providing more than 50% support in cash or other assistance to the child, then the student would answer \"No\" to the FAFSA question about legal dependents. \"Indirect support\" to the child includes support that a parent gives to the student on behalf of the child. If the student is living with a parent who is paying for most of the household expenses, the parent would usually be considered the primary source of support to the child, and the student would answer \"No\" to the question about legal dependents. However, there may be some cases where the student can demonstrate that she provides more than half of her child's support even while living at home, in which case she would answer \"Yes\" to the question about legal dependents. When the student receives money for the child from any source other than her parents, she may count it as part of her support to the child. Sources include child support and government programs, such as TANF and SNAP (formerly the federal Food Stamp Pro - gram), that provide benefits for dependent children. So a student may be considered independent when the benefit she receives is the primary support for her child. For example, if a student who lives alone with her child receives cash from her boyfriend that amounts to more than 50% support for her child, then she would be able to count the child as a dependent and in her household size, and she would be independent. If the boyfriend is the father of the child and a student himself, then he would also be able to count the child as a dependent and in his household size, and he would be independent too.Who does and does not count as a parent on the FAFSA? If the applicant answers \"No\" to questions 46-58, then she is dependent and must report her parents' information in Step 4 on the FAFSA. In most cases it's clear who the parents are but not always. Biological, adoptive, and stepparents A parent is a biological or adoptive parent or a person that the state has determined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person's name to be listed as a parent on a birth certificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts in their household size. Biological and adoptive (whether of the opposite or same sex) parents who are unmarried and living together give that as their status in Question 59, and both report their information on the FAFSA. See DCL GEN-13-12. However, a stepparent who did not adopt the student cannot be the sole parent for determining dependency status. If the other parent dies, the student is still a dependent of the remaining biological parent, not the stepparent. If no biological parent remains, the student answers \"Yes\" to Question 53 and is independent. Foster parents, legal guardians, and relatives A foster parent or a legal guardian is not treated as a parent for FSA purposes. If at any time since the age of 13 both of the student's parents were dead (and he did not have an adoptive parent) or he was in foster care, he is independent. If he is now, or was when he became an adult, an emancipated minor or in legal guardianship (see the exception under Question 55), he is independent. If a student is living with her grandparents or other relatives, their data should not be reported on the FAFSA as parental data un - less they have adopted the student. Any cash support from persons other than the student's parents should be reported as untaxed income, as discussed in Step 2. The school may also consider other kinds of support as part of the student's financial resources and use professional judgment to include the support under the item for student's untaxed income (see Chapter 5 on professional judg 2\u2014Filling Out (DEPENDENT STUDENTS ONLY) Purpose: Questions 59-79 collect information about the student's par - ents and their household. Questions 80-94 collect tax and financial data for the parents, and because these questions are answered in the same way as for the student, they were discussed earlier. Parents' personal information (59-69). The FAFSA asks for parents' marital status; the month and year they were married, separated, divorced, or widowed; SSN; last name; first initial; and date of birth. This information is used for the IRS Data Retrieval in FOTW and helps the government estimate erroneous Pell payments. If the SSN, last name, and birth date for at least one parent are not provided, or if neither parent's SSN matches with the SSA, the application will be rejected. When the SSN doesn't match with SSA, the wrong number must be corrected so that the application and SSA agree. For a name or birth date that doesn't match, correct the application if it's wrong or re-enter the information if it's correct. If the parent doesn't have an SSN, enter 000-00-0000 to prevent or remove a reject code. (See also the SSN chapter in Volume 1 .) Parents' state of residence (70-72). Parents who do not live in the United States should enter \"FC\" for Question 70. Household size (73). This determines the standard living allowance that offsets family income in the EFC calculation. The following persons count in the household size of a dependent student's parents: The student and parents, even if the student is not living with them. Exclude a parent who has died or is not living in the household because of separation or divorce, but include a parent who is on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces apart from the family. The student's siblings and children, if they will receive more than half their support from the student's parent(s) from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. Siblings need not live in the home. This includes unborn children and siblings of the student who will receive more than half support from the student's parent(s) from birth to the end of the award year. It also includes siblings who would be considered dependent based on the FAFSA dependency questions (i.e., they need not be students nor apply for aid). For children in the household size, the \"support test\" is used rather than residency because there may be situations in which a parent supports a child who does not live with her, such as when the parent is divorced or separated. If the parent receives benefits (such as Social Security payments) in the child's name, these benefits must be counted as parental support to the child. Other persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the student's parent(s) and will receive more than half support for the entire award year. When the application is submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant paragraph and example about legal STEP 4 Questions 59-73 Parent information and household size FSA and IRS household rules The rules that decide whether someone is counted in the household for FSA purposes aren't identical to the IRS rules for determining dependents or household members. Service academies, household size, and number in college Students at U.S. service academies (see the margin note on page 24) have most of their primary educational expenses paid for by the federal government. Because of this, their families cannot \"reasonably be expected to contribute to their postsecondary education\" and they are not counted in the number in college in the families of either depen - dent or independent students. Since they will not receive more than one-half of their support from any person, they also do not count in the household size of any independent students and some dependent students. However, if a service academy attendee is a sibling of a dependent student and can answer \"No\" to all the dependency status ques - tions, he would count in the household size of that dependent student. HEA Sec. 474(b)(3); 480(k),(l)AVG-30 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 dependents on page 25. See also the margin note on foster children on page 33. Number in college (74). The applicant always counts in the number in college, but parents do not. Others included in the household size are also included in the number in college if they are or will be enrolled at least half time during the award year in an eligible degree or certificate program at a school eligible for any of the FSA programs. The definition of half-time enrollment for this question must meet the federal requirements even if the school defines half time differently. (See Volume 1: Student Eligibility for enrollment status requirements.) Receipt of means-tested federal benefits (75-79). This as an alternative for the tax return requirement of the simplified needs and automatic zero EFC tests. Tax forms filed by parents, filing status, income, and assets (80-83, 85-94). Refer to the earlier discussion for these questions. Dislocated worker (84). This status, as defined in the Workforce In - novation and Opportunity Act or WIOA, is an alternative to the tax return and means-tested federal benefits criteria for determining if a person qualifies for the simplified needs test or automatic zero EFC. A person would answer \"Y es\" to this question if she meets the statutory definition of dislocated worker but does not appear to because of the general nature of the FAFSA instructions. Under the WIOA, a dislo - cated worker is someone who falls into at least one of these categories: A person who meets all of the following requirements: She was terminated or laid off from employment or received a notice of termination or layoff. She is eligible for or has exhausted her unemployment compen - sation, or she is not eligible for it because, even though she has been employed long enough to demonstrate attachment to the workforce, she had insufficient earnings or performed services for an employer that weren't covered under a state's unemployment compensation law. She is unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation. A person who was terminated or laid off from employment or re - ceived a notice of termination or layoff as a result of any permanent clo - sure of, or any substantial layoff at, a plant, facility, or enterprise A person who is employed at a facility at which the employer made a general announcement that it will close within 180 days A person who is employed at a facility at which the employer made a general announcement that it will close A self-employed person (including farmers, ranchers, or fishermen) who is unemployed because of natural disasters or because of general economic conditions in his communitySTEP 4 Questions 74-84 Number in college, benefits, tax data, and dislocated worker Response of \"Don't know\" \"Don't know\" is treated as \"No\" by the CPS. If a person gives this response, you are not required to verify it, but you may want to determine if he is a dislo - cated worker and if that would affect the student's eligibility for federal aid.Number in college HEA Sec. 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Reporting information in cases of death, separation, divorce, and remarriage Death of a parent If one, but not both, of the student's parents has died, the student answers the parental questions about the surviving biological or adoptive parent and does not report any financial information for the deceased parent. If both her parents are dead when she fills out the FAFSA, she must answer \"Yes\" to Question 53, making her independent. Remember that an adoptive parent counts as a parent, but a legal guardian doesn't. If the surviving parent dies after the FAFSA has been filed, the student must update her depen - dency status and report income and assets as an independent student. Stepparent A stepparent is treated like a biological parent if the stepparent has legally adopted the student or if the stepparent is married, as of the date of application, to a student's biological or adoptive parent whose information will be reported on the FAFSA. There are no exceptions. A prenuptial agreement does not exempt the stepparent from providing information required of a parent on the FAFSA. The stepparent's income information for the entire base year, 2016, must be reported even if the parent and stepparent were not married until after 2016. See above for how to fill out the parent questions when the stepparent's spouse (the biological parent) dies; if the stepparent has not adopted the student, he would no longer provide parental information as before, but any financial support he gives to the student would be counted as untaxed income. Divorce of the student's parents If the student's parents are divorced, he should report the information of the parent with whom he lived longer during the 12 months prior to the date he completes the application, regardless of which parent claimed him as an exemption for tax purposes. If the student lived equally with each parent or didn't live with either one, then he should provide the information for the parent from whom he received more financial support or the one from whom he received more support the last calendar year for which it was given. Note that it is not typical that a student will live with or receive support from both parents exactly equally. Usually you can determine that the student lived with one of the parents more than half the year or that he received more than half support from one of the parents. Example: Marta is 22 and doesn't meet any of the independence criteria. Her parents divorced recently, and she hasn't lived with them since she was 18. Also, neither parent provided support in the past year. The last time she received support from her parents was when she lived with them and they were still married. Because her father's income was larger and he contrib - uted more money to the overall household expenses, Marta determines that the last time she received support, most of it was from her father. She provides his data on the FAFSA. If biological or adoptive parents who are divorced still live together, their status is unmarried and living together and both would report their information on the FAFSA; see page 28. If one or both of them have married someone else and all live in the same household (and presumably the student lived with both parents an equal amount of time), the parent and stepparent, if applicable, who provided more support in the previous year would include their information on the FAFSA. Schools may use PJ to account for the other parent's financial contribution that is not already properly counted as child support on line 45c or money received on line 45j of the 2018-2019 FAFSA. Separation of the student's parents or the student and spouse A couple need not be legally separated to be considered separated\u2014they may deem themselves informally separated when one of the partners has left the household for an indefinite period and the marriage is severed. For a dependent student, use the rules for divorce to determine which parent's information to report. While a married couple that lives together can't be informally separated, in some states they can be legally separated. If their state allows this, and if they are still living together and are legally separated, then that is their status on the FAFSA unless they are the parents of a dependent student, in which case their status is unmarried and living together and both would report their information. Common-law marriage If a couple lives together and has not been formally married but meets the criteria in their state for a common-law marriage, they should be reported as married on the FAFSA. If the state doesn't consider their situation to be a common-law marriage, then they aren't married; parents of a dependent student would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check with the appropri - ate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage. HEA Sec. 475(f)AVG-32 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 A spouse of an active duty member of the Armed Forces who has ex - perienced a loss of employment because of relocating due to permanent change in duty station A spouse of an active duty member of the Armed Forces who is un - employed or underemployed and is experiencing difficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment A displaced homemaker who meets all of the following criteria: She has been providing unpaid services to family members in the home. She has been dependent on the income of another family member but is no longer supported by that income. She is unemployed or underemployed and is having difficulty ob - taining or upgrading employment. An \"underemployed\" person is one who is working part time but wants to work full time or one who is working below the demonstrated level of her educa - tion or job skills. Not everyone who receives unemployment benefits will meet the definition of dislocated worker. For example, in general those who quit their jobs are not considered dislocated workers, even if they are receiving unemployment benefits. Y ou are not required to verify the answer to this question. If you choose to verify it, documentation can include, as appropriate to the category, a letter or a layoff or termination notice from the employer, unemployment insurance (UI) system verification, tax returns, a business license, or newspaper articles. Y ou may also use documents from the state workforce agency or a \"one-stop career center, \" though they are not required to provide you such documentation and a person may meet the dislocated worker definition without going to the workforce investment system for services. Absent all other evidence, self-certification will suffice, such as a statement signed by the person affirming that he meets the definition of dislocated worker. Information from the workforce investment system . The local workforce investment system and state UI agency may support financial aid administrators by providing general information to dislocated workers; providing general information to financial aid administrators, such as the WIOA definition of dislocated workers and appropriate sam - ples of documentation that financial aid offices can request from an individual to verify dislocated worker status; providing specific information to dislocated workers. A person can request documentation from the career center or other appropri - ate office that he is receiving dislocated worker services through the workforce investment system. That office can give the documenta - tion to him, or at his request it may (but is not obligated to) give the documentation directly to the college.STEP 4 Question 84 Dislocated CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 If you must determine if someone is a dislocated worker, you have sole responsibility and must make the determination regardless of whether the person has proof of dislocated worker status\u2014or is receiving dislo - cated worker services\u2014from the workforce investment system. STEP FIVE: INDEPENDENT STUDENT DATA Purpose: Questions 95-102 collect information about independent students. Only students who answered \"Yes\" to one or more questions in Step Three complete this step. Student's household size (95). The following persons are included in the household size of an independent student: The student and his or her spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or divorce. The student's children, regardless of where they live, if they will receive more than half of their support from the student from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. This includes the student's unborn children who will be born during the award year and will receive more than half their support from the student from birth to the end of the award year. Other persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the student and will receive more than half support for the entire award year. For FAFSAs submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant paragraph and example about legal dependents on page 25. See also the margin note on foster children. Number in college (96). The student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the household size who are or will be enrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school and who can reasonably be expected to receive aid from the family for their education. The definition of half-time enrollment for this question must meet the federal requirements even if the school defines half time differently. Receipt of means-tested federal benefits (97-101). This is an alternative for the tax return requirement of the simplified needs and automatic zero EFC tests. Dislocated worker (102). See the explanation of Question 84 earlier.STEP 5 Questions 95-102 Independent student household size, number in college, federal benefits Independent student household size example Eddy is an independent student. He was married, but now he and his wife have separated. He's paying child support, but it isn't enough to provide more than half his children's support, so he can't include his children in his household size. Eddy's nephew Chavo lives with him and gets more than half of his sup - port from Eddy (and will do so for the award year), so he can be counted in Eddy's household size, which is two. Having just turned 24, Chavo is also independent, and his household size is one.Foster children in household size Typically foster children do not count in the household size as their costs are covered by foster care payments. How - ever, children in \"kinship foster care\" for whom no benefits are provided can count in the household size if they meet the tests for other persons, i.e., if they live with and receive more than half their support from their foster parents for the award year.AVG-34 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 STEP SIX: SCHOOL INFORMATION Purpose: These items collect information about which colleges the stu - dent wants to receive his FAFSA information. For a college to be able to receive his data, the student must list the college's federal school code (not the OPE ID) or enter its complete name, address, city, and state. There is a federal school code search on fafsa.gov , and the entire list of school codes is available in portable document format (PDF) and Excel on the IFAP site (https://ifap.ed.gov ). For each school the student indicates whether he expects to live on or off campus or with his parents. This information is not used to calculate his EFC, but it is useful to schools for determining the cost of attendance. The student can list up to four schools on the paper FAFSA and 10 on the web (at least one is required). If he wants his information to be available to more schools, he can use his SAR or fafsa.gov to change the schools listed. The CPS will send data to no more than 10 (four with the paper FAFSA) schools at a time. Chapter 4 tells how a student can add or change schools. STEP SEVEN: SIGNATURE(S) Purpose: By signing the FAFSA, the applicant is assuming responsibility for the accuracy of the information reported. Date and signature(s) (104-105). In addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA are correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational purpose, which is required to receive FSA funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend FSA funds only on educational expenses and affirms that he is not in default on a federal loan or does not owe a grant overpayment. If he is dependent, one parent whose information is reported on the FAFSA must also sign. Substitutes for a parent's signature . While parent information must be provided for a dependent student, a high school counselor or a col - lege aid administrator may sign the application in place of a parent if the parents are not currently in the United States and cannot be con - tacted by normal means, the current address of the parents is not known, or the parents have been determined physically or mentally incapable of providing a signature. The signer must provide her title in parentheses next to her signature and briefly state the reason (only one is needed) why she is signing for the parents; if this is not done, the FAFSA will not be processed. The signer assures a minimum level of credibility in the data submitted; however, she does not assume any responsibility or liability in this pro - cess. If the counselor or FAA finds any inaccuracies in the information reported, she should direct the student to send the SAR through the normal correction process or, if she is an FAA, she can submit correc - tions through FAA Access. Because this proxy signing isn't possible electronically, it must be done on a paper FAFSA or on the signature page/FAFSA summary used with FAA Access.STEPS 6 & 7 Questions 103-105 School data, date, and signatures School information on the ISIR The ISIR will only display the federal school code and corresponding hous - ing code of the receiving school. The in - formation of other schools the student included on the FAFSA will not appear except on the SAR and on ISIRs sent to state grant agencies. See the electronic announcement of November 12, 2015 , as well as The ISIR Guide 2018-2019 . Copies of signed documents While you will often receive documents with original or \"wet\" signatures from the student (e.g., a paper FAFSA that the student has worked on and signed while in your office), there might be an occasion where the student gives you a copy or sends you a fax of a signed document. Except for a copied FAFSA, other imaged versions of the original signed document are valid and may be retained.AVG-35 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 in preparation of the FAFSA HEA Sec. 483(d) Preparer's ID and signature (106-108). Only persons who are paid a fee to help the student fill out the application are considered FAFSA preparers. Those who advise students without charging a fee, such as high school counselors and FAAs, are not preparers. A preparer must include his name, his company's name (if applicable), his address or the company address, and either his SSN or the company employer identification number (EIN, as assigned by the IRS). With the paper FAFSA, the preparer must also sign and date the form. Preparers have other obligations. In their advertising and initial contact with a consumer, including via the Internet or phone, they must clearly inform him that the FAFSA is free and can be completed electronically or on paper without professional help. If they have a website for their service, it must link to FAFSA on the Web. They may not use any form other than the FAFSA to apply for Title IV aid. A preparer who knowingly falsifies information on the application is subject to the same penalties as an applicant.STEP 7 Questions 106-108 Preparer's CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Signatures for electronic applications FAA Access to CPS Online If you enter a student's original application through FAA Access to CPS Online, you must obtain original or \"wet\" signatures on the printed signature page/FAFSA summary or on a completed paper FAFSA, and you must keep the signed document in the school files even if the student doesn't receive federal student aid or attend your school. You may electronically store the original document, but you may not accept faxed or copied signatures from the student for the FAFSA. (You have more latitude regarding verification documents and changes to the application; see Chapter 4 .) FAFSA on the Web Students who have an FSA ID can electronically sign their FAFSA on the Web. Parents who have an FSA ID can also electronically sign. When all the necessary signatures are provided electronically, the application will be processed within 72 hours. Alternately, students can print the signature page, sign it, and mail it to the processor. If the processor doesn't receive the signature page within 14 calendar days of receiving the application data, it will mail a \"reject 16\" (missing student signature) SAR to the student, which the student can sign and return. If the student chooses not to print and send a signature page, or if no printer was available, the processor won't wait 14 days to print a rejected SAR for the student but will generate one within 72 hours of receiving the data. If the student indicated on an electronic FAFSA that she would print, sign, and mail in a signature page but the processor has not received the signature page, the student can call the FSAIC and have her record released from the FAFSA hold file. Because no signature page has been received, the FAFSA processor will produce a rejected SAR and mail it to the student to sign and return. The processor will accept the first signature document it receives\u2014either the signed signature page or the signed SAR. Schools and states receive ISIRs for rejected records. A student's reject 16 SAR and her ISIR will reflect the data that she provided on the application; however, the CPS won't calculate an official EFC for the student (an unofficial EFC that cannot be used to award or disburse aid will appear on the ISIR) or do any database matches until it receives a signed signature page, a signed SAR, or an electronic signature. A school can also collect the required \"wet\" signatures at the school, either on the SAR or a document that has the required certification statements (FAA Access allows schools to print out a signature page for the ISIR). The school can then submit an electronic correction showing that the signatures have been provided. When a parent of a dependent student doesn't sign with his own FSA ID, the student can print a signature page for the parent. If the student indicates that no printer was available, the CPS will generate a \"reject 15\" (missing parent signature) output document for the student within 72 hours. If the student indicated she would send in a signature page, the processor will wait up to 14 calendar days to receive the signed page. If it doesn't receive a signed signature page after 14 days, it will generate a reject 15 SAR and send it to the student. The student must have a parent sign the SAR and must send it back to the address on the SAR. For reject 15 records, a student's SAR and ISIR will reflect the data provided on the application, but the processor won't calculate an EFC for the student until it receives the parent's electronic signature or the signed SAR or signature page. Signature requirements for changes made after the FAFSA is filed will be discussed in Chapter 4 .AVG-37 Chapter 2\u2014Filling Out the FAFSAGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB 2018 Signature Requirements: for All FSA Programs Application (fafsa.gov , PDF FAFSA, FAA Access to CPS Online)IRS Documentation (Transcript or other form submitted for verification)Verification Document Student Must sign statement that data are accurate and other conditions are met (on paper FAFSA, web summary, or signature page or by using the FSA ID)IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) or tax return transcript (does not need to be signed).

The EFC formula uses many variables, including income, assets, the number of persons in the household, and the number of those attending college for the award year. Every year the Department publishes updated tables used in the EFC calculation. The 2018-2019 updates are in the May 1, 2017, Federal Register . Also available at https://ifap.ed.gov is the EFC Formula Guide . The law provides three different formulas to calculate the EFC: one for dependent students, one for independent students without dependents other than a spouse, and one for independent students with dependents other than a spouse. In addition, there are three simplified versions of each formula with fewer data elements. SIMPLIFIED FORMULA The simplified formula is basically the same as the regular formula except that asset information isn't considered in the calculation. A dependent stu - dent qualifies for the simplified calculation if the parents' combined adjusted gross income (AGI, for tax filers) or income earned from work (for non-filers) was less than $50,000, and either (1) the parents were not required to file an IRS Form 1040,1 (2) one of them is a dislocated worker as defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (see Chapter 2 for a description of dislocated worker), or (3) anyone counted in their household size received a means-tested federal benefit during 2016 or 2017.2 An independent student qualifies for the simplified calculation if the student's and spouse's combined AGI (tax filers) or income earned from work (non-filers) was less than $50,000, andExpected Family Contribution (EFC) The EFC is a measure of how much the student and his or her family can be expected to contribute to the cost of the student's education for the year. The EFC is calculated according to a formula specified in the law. In this chapter we describe the EFC formula in detail. Basic EFC formulas Dependent students Independent students Independent students with dependents Special calculations Simplified formula (no assets) Automatic zero EFC Other than nine-month enrollment HEA Sec. 474-479 1 Persons not required to file the IRS Form 1040 comprise those who do not have to submit a return, who filed or will file a 1040A or 1040EZ, and who were eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ but filed or will file a Form 1040 for no substantial reason or solely to claim an education tax credit. For qualifying for the simplified formula or the automatic zero EFC, a foreign tax return counts as an IRS Form 1040, while a tax return for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands counts as a Form 1040A or 1040EZ. 2 See margin note #2 on the next page.AVG-40 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 either: (1) the student and spouse were not required to file an IRS Form 1040,1 (2) one of them is a dislocated worker as defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, or (3) anyone counted in the household size received a means-tested federal benefit during 2016 or 2017.2 FAFSA on the Web has a threshold question that will cause the asset questions to be skipped when the student seems eligible for the simplified formula or an automatic zero EFC. But in some instances, such as when us - ing a paper FAFSA, a student who qualifies for the simplified formula will provide asset information. In those cases the CPS will calculate two EFCs: one using the assets and one excluding them. The EFC from the simplified formula (which excludes assets) is called the primary EFC and is printed on the front of the student's SAR, while the EFC from the full calculation is called the secondary EFC and is printed in the FAA Information section. To determine the student's federal aid, the school must use the primary EFC, which will always be less than or equal to the secondary EFC. If it turns out that the student was not eligible for the simplified formula and did not pro - vide asset information, the school must correct and submit the record and use the EFC reported on the resulting transaction. AUTOMATIC ZERO EFC The law also provides for an automatic zero EFC for some students. The rules for determining who they are are the same as those for the simplified formula with these differences: The income threshold is $25,000 or less instead of less than $50,000. Independent students without dependents other than a spouse (those who use Formula B) do not qualify for an automatic zero EFC. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MATCH AND IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SERVICE GRANT Schools will consider the EFC to be zero for Pell-eligible students with a parent or guardian who was a member of the U.S. Armed Forces and who died as a result of service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. These students must have been less than 24 years old or enrolled in college when the parent or guardian died. The CPS will match applications against a file provided by the Department of Defense (DOD). If a match is found, a personalized letter will be sent to the student explaining the potential increase in funding, the DOD match flag will be set to \"Y\" on the ISIR, and a date will appear in the parent's date of death field (which, out of sensitivity, will not be noted on the SAR). The CPS will calculate an EFC normally; the school should use a zero EFC when packaging qualifying students. Students in this situation who are not Pell eligible because their EFC is too high will be able to receive an Iraq and Afghanistan service grant (see Volume 1 , Chapter 6 ). The amount of the grant will be the same as that of Automatic zero EFC HEA Sec. 479(c)1 See margin note #1 on the previous page. 2 The means-tested federal benefit pro - grams are: Medicaid (including the Children's Health Insurance Program) or Sup - plemental Security Income (SSI) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, also known as food stamps Free and reduced price school lunches Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro - gram for Women, Infants, and Chil - dren (WIC) A person need not have received the benefit for an entire year; receiving it at any time in the base or prior year quali - fies. Also, an FAA may use professional judgment (PJ) to count a benefit if a person did not receive it during those 24 months but is receiving it now.AVG-41 Chapter 3\u2014Expected Family Contribution (EFC)Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 the Pell Grant they would have been eligible for with a zero EFC minus a set percentage (see Chapter 3 of Volume 3 for specific guidance on calculating grant awards). However, for these students the school uses the EFC calculated by the CPS for packaging instead of zero. ALTERNATE EFCS The law specifies how the EFC of a dependent student must be modified if the student is going to enroll for other than a nine-month period. The EFC found in the upper right corner of the first page of the output document is based on a nine-month enrollment period and should always be used for awarding a Pell Grant, even if the student is attending for a longer or shorter period. The second section of the \"FAA Information\" area contains a table of alternate primary and secondary EFCs for periods of 1-12 months. These are alternate EFCs that you must use to award aid (other than Pell grants) if the student is attending for other than nine months. THE EFC WORKSHEETS The end of the chapter contains the EFC worksheets, which can be used to manually calculate an EFC or to see how the EFC is determined for each of the formulas explained hereafter. For items that are taken from the FAFSA, the worksheets indicate the corresponding FAFSA/SAR line numbers. On the worksheets for the simplified formula, the parts of the calculation that aren't used are grayed out. FORMULA A\u2014DEPENDENT STUDENTS The EFC for a dependent student is calculated using the FAFSA data for the student and his parents. The CPS calculates the parents' contribution (which includes their assets), the student's contribution from income, and the student's contribution from assets; the EFC is the sum of these three. Under the simplified formula, the parents' contribution doesn't include assets, nor is the student's contribution from assets counted. Parents' contribution The parents' available income and contribution from assets are first determined, and then these are used with the number in college to calculate the parents' contribution. Parents' available income. The parents' available income is calculated by subtracting certain allowances from the parents' total income. These allowances account for certain nondiscretionary expenses, such as taxes and basic living expenses. Once a minimum level of support has been offset for those expenses, the formula assumes that the remaining income is available for discretionary purposes, including paying for a postsecondary education. The available income can be a negative number. The total income is the sum of the taxable and untaxed income, minus amounts reported in the income but excluded from the formula. If the par - ents are tax filers, the parents' AGI as reported on the FAFSA is the amount of the parents' taxable income used in the calculation. If the parents are not Negative AGI or zero? The FAFSA instruction for parents' AGI is to use the number that appears on a specific line of the tax return; this can be a negative number. The first line of the worksheet for EFC Formula A cites the FAFSA line number and instructs you to substitute a zero if the AGI is negative. This does not mean that a negative AGI should be reported as a zero on the FAFSA. The CPS will change the value to zero, and it makes assumptions that you will not make when completing an EFC worksheet by hand. When filling out the FAFSA, the applicant should follow the instruction given and use the AGI as it appears on the tax return.AVG-42 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 tax filers, the calculation uses the parents' reported income earned from work. Total income can be a negative number. The sum of the following allowances reduces the parents' total income: U.S. income tax paid. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA. Non-tax filers don't receive this allowance. If this is a negative amount, it is set to zero. State and other tax allowance. Use Table A1. This allowance is a percentage of parents' total income and approximates the average amount paid in state and other taxes. The percentage varies accord - ing to the state and according to whether the parents' total income is below $15,000 or is $15,000 or more. The state used is the parents' state of legal residence reported on the FAFSA. If this item is blank or invalid, the student's reported state of legal residence is used. If both are blank or invalid, the state in the student's mailing address is used. If all three are blank or invalid, the rate shown in Table A1 for a blank or invalid state is used (2% for total income below $15,000; 1% for total income of $15,000 or more). If the allowance is a nega - tive amount, it's set to zero. Parents' Social Security tax allowance. The parents' Social Security taxes are calculated separately by applying the rates shown in Table A2 to both parents' income earned from work in 2016 (as reported on the FAFSA). The total allowance for Social Security taxes is never less than zero. Income protection allowance. Use Table A3. This allowance is for the basic living expenses of a family. It varies according to the num - ber in the parents' household and the number in college in 2018- 2019 , as reported on the FAFSA. In general, a school can assume that 30% of the income protection allowance amount is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for transportation expenses, 16% for clothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family consumption. The income protection allowance used for a particular student is provided as one of the intermediate values in the FAA In - formation Section of the output document (labeled as \"IPA\"). Employment expense allowance. Families with two working parents and one-parent families have extra expenses that must be consid - ered, such as housekeeping services, transportation, clothing and upkeep, and meals away from home. This allowance recognizes those extra expenses. For two working parents, the allowance is 35% of the lesser of the first or second parent's income earned from work (ques - tions 88 and 89), but may not exceed $4,000. For one-parent fami - lies, the allowance is 35% of the parent's income earned from work, also not to exceed $4,000. If a student's parents are married and only one parent reports an income earned from work, the allowance is zero. The employment expense allowance is never less than zero. Parents' contribution from assets. The full formula uses the assets of parents of a dependent student and determines a \"contribution from assets.\" This amount is combined with available income to give an accurate picture of the family's financial strength. In the simplified formula assets aren't 3\u2014Expected Family Contribution August 2018 First, the parents' net worth is calculated by adding assets reported on the FAFSA. The net worth of a business or a farm is adjusted to protect a portion of these assets. Use Table A4 to calculate the amount to be used. Second, the parents' discretionary net worth is calculated by subtracting the education savings and asset protection allowance (Table A5) from the parents' net worth. As with income, this is done to protect a portion of assets. The allowances for ages 40 through 65 approximate the present cost of an annuity that, when combined with Social Security benefits, would provide a moderate level of living for a retired couple or single person at age 65. As shown in Table A5, the allowance increases with the age of the older parent (as reported on the FAFSA) to indicate the cost of purchasing such an annuity at a given age. Discretionary net worth may be less than zero. Finally, the discretionary net worth is multiplied by the conversion rate of 12% to get the parents' contribution from assets , which represents the portion of parental assets considered available to help pay for the student's college education. If the contribution from assets is negative, it is set to zero. Calculation of parents' contribution. This is the final step in determining the parents' contribution. The parents' available income and contribution from assets are added together to determine the parents' adjusted available income, which can be a negative number. The total parents' contribution from adjusted available income is calculated from the amounts and rates in Table A6 and is the total amount parents are expected to contribute toward all of their family's postsecondary educational costs. The rates in Table A6 increase from 22% to 47% as the adjusted available income increases. This is based on the principle that as income increases beyond the amount needed to maintain a basic standard of living, the portion used for family maintenance decreases and the portion available for discretionary purposes increases. Therefore, a progressively larger amount of income may be contributed toward postsecondary educational costs. The parents' contribution for the individual student is calculated by dividing the total parents' contribution from adjusted available income by the number in college in 2018-2019 , as reported on the FAFSA. Parents are not included in the number attending college. Student's contribution from income To determine the student's contribution from income, the student's available income (AI) is first calculated by subtracting total allowances from the student's total income. The AI is then assessed at a rate of 50% to obtain the student contribution from available income. If the student contribution from available income is less than zero, it's set to zero. As with the parents' income information, the student's total income is calculated using information from his FAFSA. His total income is the sum of his taxable and untaxed income, minus amounts reported in the income but excluded from the formula (see Chapter 2 for more on these exclusions). If the student is a tax filer, his AGI as reported on the FAFSA is the amount of taxable income used in the calculation. If he is not a tax filer, the calculation uses his reported income earned from work. The total income may be a negative number.AVG-44 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 The allowances are calculated by adding the following: U.S. income tax paid. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA. Non-tax filers don't receive this allowance. If this is a negative amount, it's set to zero. State and other tax allowance. Use Table A7. This allowance is a percentage of the student's total income. The percentage varies ac - cording to the state. The state to be used is the student's state of legal residence reported on the FAFSA. If that item is blank or invalid, the state in the student's mailing address is used. If both items are blank or invalid, the parents' state of legal residence is used. If all three items are blank or invalid, the rate for a blank or invalid state in Table A7 is used (2%). If the allowance is a negative amount, it's set to zero. Social Security tax allowance. The student's Social Security taxes are calculated by applying the rates shown in Table A2 to the student's income earned from work in 2016 (as reported on the FAFSA). The total allowance for Social Security taxes is never less than zero. Income protection allowance. The income protection allowance for a dependent student is $6,570. Parent's negative AAI. To recognize that a student's income may be needed to help support the family, the EFC calculation allows a parent's negative adjusted available income (AAI) to reduce a de - pendent student's contribution from income. Because the student's contribution from income cannot be negative, this will not affect the student's contribution from assets. Student's contribution from assets The student's assets are treated the same way as the parents' assets with three differences: there is no adjustment to the net worth of a business or farm, there is no education savings and asset protection allowance, and net worth is assessed at the rate of 20%. Remember that under the simplified formula there is no student contribution from assets. The student's net worth is calculated by adding assets reported on the FAFSA (negative amounts are converted to zero for this calculation). The net worth is multiplied by 20% to obtain the student's contribution from assets, which is the portion of assets considered available to help pay for his postsecondary education. Alternate EFCs for other than nine-month enrollment The standard parents' contribution is for a nine-month enrollment pe - riod. For a shorter period, the parents' contribution is prorated according to the number of months of enrollment. The student's contribution from available income is also prorated and then added to the student asset contri - bution, which is not prorated. For an enrollment of more than nine months, the parents' contribution is calculated by adjusting the standard nine-month formula on page 3 of Worksheet A of the EFC worksheets, and the student's contribution remains at the August 2018 FORMULA B\u2014INDEPENDENT STUDENT WITHOUT DEPENDENTS OTHER THAN A SPOUSE The EFC for an independent student without dependents other than a spouse is calculated using FAFSA data for the student and spouse. The CPS calculates a contribution from available income and a contribution from as - sets. The sum of these two is divided by the number in college in 2018-2019, as reported on the FAFSA. The result is the EFC for the 2018-2019 award year. Under the simplified formula, the contribution from assets isn't used. Contribution from available income The student's available income, which can be a negative number, is calculated by subtracting the total allowances from the total income. These allowances account for certain nondiscretionary expenses, such as taxes and basic living expenses. Once a minimum level of support has been provided to meet those expenses, the formula assumes that the remaining income is available for discretionary purposes, including paying for a postsecondary education. The available income is then assessed at a rate of 50% to obtain the student's contribution from available income. Total income. The total income is the sum of the student's and her spouse's (if the student is married) taxable and untaxed income, minus amounts reported in the income on the FAFSA but excluded from the formula (see Chapter 2 for more on these exclusions). If the student and spouse are tax filers, their AGI as reported on the FAFSA is the amount of taxable income used in the calculation. If they are not tax filers, the calculation uses reported income earned from work. Untaxed income is included in the formula because it may have a considerable effect on the family's financial strength and, in some cases, may be the family's main source of income. The total income can be a negative number. Allowances against income. Total allowances are calculated by adding the following: U.S. income tax paid. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA. Non-tax filers don't receive this allowance. If this is a negative amount, it's set to zero. State and other tax allowance. Use Table B1. This allowance is a percentage of the student and spouse's total income. The percent - age varies according to the state. The state to be used is the student's state of legal residence reported on the FAFSA. If that item is blank or invalid, the state in the student's mailing address is used. If both items are blank or invalid, the rate for a blank or invalid state is used (2%). If the allowance is a negative amount, it's set to zero. Social Security tax allowance. The student and spouse's Social Se - curity taxes are calculated separately by applying the tax rates shown in Table B2 to the student's income earned from work in 2016 and the spouse's income earned from work in 2016 (as reported on the FAFSA). The total allowance for Social Security taxes is never less than zero.AVG-46 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Income protection allowance. The income protection allowance is $10,220 for single students and for married students whose spouse is enrolled at least half time. The allowance is $16,380 for married stu - dents whose spouse isn't enrolled at least half time. Employment expense allowance. Families with two working spouses have extra expenses that must be considered, such as house - keeping services, transportation, clothing and upkeep, and meals away from home. This allowance recognizes those extra expenses. If the student isn't married, the employment expense allowance is zero. If the student is married but only one person is working (either the student or the student's spouse), the allowance is zero. If both the student and his spouse are working, the allowance is 35% of the lesser of the student's income earned from work (Question 39) or the spouse's income earned from work (Question 40), but it may not exceed $4,000. Contribution from assets For students who qualify for the simplified formula, there is no contribution from assets. In the full formula, the assets of an independent student with no dependents other than a spouse are considered in order to fully measure the family's ability to contribute toward postsecondary educational costs. First, the net worth of the student and spouse's assets is calculated by adding assets reported on the FAFSA. The net worth of a business or a farm is adjusted to protect a portion of the net worth of these assets. Use Table B3 to calculate the amount to be used. Second, the student and spouse's discretionary net worth is calculated by subtracting the asset protection allowance (Table B4) from the net worth. The allowance increases with the age of the student as of December 31, 2018, which may be determined from the student's date of birth as reported on the FAFSA. This is done to protect a portion of assets that may be needed for purposes other than education, such as emergencies or retirement. Discretionary net worth can be less than zero. Finally, the discretionary net worth is multiplied by the conversion rate of 20% to obtain the student and spouse's contribution from assets, which represents the portion of the value of the assets that is considered available to help pay for the student's college education. If the contribution from assets is less than zero, it's set to zero. Alternate EFCs for other than nine-month enrollment The standard EFC is for a nine-month enrollment period. If the student will be enrolled for less than nine months, the EFC is simply prorated by dividing it by nine and then multiplying the result by the number of months the student will be enrolled. For an enrollment of more than nine months, however, the EFC remains at the nine-month August 2018 FORMULA C\u2014INDEPENDENT STUDENT WITH DEPENDENTS OTHER THAN A SPOUSE The EFC for an independent student with dependents other than a spouse is calculated using the information for the student and spouse pro - vided on the FAFSA. The formula is almost the same as the formula for the parents of a dependent student. There are three basic steps. First, the student's available income is determined. Then, the student's contribution from assets is calculated. Finally, the EFC is calculated using the available income, the contribution from assets, and the number in college. Available income Available income is calculated by subtracting allowances from the student's total income. These allowances account for certain nondiscretionary costs, such as taxes and basic living expenses, and represent a minimum level of support. The formula assumes that the remaining income is available for discretionary purposes, including paying for a postsecondary education. The available income can be a negative number. Student's total income. The student's total income is the sum of the student's and his spouse's (if the student is married) taxable and untaxed income, minus amounts reported in the income on the FAFSA but excluded from the formula (see Chapter 2 for more information on these exclusions). If the student and spouse are tax filers, AGI as reported on the FAFSA is the amount of taxable income used in the calculation. If they are not tax filers, the calculation uses reported income earned from work. The total income can be a negative number. Allowances against income. Total allowances are calculated by adding the following: U.S. income tax paid. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA. Non-tax filers don't receive this allowance. If this is a negative amount, it is set to zero. State and other tax allowance. Use Table C1. This allowance is a percentage of the total income and approximates the average amount paid in state and other taxes. The percentage varies according to the state and according to whether the total income is below $15,000 or is $15,000 or more. The state to be used is the student's state of legal residence reported on the FAFSA. If this item is blank or invalid, the state in the student's mailing address is used. If both items are blank or invalid, the rate for a blank or invalid state is used (2% for total in - come below $15,000; 1% for total income of $15,000 or more). If the allowance is a negative amount, it's set to zero. Social Security tax allowance. The student's and spouse's Social Security taxes are calculated separately by applying the tax rates shown in Table C2 to the student's income earned from work and the spouse's income earned from work in 2016 (as reported on the FAFSA). The total allowance for Social Security taxes is never less than zero.AVG-48 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Income protection allowance. Use Table C3. This allowance pro - vides for the basic living expenses of a family. It varies according to the number in the student's household and the number in college in 2018-2019 , as reported on the FAFSA. In general, a school can assume that 30% of the income protection allowance is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for transportation expenses, 16% for clothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family consumption. The income protection allowance used for a particular student is provided as one of the intermediate values in the FAA In - formation Section of the output document (labeled as \"IPA\"). Employment expense allowance. Families with two working parents and one-parent families have extra expenses that must be consid - ered, such as housekeeping services, transportation, clothing and upkeep, and meals away from home. This allowance recognizes those extra expenses. When both the student and spouse work, the allow - ance is 35% of the lesser of the student's income earned from work (Question 39) or the spouse's income earned from work (Question 40), but may not exceed $4,000. If the student isn't married, the al - lowance is 35% of the student's income earned from work, or $4,000, whichever is less. If a student is married and only the student or the spouse (but not both) reports an income earned from work, the al - lowance is zero. The employment expense allowance is never less than zero. Contribution from assets In the full formula, the assets of an independent student with dependents other than a spouse are considered in order to fully measure the family's ability to contribute toward postsecondary educational costs. The formula determines a \"contribution from assets,\" an amount that is combined with available income to give an accurate picture of the family's financial strength. In the simplified formula, the assets aren't counted at all. First, the net worth of a student and spouse's assets is calculated by adding assets reported on the FAFSA. The net worth of a business or farm is adjusted to protect a portion of these assets. Use Table C4 to calculate the amount to be used. Second, the student and spouse's discretionary net worth is calculated by subtracting the asset protection allowance (Table C5) from the net worth. The allowance increases with the age of the student as of December 31, 2018, which may be determined from the student's date of birth as reported on the FAFSA. This is done to protect a portion of assets that may be needed for purposes other than education, such as emergencies or retirement. Discretionary net worth can be less than zero. Finally, the discretionary net worth is multiplied by 7% to obtain the contribution from assets , which is the portion of the value of the student's and spouse's assets considered to be available to help pay for the student's postsecondary education. If the contribution from assets is less than zero, it is set to zero.AVG-49 Chapter 3\u2014Expected Family Contribution (EFC)Glossary 2018 Calculation of student's EFC This is the final step in determining the EFC for the independent student with dependents other than a spouse. The available income and the contribution from assets are added together to obtain the adjusted available income. The adjusted available income can be a negative number. The total contribution from adjusted available income is calculated from using Table C6. This is the total amount the student's family is expected to contribute toward family postsecondary educational costs. The rates in Table C6 increase from 22% to 47% as the adjusted available income increases. The rate is based on the principle that as income increases beyond the amount needed to maintain a basic standard of living, the portion used for family maintenance decreases, while the portion available for discretionary purposes increases. The larger the income, the easier it is for a family to contribute toward postsecondary educational costs with less effect on the maintenance of the family. The EFC is calculated by dividing the total student's contribution from adjusted available income by the number in college in 2018-2019 as reported on the FAFSA. The result is the EFC for the 2018-2019 award period. Alternate EFCs for other than nine-month enrollment The standard EFC is for a nine-month enrollment period. If the student will be enrolled for less than nine months, the EFC is simply prorated by dividing it by nine and then multiplying the result by the number of months the student will be enrolled. For an enrollment of more than nine months, however, the EFC remains at the nine-month amount.AVG-50 Application page **Do not include the family's home. ***To calculate the parents' contribution for other than nine-month enrollme nt, see page 11.2018-2019 EFC FORMULA A : DEPENDENT STUDENT REGULAR WORKSHEET Page 1A *STOP HERE if the following are true: Line 3 is $25,000 or less and The parents are eligible to file a 2016 IRS Form 1040A or 1040EZ (they are not required to file a 2016 Form 1040) or they are not required to file any income tax return or Anyone included in the parents' household size (as defined on the FAFSA) received benefits during 2016 or 2017 from any of the designated means- tested federal benefit programs or Either of the parents is a dislocated worker.

Verification is not required for students who are only eligible for unsubsidized student financial assistance (however, see Verification exclu - sions later in this chapter for an important caveat). While graduate students are ineligible for most types of subsidized Title IV aid, they are eligible for Federal Work Study and would need to complete verification if they are selected and receive that aid. Students who are eligible for both subsidized and unsubsidized Title IV aid may not avoid verification by accepting only unsubsidized aid; they must complete verification to receive any Title IV aid. However, see the relevant margin note on page 93. REQUIRED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Your school must have written policies about the time period in which students must submit verification docu - mentation, the consequences for failing to submit those documents in time, the method you will use to notify students if their EFC and Title IV aid amounts change, the procedures you or students will follow to correct FAFSA data, the procedure you will follow to refer a student to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) (see Chapter 5 ). Your school must provide, in a timely manner, students selected for verification a clear explanation of their role, including what documents they must submit, the deadlines they must meet, and the consequences of failing to meet them. You must complete verification for a selected student before you exercise professional judgment to adjust any values that are used to calculate the EFC. But making a professional judgment (PJ) adjustment does not require you to verify an application that isn't selected.Verification regulations 34 CFR 668.51-61 Definitions 34 CFR 668.52 Subsidized student financial assis - tance programs \u2014Title IV programs for which eligibility is determined by the EFC. These include the Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Op - portunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work- Study (FWS), Perkins Loan, and Direct Subsidized Loan programs. Unsubsidized student financial as - sistance programs \u2014Title IV programs for which eligibility is not based on the EFC. These include the Teacher Educa - tion Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Direct Un - subsidized Loan, and Direct PLUS Loan programs. The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is a non-need-based grant and is not subject to verification.Because students sometimes make errors on their application, there is a process for verifying applications and making corrections. The Central Processing System (CPS) selects which applications are to be verified, but you also have the authority to verify additional students.Verification, Updates, and Corrections Policies and procedures 34 CFR 668.53Application Verification Guide 2018-2019AVG-80 FSA HB August 2018Glossary DCL APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION TO BE VERIFIED The Department's long-term goal is for a customized approach to veri - fication. A menu of potential verification items for each award year will be published in the Federal Register , and the items to verify for a given applica - tion will be selected from that menu and indicated on the student's output documents. Output documents will continue to include only one verification flag to show students who were selected, and they will need to verify all the FAFSA items shown in the margin that apply to them. The verification flag will have a value of \"Y,\" and next to the EFC will be an asterisk referring to a comment in the student section of the SAR that tells applicants they will be asked by their schools to provide documentation. A verification tracking flag will be set on the applicant's Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) to indicate placement in one of the 2018-2019 verification tracking groups. In some cases you, not the CPS, will select a student for verification. You must verify any information you have reason to believe is incorrect on an application. Also, you may at your discretion require a student to verify any FAFSA information and provide reasonable documentation according to consistently applied school policies. In either case you may, but are not required to, include any of the CPS verification items not already included. Whether you do that or not, students with these applications are considered selected for verification and, as with CPS-selected applications, all other verification requirements, such as deadlines, allowable tolerances, and interim disbursement rules, apply. Verification tracking groups Students who are selected for verification will be placed in one of the fol - lowing groups to determine which FAFSA information must be verified. V1\u2014Standard Verification Group. Students in this group must verify the following if they are tax filers: Adjusted gross income U.S. income tax paid Untaxed portions of IRA distributions Untaxed portions of pensions IRA deductions and payments Tax-exempt interest income Education credits Household size Number in college Students who are not tax filers must verify the following: Income earned from work Household size Number in collegeVerification items for 2018-2019 34 CFR 668.56 The verification items for 2018-2019 are the same as last year's: Adjusted gross income (AGI) U.S. income tax paid Education credits Untaxed IRA distributions Untaxed pensions IRA deductions and payments Tax-exempt interest Income earned from work Household size Number in college High school completion status Identity/statement of educational purpose See the May 5, 2017, Federal Register . Changing tracking groups A student may move from Verification Tracking Group V1 or V4 to group V5 based on corrections made to her CPS record or on other information avail - able to the Department. If verification was already completed for the previous group, the student is only required to verify the V5 information that was not already verified. If verification was not completed for the previous group, the student only needs to verify the V5 in - formation. No disbursements of Title IV aid may be made until the V5 verification is satisfactorily completed. If the appli - cant doesn't complete verification, the school is not liable for any Title IV aid it disbursed prior to receiving the group V5 ISIR. The applicant is liable for the full amount because without verification there is no evidence she was eligible for that aid. See the electronic announce - ment of October 31, 2016 , for more information about disbursements and potential return of funds when students are selected for verification.AVG-81 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary DCL V2\u2014Reserved for future use by the Department. V3\u2014Reserved for future use by the Department. V4\u2014Custom Verification Group. Students must verify high school completion status and identity/statement of educational purpose. V5\u2014Aggregate Verification Group. Students must verify high school completion status and identity/statement of educational purpose (SEP) in ad - dition to the items in the Standard Verification Group. V6\u2014Reserved for future use by the Department. Reporting results for groups V4 and V5 You must report the verification results of identity and high school (HS) completion status for any student for whom you receive an ISIR with track - ing flag V4 or V5\u2014as selected by the CPS, not your school\u2014and request ver - ification documentation. You report this information on the FAA Access to CPS Online website: select the Identity Verification Results option from the main menu, enter your school identifiers, the year, and the student identifi - ers. You will then enter one of the following numeric codes that most applies: 1\u2014Verification completed in person, no issues found 2\u2014Verification completed using notary, no issues found 3\u2014Verification attempted, issues found with identity. (You received ac - ceptable documentation of high school completion, but you did not receive the SEP or documentation of identity or the latter was unac - ceptable.) 4\u2014Verification attempted, issues found with HS completion. (You re - ceived the SEP and acceptable documentation of identity, but you didn't get HS completion documentation or it was unacceptable.) 5\u2014No response from applicant or unable to locate 6\u2014Verification attempted, issues found with both identity and HS completion You should report results no more than 60 days following your first request to the student for documentation of identity and high school comple - tion. Inaccurate and untimely reporting may subject your school to findings as a result of your annual compliance audit or a program review. You should not wait until the award year ends before reporting these results. If there is a change in a result you have already submitted, you can submit the new code using the above process, and you should make that change within 30 days. Because the FAA Access website does not store a list of these verification results for you to retrieve, we recommend you print and keep the confirma - tion page for your records. Instead of using this individual method, you can submit verification results by uploading a flat file with the data for up to 2,000 students.Online verification assessment module https://ifap.ed.gov/qahome/ qaassessments/fsaverification.html Verification questions/answers The Department has a list of questions and answers about verification online. See www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/ reg/hearulemaking/2009/ verification.html . Verification following disasters Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for when federally- declared disasters affect the awarding of aid. The DCL states that the Secre - tary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster as long as the school has tried to pre - serve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code \"S\" when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to af - fected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding household size and number in college is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Note that the relief described in the DCL and its attachment applies specifically to disasters and is separate from relief provided under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HE - ROES) Act, which is cited in the margin on the next page. Verification exclusions 34 CFR 668.54(b)Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019AVG-82 FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Verification exclusions There are times when you don't need to verify a student's application. Except in the case of the student's death, however\u2014or post-enrollment situations where the student also does not intend to reenroll\u2014none of the exemptions excuse you from the requirement to resolve conflicting information (see Chapter 5 ). You should document the basis for an exclusion. Other information not excluded must still be verified according to all other requirements. You don't have to verify FAFSA information of a student in the following situations: Death of the student. You don't have to continue verification if you made an interim disbursement and the student died before verifica - tion was completed. You cannot make any additional disbursements, except for FWS funds already earned, to any of the student's benefi - ciaries. You cannot originate or disburse his Direct Subsidized Loan or consider any interim disbursement you made of Pell, Perkins, or FSEOG funds or provisional FWS employment to be an overpay - ment. See Chapter 2 of Volume 5 . Not an aid recipient. The student won't receive Title IV aid for rea - sons other than a failure to complete verification. This includes being ineligible for that aid and withdrawing without receiving it. The applicant is eligible to receive only unsubsidized student finan - cial assistance. However, students selected for V4 or V5 verification should complete it in accord with the answer to DOC-Q18 on the verification Q and A page . Applicant verified by another school. The student completed verifi - cation for the current award year at another school before transfer - ring. Her FAFSA data must be the same as it was at the previous school, and you must get a letter from that school stating that it verified her application and providing the transaction number of the pertinent valid ISIR. Post enrollment. The student was selected for verification after ceasing to be enrolled at your school, she does not intend to reenroll for the award year, and no further (including late) disbursements will be made. Unless you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, you don't have to ver - ify the reported FAFSA information of the parents of a dependent student if any of the following apply (including in cases where there is only one parent): Both of the parents are mentally incapacitated. Both parents or the custodial parent has died. They are residing in a country other than the United States and can't be contacted by normal means. They can't be located because the student does not have and cannot get their contact information. Unless you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, you don't have to veri - fy the reported FAFSA information of the spouse of an independent student if any of the following apply:Spouse unavailable example Ursula is attending Lem Community College, and her application is selected for verification. She provided her husband's information on the application but now explains that her husband has recently moved out, and she can't locate him. Ursula also gives Lem some documents to show that she's tried to locate her husband. Lem determines that Ursula doesn't need to provide verification of her husband's tax and income information, but she still needs to verify her own information.HEROES Act modifications The HEROES Act allows the Secretary to modify or waive some statutory and regulatory requirements for those who are serving on active duty or per - forming qualifying National Guard duty during a war, other military op - eration, or national emergency; reside or are employed in an area declared a disaster by a federal, state, or local official in connection with a national emergency; or suffered economic hardship as a direct result of a war, other military operation, or national emergency, as determined by the Secretary. Read the electronic announcement , and read the Federal Register notice for the waivers and modifications, which are due to expire on September 30, 2022.AVG-83 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL The spouse has died. He is mentally incapacitated. He is residing in a country other than the United States and can't be contacted by normal means. He can't be located because the student does not have and cannot get his contact information. DOCUMENTATION The documentation you will need for verification varies according to the item verified, as explained in this section. The Department encourages students and parents to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to import data from their tax return and not change it. It is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting verification requirements. Also, this chapter includes suggested text developed by the Department, which you can use to create an institutional verification document if you choose and to verify non-tax items, such as household size and number in college. The text is also available on the IFAP website at https://ifap.ed.gov . If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies are acceptable, and unless specifically noted in this chapter, a signature on a copy is as valid as an original signature (i.e., a handwritten or \"wet\" signature). In the limited circumstances when a tax return copy is acceptable, if it is unsigned the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide his name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. The chart below shows the tax form line numbers for the most commonly reported items. This chart is a reference only; it is not a list of all the items the school must check on a tax return. AGI, taxes paid, and other tax data As already noted, the importation of IRS tax data via the DRT is the best way to document that information. Students and parents do this either when initially filling out the FAFSA on the Web (FOTW or fafsa.gov ) application AGI and income tax documentation 34 CFR 668.57(a) Line items from the 2016 tax return 1040 1040A 1040EZ AGI 37 21 4 Income Tax Paid 56 minus 46 28 minus 36 10 Deductible IRA/SEP 28 plus 32 17 Tax-exempt Interest Income 8b 8b Untaxed Portions of IRAs and Pensions (excluding rollovers)15a 15b and 16a minus 16b11a minus 11b and 12a minus 12bDRT items The following items are imported from IRS forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ to a student's FAFSA via the DRT: Type of tax return filed Filing status Adjusted gross income Taxes paid Income earned from work Exemptions In addition, the following are also im - ported from the 1040 and 1040A forms but not the 1040EZ: Education credits IRA deductions Tax-exempt interest income Untaxed IRA distributions Untaxed pensionsTax transcript matrix See the June 6, 2018, announcement for a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their cor - responding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript.Acceptable documentation The documentation required for verify - ing 2018-2019 application data is given in the Federal Register published on May 5, 2017. See also DCL GEN-17-05 for guidance about verifiable informa tion August 2018Glossary CFR DCL or later as a correction. For the retrieved data to be acceptable documentation of tax data, it is necessary that neither students nor parents change the data after it is transferred from the IRS\u2014if the data was changed or if you have reason to believe the data transferred is incorrect, the student will need to provide a return transcript as explained below. The IRS request field(s) on the ISIR will have a value of \"02\" when the data is unchanged. If students cannot or will not use IRS Data Retrieval, either at initial FAFSA filing or through the fafsa.gov correction process, they must document AGI, taxes paid, and untaxed income by providing an IRS tax return transcript for the student and spouse or parents, as applicable. Under the following conditions, the IRS DRT is not available on fafsa.gov (all apply to both students and parents unless otherwise noted): The person did not indicate on the FAFSA that the tax return has been completed. The marriage date is January 2017 or later. The first three digits of the SSN are 666. The person filed a non-U.S. tax return. The person is married and filed the tax return either as head of household or married but filing a separate return. Neither married parent entered a valid SSN. An unmarried parent or both married parents entered all zeroes for the SSN. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for verification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their authenticity. Special situations Filing extensions. With the change to prior-prior year tax data, even individuals who have an automatic six-month extension by the IRS should have completed their tax return by the time of verification. Therefore, they must verify income and tax information either by using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool or by submitting to the institution an IRS Tax Return Transcript. Only students and parents granted an extension beyond six months may submit the following for verification: a copy of IRS Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return ; a copy of the IRS's approval of an extension beyond the automatic six-month extension for tax year 2016; confirmation of non-filing from the IRS dated on or after October 1, 2017; copies of all their W-2 forms (or equivalent); and if self-employed, a signed statement with the amounts of their AGI and U.S. income taxes paid.Using third parties to get tran - scripts The IRS has developed a special Income Verification Express Service (IVES) that allows a third party to receive a tax filer's transcript. The IVES participant submits a 4506-T or 4506T-EZ form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a small fee for this service. Schools may use a transcript from an IVES participant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this instance) for verifica - tion as long as they have no reason to question its authenticity. Schools may not, however, pass on the charge for using this service to the student. See GEN-14-05 for more information.Requesting a tax transcript There are a few ways to request a tax return transcript: online at www.irs.gov , by calling 1-800-908-9946, or by mail - ing or faxing the paper Form 4506T-EZ, which can be printed out from the IRS website. To order a fiscal year tax tran - script for verification, Form 4506-T must be used rather than Form 4506T-EZ. Phone requests are via an automated process instead of an IRS representative. With online requests, tax filers can get an electronic transcript (see below) or they can have the IRS mail them a pa - per transcript, which is how non-online requests are handled. Only filers who submit a paper 4506-T or 4506T-EZ can choose to have the transcript mailed to a third party. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS. The Get Transcript Online feature allows users to get the transcript in real time as a portable document format (PDF) file, which they can submit electronically to a school or print and submit as a hard copy. To use the Get Transcript Online tool, users must have (1) access to a valid email address, (2) a text-enabled mobile phone in their name, and (3) specific financial account numbers, such as a credit card number or an account number for a home mortgage or auto loan. The process will not cause charges to the card or the account. See the July 26 , 2016, announcement .AVG-85 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Y ou may require those with a filing extension to use the DRT or submit to your school a tax transcript after the return has been filed. If you do that, you must reverify the income information. If the student fails to use the DRT or submit a tax transcript, see the guidance on page 94 on failing to complete verification. See DOC-Q16 on the Q and A page . Filers of joint returns who are no longer married. When dependent students' parents filed a joint return and have separated, divorced, mar - ried someone else, or been widowed, the students must submit an IRS tax transcript and a copy of each W-2 form for the parent whose tax information is on the FAFSA. Similarly, an independent student must submit a tax transcript and a copy of each of her W-2 forms if she filed a joint return and is separated, divorced, or a widow. For non-tax filers you must receive a W-2 form for each source of employment income. Y ou must also get a signed statement giving the sources and amounts of the person's income earned from work not on W-2s and certifying that the person has not filed and is not required to file a tax return. Students may sign on a nonfiling spouse's behalf. For residents of the Freely Associated States (the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of Micronesia), a copy of the wage and tax statement from each employer and a signed statement identifying all of the person's income for the year is ac - ceptable. Persons from a U.S. territory or commonwealth or a foreign country who are not required to file a tax return can provide the signed statement certifying their income. Y ou must also require the person (except dependent students) to submit a \"Verification of Nonfiling Letter\" from the IRS dated on or after October 1, 2017, attesting that she did not file a 2016 IRS tax return. She can get this by sending IRS Form 4506-T and checking box 7. Persons subject to foreign tax codes would submit a comparable document; see DOC-Q30 on the verification Q and A webpage . Note that verification of nonfiling is not an indication that the person is not required to file a return, just that she did not file one. See Chapter 5 if a person whose financial information was on the FAFSA did not file a tax return when it appears she was required to, and see DOC-Q29 on the above webpage about non-tax filers who lack any identifying num - ber (e.g., SSN) needed to get a confirmation of nonfiling from the IRS. For filers of non-IRS tax returns, you may accept a transcript ob - tained from a government of a U.S. territory or commonwealth or a foreign nation that includes all of the tax filer's income and tax infor - mation required to be verified for tax year 2016. If a free transcript is not available, you may accept instead a copy of the tax return, which must be signed by the filer or one of the filers of a joint return. See DOC-Q28 on the Q and A page for more information. Use the income and tax information that most closely corresponds to the information on the IRS tax return, and convert monetary amounts into U.S. dollars as appropriate. If you question the accuracy of the information on the signed copy of the return, the filer must provide you with a copy of the tax account information issued by the tax authority.Rollovers and verification Qualified rollovers from one retirement account to another are not taxable, and they should not be counted as untaxed income (as indicated in Chapter 2 ). Since neither the DRT nor a tax tran - script identifies rollovers, you must get documentation from the tax filer. This could be a signed statement with the rollover amount or a notation by the filer on the tax transcript that includes the word \"rollover\" beside any appli - cable item, similar to the instruction the IRS gives for Forms 1040 and 1040A. The annotation must be signed and dated by the filer. For those who used the DRT, a signed confirmation that the IRA or pension distribution included a rollover would suffice; a tax transcript would only be needed if other IRS tax information was changed. See VI-Q4 on the verification Q and A page for more information.If a W-2 is not available If an individual who is required to sub - mit an IRS Form W-2 did not save a copy, she should request a replacement W-2 from the employer who issued the original. A W-2 transcript from the IRS is also acceptable though it generally is not available until the year after the W-2 information is filed with the IRS (e.g., 2018 for 2016 information filed in 2017). If she is unable to obtain one in a timely manner, you may permit her to provide a signed statement that includes the amount of income earned from work, the source of that income, and the rea - son why the W-2 is not available in a timely manner. IRS documentation requests See the electronic announcement of February 23, 2017 , for information about the documents obtained from the IRS that are used for verification: the tax return transcript, record of account, tax account transcript, and the wage and income transcript. The announce - ment also explains Form 13873, which students or parents might receive when requesting documents from the IRS.Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019AVG-86 FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Filers of amended returns. Students or parents who file an amended return (IRS Form 1040X) can, beginning with the 2018-2019 year, use the IRS DRT, though the ISIR will show an IRS Request Flag value of 07 (see page 15). Because the tax return transcript does not reflect changes to the original return by the filer or the IRS, it is by itself not sufficient. So when you know that an amended return was filed, you must submit any changes to a nondollar item and any changes to a single monetary item of $25 or more. To complete verification you will need a signed copy of the 1040X form that was filed as well as either IRS DRT information on an ISIR record with all the information from the original tax return or an IRS tax return transcript (which does not have to be signed) or any other IRS transcript that includes all the income and tax infor - mation required to be verified. Note that there may be rare cases when a student, spouse, or parent did not file a 1040X with the IRS but whose tax and income information was amended by the IRS. In such a case a school may accept one of the items mentioned above plus documentation showing the IRS's change(s). Victims of identity theft who cannot get a return transcript or use the DRT submit a Tax Return DataBase View (TRDBV) transcript as well as a signed and dated statement indicating that they were victims of tax-related identity theft and that the IRS is aware of it. They do this by calling the IRS's Identity Protection Specialized Unit (IPSU) at 800- 908-4490. After the IPSU authenticates the tax filer's identity, she can ask the IRS to mail her the TRDBV transcript, which is an alternate paper transcript that will look different than a regular transcript but that is official and can be used for verification. Unless you doubt its au - thenticity, you don't need to get an IRS signature or stamp or any other validation. See DCL GEN-14-05 for a sample TRDBV transcript. Those who cannot obtain a TRDBV transcript may instead submit another official IRS transcript or equivalent IRS document if it includes all of the income and tax information required to be verified. Students eligible for an automatic zero EFC. A dependent student in this category who is placed in Verification Tracking Group V1 or V5 must verify his parents' AGI if they were tax filers and their income earned from work if they were non-tax filers. He must also verify high school completion status and identity and sign a statement of educa - tional purpose if in group V5. An independent student must verify 1. his and, if applicable, his spouse's AGI if they were tax filers; 2. their income earned from work if they were non-tax filers; 3. his high school completion status and identity and sign a statement of educational purpose if in group V5; and 4. the number of household members to determine if the student has any dependents other than a spouse. All students eligible for an auto zero EFC who are placed in Verifica - tion Tracking Group V4 must verify high school completion status and identity and sign a statement of educational purpose. Verification selection and PJ Once the Department selects a FAFSA for verification, every subsequent trans - action for that award year, even one resulting from PJ, will indicate that the student is selected for verification. If a FAFSA that is not selected for verification is later corrected, that can result in the application being selected. However, when PJ is used (and coded correctly) to adjust an application that is not selected for verification, the CPS prevents the subsequent transaction from being selected for verification.\"Per computer\" amounts The tax return transcript may show a per computer amount for some tax data that is different from what the filer reported to the IRS. The per computer amount should be used because it cor - rects mathematic errors and is more accurate than what appears on the original return or was transferred via the DRT. This guidance still holds, but because the DRT reports per computer values for AGI, income tax paid, and ed - ucation tax credits, there should not be many discrepancies between DRT data and the transcript. Also, if a transcript in - dicates \"recomputed <tax return item> per computer,\" that amount may be ignored for verification. Other IRS transcripts Schools may accept for verification any IRS tax transcript that includes all of the necessary information: adjusted gross income, U.S. income tax paid, untaxed IRA distributions, untaxed pensions, education credits, IRA deductions and tax-exempt interest. Because the record of account transcript and the Return Transcript for Taxpayer (RTFTP) include all of the above information, either may be used for verification. The Informa - tion Returns Processing Transcript Re - quest\u2014Wages (IRPTR-W) only provides wage information and therefore can only be used in lieu of a W-2 form.AVG-87 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Using a joint return to figure individual AGI and taxes paid If the filer of a joint return has become widowed, divorced, or separated since filing the return, it may be necessary to determine the individual's income and taxes paid using the joint return and W-2 forms. If a W-2 is not available (the filer is self-employed for example) or if a duplicate copy from the employer who issued the original W-2 is not available in a timely manner, the school may permit the filer to provide a signed statement that certifies the base year AGI and U.S. taxes paid. If he has divorced and married someone new (see the margin note on page 91 if this occurred after completion of the application), then the new spouse's income and assets would also need to be included. Add the income amounts from the individual's W-2 forms to any other income that can be extracted from the joint return. Any interest or business income earned on joint accounts or investments should be assessed at 50%. The same procedure should be used to divide business or farm losses. Also, if the AGI listed on the joint return was adjusted, you should reduce the individual's AGI by the portion of the adjustment that applies solely to him or her. For example, if an adjustment was made for moving expenses, which applies to the couple jointly, only 50% of the adjustment amount can be applied against the individual's income. An AGI figure can be calculated for the individual filer. A signed statement from the filer certifying that the data from the joint return were accurately assessed is sufficient documentation for this method. Use one of the following methods to figure the individual's taxes paid: Tax table (preferred method). Using the IRS Tax Table or Tax Rate Schedule for the appropriate year, calculate the amount of tax that would have been paid if a separate return had been filed. Use the deduction and number of exemptions the individual could have claimed if he or she had filed a separate return. (If itemized deductions were taken, count only the portion of those deductions that could have been claimed on a separate tax return.) Proportional distribution. Determine what percentage of the joint AGI was attributable to the individual, and then as - sess the joint taxes paid by that same percentage. Example 1: Calculating individual AGI from joint return example Eddy's application is selected for verification. He and his wife filed a joint return for 2016 and have since separated. The AGI on Eddy's FAFSA matches the AGI of $53,700 on the 2016 tax return, which means it's wrong because it includes his wife's income. Eddy's W-2 shows that his income for 2016 was $23,900, and the tax return shows $400 in interest. Because it was interest on a joint savings account, the aid administrator adds $200 of it to Eddy's income and submits $24,100 as the corrected income via FAA Access. Example 2: Calculating individual taxes paid from a joint return The aid administrator determines that Eddy's part of the $53,700 AGI he and his wife reported is $24,100. Eddy and his wife claimed four exemptions on their tax return (themselves, one child, and Eddy's nephew). Eddy's wife has custody of the child and will claim him as her dependent when she files her tax return for 2016. Eddy's nephew still lives with him. Therefore, Eddy would have had two exemptions (himself and his nephew), totaling $8,100. In the new situation, Eddy's filing status is \"head of household\" instead of \"married. \" Therefore, his standard deduction is $9,300 (instead of the $12,600 for married filers). Eddy's income of $24,100 minus the $8,100 for exemptions and the $9,300 standard deduction results in $6,700 in taxable income. The aid administrator uses the tax table to determine how much tax Eddy would have paid on this amount, taking into ac - count any applicable credits reported on the original return. With a taxable income of $6,700, the amount of tax paid from the tax schedule would be $673. To use the proportional distribution method instead, the aid administrator figures out what percentage of the joint AGI Eddy's income represents. The percentage is 45% (24,100 \u00f7 53,700 is .4488). The aid administrator then multiplies the in - come tax paid as reported on the tax return ($2811 for this example) by this percentage. Therefore, Eddy's income tax paid would be $1,265 (.45 \u00ce$2811).Application Guide 2018-2019AVG-88 FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Using a tax return to complete verification. When the DRT and return transcript are not available and you must use a tax return for verification, it will likely have been filed electronically with one of a variety of methods. These include do-it-yourself methods as well as completion by a tax preparer. Each method should permit printing of a paper copy of the return, though the e-file format might not contain every line item, showing instead only the data the tax filer provided. For example, if Item 8a, \"Taxable interest income, \" does not appear on such a return, that means no taxable interest income was reported. Y ou can also accept an electronic copy of the return that has been electronically signed, provided your school's process for accepting such signatures complies with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act. But a signature on Form 8879, the IRS e-file Signature Authorization, is not an acceptable substitute for a signature on the tax return. For persons who have a tax professional prepare their return, instead of a copy of the return with the filer's signature, you may accept one that has the name and PTIN of the preparer or has his SSN or EIN and has been signed, stamped, typed, or printed with his name and address. Note that the IRS requires paid preparers to have a PTIN. If a person did not retain a copy of her 2016 tax information and it cannot be located by the IRS or the relevant government agency, she must submit a signed statement indicating that she did not keep a copy of her tax information as well as documentation from the taxing authority indicating that that information cannot be located. Also, you must accept for an IRS filer either a copy of Form W-2 for each source of employment income received for 2016 or, if she is self-employed, a signed statement certifying the amount of AGI and taxes paid. For someone who filed an income tax return with a government of a U.S. territory or commonwealth or a foreign central government, accept a copy of a wage and tax statement or a signed statement certifying the amount of AGI and taxes paid for 2016. Household size To document the household size, the student needs to provide a statement signed by him and, if dependent, at least one parent that gives the name, age, and relationship to the student of each person in the household. You don't have to verify household size in the following situations: For a dependent student, the household size reported is two with a single, divorced, separated, or widowed parent or is three with par - ents who are married or are unmarried and living together For an independent student, the number reported is two if he is married or one if he is single, divorced, separated, or widowed Keep in mind that household size needs to align with the answers to the relevant dependency status questions, such as the one about having depen -Number in college documentation 34 CFR 668.57(c)Household size documentation 34 CFR 668.57(b)Immigrants and tax filing Immigrants are not exempt from tax fil - ing. The IRS is more concerned whether a person is a resident or nonresident\u2014 rather than legal or illegal\u2014alien. An alien is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national. A resident alien is one who either is a permanent resident or has resided in the U.S. for a specific minimum amount of time (has met the substantial presence test). All others are nonresident aliens. Resident aliens' income is generally subject to tax in the same manner as U.S. citizens', and they file Forms 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. Nonresident aliens who are required to file a return submit Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ; both forms are acceptable documentation for verification. Immigrants who do not have an SSN and are unable to get one can apply with the IRS for an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). The ITIN is only for tax purposes. It does not autho - rize a person to work, endorse his legal status, or entitle him to the earned in - come credit or Social Security benefits. It is not to be used as an identifier in place of the SSN on the FAFSA. See the IRS's Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens at www.irs.gov for more information.AVG-89 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL dents other than a spouse. If verification reveals that answers do not match, the FAFSA needs to be corrected so that they do. Number in college You can document this item with a statement signed by the student (and, if she is dependent, at least one parent) that gives the name and age of each person in the household (excluding the parents of a dependent student) who is enrolled at least half time in a degree or certificate program at an eligible college. The statement must also give the name of each college, and it can be written to document household size as well. Completion of the Department's verification suggested text can satisfy both items. If you have reason to doubt the enrollment information reported, you must obtain from each school a statement that the named person will attend there on at least a half-time basis. You don't have to get such a statement if the person has not yet registered, is attending less than half time, or will be attending your school. If you have reason to doubt whether a reported school is Title IV eligible, you must insure it is, such as by checking to see if it has a federal school code. You don't have to verify the number in college if the reported number enrolled is one (the student only). High school completion Students must provide one of the following documents that indicate their high school completion status at the beginning of the 2018-2019 year: A copy of a high school diploma A copy of a final, official high school transcript that shows the date when the diploma was awarded A copy of the \"secondary school leaving certificate\" or similar docu - ment from the proper government agency for students who com - pleted secondary school in a foreign country. If your college doesn't have the expertise to evaluate foreign secondary school credentials or chooses not to do so, there are evaluation services available. A copy of a General Educational Development (GED) certificate or GED transcript that indicates the student passed the exam Certification of a passing score on a test that the student's state au - thorizes and recognizes as the equivalent of a high school diploma. This includes tests similar to the GED, such as the High School Equivalency Test or the Test Assessing Secondary Completion. Test transcripts are acceptable documentation if they indicate that the final score is a passing score or that the student's state considers the test results to meet its high school equivalency requirements. An academic transcript that indicates the student successfully com - pleted at least a two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree at any participating school. You do not have to collect proof of high school status for graduate students if admission into their program required the completion of at least two years of undergraduate coursework.Refugees and HS completion In rare instances when a refugee, asylee, or victim of human trafficking cannot obtain documentation of high school completion from her home country, a school may accept self-certification in accordance with the guidance of Q & A FHD-Q2/A2 at www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ hearulemaking/2009/hsdiploma.html . ATB alternatives for high school completion Legislation in 2014 and 2015 provided ability-to-benefit (ATB) alternatives to a high school diploma for students en - rolled in a career pathway program on or after July 1, 2014. See DCL GEN-16-09 for more information, including a defini - tion of career pathway program and a list of Q's and A's. Students who were enrolled in a Title IV program prior to July 1, 2012, and were eligible for aid under the old ATB provi - sions retain their eligibility regardless of whether they are in a career pathway program. See GEN-12-09 regarding the grandfathered ATB provisions, and see the announcement of June 24, 2015, for a current list of approved ATB tests. For students who establish Title IV eli - gibility under an ATB alternative, your school should have already obtained or be in the process of obtaining docu - mentation necessary to support his eligibility. Therefore, no further high school completion documentation should be needed from the student.Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019AVG-90 FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL For a student who has not completed high school and is seeking enrollment in a program that leads to at least an associate degree or its equivalent, documentation from the high school that he excelled academically and from your school that he meets your written policy for admitting such students. This should be a rare occurrence. For homeschooled students, a copy of a secondary school comple - tion credential for homeschool (other than a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent) if state law requires homeschooled students to get that credential. If it is not required, a transcript or the equivalent signed by the parent or guardian that lists the secondary school courses the student completed and documents the successful completion of a secondary school education in a homeschool setting. For students in an \"eligible career pathway program,\" documenta - tion that they passed an approved ATB test or completed at least 6 credit hours or 225 clock hours that are applicable toward a degree or certificate offered by your school. See the margin note. If your school has already received one of these documents as part of the admission process, you do not need to ask for another. If you successfully verified a student's high school completion in a prior year, you do not need to do it again. Some schools collect seventh semester high school transcripts prior to students receiving an actual diploma, or they collect high school transcripts for some but not all of their students because they may have spe - cial programs that admit students without a high school diploma. In both cases, schools must collect separate documentation that shows the date when the diploma was awarded. When documentation of high school completion is unavailable\u2014e.g., the school is closed and no information is available from another source such as the school district or state department of education, or the parent or guard - ian who homeschooled the student is deceased\u2014you may accept alternative documentation, such as a military DD Form 214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty that indicates that the student is a high school graduate or equivalent. However, a student's self-certification is not accept - able except in rare instances for refugees, asylees, and victims of human traf - ficking, as explained in the margin note on page 89. Identity and statement of educational purpose Students should appear in person at your school and present a valid, un - expired,* government-issued photo identification (ID) such as a passport or a driver's license or other state-issued ID. You must maintain an annotated copy of that ID that includes the date it was received and the name of the person your school authorized to receive it.** Note that an ID issued by a state university or college is not sufficient for this purpose. Students must also sign a statement of educational purpose that certi - fies who they are and that the federal student aid they may receive will only be used for educational purposes and for the cost of attending the school for the 2018-2019 year. Unlike the other text at the end of the chapter, the text for this statement is not suggested \u2014you must use the exact language given (the student's identification number is optional though if collected elsewhere on the same page as the statement). After examining the statement, you may V4 and V5 reporting As explained on page 81, schools are required to report through FAA Access the outcomes of verifying high school completion status and identity/state - ment of educational purpose for appli - cations with tracking flags V4 and V5.Electronic signatures For verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signa - ture for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the process includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing. This is often accomplished with a PIN or password that is assigned only after the identity of the person receiving the PIN or password has been authenticated.Timing of signature Any required signatures, such as signa - tures on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of verification\u2014they can't be collected after the verification deadline for that award year. * The ID just needs to be unexpired at the time it is checked. For proving iden - tity, it does not matter if the ID is due to expire during the award year. ** The school may determine which of its staff are authorized to review an ap - plicant's identity. We do recommend that the person(s) be full-time staff and that the school keep a record of who they are.AVG-91 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL convert it into an electronic record. You must keep that or the original for at least the required Title IV record retention period. A student who is unable to appear at your school must go to a notary public and sign the statement of educational purpose. He must then submit to your office that statement, a certification from the notary that he appeared before her and presented a government-issued photo ID confirming his iden - tity, and a copy of the same ID. UPDATING INFORMATION Generally, a student cannot update information that was correct as of the date the application was signed because the FAFSA is considered to be a \"snapshot\" of the family's financial situation as of that date. For example, if the student's family sold some stock after she signed the FAFSA and spent the money on an unreported asset such as a car, she can't update her infor - mation to show a change in assets. After the FAFSA is signed, only certain items can be updated under the following conditions: 1. All applicants whose dependency status changes must update that and the related FAFSA information throughout the award year ex - cept when the update is due to the student's marital status changing. 2. All applicants selected by the Department or a school for verifi - cation of household size or number in college must update those numbers to be correct as of the date of verification unless the update is due to a change in the student's marital status. Documenting household size or number in college is not required in a subsequent verification in the same year if the information has not changed. At your discretion you may update under either 1 or 2 even when the update is due to a change in the student's marital status if you deem it neces - sary to address an inequity or to reflect more accurately the applicant's ability to pay. Such a decision must be on a case-by-case basis, and you must docu - ment your reasons for it. You must also update all other pertinent informa - tion, such as spousal income and taxes paid, to be consistent with the new marital status. If you change the status of an applicant to unmarried and that makes him dependent (because he was independent only due to marriage), his FAFSA must be updated with his parents' information. Your school may have a policy of not considering such updates after a specific census date. Note, however, that you cannot update the marital status of an already independent student whose dependency status has not changed because of her marriage or divorce and who was not selected for verification. In such a case you must select the student for verification if you want to exercise your discretion to update her marital status and all other associated information. CORRECTING ERRORS As explained in the last section, you only make updates in specified situa - tions, but for students who are not selected for verification, you or they must correct and submit for processing any errors reported on the original FAFSA that would change the EFC or that determine the students' eligibility for aid.Online notary services Currently the Department does not authorize the use of online notary ser - vices as an alternative to traditional, in- person notary services.REAL ID Act of 2005 The REAL ID Act affects people entering certain restricted areas where identifica - tion is required: federal facilities, nuclear power plants, and federally regulated commercial airplanes. Because there are currently no restrictions under the act on agencies accepting an ID that is not compliant with the act (typically one marked \"not for federal identification\") for other purposes, such an ID is accept - able for verification of identity/state - ment of educational purpose. It must be a government-issued ID that has not expired and includes the student's photo and name.Updating information 34 CFR 668.55 Parent remarriage after applying While the applicant does not typically update household size or number in college because of a change in his mari - tal status, if he is a dependent student and his parent remarries between appli - cation and verification, he must update household size to include the new step - parent. However, the student would not count the new stepparent's income and assets. A school can use professional judgment to include the stepparent's income or to otherwise account for the change. HEA Sec. 475(f)(3) 34 CFR 668.55(b)Application 2018Glossary CFR DCL For students who are selected for verification and receiving subsidized student aid, changes that result to any non-dollar item and to any dollar item of $25 or more must be submitted for processing. See the section on changes in a selected applicant's FAFSA. INTERIM DISBURSEMENTS Interim disbursements are allowed either prior to completing verification or after verification but before receiving the corrected SAR or ISIR. If you have no reason to question the accuracy of the information on the FAFSA, prior to completing verification you may at your discretion 1. make one disbursement of Pell, Perkins, and FSEOG funds for the applicant's first payment period; 2. permit FWS employment for the first 60 consecutive days after the student enrolls for the award year; or 3. originate but not disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan. If verification results in changes to the FAFSA information that you determine will not alter award amounts, you may at your discretion take ac - tions 1-3 as well as disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan prior to receiving the corrected valid SAR or ISIR. Overpayments from interim disbursements If prior to verification you make an interim disbursement of Pell, Per - kins, or FSEOG funds, your school is liable for any overpayment that results. If you can't eliminate it by reducing subsequent disbursements or having the student return the money, your school must use its own funds to reimburse the appropriate program by the earlier of 60 days after the student's last day of attendance or the last day of the award year. If prior to verification your school permits provisional FWS employment of students for up to 60 days, it is liable for any overpayment it can't recover by adjusting other aid, and it must reimburse the FWS account from its own funds. Students must be paid for all work performed out of your school's payroll account\u2014they can't be required to repay FWS wages earned except when they are proven guilty of fraud. If you make an interim disbursement after completing verification but prior to receiving a correct valid SAR or ISIR, and you fail to receive the SAR or ISIR within the deadlines discussed later in this chapter, your school must use its own funds to reimburse the appropriate program and ensure that the student is paid under its own payroll account for all work performed. CHANGES IN A SELECTED APPLICANT'S FAFSA To receive subsidized student aid, students or the school must submit for processing any changes resulting from verification to a non-dollar item or a single dollar item of $25 or more. Also, if you are required to submit any change through CPS because of verification, you must submit all changes, including amounts that are below $25.Interim disbursements 34 CFR 668.58 Recovery of funds from interim CFR 668.61 Changes to FAFSA information 34 CFR 668.59 When there is an overaward from a regular disbursement, the following in - dividual progam regulations apply: Pell 685.303(e)Schools that make disbursements Schools on the Heightened Cash Moni - toring 2 (HCM2) and Reimbursement payment methods (see Volume 4 ) must, as part of their request for Title IV funds from the Department, submit docu - mentation showing that students were eligible to receive the funds disbursed to them (and for which the schools are seeking reimbursement). Because final determination of student eligibility in - cludes completing verification, HCM2 and reimbursement schools are not able to make interim disbursements. Delaying disbursements When schools choose to verify an item other than those the Department se - lects, they may delay disbursing Title IV aid until verification is completed if the school-selected item can affect the stu - dent's Title IV eligibility, such as an item about dependency status. But schools cannot delay disbursing when the item has no bearing on Title IV aid, for ex - ample, if the school is verifying home equity to determine student eligibility for its own or state aid.AVG-93 Chapter 4\u2014Verification, Updates, and Corrections FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Campus-Based and DL changes When students receive subsidized student aid other than Pell Grants and there is a change, adjust the package on the basis of the EFC on the corrected valid SAR or ISIR. If there was an interim disbursement, comply with the relevant rules if the package must be reduced. If there was a regular disburse - ment and the package must be reduced, comply with Perkins or FSEOG overpayment rules or with the rules for dealing with excess loan proceeds for Direct Subsidized Loans. Pell changes When the data on the FAFSA change, recalculate the student's Pell Grant on the basis of the EFC on the corrected valid SAR or ISIR. You can only pay an increased Pell Grant if you have that output document and it supports an increased Pell award. If the Pell Grant is reduced and the student received an interim disburse - ment, adjust following disbursements as necessary. Failing that, the student should reimburse the Pell Grant Program, or, if he does not return the over - payment, your school must reimburse the Pell program with its funds. If the student received Pell Grant money as a regular disbursement, he is responsi - ble for repaying the overpayment. See Volume 5 , Chapter 1 of the Handbook for information on overpayments. Selection after disbursement A student's application might be selected for verification after corrections are submitted and the student has been paid based on the previous unselect - ed CPS transaction. You must verify his application before making further disbursements. If verification does not justify aid already disbursed, then the student is responsible for repaying all aid for which he is not eligible, though he may keep any Direct Loan money he received and FWS wages he earned. See page 94 for what happens if he fails to complete verification. After documentation is complete When you've obtained all necessary verification documents from the student, you should compare them to the SAR or ISIR you are reviewing for payment. If all the student's information is correct and there are no outstanding issues or conflicting information, you may award and disburse aid for which the student is eligible. HOW TO SUBMIT CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES Corrections and updates can be submitted by the student on the SAR or the web or by the school using FAA Access to CPS Online or the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). In addition to the following information, see also \"Corrections and Updates\" in the 2018-2019 ISIR Guide . Using fafsa.gov Any student who has an FSA ID\u2014regardless of how he originally ap - plied\u2014may correct any of his own data by using FAFSA on the Web at https://fafsa.ed.gov . If dependent students need to change parental data, a parent must either sign electronically with her own FSA ID or print out and sign a signature page.Disbursing unsubsidized aid For students who are selected for Veri - fication Group V1, a school may, on a case-by-case basis and with proper doc - umentation, disburse Direct Unsubsi - dized and PLUS loans prior to complet - ing verification when completion will be delayed and the student is eligible for both subsidized and unsubsidized aid. To avoid exceeding the student's financial need, the school must consider the subsidized aid she will receive and adjust the aid amounts after verification if necessary. If the student never completes V1 veri - fication, the Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS loan aid that was disbursed may be kept. If it's determined that the stu - dent was ineligible when she received aid, see the relevant guidance on re - turning aid in such situations in Volume 4, Chapter 3 , of the Handbook. Example: selection after disbursement Owen is attending Guerrero University. His application isn't selected for verification, and he receives aid in the fall. In December, Owen submits a correction on his SAR that causes the ensuing transaction to be selected for verification. The aid administrator at Guerrero tells Owen he needs to submit verification documents if he wants his aid for the spring and if he wants to keep the Pell funds he received for the fall, but Owen doesn't turn in the documents. Owen doesn't have to repay the Stafford loan he got in the fall, but he does have to return the Pell Grant, and Guerrero must cancel his aid package for the spring.Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019AVG-94 FSA HB August 2018Glossary CFR DCL Submitting changes via FAA Access to CPS Online or EDE Your school can submit corrections and updates electronically through FAA Access to CPS Online or EDE even if the original application wasn't submitted with that method. If your school isn't listed on the transaction you want to correct , the student will have to give you the DRN printed on the SAR or SAR Acknowledgement so that you can add your school in the next available institution field and then get electronic access to the resulting cor - rected transaction. If all the fields are filled, the student will have to tell you which school to replace with yours. If you send a correction or update for a student, you must first have signed documentation from the student and parent. This can be signatures on Part 2 of the SAR, a signed copy of the correction or update, or a signed verification document. Unlike those for the original application, these do not have to be wet signatures. See Chapter 2 for more on signature requirements. The CPS will process the change, send an ISIR to the school, and send the student a one-page SAR acknowledgement or, if the CPS has her email address, an email with a link to her SAR information on the web. Using the SAR to make corrections Students who received a paper SAR may make corrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the SAR (of course, students with FSA IDs can instead use fafsa.gov ). One parent must also sign if the student is dependent and parent data was changed, unless the only corrections are to the institution or housing codes, the address, or telephone number. If the student applied electronically through a school or received an email link to SAR information on the web but would like to make corrections with a paper SAR, she can have one mailed to her by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243 and providing her name, SSN, and date of birth. Adding schools and changing a student's address As with other changes, a student can add schools or change her address, email address, or telephone number online or on a paper SAR. But she can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID and pro - viding her DRN. You can submit those changes for her through FAA Access, although, as noted before, if your school was not listed on the student's appli - cation, you will need her DRN to add your school. The FAFSA has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: four schools can appear on the paper application, 10 with either FAFSA on the Web, FAA Access, or EDE. If the student wants information sent to more schools, he can use any of the methods listed pre - viously to replace some or all of the original schools, though the replaced schools will not receive an ISIR. For example, if the student originally listed 10 schools on the application and then used fafsa.gov to replace two schools with two new ones, those that were replaced would not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.Corrections by phone limited to processor errors As we've discussed, a student with a DRN can change his address and school listings by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center. Most other corrections can't be made over the phone\u2014they have to be done on the SAR or through fafsa.gov or FAA Access. There is only one exception, and that's when the information the student submitted on a paper FAFSA or SAR was not scanned or input correctly. If a student contacts the FSAIC and an operator can verify by viewing the im - age file of the document that an answer to an item was not correctly recorded by the FAFSA processor, the operator can correct that error. The correction will be transmitted to the CPS, a corrected ISIR will be available to the student's schools within 72 hours, and he will receive a corrected SAR in the mail within 10 days. The student doesn't have to sign for this correc - tion because he has already signed the original paper document that has the correct information.Making corrections and updates FAFSA on the Web https://fafsa.ed.gov/ FAA Access to CPS Online https://faaaccess.ed.gov / or via EDE by the school aid office Student aid report paper corrections sent by mail By phone Change schools listed or student address (DRN required) Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243)AVG-95 2018Glossary CFR DCL Verification completed within additional time period for Pell 34 CFR 668.60(c)(1)DEADLINES AND FAILURE TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION You must require students selected for verification\u2014either by your school or the Department\u2014to submit the documentation by the date speci - fied by your school (for Campus-Based and DL) or the Department (for Pell). Campus-Based and DL If a student doesn't provide verification documentation within a reason - able time period that your school has established, you cannot disburse more Perkins or FSEOG funds, employ or permit further FWS employment, or originate or disburse any additional Direct Loans (subsidized, un - subsidized, or PLUS). The student must repay any Perkins or FSEOG funds she received that year. If she fails to complete verification within the time period established by your school and if you received any Direct Subsidized Loan funds for the student that you did not disburse, you must return some or all of those funds under the excess cash tolerance regulation [see 34 CFR 668.166(b) and Volume 4 , Chapter 2 ]. Notwithstanding this, if the student provides the documentation after your school's deadline, you may, at your discretion, still provide aid. Pell Grants A student selected for verification may submit a valid SAR or a school can receive a valid ISIR after the Pell deadline but before the verification deadline published in the Federal Register . If a student does not provide the verification documentation or you do not receive the valid SAR or ISIR (if necessary) within this additional time, he forfeits his Pell Grant for the award year and must return any Pell money already received for that year. Other considerations The Department may determine not to process the FAFSA of an appli - cant who has been requested to provide documentation until he does so or the Department decides there is no longer a need for it. A Pell applicant selected for verification must complete the process by the deadline published in the Federal Register . The notice for 2017-2018 was published on June 27, 2017, and the deadline for that year is September 22, 2018, or 120 days after the last day of the student's enrollment, whichever is earlier. When the notice for 2018-2019 is published, the corresponding deadline date is expected to be September 21, 2019. Campus-Based and Stafford Loan applicants must complete verification by the same deadline or by an earlier one established by your aid office. Verification is complete when you have all the requested documentation and a valid ISIR or SAR (one on which all the information is accurate and complete). This includes any necessary corrections, which must be made by the Federal Register deadlines for submitting paper or electronic corrections.Failure to submit documentation 34 CFR Pell Grants Campus-Based/DL DCL Late disbursements Generally a student ceases to be eligible for aid once he has finished the term and is no longer enrolled. However, he may submit verification documentation and receive a late disbursement after that time if the Department processed a SAR or ISIR with an official EFC while he was still enrolled. For information on post-withdrawal disbursements, see Volume 5 . Verification status codes When you disburse a Pell Grant, you must report the student's verifica - tion status through Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) even if he wasn't selected for verification. V\u2014Y ou have verified the student. This includes students selected by the CPS and those your school chose to verify based on its own criteria. W\u2014The student was selected for verification by the CPS or your school, and you chose to pay a first disbursement of Pell without documenta - tion. This code must be updated once verification is complete, or COD will reduce the Pell Grant to zero. S\u2014The CPS selected the student for verification, but you did not verify him because he satisfied one of the exclusions described earlier in the chapter (except the post-enrollment exclusion; see \"Blank\" next). Blank\u2014Report a blank if you have not performed verification because neither the CPS nor your school selected the student or because the student was selected by the CPS after ceasing to be enrolled at your school and all (including late) disbursements were made. SUGGESTED VERIFICATION TEXT We are providing suggested text for the 2018-2019 verification items that were identified in the May 5, 2017, Federal Register notice and in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-05. This suggested text fulfills verification require - ments, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else's) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be veri - fied for a particular student or group of students. However, schools must not put the seal of the Department of Education on any verification documents. The one exception is that schools must use the exact language provided in the \"Statement of Educational Purpose\" for students who are placed in verification tracking groups V4 or V5. This does not include the accompany - ing notary's certificate of acknowledgment; for that the school may use some other form, such as the one its state uses. For more information, including copies of the suggested text, see the electronic announcement of August 16, 2017 , on the IFAP website.Further verification? Sometimes schools ask if further verifi - cation is needed to resolve discrepan - cies between the ISIR and what the student provided for verification. The answer is no, unless you have reason to doubt the accuracy of the verification information. Acceptable documentation either confirms that an item was right on the ISIR, or it is used to correct that item. That is the purpose of verification; continued fact-finding is not necessary.2018-2019 Suggested Verification Text Verification of 2016 Income Information for Student Tax Filers Important Note: The instructions below apply to the student and spouse, if the student is married. Notify the financial aid office if the student or spouse filed separate IRS income tax returns for 2016 or had a change in marital status after December 31, 2016. Instructions: Complete this section if the student and spouse filed or will file a 2016 IRS income tax return(s). The best way to verify income is by using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) that is part of FAFSA on the Web at FAFSA.gov. In most cases, no further documentation is needed to verify 2016 income information that was transferred into the student's FAFSA using the IRS DRT if that information was not changed by the FAFSA filer.

AVG-111 CHAPTERC 5Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 While many questions you get as a financial aid administrator will have routine answers, some situations will require extra discretion on your part. To account for special circumstances of a student, you may choose to exercise professional judgment (PJ) to adjust her cost of attendance or the data that determine her EFC. You might decide that unusual circumstances warrant making a dependent student independent. If you receive conflicting information for a student, you will need to resolve that. In some cases you may discover that a student has been guilty of fraud and should be reported. And you may need to determine if a student should be classified as an unac - companied homeless youth. PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT An aid administrator may use PJ on a case-by-case basis only to adjust the student's cost of attendance or the data used to calculate her EFC. This adjustment is valid only at the school making it. You submit a PJ change elec - tronically, via FAA Access to CPS Online or third-party software, and you may do it without a signature from the student or parent. In FAA Access or EDE, you must select \"EFC adjustment requested\" for the professional judg - ment field. The next ISIR will indicate \"Professional judgment processed.\" The reason for the adjustment must be documented (by a third party if possible), and it must relate to the special circumstances that differentiate him\u2014not to conditions that exist for a whole class of students. You must re - solve any inconsistent or conflicting information shown on the output docu - ment before making any adjustments. An FAA's decision regarding adjust - ments is final and cannot be appealed to the Department. The statute states that nothing within it shall be construed as limiting the authority of aid administrators to make data adjustments for some situations. However, the law gives some examples of special circumstances, such as elementary or secondary school tuition, medical or dental or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care costs, being homeless or a dislocated worker, recent unemployment of a family member, or other changes in the family's income or assets. Use of PJ is neither limited to nor required for the situations mentioned.There are unusual situations where you will need to exercise your discre - tion as a financial aid administrator: when modifying data used to cal - culate the expected family contribution (EFC), performing dependency overrides, resolving conflicting information, reporting cases of fraud, and determining a student to be an unaccompanied homeless youth.Special Cases Online review of PJ practices https://ifap.ed.gov/qadocs/ FSAVeriModule/activity2verif.doc Prior-prior year data and PJ Because prior-prior year data is older than prior year data, schools may see more cases that justify the use of PJ to adjust for more current circumstances of a family, for example, if the income has changed significantly, either up - ward or downward. The Department is aware of this and expects that there will be some increased use of PJ. Schools should continue to follow the guide - lines presented here and be aware that while they may identify a category of students with similar circumstances to consider for a possible professional judgment adjustment (e.g., students who quit jobs to start school), they may not, however, automatically provide identical treatment to all students in that category. Each PJ case must be de - termined and documented individually. See DCL GEN-16-03 . PJ and unemployment benefits The Department has issued special guidance concerning the use of profes - sional judgment for persons who are receiving unemployment benefits dur - ing economic hardship. This continues to be in effect; see DCL GEN-11-04 for more 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Another situation where you might want to use professional judgment involves Roth IRAs. When someone converts a regular IRA into a Roth IRA by transferring funds, the amount converted has to be reported as taxable in - come on the tax return. So the income reported on the FAFSA will be higher than without the Roth conversion, even though the family doesn't actually have additional income or assets available. You can use professional judg - ment to reduce the income and taxes paid to the amount that would have been reported if there was no Roth conversion if you think the adjustment is warranted for a student. As with the specific special circumstances listed in the law, you're not required to make an adjustment in this situation. The law doesn't allow you to modify either the formula or the tables used in the EFC calculation; you can only change the cost of attendance or the values of specific data elements used in the EFC calculation. In addition, you can't adjust data elements or the cost of attendance solely because you believe the tables and formula are not adequate or appropriate. The data elements that are adjusted must relate to the student's special circumstances. For ex - ample, if a family member is ill, you might modify the AGI to allow for lower earnings in the coming year or might adjust assets to indicate that family sav - ings will be spent on medical expenses. You can't use PJ to waive general student eligibility requirements or to circumvent the intent of the law or regulations. For instance, you cannot use PJ to change FSEOG selection criteria. Nor can you include post-enrollment activity expenses in the student's COA. For example, professional licensing costs to be incurred after the enrollment period would not be includable (though one-time licensing costs incurred during the enrollment period may be\u2014see Cost of Attendance in Volume 3 ). Occasionally aid administrators have made decisions contrary to the pro - fessional judgment provision's intent. These \"unreasonable\" judgments have included, for example, the reduction of EFCs based on recurring costs such as vacation expenses, tithing expenses, and standard living expenses (related to utilities, credit card expenses, children's allowances, and the like). Aid ad - ministrators must make \"reasonable\" decisions that support the intent of the provision. Your school is held accountable for all professional judgment deci - sions and for fully documenting each decision. An FAA should keep in mind that an income protection allowance (IPA) is included in the EFC calculation to account for modest living expenses. Be - fore adjusting for an unusual expense, consider whether it is already covered by the IPA. It is reasonable to assume that approximately 30% of the IPA is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for transportation expenses, 16% for clothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family consump - tion. The income protection allowance is one of the intermediate values in the FAA Information section of the output document (labeled as \"IPA\"). See Chapter 3 for the IPA values. If you use professional judgment to adjust a data element, you must use the resulting EFC consistently for all FSA funds awarded to that student. For example, if for awarding the student's Pell Grant you adjust a data element that affects the EFC, that new EFC must also be used to determine the stu - dent's eligibility for aid from the Campus-Based and Stafford Loan programs.Professional judgment HEA Sec. 479A(a) IN GENERAL\u2014Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an indi - vidual eligible applicant with special circum - stances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance, unusu - ally high child care or dependent care costs, recent unemployment of a family member or an independent student, a student or family member who is a dislocated worker (as defined in section 101 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998), the number of parents enrolled at least half time in a de - gree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 487, a change in housing status that results in an individual being homeless (as defined in section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act), or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets or a student's status. Spe - cial circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this title shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid ad - ministrator in such cases (1) to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this title, or (2) to offer a dependent student financial assistance under section 428H or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan without requiring the parents of such stu - dent to file the financial aid form prescribed under section 483 if the student financial aid administrator verifies that the parent or parents of such student have ended finan - cial support of such student and refuse to file such form. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.Chapter 5\u2014Special CasesAVG-113Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 If you make a PJ adjustment, you must set the FAA Adjustment flag in FAA Access or via the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). Finally, if you use PJ for a student who was selected for verification (by you or the Department), you must complete verification before exercising professional judgment. However, you do not have to verify information that you will entirely remove due to PJ. For example, if a dependent student's parents have separated after completion of the FAFSA and one parent is no longer in the household size and you decide to use PJ to remove that parent's income from the FAFSA, you do not have to first verify his or her income. Also, using PJ does not require you to verify a student's application if he was not already selected for verification by the Department or your school. Students without parent support Students whose parents refuse to support them are not eligible for a dependency override, but they may be able to receive unsubsidized Stafford loans only. For a student to be eligible for this provision (the text of which is in the \"Professional judgment\" margin note on page 112), you must get doc - umentation (1) that his parents refuse to complete his FAFSA and (2) that they do not and will not provide any financial support to him. Include the date support ended. If the parents refuse to sign and date a statement to this effect, you must get documentation from a third party (the student himself is not sufficient), such as a teacher, counselor, cleric, or court. As noted in the next section, this situation does not justify a dependency override. But as with overrides, resolving the situation is at your discretion. If you decide that a student falls into this category, you must document your decision and ensure that the student submits a FAFSA and passes all the eli - gibility matches. The result will be a rejected application with no EFC. You can then award the student unsubsidized Stafford loans up to the maximum the student would normally be eligible for depending on his grade level (but not the amount a student can get when his parent is unable to get a PLUS loan). See DCL GEN-08-12 for more information. DEPENDENCY OVERRIDES An FAA may do dependency overrides on a case-by-case basis for stu - dents with unusual circumstances. If the FAA determines that an override is appropriate, she must write out the determination and retain it and the supporting documentation. However, none of the conditions listed below, singly or in combination, qualify as unusual circumstances meriting a de - pendency override: 1. Parents refuse to contribute to the student's education. 2. Parents are unwilling to provide information on the FAFSA or for verification. 3. Parents do not claim the student as a dependent for income tax pur - poses. 4. Student demonstrates total self-sufficiency.Dependency overrides HEA Sec. 480(d)(1)(I) and (d)(2). Also see Dear Colleague Letters GEN-03-07 and GEN-11-15.IPA percentage example In 2016 Alan had $3,550 in medical ex - penses that were out-of-pocket costs. He is married, has two children, and is the only member of his household in college, so his IPA is $39,780. Because his expenses were less than the amount for medical expenses already provided for in the IPA (11% of $39,780 is $4,376), the aid administrator at Sarven Tech - nical Institute does not adjust Alan's FAFSA information.Adjustment example Kitty's mother had income earned from work of $25,000 in 2016 but is no longer employed. After receiving documenta - tion confirming this, the FAA at Krieger College decides to adjust the AGI re - ported for Kitty's parents to take into account their reduced income. The FAA also reduces the income earned from work for Kitty's mother to zero. Dependency override example Said is a refugee from Iraq who quali - fies for federal student aid as an eligible noncitizen. But his FAFSA was rejected because he is a dependent student and did not provide data for his parents. When the aid administrator asks him for his parents' information, he says they are in Iraq and have been displaced due to the upheaval there, and he doesn't know how to contact them. The FAA asks him for documentation of this, and Said says that he has an uncle living in the U.S. who can attest to his situation. The FAA asks for Said's uncle to either appear in person and sign a statement confirming Said's account or to send the aid office a notarized statement. Said's uncle, who works not far from the school, comes to the aid office, signs the statement, and the FAA grants Said a dependency override.AVG-114 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Unusual circumstances do include (and may cause any of the afore - mentioned conditions) abandonment by parents, an abusive family environ - ment that threatens the student's health or safety, or the student being unable to locate his parents. In such cases an override might be warranted. These conditions would not disqualify a student from being a homeless unaccompanied youth or self-supporting and at risk of homelessness. An aid administrator may override only from dependent to inde - pendent (though as suggested earlier, if an independent student receives substantial support from others, a school may use PJ to adjust the COA or FAFSA data items such as untaxed income). Documentation is critical to the dependency override process. The docu - mentation must support, and include the reason for, the decision and should in almost all cases originate from a third party with knowledge of the unusual circumstances of the student. An FAA may, without gathering documentation, use an override that another school granted in the same award year. However, overrides do not carry over from one year to the next; the FAA must reaffirm each year that the unusual circumstances persist and an override is still justified. A third party that knows the student's situation\u2014e.g., a teacher, coun - selor, medical authority, member of the clergy, prison administrator, govern - ment agency, or court\u2014should establish the unusual circumstances. Evidence can be a signed letter or an official document, such as a court order. If third party documentation is not available, the school may (it is not required to) accept a signed and dated statement from the student or a family member detailing the unusual circumstances. Such a statement should be a last resort. To override the student's dependent status on an initial application through FAA Access, the FAA should use the Dependency Override code of \"1\" (see the EDE Technical Reference for more information). To authorize a dependency override on a paper FAFSA, the FAA marks the bubble for an override, labeled \"D/O,\" in the \"College Use Only\" area, fills in the school's federal code, and signs. A separate letter attached to the application in lieu of making the override is not acceptable.Unable to provide parent data FAFSA on the Web allows students to indicate that they believe they have special circumstances that prevent them from providing parent informa - tion. A student who indicates this is thoroughly informed about what war - rants a dependency override and what the results will be for his application. If he persists through those screens and does not include parent data, he will get a rejected ISIR that will have the special circumstances flag set. You will have to review the student's situation and determine if he: is an unaccompanied homeless individual, merits a depen - dency override, must instead provide parent data, or should be permitted to borrow only unsubsidized Stafford loans because he can document that his parents have refused to support him and to provide their information on his FAFSA. In the last case he does not re - ceive a dependency override. Overrides and professional judgment The phrase \"professional judgment\" is loosely used for the discretion that FAAs apply to dependency overrides and to data adjustments in the application. The provisions for these two types of chang - es are in separate places in the HEA. The citation for dependency overrides is in Sec. 480(d)(7); the citation for data ad - justments is in Sec. 479A and is copied in toto in the margin on page 112. Refusing or reducing a loan Remember that the discretion of FAAs extends to refusing or reducing Direct Loan funds as long as the reason is documented and given in written form to the student and is not due to dis - crimination against the student on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability. HEA Sec. 479A(c)Chapter 5\u2014Special CasesAVG-115Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 If the student has already applied, you can use FAA Access to authorize or cancel an override; overrides cannot be done on the SAR. If she had an override done at another school in the current year, that will be noted with the school's federal code on FAA Access. Only the school performing the override will receive that transaction. If the student adds your school to the transaction or if she gives you her data release number (DRN), you can ac - cess the record. CONFLICTING INFORMATION In addition to reviewing application and data match information from the CPS, a school must have an adequate internal system to identify con - flicting information\u2014regardless of the source and regardless of whether the student is selected for verification\u2014that would affect a student's eligibility, such as information from the admissions office as to whether the student has a high school diploma or information from other offices regarding academic progress and enrollment status. The school must resolve all such conflicting information, except when the student dies during the award year or when she is no longer enrolled and will not re-enroll; if the student later enrolls, you are again obligated to resolve the conflicting information. If your school has conflicting information concerning a student's eligibil - ity or you have any reason to believe his application information is incorrect, you must resolve the discrepancies before disbursing FSA funds and, as with verification, before making any PJ adjustment. If you discover discrepancies after disbursing FSA funds, you must still reconcile the conflicting informa - tion and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements. Subsequent ISIRs You are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you verified an earlier transac - tion. First determine if the EFC or the \"C\" flag has changed or if there are new comments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Also, check any updates or corrections or whether the verification tracking group has changed. If the EFC has not changed and there are no changes in the \"C\" flag, tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally required. If the EFC does change but it either doesn't affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that changed were already verified, no action is required. But if the EFC changes and the pertinent data elements were not verified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the \"C\" flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must resolve any conflicts. Discrepant tax data Financial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, yet there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax law information can evalu - ate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental understanding of relevant tax issues that can considerably af - fect the need analysis. You are obligated to know: (1) whether a person was required to file a tax return, (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be, and (3) that an individual cannot be claimed as an exemption by more than one person.IRS Publication 17 The IRS's Publication 17 is a large docu - ment, but so that you won't be daunted by its size, we have included the page numbers you might need to refer to.Requirement to identify and resolve discrepant information 34 CFR 668.16(f) Requirement to verify questionable data 34 CFR 668.54(a)(2) \"If an institution has reason to believe that an applicant's FAFSA information is inaccurate, it must verify the accuracy of that information.\" Marital and tax filing status The ISIR/SAR comments with codes 361-368 indicate a possible error when the filing status and marital status do not match. This is not considered to be conflicting information subject to the resolution requirements of 34 CFR 668.16(f), but we do encourage schools to review the application for mistakes when these comments appear. See the electronic announcement from May 15, 2014.AVG-116 Application and Verification Guide 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 Publication 17 of the IRS, Your Federal Income Tax , is a useful resource that you can view on the web at www.irs.gov . It addresses pertinent tax issues on these pages: the filing requirements\u2014i.e., who is required to file a return\u2014 are on pages 4-6; the instructions on which form a person should file are on pages 6-8; and the filing status requirements are on pages 20-25. For example, an FAA who notices that a dependent student's married parents have each filed as \"head of household\" (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or married) must question whether that is the correct filing status. Publication 17 explains on pages 22-25 the criteria a per - son must meet to file as head of household. Resolution of the conflict may be a reasonable explanation of why there appears to be a conflict but is none, or the parents may refile and submit a copy of the amended return. Resolution of conflicting information You may not disburse aid until you have resolved conflicting informa - tion, which you must do for any student as long as he is at your school. Even if the conflict concerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have determined which data are cor - rect; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. Of course, you must document your findings and include an expla - nation that justifies your decision. REFERRAL OF FRAUD CASES If you suspect that a student, employee, or other individual has misre - ported information or altered documentation to fraudulently obtain federal funds, you should report your suspicions and provide any evidence to the Of - fice of Inspector General.

See the announce - ment for more 5\u2014Special CasesAVG-117Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB August 2018 UNACCOMPANIED HOMELESS YOUTH If a student does not have and cannot get documentation from any of the authorities given on page 27, you (the FAA) must determine if she is an un - accompanied youth who is homeless or is self-supporting and at risk of being homeless. Any student who is not yet 24 may qualify for a homeless youth determination. It is important to make homeless youth determinations on a case-by-case basis. As defined in the margin note, a student is considered homeless if he lacks fixed, regular, and adequate housing. This is broader than just living \"on the street.\" It includes temporarily living with other people because he had nowhere else to go; living in substandard housing (if it doesn't meet lo - cal building codes or the utilities are turned off, it is generally not adequate); living in emergency or transitional shelters, for example, trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency after disasters; or living in motels, camping grounds, cars, parks, abandoned buildings, bus or train sta - tions, or any public or private place not designed for humans to live in. It also includes living in the school dormitory if the student would otherwise be homeless. A student living in any of these situations and fleeing an abusive parent may be considered homeless even if the parent would provide support and a place to live. The documentation for an FAA's evaluation of the living arrangements of a student must demonstrate that she meets the definition of this category of independent student. The determination may be based on a documented interview with the student if there is no written documentation available. When you are making a determination of homelessness: Ask for help with determining eligibility from local school district homeless liaisons, state homeless education coordinators, the Na - tional Center for Homeless Education ( https://nche.ed.gov/ ), or the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth ( www.naehcy.org ). School district homeless liaisons and shelter providers can help you develop and implement procedures for verification. Relevant information can come from recognized third-parties such as private or publicly funded homeless shelters and service provid - ers, financial aid administrators from another college, college access programs such as TRIO and GEAR UP, college or high school coun - selors, other mental health professionals, social workers, mentors, doctors, and clergy. Use discretion when gathering information, and respect the student's privacy. Some information, such as that protected by doctor-patient privilege, is confidential. Also, documents such as police or Child Protective Services reports are not necessary. Do not focus on why the student is homeless or unaccompanied but on whether the evi - dence shows that he is an unaccompanied homeless youth as defined in section 725 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a); see the margin note.Homeless youth definitions At risk of being homeless \u2014when a student's housing may cease to be fixed, regular, and adequate, for exam - ple, a student who is being evicted and has been unable to find fixed, regular, and adequate housing Homeless \u2014lacking fixed, regular, and adequate housing Self-supporting \u2014when a student pays for his own living expenses, including fixed, regular, and adequate housing Unaccompanied \u2014when a student is not living in the physical custody of a parent or guardian Housing Fixed \u2014stationary, permanent, and not subject to change Regular \u2014used on a predictable, rou - tine, or consistent basis Adequate \u2014sufficient for meeting both the physical and psychological needs typically met in the homeHomeless youth determinations DCL DCL FSA HB August 2018 Determine eligibility based on the legal definitions provided. Unaccompanied homeless youth may use the address of your school as their own on the FAFSA. For students you determine to be unaccompanied homeless youths or unaccompanied, self-supporting youths at risk of being homeless, select the homeless youth determination option (#4) in the dependency override field in FAA Access to CPS Online or EDE. On the paper FAFSA, fill in the rel - evant bubble in the \"College Use Only\" box (see the graphic on page 114), include your school code, and sign. For students who have already filed their FAFSA, submit a FAFSA correction using the Homeless Youth Determina - tion flag on the \"dependency determination\" page (Special Circumstances flag on the ISIR). To cancel a homeless youth determination, you use the same method as when canceling a dependency override: change the depen - dency override value to \"2\u2014FAA override canceled\" in FAA Access or EDE. You may rely on a determination by another school that a student was in this category on or after July 1, 2017. Also, a new determination must be made each year for an applicant who is homeless or at risk of being homeless.Confirmation not required You are not required to confirm the an - swers to the homeless youth questions unless you have conflicting informa - tion. A documented phone call with, or a written statement from, one of the relevant authorities is sufficient verifica - tion when needed. In most cases the officials authorized to make an unaccompanied homeless youth determination (see page 27) will only provide documentation of that sta - tus for persons they are directly provid - ing services to. However, there may be a few case-by-case instances where such an official will provide documentation for a person who is no longer officially receiving services. Also, local liaisons may write subsequent year letters of verification for unaccompanied home - less youth through age 23 for whom they have the necessary information to write such letters. This documentation is acceptable for verifying unaccompa - nied homelessness. It is not conflicting information if you disagree with an authority's determina - tion that a student is homeless. If you believe the authority is incorrect or abusing the process, accept his determi - nation but contact the following over - sight party, as relevant, to evaluate the authority's determinations: School district homeless liason: con - tact the coordinator of education for homeless children and youth programs of the state's educational agency. A list of state coordinators can be found at https://nche.ed.gov/states/ state_resources.php . Director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program: you should contact the local Continuum of Care (CoC) administering the HUD homeless assistance program. Go to https://www.hudexchange.info/ programs/coc/ and click on \"Contact a CoC\" on the right side of the page. Director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program: contact the National Clear - inghouse on Families and Youth by phone at 301-608-8098 or by email at ncfy@acf.hhs.gov .1-1 i FSA HB May 2018Introduction SOURCES OF INFORMATION There are many factors you must consider when reviewing an application for aid from the FSA programs, such as whether the student is a U.S. citi - zen or permanent resident, whether the applicant is making satisfactory aca - demic progress, and whether he or she has a defaulted FSA loan. To answer these questions you receive information about the student from different sources, including the Department of Education's Central Processing System (CPS) for financial aid applications and the National Student Loan Data Sys - tem (NSLDS). Throughout the year, the Department of Education (The Department) provides updates to schools in the form of Dear Colleague Letters (DCLs). These and other releases, such as Federal Register notices and announcements containing system updates and technical guidance, are available on the Infor - mation for Financial Aid ). The FSA Handbook doesn't cover the operation of software. For schools using software from the Department, there are technical references on the FSA Download website (see the margin) that explain how the software oper - ates. Schools using third-party software should consult the vendor's refer - ence materials for technical guidance.

Updated DCL citation in Remaining Perkins Loan authority sidebar.1-4 Requirements In this chapter, we discuss student eligibility requirements that don't require information from the Department's systems. The school determines on its own whether the student meets these eligibility requirements. In some cases, the financial aid office will need to get information from other school offices, such as the admissions office or the registrar, or from other organizations, such as high schools or testing agencies. REGULAR STUDENT IN AN ELIGIBLE PROGRAM Aperson must be enrolled as a regular student in an eligible program to receive Federal Student Aid (FSA) funds (exceptions are discussed later in this chapter). A regular student is someone who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate offered by the school. The requirement for an eligible program is discussed in Volume 2, Chapter 2 . A school must document a student's enrollment in an eligible program at the time of admission, and it must have a system to notify the financial aid office if the student leaves the program. It must also document that an aid recipient is a regular student. Conditional acceptance. Some schools admit students provisionally, for example, until they provide further documentation, such as academic transcripts or test scores, or demonstrate an ability to succeed in the program by receiving acceptable grades in program coursework. Typically, the school will limit these students' enrollment in terms of number of courses or enrollment status until they meet the necessary conditions. Students admitted as conditional are regular students only if the school officially accepts them into the eligible degree or certificate program. The Department does not define official acceptance or admission. If the student is merely allowed to take some courses before being officially admitted to the program, she is not considered a regular student and is not eligible for FSA funds until she is officially admitted. Schools may offer a trial or conditional period during which a student at - tends a program without incurring program charges or receiving FSA funds. If the student continues beyond the trial period and enrolls as a regular stu - dent, the school can pay him FSA grants for the entire payment period and loans for the period of enrollment. Continuing education. Regular students may receive aid for classes they take in a school's continuing education department as long as the classes apply to their degree or certificate program.Student eligibility 34 CFR 668.32 See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for eligible program requirements. Regular student example HEA Sec. 484(a)(1), (b)(3), (4); College (NSCC) allows anyone with a high school diploma or the equivalent to enroll in any course. Many of NSCC's students do not intend to receive a degree or certificate; they are not regular students. NSCC requires those who want to receive a degree or certificate to complete a form stating which degree or certificate they are studying for and to meet periodically with an academic advisor. NSCC considers them to be regular students. Trial periods of enrollment DCL GEN-11-12 You may offer trial periods of enrollment to allow a student to \"try out\" a program, without incurring charges or receiving Title IV (TIV) aid, before deciding to continue the program as a regular student and applying for Title IV aid. 1-6 Volume student for study at the postsecondary level (as opposed to preparatory coursework, which prepares a student for a given program). A student enrolled solely in a remedial program is not considered to be in an eligible program. If acceptance into an eligible program is contingent on completing remedial work, a student cannot be considered enrolled in that program until she completes the remedial work. However, if the student is admitted into an eligible program and takes remedial coursework within that program, he can be considered a regular student, even if he is taking all remedial courses before taking any regular courses. You may count up to one academic year's worth of these courses in his enrollment status for federal aid. For the purpose of this limit, that is 30 semester or trimester hours, 45 quarter hours, or 900 clock hours. If the remedial classes are non-credit or reduced-credit, you must determine how many credit hours they are worth to count toward the student's enrollment status (see \"Enrollment status\" section in this chapter). A remedial course cannot be below the educational level needed for a student to successfully pursue her program after one year in that course. Also, remedial courses must be at least at the high school level, as determined by the state legal authority, your school's accrediting agency, or the state agency recognized for approving public postsecondary vocational education. If that agency determines that a remedial class is at the elementary level, the school must abide by that determination, and the class cannot be included for FSA purposes. Nor can FSA funds be used for a remedial course that uses direct assessment of student learning instead of credit or clock hours. You can't use non-credit remedial hours to determine a student's enrollment status if the course is part of a program that leads to a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. A student is never permitted to receive funds for training or for coursework prior to the completion of high school, even if the high school equivalency training is offered at postsecondary schools or is required for the postsecondary program. Similar to other remedial coursework, a student may receive FSA funds for English as a second language (ESL) courses that are part of a larger eli - gible program. There are differences though: ESL courses don't count against the one-year limitation on remedial coursework, and they need not be at the secondary school level. If your school permits a student to enroll in ESL or other remedial cours - es that don't apply to his degree or certificate, be aware that awarding FSA loans or Pell Grants over a series of semesters for such work can exhaust his eligibility for Pell Grants and/or FSA loans before he completes his program.Conditional acceptance examples 1. Waveland University allows students to take graduate courses before they have taken the GRE, but it limits them to no more than three courses and does not admit them into its graduate programs until they have submitted acceptable GRE scores. They aren't regular students, and since the school hasn't admitted them, they aren't eligible for FSA funds. 2. When Wrigley University accepts students into its graduate programs, it requires that the students receive no grade lower than a \"B\" in the first three courses. During this time, the school considers students to be admitted into the program, so they are eligible for FSA. If, however, students receive a grade lower than a B in any of the first three classes, their admittance will be withdrawn and they then will be ineligible for further FSA funds. Continuing education examples 1. Sheffield University has a continuing education department that offers many online (telecommunications) courses that students in other departments of the school may take and that apply to the degree or certificate program in which the students are enrolled. These are regular students who are eligible for FSA funds. 2. Windy City University has a continuing education department that offers many courses. Some students enroll in these courses without being admitted to the university. They are not regular students and are not eligible for FSA funds. Remedial coursework Preparatory coursework A student not enrolled in a degree or certificate program is eligible for Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans (and a parent may receive Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent student) for up to one year if she is taking coursework necessary for enrollment in an eligible program. See the discussion under Direct Loans in Chapter 6 of this volume. Teacher certification coursework A student may receive Federal Work-Study (FWS), as well as Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans, and Perkins Loans (and a parent may receive Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent student) if he or she is enrolled at least half time in required teacher certification coursework, even if it does not lead to a degree or certificate awarded by the school. For more details on Direct Loan and Perkins Loan eligibility criteria, see Chapter 6 of this volume. To qualify, the coursework must be required for elementary or secondary teacher certification or recertification in the state where the student plans to teach and must be offered in credit or clock hours. Courses using direct assessment in lieu of credit or clock hours are not eligible. An otherwise eligible student may also receive a TEACH Grant. Optional courses that the student elects to take for professional recognition or advancement, and courses recommended by your school but not required for certification, do not qualify. You should document that the courses are required by the state for teacher certification. A student with a bachelor's degree who is enrolled in a postbaccalaureate teacher certification program can receive a Pell Grant in limited situations. See Chapter 6 of this volume. Students with intellectual disabilities Students with an intellectual disability (see margin note) can receive funds from the Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS programs. They must be en - rolled or accepted for enrollment in a comprehensive transition and postsec - ondary program (as defined in 34 CFR 668.231) for students with intellectual disabilities and must maintain satisfactory academic progress as determined by the school for this program. These students: do not have to be enrolled for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate, and are not required to have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. Except for the statutes governing need analysis, the Secretary has the authority to waive any Pell Grant, FSEOG, FWS, or institutional eligibility provisions necessary to ensure that programs enrolling students with intellec - tual disabilities are eligible for these three types of federal student aid and that eligible students receive those funds.Students with intellectual disabilities HEA Sec. 484(s) 34 CFR 668.230-233 20 U.S.C. 1091, 1140 Students who: 1) have mental retardation or a cognitive impairment characterized by significant limitations in intellectual and cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills; and (2) are currently or were formerly eligible for special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1401), including students who were determined eligible for special education or related services under the IDEA but were homeschooled or attended private school. See 668.233(c) for documentation requirements.Teacher certification course- work 34 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL ELEMENTARY OR SECONDARY ENROLLMENT A student enrolled in elementary or secondary school is not eligible for aid from the FSA programs, even if she is simultaneously enrolled in an eligible college program. A student is considered to be enrolled in secondary school if she is pursuing a high school diploma or if she has completed the requirements for a diploma, has not yet received it, and either she is taking college coursework for which her high school gives credit or her high school still considers her to be enrolled there. An adult pursuing a high school equivalency certificate (not a high school diploma) is not considered to be enrolled in secondary school. However, as stated earlier, a student can't get aid for high school equivalency training. An adult can take a course offered by a high school, such as a driver's education course, without being considered enrolled there. ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS To receive FSA funds, a student must be qualified to study at the postsecondary level. A student qualifies if she: has a high school diploma (this can be from a foreign school if it is equivalent to a U.S. high school diploma); has the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma, such as a general educational development (GED) certificate or other state- sanctioned test or diploma-equivalency certificate; has completed homeschooling at the secondary level as defined by state law; has completed secondary school education in a homeschool set - ting which qualifies for an exemption from compulsory attendance requirements under state law, if state law does not require a home - schooled student to receive a credential for their education; or has completed one of the ability-to-benefit (ATB) alternatives and is either currently enrolled in an eligible career pathway program or first enrolled in an eligible postsecondary program prior to July 1, 2012. A student may self-certify on the FAFSA that he has received a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate or that he has com - pleted secondary school through homeschooling as defined by state law. If a student indicates that he has a diploma or high school equivalency certificate, your school isn't required to ask for a copy (except as noted below), but if your school requires a diploma for admission, then you must rely on that copy of the diploma or high school equivalency certificate and not on the stu - dent's certification alone. Academic qualifications HEA Sec. 484(d) 34 CFR 668.32(e) COD Technical Reference NEWElementary/secondary enrollment HEA Sec. 484(a)(1) 34 CFR 668.32(b) Secondary school enrollment examples Marie is a junior in high school and enrolls in an electronics technician program at Lakeshore Community College (she is above the age of compulsory school attendance for her state and therefore can be admitted as a regular student at LCC). The coursework is offered evenings and weekends, so she can still attend her high school classes. The electronics technician program is an eligible postsecondary program, and Marie will receive a certificate from Lakeshore when she completes the program. However, she is not eligible for aid because she is still enrolled in high school. Joe, a regular student at Waveland University, decides to take a driver's education course at the local high school during the summer. This does not mean he is enrolled in secondary school. Graduate or professional student definition 34 CFR 668.2(b) For Title IV student eligibility purposes, a graduate or professional student is defined as a student who is enrolled in a program or course above the baccalaureate level or in a professional program and has completed the equivalent of 3 academic years of full- time study, either prior to entering the program or as part of the program itself. Also, a student who is receiving Title IV aid as an undergraduate student can't be considered a graduate/professional student for that same period of enrollment.1-9 Chapter 1\u2014School-Determined Requirements FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Awards submitted to the COD system for all students require a Student Eligibility Code (previously Ability to Benefit Code) to report how the stu - dent (including graduate and professional students) is qualified to study at the postsecondary level (e.g. by obtaining a high school diploma or its rec - ognized equivalent). For more detail on submitting the appropriate Student Eligibility Code, see the COD Technical Reference on IFAP. Checking the validity of a high school diploma If your school or the Department has reason to believe that the high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education, you must evaluate the validity of the student's high school completion. Students who indicate on their FAFSA that they graduated high school must give the name, city, and state of the high school. FAFSA on the Web will not allow students to skip these items, and it will have a drop-down list of both public and private high schools populated by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Inclusion on the list does not mean that a diploma from the school is valid, nor does exclusion from the list mean that the diploma is invalid. Acceptable documentation for checking the validity of a student's high school completion can include the diploma and a final transcript that shows all the courses the student took. Diplomas from unaccredited high schools can be valid and qualify stu - dents to receive FSA funds, as well as to meet college admission standards. One resource that a school may consider to determine if a high school di - ploma is valid is the department of education in the state in which the high school is located, if that department has jurisdiction over the high school. Colleges are also free to consult with each other as they develop their pro - cedures for checking the validity of high school diplomas. For students who completed their secondary schooling outside the United States, comparable documents can help, as can the services of companies that determine the va - lidity of foreign secondary school credentials. A student's self-certification is not sufficient to validate a high school di - ploma that is in question. If there is conflicting information between the stu - dent's certification on the FAFSA and other documentation or information obtained from the student, the institution must resolve this conflict. It should be remembered that for a college to be an eligible institution, it must admit as regular students only those with a high school diploma or the recognized equivalent or who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance. As in other areas of FSA administration, schools have final authority in meeting this requirement. The Department does not plan to have an appeal process or to intervene in reasonable judgments of school administrators, such as a decision to move a high school from a college's acceptable to unacceptable list or a case where one school has different lists than another.College diploma mill definition An entity that: 1. Charges someone a fee and requires him to complete little or no education or coursework to obtain a degree, diploma, or certificate that may be used to represent to the general public that he has completed a program of postsecondary education or training; and 2. Lacks accreditation by an agency or association that is recognized as an accrediting body for institutions of higher education by the Secretary (pursuant to Part H, Subpart 2 of Title IV) or a federal agency, state government, or other organization that recognizes accrediting agencies or associations. When a student incorrectly states diploma status When a student incorrectly states an eligible diploma status, for example, stating one year that they had a high school diploma, and in a subsequent year either notifying you that the previous submission was a mistake, or simply answering \"no\" to the high school diploma question, then the student was ineligible for all TIV aid in the prior award year, and is ineligible for all TIV aid going forward. In this case, the student is responsible for the overpayment they previously received when ineligible, including aid received for completed award years. You (the school) MUST report the overpayment to NSLDS (see Volume 5, Chapter 2) and may refer the case to the Department for collection if you cannot recover the money from the student (see sample format document in Volume 4, Chapter 3).1-10 Volume 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May Foreign high school diplomas High school diplomas/transcripts from other countries are acceptable toward the student eligibility general requirement, as long as the diploma is equivalent to a U.S. high school diploma. A school that is qualified to evaluate the credential may do so. A school that is not qualified or chooses not to evaluate the credential can instead require students to have their credential evaluated by a company that offers such a service. The school may pay for the evaluation, but if it does so, it can only have students reimburse it for the cost if it requires the evaluation as part of its admission process for all students who have a foreign credential. You may not require only students who are applying for federal student aid to pay the school to have their credential evaluated be cause that would amount to the school charging a fee to complete the FAFSA, which is pro - hibited under HEA 483(a)(6). In such cases, be cause the cost of evaluating a foreign credential is incurred as a charge of admission prior to enrollment in an eligible program, it cannot be included in students' cost of attendance (COA). If the student is selected for verification tracking groups V4 or V5, in which the student must provide proof of high school completion, when it is impossible for a refugee, asylee or victim of human trafficking to obtain documentation of his or her completion of a secondary school education in a foreign country, you may accept self-certification that they have completed a high school (or equivalent) education from these applicants, along with their entry status documentation that demonstrates the applicant's current or prior status as a refugee, asylee, or victim of human trafficking who entered the U.S. after the age of 15 (see item FHD-Q2/A2 at www2.ed.gov/policy/high - ered/reg/hearulemaking/2009/hsdiploma.html) . Recognized equivalents of a high school diploma The Department recognizes several equivalents to a high school diploma: a GED certificate; a certificate or other official completion documentation demonstrating that the student has passed a state-authorized examination (such as the Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET), or, in California, the California High School Proficiency Exam) that the state recognizes as the equivalent of a high school diploma (certificates of attendance and/or completion are not included in this qualifying category); an associate's degree; successful completion of at least 60 semester or trimester credit hours or 72 quarter credit hours that does not result in the awarding of an associate's degree, but that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree at any institution; or enrollment in a bachelor's degree program where at least 60 semester or trimester credit hours or 72 quarter credit hours have been successfully completed, including credit hours transferred into the bachelor's degree program.Foreign diplomas www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ for a student who enrolls without completing high school, a transcript indicating the student has excelled in high school. The student must no longer be enrolled in high school, must satisfy your school's written policy for admitting such students, and must be starting a program that leads at least to an associate's degree or its equivalent. Note that merely possessing a certificate of attendance and/or high- school completion is not sufficient for a student to be Title IV aid eligible. Such a certificate may be issued without a student having completed all of the academic graduation requirements, including passing any required examina - tions. A state must consider a certificate or high-school-completion-equiva - lency test as equivalent to a high school diploma in that state in order for it to be considered equivalent to a high school diploma for Title IV aid eligibility purposes. Homeschooling Though homeschooled students are not considered to have a high school diploma or equivalent, they are eligible to receive FSA funds if their second - ary school education was in a homeschool that state law treats as a home or private school. Some states issue a secondary school completion credential to homeschoolers. If this is the case in the state where the student was home - schooled, she must obtain this credential to be eligible for FSA funds if the state requires it. She can include in her homeschooling self-certification that she received this state credential. An eligible institution is defined in part as one that admits as regular students only those who have a high school di - ploma or equivalent, are beyond the compulsory age of attendance for the school's state, or are dually enrolled at the college and a secondary school. For students who finish homeschooling at a younger age, the Depart - ment considers them to be beyond the age of compulsory attendance if your school's state would not require them to obtain a secondary completion cre - dential as provided under state law, or if not required by state law, has com - pleted a secondary school education in a homeschool setting that qualifies as an exemption from compulsory attendance under state law. See also Volume 2, Chapter 1 .Recognized equivalent of a high school diploma 34 at Maddon College. Kris completes his high school requirements early, but the high school does not formally issue the high school diploma until a later time. Maddon can award Kris TIV funds if Maddon obtains a statement signed by an official from Kris's high school attesting that Kris has completed all of the required coursework and has successfully passed any required proficiency examinations for the high school diploma. The statement must include the date when the actual high school diploma will be issued.

If a student first enrolled in an eligible postsecond - ary program prior to July 1, 2012, the student may enroll in any eligible pro - gram and can become eligible through one of the ATB alternatives. However, if a student first enrolled in an eligible postsecondary program on or after July 1, 2012, the student may only become eligible through one of the ATB alternatives if the student is enrolled in an \"eligible career pathway program.\" See below for more details about eligible career pathway programs. An ATB student need not be enrolled concurrently in both the eligible postsecondary program and the component for attaining a high school diploma or its recog - nized equivalent. The ATB alternatives include: Passing an independently administered Department of Education approved ATB test (see chart at the end of this section). Completing at least 6 credit hours or 225 clock hours that are ap - plicable toward a Title IV-eligible degree or certificate offered by the postsecondary institution (neither remedial nor developmental coursework count toward this requirement. The coursework must demonstrate that the student has the ability to benefit from the postsecondary program in which the student is enrolled or intends to enroll, but need not be applicable to the specific degree or pro - gram in which the student is enrolled). Completing a State process approved by the Secretary of Education. Note: To date, no State process has been submitted for the Secre - tary's approval. Eligible Career Pathway Programs. An \"eligible career pathway pro - gram\" means a program that combines rigorous and high-quality education, training, and other services that: 1. Align with the skill needs of industries in the economy of the State or regional economy involved; 2. Prepares an individual to be successful in any of a full range of sec - ondary or postsecondary education options, including apprenticeships regis - tered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (commonly known as the \"National Apprenticeship Act\"; 50 Stat. 664, chapter 663; 29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.); 3. Includes counseling to support an individual in achieving the indi - vidual's education and career goals; 4. Includes, as appropriate, education offered concurrently with and in the same context as workforce preparation activities and training for a spe - cific occupation or occupational cluster; 5. Organizes education, training, and other services to meet the particu - lar needs of an individual in a manner that accelerates the educational and career advancement of the individual to the extent practicable;NEW ATB tests 34 CFR Part 668 Subpart J (Sections 141-156) E-Announcement June 24, 2015 Revised ATB regulations were published in the Federal Register on Oct. 29, 2010. Guidance on implementation of requirements for tests in languages other than English was given in GEN- 11-08. Ceasing to be an ATB student A student who gained TIV eligibility under one of the ATB alternatives ceases to be an ATB student when they obtain a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. At that point, the student is no longer subject to the restrictions on ATB students, including that the student be enrolled in an eligible career pathway program in order to be (potentially) TIV-eligible.ATB options & Eligible Career Pathway Programs 34 CFR 668.32(e)(2,3,5) Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-113) DCL GEN-12-09 DCL GEN-16-09 HEA Sec. 484(d) Requirements FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL 6. Enables an individual to attain a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, and at least one recognized postsecondary credential; and 7. Helps an individual enter or advance within a specific occupation or occupational cluster. You must make a determination on whether a program meets these criteria, and you are responsible for documenting that your career pathway program(s) meet each of the requirements described above. The Department does not require that you receive approvals or endorsements from a State or local workforce agency to fulfill these requirements, although that may be one way that you document your compliance. You must maintain documentation that each eligible career pathway program that you use as a basis for determining a student's eligibility under the ATB alternatives meets the above requirements. This must include docu - mentation that the program(s) in question include workforce preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster, and that the program is aligned with the skill needs of the U.S. state or regional economy in which your school is located. Additional information regarding the requirements for eligible career pathway programs can be found in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-16-09 on IFAP. Eligibility of Other Students Without a High School Diploma (Grandfa - thered Students). As discussed in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-12-09, students who were enrolled in an eligible program of study prior to July 1, 2012 may continue to establish Title IV eligibility in any eligible program under one of the ATB alternatives by using the following grandfathering test: Question 1: Did the student attend an eligible program at any Title IV institution prior to July 1, 2012? If yes, the student may use any of the ATB alternatives (as described above) to become eligible for Title IV, HEA student assistance. If no, continue to Question 2. Question 2: Did the student, prior to July 1, 2012, officially register at a Title IV institution, and is the student scheduled to attend an eligible pro - gram? If yes, the student may use any of the ATB alternatives (as described above) to become eligible for Title IV, HEA student assistance. If no, the stu - dent may not use the ATB alternatives to become eligible for Title IV, HEA student assistance, unless the student is enrolled in an eligible career pathway program. For a student who qualifies to use one of the ATB alternatives through enrollment in an eligible program prior to July 1, 2012, you must document that the student successfully completed one of the approved ATB alternatives described above. You must also document that the student was enrolled in both the TIV-eligible program component and the component that enables an individual to attain a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. Such documentation could include documentation from NSLDS that shows a student's prior receipt of Title IV funds, or a transcript or other receipt that demonstrates enrollment in an eligible program. 1-14 Volume 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB PROGRESS (SAP) To be eligible for FSA funds, a student must make satisfactory academic progress, and your school must have a reasonable policy for monitoring that progress. The Department considers a satisfactory academic progress policy to be reasonable if it meets both the qualitative and quantitative criteria ex - plained in this section. Your SAP policy must be at least as strict (in terms of the qualitative and quantitative standards discussed below, not the frequency with which these are checked) as your SAP policy for students enrolled in the same program of study who are not receiving FSA funds at your school, and it must apply to all students within categories, e.g., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, and graduate students. Different SAP policies may apply to different academic programs, however the SAP policy must apply equally to all TIV programs; i.e, a student is either making SAP or is not; you may not say a student is making SAP for Pell but not for Direct Loans. All relevant SAP policy must be applied. Your policy(s) must require an academic progress evaluation at the end of each payment period for students in programs lasting one year or less.

Financial aid probation \u2014A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals. Eligibility for aid may be reinstated for one payment period. Financial aid warning \u2014A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress. The school reinstates eligibility for aid for one payment period and may do so without a student appeal. This status may only be used by schools that check SAP at the end of each payment period and only for students who were making SAP in the prior payment period for which they were enrolled or who were in the first payment period of their program. Maximum timeframe For an undergraduate program measured in credit hours, a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program. For an undergraduate program measured in clock hours, a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program as measured by the cumulative number of clock hours the student is required to complete and expressed in calendar time. (Note that a student in a clock hour program cannot receive aid for hours beyond those in the program; the maximum timeframe applies to the amount of calendar time the student takes to complete those hours.) For a graduate program, a period the school defines that is based on the length of the program.all other programs, the policy must require annual reviews and must corre - spond with the end of a payment period. For programs greater than one year, your policy may also call for progress reviews after each payment period. If you review at each payment period, you must review SAP after a summer term if the student attends the summer term. You may have reasonable rules for students who initially enroll in specific courses but modify that enroll - ment within a limited time. Grades and pace of completion Your school's policy must specify that both the quantitative (time-based) and qualitative (grade-based) standards are reviewed at each evaluation point. Each may include a payment period-based standard but are required to include a cumulative standard. You may review SAP more frequently, (for example, monthly), but the more frequent reviews would not replace the re - view that is required to be conducted at the end of the payment period. Your policy must specify the qualitative standard (grade point average or GPA) that a student must have at each evaluation or, if GPA is not an appro - priate qualitative measure, a comparable measure against a norm. In addi - tion, the HEA requires a specific qualitative review at the end of the student's second academic year. Students enrolled in a program of more than two aca - demic years must have a GPA of at least a \"C\" or its equivalent or must have an academic standing consistent with your school's graduation requirements. Having a standing consistent with the requirement for graduation means you could use an escalating GPA instead of a fixed one. For example, if your school uses a 4-point scale, it could require students to have a 2.0 average by graduation but allow their average to be lower earlier in their program. If your policy permits such a progression and a student falls below a C aver - age, you must be able to document that her average is consistent with the academic standard required for graduation. Remedial coursework must be included in the qualitative assessment of SAP. The courses need not be in - cluded in the student's GPA; however, your school must have some means of assessing a student's academic progress in remedial coursework. Your policy must also specify the quantitative standard (pace) at which students must progress through their program to ensure that they will gradu - ate within the maximum timeframe , and each academic progress check must measure this. You calculate the pace at which a student is progressing by dividing the total number of hours the student has successfully completed by the total number he has attempted. You may include, but aren't required to include, remedial courses when making the assessment of the quantitative component of SAP. Checking a student's pace of completion allows for variations of enroll - ment status since you look at the percentage of classes successfully completed rather than the number. Also, you can use a graduated completion percent - age for each year of a program. For instance, your policy can permit students to complete a lower percentage of their classes in the first academic year but require them to complete an increasing percentage in subsequent years so that they finish their program in time. A student is ineligible (via the maxi - mum timeframe element) when it becomes mathematically impossible for him to complete his program within 150% of its length if it is an undergradu -SAP pace, attendance & published length of program While a school's attendance policy may be more strict than the quantitative (pace) standard for SAP, if, in a program to which these standards apply, a substantial majority of students graduate after the published length of the program (while retaining Title IV eligibility & incurring overtime charges), ED will likely require the school to revise the published length of the program.NEW1-16 Volume 1\u2014Student Eligibility amnesty/renewal Some schools have academic amnesty/ renewal procedures through which a student can apply to have credits attempted and grades earned in previous semesters excluded from the calculation of the student's grade point average. The FSA program regulations make no provision for the concept of academic amnesty or academic renewal. Therefore, a school must always include courses applicable to a student's major (whenever taken) in evaluating a student's satisfactory academic progress (both quantitative and qualitative components). However, a student may be able to appeal loss of eligibility due to special circumstances. Completed program, no degree A student who completes the academic requirements for a program but does not yet have the degree or certificate is not eligible for further additional FSA funds for that program. Retaking a program Your school may permit a student to receive FSA funds for retaking a program that she has completed before. For more details, see \"Eligibility and enrollment status for retaking coursework\" sidebar later in this chapter.ate program, or within the maximum timeframe established by the school if it is a graduate program. In this situation, an appeal would be possible if your school accepts appeals. Your policy must explain how GPA and pace of completion are affected by course incompletes, withdrawals, and repetitions, and by transfer credits from other schools. Generally, all periods of the student's enrollment count when assessing progress, even periods in which the student did not receive FSA funds. However, only transfer credits that count toward the student's current program must be counted (as both attempted and completed hours; credits not counted toward the student's program may also be counted at your school's discretion, as described in your SAP policy). Your policy may permit that for students who change majors, credits and grades that do not count toward the new major will not be included in the satisfactory progress determination. You may limit how many times a student can change majors, for SAP purposes. Your SAP policy cannot exclude from the progress review courses in which a student remained past the add/drop period and earned a grade of \"W\" (or its equivalent), nor can it routinely exclude certain hours attempted, such as those taken during a summer session. A review of SAP is not com - plete until both the qualitative and quantitative measures have been reviewed. If a satisfactory progress check shows that a student does not have the re - quired GPA or is not maintaining the required pace, she becomes ineligible for FSA funds unless she is placed on financial aid warning (if your school re - views SAP at the end of each payment period) or probation (after a successful appeal), as explained below. Your policy must describe both of these statuses if it allows for them, and it must provide for notification to students of the results of any evaluation that affects their eligibility for FSA funds. You may monitor SAP at the end of every month, but an official review (i.e., for Title IV/SAP purposes) may only occur at the end of a payment period. The monthly evaluation at the end of the month that contains the end of a payment period (for example, hour 450) cannot count as the official eval - uation at the end of a payment period. Even if your school conducts progress evaluations at the end of each month, you cannot conduct the official (for Title IV/SAP purposes) SAP review at the end of each month. The official evaluation must be at the end of a payment period. After an official evalua - tion, a student must be placed on warning or probation status (if the appeal is successful) for an entire payment period when SAP is not achieved. You may not put someone on warning/probation for less than a payment period. Financial aid warning Only schools that check satisfactory progress at the end of each payment period may place students on financial aid warning as a consequence of not making satisfactory progress. A school may use this status without appeal or any other action by the student. Warning status lasts for one payment period only, during which the student may continue to receive FSA funds. Students who fail to make satisfactory progress after the warning period lose their aid eligibility unless they successfully appeal and are placed on proba - tion. Schools do not need to use the warning status; they can instead require students to immediately appeal to be placed on probation.SAP for test-based credits Some schools have developed tests in accord with their academic standards, such as language proficiency tests, which students can take and receive course credit. If such credits count toward the student's program, the grades for those credits count in the student's GPA for all FSA purposes. Such credits must be counted towards SAP for quantitative/pace purposes, and may, according to the school's written policy, be counted towards the student's qualitative/grades DCL SAP new/conflicting information requirements You must have an established procedure for reviewing and addressing additional information that may have an impact on SAP reviews. For example, if you review SAP at the end of a spring term and receive late notification of a grade change for the previous fall or spring term, you must recheck SAP using that new information.]Appeals, financial aid probation, and academic plans All schools may use the financial aid probation as part of their satisfac - tory progress policy. When a student loses FSA eligibility because he failed to make satisfactory progress, if the school permits appeals, he may appeal that result on the basis of: his injury or illness, the death of a relative, or other special circumstances. His appeal must explain why he failed to make satis - factory progress and what has changed in his situation that will allow him to make satisfactory progress at the next evaluation. If you determine, based on the appeal, that the student should be able to meet the SAP standards by the end of the subsequent payment period, you may place him on probation without an academic plan. You must review the student's progress at the end of that one payment period, as probation status is for one payment period only. If you determine, based on the appeal, that the student will require more than one payment period to meet progress standards, you may place him on probation and develop an academic plan for the student. You must review the student's progress at the end of one payment period as is required of a student on probation status, to determine if the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan (or the universally applica - ble SAP requirements, outside of any individualized academic reinstatement plan), the student is eligible to receive Title IV aid as long as the student con - tinues to meet those requirements and is reviewed according to the require - ments specified in the plan. Your school determines the process and documentation required for an appeal. It may decide to require more extensive information on an initial ap - peal and some type of an update statement on a subsequent appeal. The regu - lations do not specify what must be included in an academic plan. The school and the student must develop a plan that ensures that the student is able to meet the school's satisfactory progress standards by a specific time, though an academic plan could instead take the student to successful program comple - tion. Students must also appeal to change their plan. They must explain what has happened to make the change necessary and how they will be able to make academic progress. Reestablishing aid eligibility Your policy, even if it does not permit appeals, must explain how stu - dents who are not making satisfactory academic progress can restore their el - igibility for FSA funds. Other than when a student is placed on financial aid warning or probation or has agreed to an academic plan as outlined above, he can regain eligibility only by taking action that brings him into compli - ance with your school's satisfactory progress standards. The requirement that a student complete a number of credits or enroll for a number of academic periods without receiving FSA funds, or that he interrupt his attendance for one or more academic periods, may be part of your academic progress policy. However, neither paying for one's classes nor sitting out for a term affects a student's academic progress status, so neither is sufficient to reestablish aid eligibility. 1-18 Volume appeal Students in a bachelor's degree program at National College must complete 120 credits and may attempt up to 180 credits (120 x 150%). National reviews a student's academic progress once per year and has a pace of completion of 2/3 or 66.67% of the classes that students attempt; it requires a cumulative GPA of 1.50 after the first year, 1.75 after the second year, and 2.0 after the third year and beyond. In his first semester, Danny fails one course and withdraws (late in the term) from one of his five courses (15 credits). He takes four courses in his second semester and again fails one and withdraws from one. Though his GPA is 1.71, he isn't making SAP by the end of the first year because he completed only 15 credits out of the 27 he attempted, and two-thirds (2/3) of 27 is 18. Danny applies for an appeal, but because his only reason for not making SAP is that he wasn't able to concentrate on college after being in high school, and because he doesn't offer evidence showing what has changed, the aid administrator at National denies his appeal, and he is ineligible for aid in his second year. Even if Danny had a more convincing reason for failing at SAP, such as being injured and being rendered unable to participate effectively in his normal activities, the administrator might still have denied his appeal because she saw little improvement or variation in Danny's pace of completion and did not determine that he would likely be making SAP a year later. If Danny's academic performance improves by the end of his second year so that he is meeting the SAP criteria, he can again receive FSA funds.4-year credit-hour program with warning and appeal Krieger University checks SAP every quarter, which permits it to use financial aid warnings. Students must complete 144 credit hours to receive a BA or BS degree, and they may attempt up to 216 credit hours to complete a program. Students must complete at least half of the credits they attempt in their first year and 75% of their credits in each year after that. They must have no less than a 2.0 GPA at all times. Gina finishes her first year at Krieger with a 2.25 GPA and completes all of the credits that she attempts, so she is making SAP. After the first quarter in her second year, she again completes all of her classes but poor grades leave her with a 1.94 GPA. The aid administrator places her on financial aid warning for one quarter and informs her that she is not meeting the SAP standards. Gina does poorly in the next quarter as well, and her GPA drops to 1.85. The aid administrator informs her that she can't continue on warning status and needs to submit an appeal explaining why she is failing to make SAP and why she thinks that will change and allow her to again make SAP. Gina brings the administrator an obituary showing that her mother died recently, which required that she help with family affairs and caused her to lose her focus at school. She asserts that is over now. The administrator places her on probation and suggests that she might take fewer courses. But Gina enrolls full time and again receives poor grades, causing her GPA to drop to 1.80. The administrator informs Gina that she has become ineligible for FSA funds but that she can become eligible again if she raises her GPA to 2.0 or that she can submit another appeal (the latter appeal must be based on a reason different from the first appeal) and this time request to be placed on an academic plan.Satisfactory Academic Progress Examples: credit-hour program with financial aid warning Carver University has a program that a full-time student can complete in 24 semester hours. Because this is a one-year program, Carver must check SAP every payment period. Their policy is that students must complete the program by the time they have attempted 36 (150% of 24) hours, and the pace of completion is 2/3 or 66.67%. They require a 2.0 GPA at all times. Suzie plans to take two classes (eight hours) each semester. In the first term, she fails one class and gets a B in the other. Her GPA is 1.5 and her pace of completion is 50%, so Carver automatically places her on financial aid warning and informs her of this. In her second semester, Suzie gets a C (in the class she failed in the first semester) and an A, raising her GPA to 2.25 (Carver counts all grades for retaken classes), and she has completed 75% of her classes, so she restores her aid eligibility. Clock-hour program with appeal Fowler Community College has a 900-clock-hour program that normally takes eight months to complete. Fowler allows a maximum timeframe of 12 months to complete the program, and students must complete at least 300 clock hours out of the 450 clock hours of each payment period (four months) and maintain a 2.0 GPA. Because the program is so short and financial aid warnings would delay a rigorous review of students' academic performance until late in (or the end of) the program, Fowler decides not to use warnings. Instead, it requires students to submit an appeal when they are not meeting SAP standards. After the first four months, Anthony's GPA is 3.0, but he completes only 250 of the 300 clock hours that were required for the payment period. Fowler informs him that he must submit an appeal to continue to receive FSA funds. Anthony tells the administrator that he was diagnosed with depression, which prevents him from doing as much as he'd like. He provides a note from his psychiatrist and affirms that he is doing better since he has received regular treatment. The administrator grants his appeal and puts him on financial aid probation since she determines that Anthony can finish the program in the remainder of the year. She drafts a plan that allows him some flexibility in his pace of completion and that requires him to check with her once a month to inform her of his progress in his classes. After four more months, Anthony's GPA is 3.3, and he has completed 580 hours out of the 600 required under Fowler's published SAP policy, which would normally make him ineligible for FSA funds. But because he is progressing according to his personal SAP plan and is predicted to complete the program within the maximum timeframe, he may still receive aid.Satisfactory Academic Progress Examples: DCL ENROLLMENT STATUS A student must be enrolled at least half time to receive aid from the Di - rect Subsidized/Unsubsidized and Direct PLUS Loan programs. The Pell, TEACH Grant, and Campus-Based Programs don't require half-time enroll - ment, with two exceptions: the first exception is students must be enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program for teacher education at least half-time. The second exception is that, for Perkins and FWS, students must be enrolled half-time in a teaching credential program. But enrollment status does affect the amount of Pell a student receives; see Volume 3, Chapter 3 . To be enrolled half time, a student must be taking at least half of the course load of a full-time student. Your school defines a full-time workload, but it must meet the minimum standards in the FSA regulations. The defini - tion of full time for FSA purposes can differ from that used for other pur - poses at your school, such as the definition used by the registrar's office. Your definition of a full-time workload for a program must be used for all students in that program and must be the same for all FSA-related purposes, including loan deferments. You can't accommodate a student with a learning disability or other handicap by allowing her a full-time enrollment status lower (for Title IV financial aid purposes) than the minimum standard (see the margin note on students with intellectual disabilities). Minimum standards for full-time enrollment. A student's workload may include any combination of courses, work, research, or special studies that your school considers sufficient to classify them as full time. This includes, for a term-based program, one repetition of a previously passed course that is not due to the student failing other coursework. The regulations specify a minimum standard for undergraduate students but not for graduate students. For undergraduates, full-time status must be at least: 12 semester hours or 12 quarter hours per academic term in an educational program using a semester, trimester, or quarter system; 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours per academic year for an educational program using credit hours but not using a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or the prorated equivalent for a program of less than one academic year; 24 clock hours per week for an educational program using clock hours; A series of courses or seminars equaling 12 semester or quarter hours over a maximum of 18 weeks; For a program that measures credit hours and uses nonstandard terms, the number of weeks of instruction in the term divided by the number of weeks of instruction in the academic year, multiplied by the number of credit hours in the academic year; The work portion of a cooperative education program in which the amount of work performed is equivalent to the academic workload of a full-time student; orFull-time student definition 34 Sec. 428(b)(1)(A), 34 CFR 668.2(b) A school may choose to define half time as half of the minimum full-time standard established in the regulations even if this is less than half the full-time standard established by the school. For example, if a school sets 14 semester hours as full time, it could use 6 semester hours (one- half of the regulatory full-time minimum of 12) as half time instead of 7. Enrollment status for students with intellectual disabilities Because a comprehensive training program for students with intellectual disabilities can include work for which the school awards no credit, such as audited courses, the school must develop equivalencies in credit hours for such work, just as it must do with non-credit remedial coursework. This will allow the school to determine the enrollment status for students in these programs.1-21 Chapter 1\u2014School-Determined Requirements FSA a courseload commensurate with the full-time definitions listed here, and at least half of that load must be non-correspondence coursework that meets half of the school's requirement for full-time students. Your school must have a written policy stating what enrollment status the work portion of a co-op program is equivalent to. If it equals or exceeds a full-time academic load, the co-op student is considered full time regardless of how many credits are earned for the co-op work. A student taking only correspondence courses is never considered to be enrolled more than half time. See Volume 3 for more on Pell and enrollment status and correspondence courses. If a student is enrolled in courses that do not count toward his degree, certificate, or other recognized credential, they cannot be used to determine enrollment status unless they are eligible remedial courses. This means you cannot award the student aid for classes that do not count toward his degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. Also, federal student aid can be awarded only for learning that results from instruction provided or overseen by the school. It cannot be awarded for any portion of a program based on study or life experience prior to enrollment in the program, or based on tests of learning that are not associated with educational activities overseen by the school.Eligibility and enrollment status for retaking coursework 34 CFR 668.2(b) The regulatory definition for full-time student (for undergraduates) has been revised to allow a student, in a term- based program only, to retake any previously passed course (one time only per previously passed course). For this purpose, passed means any grade higher than an \"F,\" regardless of any school or program policy requiring a higher qualitative grade or measure to have been considered to have passed the course. This retaken class may be counted toward a student's enrollment status, and the student may be awarded Title IV aid for the enrollment status based on inclusion of the class. Normal SAP policy allows for a student to receive Title IV funds for retaking a course he or she failed, and if a student withdraws before completing the course that he or she is being paid Title IV funds for retaking, that is not counted as his or her one allowed retake for that course. However, if a student passed a class once, then is repaid for retaking it, and fails the second time, that failure counts as their paid retake, and the student may not be paid for retaking the class a third time. If your school has a policy that requires students to retake all of the coursework for a term in which a student fails a course, only the first retake of any previously passed course is eligible for Title IV aid (see the preamble to the October 15, 2015 Program Integrity regulation; page 67127). If a student withdraws from all Title IV eligible courses in the payment period or period of enrollment and continues to attend only the course(s) that he or she is completing or repeating for which he or she may not receive Title IV aid during that period, the student is a withdrawal for Title IV purposes. This is because a student is considered to be attending a Title IV eligible program only if he or she is attending one or more courses in that program for which the student is receiving Title IV, HEA program funds.1-22 Volume 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL STUDENTS CONVICTED OF POSSESSION OR SALE OF DRUGS A federal or state drug conviction (but not a local or municipal conviction) can disqualify a student for FSA funds. The student self-certifies in applying for aid that he is eligible; you're not required to confirm this unless you have conflicting information. Convictions only count against a student for aid eligibility purposes (FAFSA question 23c) if they were for an offense that occurred during a period of enrollment for which the student was receiving federal student aid\u2014they do not count if the offense was not during such a period, unless the student was denied federal benefits for drug trafficking by a federal or state judge (see drug abuse hold sidebar). Also, a conviction that was reversed, set aside, or removed from the student's record does not count, nor does one received when she was a juvenile, unless she was tried as an adult. The chart below illustrates the period of ineligibility for FSA funds, depending on whether the conviction was for sale or possession and whether the student had previous offenses. A conviction for sale of drugs includes convictions for conspiring to sell drugs. Possession of illegal drugsSale of illegal drugs 1st offense 1 year from date of conviction2 years from date of conviction 2nd offense 2 years from date of convictionIndefinite period 3+ offenses Indefinite period If the student was convicted of both possessing and selling illegal drugs, and the periods of ineligibility are different, the student will be ineligible for the longer period. Schools must provide each student who becomes ineligible for FSA funds due to a drug conviction a clear and conspicuous written notice of his loss of eligibility and the methods whereby he can become eligible again. A student regains eligibility the day after the period of ineligibility ends (i.e., for a 1st or 2nd offense); or when he or she successfully completes a qualified drug rehabilitation program that includes passing two unannounced drug tests given by such a program. Further drug convictions will make him ineligible again. Students denied eligibility for an indefinite period can regain eligibility after completing any of the following options: 1) Successfully completing a rehabilitation program, as described below, which includes passing two unannounced drug tests from such a program); Counting non-credit or reduced-credit remedial work in enrollment status 34 CFR 668.20 A student can receive aid for a limited amount of remedial coursework that is included as part of a regular program. As long as the student qualifies for aid for remedial courses, you must include the remedial courses in the student's enrollment status. Some schools give no credit or reduced credit for remedial classes. To determine enrollment status, credit hours for the remedial class should be the same as for the comparable full-credit class. If you're using credit hours, you can compare the number of classroom and homework hours of study that the remedial course requires with the hours required for similar courses offered for full credit. Clock-hour schools should use the number of classroom hours attended in the remedial program. Drug convictions HEA Section 484(r) 34 CFR 668.40 A student who self-certifies that he or she has P56, 058, or 052 on his or her SAR and ISIR. See the SAR Comment Code and Text Guide on IFAP. For questions, contact the CPS/SAIG Technical Support at 800-330-5947, or CPSSAIG@ed.gov Question 23 Student Aid Eligibility Worksheet E-Announcement Sept 23, 2016 You may distribute this worksheet to students to help them determine and document their eligibility or ineligibility, based on their responses to question 23 on the FAFSA (i.e., drug convictions): DCL 2) Having the conviction reversed, set aside, or removed from the student's record so that fewer than two convictions for sale or three convictions for possession remain on the record; or 3) Successfully completing two unannounced drug tests which are part of a rehab program (the student does not need to complete the rest of the program). In such cases, the nature and dates of the remaining convictions will determine when the student regains eligibility. It is the student's responsibility to certify to you that she has successfully completed the rehabilitation program; as with the conviction question on the FAFSA, you are not required to confirm the reported information unless you have conflicting information. When a student regains eligibility during the award year, you may award Pell Grant, TEACH, and Campus-Based aid for the current payment period and Direct Loans for the period of enrollment. Standards for a qualified drug rehabilitation program A qualified drug rehabilitation program must include at least two unan - nounced drug tests and satisfy at least one of the following requirements: Be qualified to receive funds directly or indirectly from a federal, state, or local government program; Be qualified to receive payment directly or indirectly from a federally or state-licensed insurance company; Be administered or recognized by a federal, state, or local government agency or court; or Be administered or recognized by a federally or state-licensed hospital, health clinic, or medical doctor. If you are counseling a student who will need to enter such a program, be sure to advise the student of these requirements. If a student certifies that he has successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program, but you have reason to believe that the program does not meet the requirements, you must find out if it does before paying the student any FSA funds. Drug abuse hold The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 includes provisions that authorize federal and state judges to deny certain federal benefits, including student aid, to persons convicted of drug trafficking or possession. The Central Processing System maintains a hold file of individuals who have received such a judgment. All applicants are checked against this file to determine if they should be denied aid. This is separate from the check for a drug conviction via question 23; records matching the drug abuse hold file receive a rejected application (reject 19 and comments 009 or 055 on the SAR and ISIR). See the ISIR Guide on the IFAP publications page for more HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL INCARCERATED STUDENTS A student is considered to be incarcerated if he or she is serving a crimi - nal sentence in a federal, state, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, work farm, or similar correctional institution (whether it is operated by the government or a contractor). No student who is incarcerated may receive Title IV student loan funds, and no student who is incarcerated in a Federal or State penal institution may receive Pell Grant funds. However, an incar - cerated student is still potentially eligible for Pell, FSEOGs and FWS, but not Direct Loans or Perkins Loans, if he or she is incarcerated in a juvenile justice facility, a local or county jail, or a local or county penitentiary or correctional facility. You may accept the student's written self-certification that he is no longer incarcerated. See Chapter 6 for more information on this and on sex offenders who were incarcerated but are now subject to an involuntary civil commitment. CONFLICTING INFORMATION In addition to reviewing data provided by the Department's application system and NSLDS (as discussed in the rest of this volume), your school must have an internal system to share information relevant to the student's eligibility, such as his or her academic standing. The FSA program regula - tions require a school to develop an adequate system to ensure the consis - tency of any data related to a student's application or eligibility for Federal Student Aid regardless of the source of that data. As described in Early FAFSA Electronic Announcement #2 ( https://ifap. ed.gov/EarlyFAFSA/EarlyFAFSADCLandEA.html ), the best way to avoid gen - erating conflicting information is to encourage those filing FAFSAs to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (for those items which can be transferred). See the E-Announcement for more detail on the DRT. If your school has conflicting information for a student or you have any reason to believe his application is incorrect, you must resolve such dis - crepancies before disbursing FSA funds. If you discover a discrepancy after disbursing FSA funds, you must reconcile the conflicting information and require the student to repay any aid for which he wasn't eligible, unless he is no longer enrolled for the award year and will not re-enroll. Your school is responsible for reconciling all inconsistencies that it receives with one excep - tion: if the student dies during the award year, you aren't required to resolve conflicting information. In addition to efforts your school undertakes to identify and eliminate conflicting information, there is one additional type of potential conflicting information which will be identified automatically by the CPS. On 2018-19 ISIRs, when a potential conflict in parent or student data is detected, the CPS will issue a \"400\" or \"401\" code. When a 400 or 401 code is issued, you will need to resolve any conflicting information issues and repackage any affected 2018-19 aid. Conflicting information 34 CFR 668.16(b)(3) and (f)Incarcerated students 600.2 and 668.32(c)(2) DCL GEN-14-21 401 SAR codes August 2017 E-Announcement 18-19 SAR DCL If you are unable to resolve the conflicting information, you must con - sider the student to be in overaward status for any 2018-19 need based aid (i.e., Title IV grants, Federal Perkins Loans, and Direct Subsidized Loans) that was disbursed (in this case, FWS money never need be repaid, but you must immediately cease paying any further FWS funds). For more information on conflicting information, please refer to the Ap- plication and Verification Guide and Volume 2, Chapter 3 . CHANGE IN ELIGIBILITY STATUS A student's eligibility status can change during the award year, which almost always affects whether he can be paid. The special rules for changes in satisfactory academic progress status were discussed in the SAP section. For more details on Pell Grant status changes within and between terms, see Volume 3, Chapter 3 . Gaining eligibility A student who gains eligibility is one who was previously ineligible for some reason. In general, a student who gains eligibility may receive Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Campus-Based funds for the entire payment pe - riod and Direct Loan funds for the period of enrollment in which he or she becomes eligible. A student is eligible for Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Campus-Based aid for the entire award year, not just the payment period, in which he or she becomes eligible by meeting the requirements for citizenship (including becoming an eligible noncitizen), having a valid Social Security number, or being registered for Selective Service. For examples of gaining eligibility, we'll look at two students, Roy and Leon. Roy enrolls in a one-year certificate program at Carver University. Carver won't officially admit Roy before he provides an academic transcript from his previous school, but it lets him start classes in the fall. Carver re - ceives Roy's transcript after he's attended for a month and officially admits him. He's still in his first payment period when admitted, so he can receive Pell and Campus-Based funds for his entire period of enrollment. The school can also use the program length of one year as the period of enrollment for which Roy can receive a loan. Leon is finishing his senior year in high school; his classes end June 4. He decides to start classes in the winter at Carver on January 11. The second payment period begins on May 17. Leon isn't eligible for aid when he first starts classes at Carver. However, when he becomes eligible after June 4, Carver can disburse Pell and Campus-Based funds to Leon retroactively for the current payment period that started on May 17 (but not for the payment period that started in January) and a Direct Loan for the current period of enrollment, which does include the payment period that began in January.Defense of Marriage Act Decision DCL-GEN-13-25 DCL-GEN-14-14 In June 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which provided that for purposes of federal programs, a marriage can only be between one man and one woman. For purposes of Title IV aid, the Department now considers that any legal marriage which was recognized by the jurisdiction in which it was performed as recognized without regard to whether the marriage is between persons of the same or opposite sex, and without regard to where the couple resides. This has implications for dependency status and will impact how applicants fill out the FAFSA. For more details, see the Application and Verification Guide, Chapter 2 . In 2014, the Department published DCL GEN-14-14, which described further guidance on the potential eligibility of a same-sex stepparent to qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan. For further information, see the DCL. 1-26 DCL Losing eligibility A student cannot receive any federal student aid after losing eligibility for it unless he or she qualifies for a late disbursement. To illustrate the rule on losing eligibility, we'll look at a student named Steve. Steve is a student at Waveland University. At the end of September, after the start of the fall term, he is convicted in a state court for possession of drugs. It is his first offense, and he isn't incarcerated, but he is ineligible for aid. Waveland gave Steve his first Direct Subsidized loan disbursement at the beginning of the semester in September and was going to disburse a Direct Unsub Loan to him in October. Now Waveland can't disburse the Direct Unsub Loan, since the first dis - bursement was scheduled after he lost eligibility. Steve doesn't have to pay back the first disbursement of his Direct Loan immediately (though he will have to pay it back once he enters repayment), but he can't receive additional FSA funds until one year elapses or he successfully completes a qualified drug rehabilitation program.Religious order student eligibility 34 CFR CFR 690.75(d) Members of any religious order, society, agency, community, or other organization aren't considered to have financial need if the order\u2014 (1) has as a primary objective the promotion of ideals and beliefs regarding a Supreme Being, (2) requires its members to forego monetary or other support substantially beyond the support it provides, and (3) directs the member to pursue the course of study or provides subsistence support to its members. Members of these religious orders can't receive Direct Subsidized Loans, Pell Grants, or Campus-Based aid. They are eligible, however, for Direct Unsubsidized Loans. 1-27 Chapter 1\u2014School-Determined Requirements FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for more information on the topics below. Note that a school may not refuse to provide FSA funds to a student because he is enrolled in correspondence or distance education courses unless they are not part of an eligible program. Correspondence courses HEA Sec. 484(k) 34 CFR 600.2 34 CFR 668.38 A correspondence or \"home study\" course is one for which the school provides instructional materials and exams for students who don't physically attend classes at the school and who are studying indepen - dently. When a student completes a portion of the materials, he takes the related exam and returns it to the school for grading. If the course uses video cas - settes or discs, it is a correspondence course unless the school provides the same instruction to students who physically attend the school that year. Distance education courses are not considered correspon - dence courses. A student enrolled in a correspondence course can only receive FSA funds if the course is part of a program that leads to an associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree; if the program leads to a certificate, the student is not eligible for aid for that course. There are also restrictions regarding cost of atten - dance for correspondence courses; see Volume 3, Chapter 2 . Students studying abroad HEA Sec. 484(o) 34 CFR 668.39 A student in a study-abroad program is eligible for aid if the program is approved for academic credit toward her degree by the eligible homeschool at which she is enrolled as a regular student. The homeschool must have a written agreement with the foreign school (or with another U.S. school that contracts with the foreign school) or a single written arrangement with a study-abroad organization to represent an agreement between the homeschool and the foreign school. For more detail on requirements for awarding at foreign schools, see the Foreign School Handbook , available on IFAP.Eligibility Requirements for specific educational programs Distance education courses HEA Sec. 103 and 484(l) 34 CFR 600.2 34 CFR 668.38 Distance education refers to instruction delivered to students who are physically separated from their instructor, to support regular and substantive interaction between student and instructor, whether in real time or through time delay. Technologies used may include the Internet; one-way and two-way transmissions through open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, broadband lines, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless communications devices; audio conferencing; or, if used in conjunction with the previous technologies, video cassettes, DVDs, and CDs. If a course does not qualify as a distance education course, it is considered to be a correspondence course. Students can receive FSA funds for distance education courses under these conditions: the courses must belong to an eligible program, and the school must have the capability to effectively deliver distance education programs as determined by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Department and that has the evaluation of distance education programs within the scope of its recognition. Short-term certificate programs of less than one year offered via distance education are eligible for FSA funds, and they are not considered correspondence programs.1-28 & Eligible Noncitizens ELIGIBLE CATEGORIES A student must be one of the following to be eligible to receive federal student aid: A U.S. citizen or national ; A citizen of the Freely Associated States: the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of Palau and the Marshall Islands . (These students can only receive aid from some of the FSA programs and do not have an A-number/ARN, see \"Citizens of the Freely Asso - ciated States\" section later in this chapter); or A U.S. permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen. The Department of Education (The Department) matches all applica - tions with the Social Security Administration (SSA) on U.S. citizenship sta - tus. If the status cannot be confirmed, the student must provide documents proving U.S. citizenship, citizenship of the Freely Associated States, or eligible non-citizenship in order to be potentially Title IV aid-eligible. If the student provides an alien registration number (ARN) on the FAFSA, his record is also sent to DHS to check noncitizen immigration status. The results of both matches appear on the Institutional Student Information Report (ISIR), and a failed match with either agency will produce a \"C code\" on the student's ISIR. A student's U.S. citizenship (or eligible noncitizen) status only needs to be checked once for the award year; if the status is eligible at that time, it remains so for the rest of the award year (with the exception of parolees and VAWA prima facie cases; see the \"Third Step Verification (Formerly Form G-845)\" section below). If a parent wants to take out a PLUS loan for a dependent undergraduate student, both the parent and the student must be a U.S. citizen or national or eligible noncitizens.Citizenship HEA Sec. 484(a)(5), 34 CFR 668.32(d), 34 CFR 668.33, and Subpart I of Part 668.A student has to be a U.S. citizen, a citizen of the Freely Associated States, or an eligible non - citizen to be potentially eligible for federal student aid. In this chapter we describe how the student's FAFSA information is matched with other agencies to determine citizenship status. We also describe immigration documents that you may have to collect to make sure that the student meets this requirement. Citizenship issues All applications are matched with the Social Security Administration (SSA) on U.S. citizenship status. Applications that have an Alien Reg - istration Number (ARN) are matched against Department of Homeland Secu - rity (DHS) records. If the DHS match fails after automat - ed primary and secondary verification, the school must conduct a third step verification (see \"Third Step Verification (Formerly Form G-845)\" section in this chapter). USCIS/SAVE will only accept paper G- 845s until May May2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL U.S. CITIZENSHIP MATCH WITH THE SSA All applications are matched with SSA records to verify U.S. citizenship status, name, date of birth, the Social Security number (SSN), and possible date of death (see Chapter 4 ). The CPS will reject the application for insuffi - cient information if name, date of birth or SSN is not provided. The student's match result is reported in the \"SSA Citizenship\" field on the SAR on the Match Flags section of the SAR and ISIR. If the student leaves the citizenship question on the FAFSA blank, the CPS will still attempt the citizenship match with the SSA. If there is a complete match with the student's SSN, name, date of birth, and U.S. citizenship, the CPS will report the student to be a U.S. citi - zen. Successful match. The SAR and ISIR will have a match flag (but no comment) indicating that the student's U.S. citizenship status was confirmed. Data doesn't match. If the student's SSN, name, or date of birth doesn't match SSA records, his U.S. citizenship status can't be confirmed and a C code and a comment will appear on the output document. The student should correct the SSN, name, or date of birth (see Chapter 4 for more on SSN match problems) and submit it. The CPS will perform the match again, and you must see if the new ISIR confirms the student's U.S. citizenship sta - tus; if it does, the C code will no longer appear. U.S. Citizenship not confirmed. The SAR and ISIR will include a C code and a comment ( code 146 ) explaining that the SSA was unable to con - firm the student is a U.S. citizen and that he/she needs to provide his/her fi - nancial aid office with documents proving U.S. citizenship (see below). If the student provides eligible noncitizen documentation, you or the student must make a correction by entering his/her Alien Registration Number (ARN) on the ISIR, changing his/her citizenship status to eligible noncitizen in Ques - tion 15, and submitting it to the CPS, which will attempt a match with DHS records to confirm the student's immigration status. Note that U.S. citizens born abroad might fail the citizenship check, un - less they have updated their citizenship information with SSA (see \"Updating status for U.S. citizens born abroad\" later in this chapter). U.S. citizenship documentation If a student must prove his status as a U.S. citizen or national, only cer - tain types of documents are acceptable. The Department doesn't specify all of the acceptable documents, but here are some documents you might choose to use to prove U.S. citizenship: A Certificate of Naturalization (N-550 or N-570) issued by USCIS (or, prior to 1991, a federal or state court), or through administrative naturalization after December 1990 to those who are individually naturalized. You must copy this document for the student's file and tell the student to update their status with DHS, see https://uscis.gov/ about-us/contact-us . A Certificate of Citizenship (N-560 or N-561) is issued by USCIS to individuals who derive U.S. citizenship through a parent.Example: citizenship not confirmed Anthony is a U.S. citizen, but SSA doesn't confirm his U.S. citizenship status. The aid administrator at Epstein College asks him to submit documenta - tion of his status. Anthony first submits a Social Security card, but the admin - istrator explains that the card doesn't document his status because non - citizens can have Social Security cards. Anthony then brings in his Certificate of Naturalization. The administrator makes a copy of the certificate for his file and tells Anthony his citizenship has been documented. She also ad - vises Anthony to have the SSA correct its database so that he won't have this problem again. Passport cards & passports 22 CFR 51.4(b)(2) A student may apply for a U.S. passport card, which may be considered accept - able documentation of U.S. citizenship, at the U.S. State Department website: https://travel.state.gov/content/pass - ports/en/passports/information/card.html U.S. Citizenship A person is a U.S. citizen by birth or by naturalization or by operation of law. Persons (except for the children of foreign diplomatic staff) born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and, in most cases, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands are U.S. citizens, as are most persons born abroad to parents (or a parent) who are citizens. All U.S. citizens are considered U.S. nationals, but not all nationals are citizens. Per - sons whose only connection to the U.S. is through birth on American Samoa, Swains Island, or the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are not U.S. citizens but are U.S. nationals, and therefore may receive FSA funds. 1-31 Chapter 2\u2014U.S. CFR DCL A copy of the student's birth certificate showing that the student was born in the U.S., which includes Puerto Rico (on or after Janu - ary 13, 1941), Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands (on or after January 17, 1917), American Samoa, Swains Island, or the Northern Mariana Islands, unless the person was born to foreign diplomats residing in the U.S. If a student has a birth certificate from a U.S. jurisdiction showing that the student was born abroad (i.e., not in the U.S. or its territories), that birth certificate is not acceptable documentation. A U.S. passport, current or expired, (except \"limited\" passports, which are typically issued for short periods such as a year and which don't receive as much scrutiny as a regular passport when applying). In the case of nationals who are not U.S. citizens, the passport will be stamped \"Noncitizen National.\" Five-year-duration U.S. passports (commonly issued to younger students) are considered acceptable documentation, and are not considered \"limited\". Passport cards are also acceptable; however, one-year-duration U.S. passports are NOT acceptable documentation. A wallet-sized passport card, issued by the State Department, is a fully valid attestation of the U.S. citizenship and identity of the bear - er, but can only be used for land and sea travel between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. A copy of Form FS-240 (Consular Report of Birth Abroad), FS-545 (Certificate of birth issued by a foreign service post), or DS-1350 (Certification of Report of Birth). These are State Depart - ment documents. Before you can disburse aid, the student must present documentation that verifies he is a U.S. citizen. If the documents indicate that the student is a U.S. citizen or national, you may award and disburse aid to the student and the C-code may remain on the student's ISIR. Keep a copy of the docu - mentation in the student's file. Unlike the case of eligible noncitizens, you don't submit the documents to the DHS/USCIS or any other agency for verification of U.S. citizenship, even though older versions of the Certificate of Citizenship and of the Certificate of Naturalization instruct the holder not to photocopy them. The student can also contact the Social Security Ad - ministration to update the student's record. This updating is not required to receive aid. Child Citizenship Act (CCA) The CCA became effective on February 27, 2001. As of that date, foreign-born children who are not U.S. citizens at birth become citizens once these conditions are met: At least one parent (biological or adop tive) is a U.S. citizen; the children live in the legal and physi cal custody of that parent; they are under 18 years of age; and they are admitted as immigrants for lawful permanent residence. Children newly entering the country who are adopted abroad prior to the issuance of their IR-3 visa (for orphans) or IH-3 visa (for children from Hague Convention countries) become citizens upon arrival. They should receive a Certificate of Citizenship within 45 days instead of receiving a permanent resident card and then filing Form N-600 to request a certificate. Children who are adopted after being admitted to the U.S. with an IR-4 visa (for orphans) or IH-4 visa (for children from Hague Convention coun - tries) become citizens once their adoption is full and final. Parents of these and other children who do not automatically receive a certificate of citizenship can get one by filing Form N-600. For more information, contact the USCIS, visit the website at www.uscis.gov , or see the State Department's intercountry adoption website at http://adoption.state.gov/ .Parent signature on certificate Because documents such as a certificate of citizenship can go to minors, they may be signed by a parent or guardian instead of the minor child. This does not affect the legitimacy of the docu - ment.Mandatory name changes Whenever a student legally changes their name because of marriage, di - vorce, court order or any other reason, they must tell the Social Security Ad - ministration so they can get a corrected card and have correct SSN matches in the future. The student must bring the appropriate documents to prove the change to their local SSA office. See https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp Updating status for U.S. citizens born abroad Students born abroad to U.S. citizen parents are U.S. citizens if they meet certain requirements, and their status is usually noted in the SSA's database when they receive an SSN. But occasionally, a student may not have provided sufficient proof of U.S. citizenship to SSA in order for the record to be updat - ed. Therefore, these students will fail the U.S. citizenship match even if they have an SSN. If this occurs, the student must provide proof of U.S. citizen - ship as outlined below. He can contact the SSA to have its record corrected. This update is not required to receive aid. Such students can document US. citizenship by providing a \"Consular Report of Birth Abroad\" (Form FS-240, which is proof of U.S. citizenship), a \"Certification of Report of Birth\" (Form DS-1350, which is evidence of U.S. citizenship and equivalent to a birth certificate), or a Certificate of Citi - zenship issued by USCIS. If the birth of the student was registered with the American consulate or embassy in a foreign country before he turned 18, he can receive a copy of one of these by sending a written, notarized request to the USCIS. For pictures of the U.S. citizen documents listed above, see the end of this chapter. CITIZENS OF THE FREELY ASSOCIATED STATES Students who are citizens of the Freely Associated States\u2014the Feder - ated States of Micronesia and the republics of Palau and the Marshall Is - lands \u2014are eligible for Pell Grants (citizens of Palau are also eligible for FWS and FSEOG; see the margin note) but are not eligible for FSA loans. These students should have a passport from the Freely Associated States or an I-94. The student should indicate on the FAFSA that he/she is an eligible non - citizen and leave the ARN item blank. If the student doesn't have an SSN, he enters 666 and ED will give him a number to use, or if he was given a num - ber in the previous year, he must continue to use the same ED-assigned pseu - do-SSN due to Pell Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) rules (see the November 20, 2013 Electronic Announcement for more details). Because he isn't providing an ARN, the student's application won't go through the DHS match. Do not complete a third step verification for these students\u2014they will fail the match. Instead, request documentation of his Freely Associated States citizenship. Once you have received the student's document establishing his status, as a citizen of the Freely Associated States, make a copy of the document and place it in the student's file. You can reuse the original document in future years if it hasn't expired. The Freely Associated States The Compact of Free Association (P.L. 99-239) created three political entities from the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Two of these entities, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, voted in 1986 to end political ties with the U.S.. The third entity, Palau, voted to ratify the compact in 1994; its independence was effective October 1, 1994. These three entities are the Freely Associated States. 34 CFR 600.2 No FSEOG and FWS/Compact Act The Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, or the Compact Act, eliminates eligibility for citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) for FSEOG and FWS funds. To mitigate this loss, the Compact Act authorizes Supplemental Education Grants (SEGs) that may be awarded to the FSM and RMI. For more information, students of the FSM and RMI should contact their local educa - tion authority. Also under the Compact Act, students who are citizens of the Republic of Palau will continue to be eligible for FWS and FSEOG through the 2018-19 award year. ED-Assigned identification num - bers for Pacific Islanders and the FAFSA Electronic Announcement Nov 20, 2013 For more details on SSNs for Citizens of the Freely Associated States, see Chap - ter 4 of this volume.Report of birth abroad The F-240 Report of Birth Abroad form was redesigned in January 2011, but the previous version (DS-1350) remains valid for proving U.S. citizenship for Title IV purposes. 1-33 Chapter 2\u2014U.S. Citizenship & THE DHS The DHS assigns to all legal aliens an Alien Registration Number (ARN), which FSA uses to identify the student records that must be sent to DHS for immigration status verification. If the applicant indicates on the FAFSA that he is an eligible noncitizen and provides an ARN, identifying infor - mation is sent to the DHS for eligible noncitizen matching. The results of the match are shown by a match flag in the \"FAA Informa - tion\" section of the output document, under the heading \"DHS\" on the ISIR or \"DHS Match Flag\" on the SAR. There will also be a comment about the results on the output document. Because all applications are matched with the SSA, an application with an ARN will be matched with both DHS and SSA records. When results are received from both matches, a positive SSA match will indicate that the stu - dent is a U.S. citizen. If the SSA match is negative, the DHS match flag will determine the student's eligible noncitizen status. Successful match. (Y Flag) If the match confirms the student's immi - gration status as an eligible one, he can receive aid if the other eligibility cri - teria are also met. Comment code 143 will appear on the SAR and ISIR, and the successful match results are documentation of the student's eligibility. Of course, if you have other information about his status that seems to contra - dict the successful match result, you must resolve the conflict before paying the student (see \"Conflicting Information\" in Chapter 1 ) by going through the third step verification process. Record was not sent to DHS due to data entry errors. (Blank flag) The match won't be attempted if the student left the citizenship question blank (code 068) , if the student said they were an eligible noncitizen but provided either no ARN or an illegible or invalid one (code 142) , or if she changed her response to the citizenship question or changed her ARN after previous verification by the DHS (code 141) . Instead, the student will receive a C code and a comment explaining the problem and directing her to provide the school with his/her most recent immigration documentation to support his/her eligibility. Compare the student's immigration document with the SAR/ISIR to determine the appropriate resolution action. If you or the stu - dent corrects the ARN and resubmits it so that the match can be conducted, and his/her eligibility is confirmed as an eligible noncitizen, the C code will not appear on the new ISIR. If her eligibility is not confirmed, (match flag = N), check her DHS secondary Match Flag to determine how to proceed. Student's noncitizen status has not yet been confirmed. (N Flag and C code) DHS will continue to check its records in a process called auto- mated secondary confirmation . The SAR and ISIR will have comment code 144 and a DHS match flag of \"P\" (indicating that the procedure is still in process). Within three to five days, the CPS should generate a SAR and ISIR indicating the result in the \"DHS Secondary\" Flag field. The response table in the margin explains each Flag, its translation and how to proceed.Suspect documents If you are able to discern that a docu - ment is fraudulent, you must deny the student Title IV aid. If the student sub - mits conflicting information regarding immigration status on the FAFSA, you must resolve any discrepancies before disbursing Title IV aid. Report altered or misreported infor - mation to the Department's Office of Inspector General at 1-800-MIS-USED or the OIG's website at: www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/in - dex.html. DHS third step verification match flags and comment codes Y, 120: The student's eligibility has been confirmed. You can process his aid. C ,105: The student's eligible nonciti - zen status has not yet been verified. The school is required to wait 10 business days for another ISIR with an updated match result. If there is no update, the school begins the third step verification process. N, 046: The student's immigration status was not confirmed. The school begins third step verification. X, 109: The DHS did not have enough information to determine the student's status. The school begins third step 2018-19 FSA HB May2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL The school should wait at least 10 but no more than 15 business days for the result of automated secondary confirmation. If the result has not been received by that time, the school must begin the third step verification pro - cess (see below). A correction to the student's name, date of birth, or ARN made while the DHS is conducting the automated secondary confirmation will start the process over, i.e., the correction will be sent through primary confirma - tion. Though unlikely, if the new primary confirmation match yields a \"Y,\" the transaction can be used to award aid. The new transaction may have a new DHS verification number assigned. A correction made to a transaction that contains secondary confirmation results of \"Y\" or \"C\" (or a transaction with a primary confirmation result of \"Y\") will not be sent through the DHS match again. Otherwise the record will be re-sent for matching. ARN corrections and additions to the FAFSA If the citizenship question is blank but there is an ARN , the CPS will send the record to DHS for matching. If both the citizenship question and the ARN are blank, the record will not be sent to DHS. The output document will explain that SSA was unable to confirm that the student is a U.S. citizen. She must submit a correction to the citizenship status and ARN if she is an eligible noncitizen. If U.S. citizen or national is selected, but the student provides an eligible noncitizen document, correct question 14 on the ISIR to \"No, but I am an eligible noncitizen\" and enter the ARN in question 15. This correction will tell CPS to send the record to the DHS Pri - mary match (for the first time). Ignore comment code 146 from SSA on the current ISIR. Wait for the DHS Match flags on the student's next ISIR to determine if the student is an eligible noncitizen or if a third step verification is necessary. If the ARN on the ISIR does not match the ARN on the student's immigration document, correct the ARN in field 15. This will send the corrected record (which DHS considers a new record because of the new ARN) to the DHS Primary match. Ignore DHS comment codes 046, 105 and 109 on the current ISIR. Do not complete third step verification unless the DHS Match flags on the resulting ISIR indicate that third step verification is necessary. For more detail on these codes, see the 2018-19 SAR Comment Code and Text guide on IFAP.Example of eligible noncitizen not confirmed On his original application, Theo didn't give his ARN and reported that he was a citizen. When the SSA didn't confirm this, Theo told the aid administrator at Fowler University that he was a permanent resident. He added his ARN and changed his citizenship status to eligible noncitizen, but SAVE didn't confirm his status as an eligible noncitizen. He explained to the aid administrator that he had applied for permanent resident status but didn't have documentation yet. The aid administrator told him that when he received documentation that his application was approved, he should bring it to Fowler so that it could be submitted to the USCIS for confirmation.Conditions requiring secondary confirmation 34 CFR 668.133(a) School policies and procedures on secondary confirmation 34 CFR 668.134-1351-35 Chapter 2\u2014U.S. CFR DCL THIRD STEP VERIFICATION (FORMERLY FORM G-845) If the student didn't pass secondary verification or if you have conflict - ing information about his immigration status after receiving a match result, you must review the record for third step verification. Third step verification preparation 1. Request the student's most current, unexpired immigration document. When it is submitted, make a copy of it. 2. Carefully review the student's immigration documentation against the status and document descriptions below. 3. Determine whether the student's immigration documentation sup - ports eligibility for Title IV aid. If it does do not support an eligible status, you can tell the student that he is not eligible now, but may be eligible if/ when he provides eligible noncitizen documentation. You should not com - plete third step verification for this student. Third step verification via the SAVE system If the student's immigration documentation appears to demonstrate that he is an eligible noncitizen, you must complete a third step verifica - tion request. Through April 24, 2018, complete a Form G-845 and follow the instructions in Volume 1, Chapter 2 of the 2017-18 Federal Student Aid Handbook. Using the DHS verification number, submit it through the SAVE system to confirm that the documentation is valid and to obtain the student's immigration status. After April 24, 2018, watch for an EA announcing the date that a SAVE user ID will be sent to each school's Primary Destination Point Administra - tor (PDPA) and follow the instructions in the EA. After your PDPA has created a SAVE third step only user ID for you, begin submitting third step verification via the SAVE system. SAVE Instructions will be found on the \"DHS-SAVE, Eligible Noncitizen\" link in the \"Information Pages\" section (see sidebar on right side of the page) on IFAP homepage (IFAP.ed.gov) as they become available in late April, 2018. In May, 2018, DHS and the Department of Education, in a collabora - tive effort, will issue (to the PDPA with CPS access at each school) a unique SAVE user ID to submit third step data electronically through the DHS/ SAVE system. On May 1, 2018, DHS will no longer accept paper forms nor return paper responses. To prepare for the transition, refer to the Electronic Announcement (EA) dated 2/26/2018: https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/0 22618TransitionG845FormElectEligNoncitizenStat.html .\"Third Step\" Verification The \"Paper Secondary Confirmation\" step, which required you to submit a paper form G-845, is now called \"third step verifi cation.\" DHS-USCIS returns the response via the SAVE system. I-94 website https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94 The I-94 regulations and process have not changed. Customs and Border Pro - tection (CBP) creates admission records electronically. The I-94 website allows travellers (and schools, if the traveller grants permission) to access admission records online (the website contains records from April 2011 to present). Legacy paper I-94s are also still valid. NEW DHS verification number on the ISIR When a record is processed through the CPS match with DHS, a 15-digit verifica - tion number is assigned to the student and printed in the \"FAA Information\" section of the SAR and ISIR. This 15 digit number is needed to access the student's SAVE record, and to submit a third step verification request through SAVE. You must submit, via SAVE, the verification number. Lack of response example Javier is a refugee and received aid from Schwarber University. His status wasn't confirmed through the DHS match, so Schwarber performed third step verification. The DHS didn't respond in time, so Schwarber paid Javier without any response. When Javier applies again, the CPS still doesn't confirm his status. Even though Schwarber began third step verification for Javier last year and his documents haven't expired, because the school never received a DHS response, it must perform third step verification documentation Certain non-U.S. citizens may be eligible for Title IV aid. The following types of \"eligible noncitizens\" are among the classes of persons who may be eligible. For classes of eligible noncitizens other than permanent residents, evidence of their status typically is on the I-94, but other documentation may also be acceptable. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) no longer is - sues a paper I-94 form, with the exception of asylees and certain parolees. In September 2015, CBP automated the refugee admission process. Refugees will no longer receive a paper form I-94, but will have access to an electronic form. Students without paper I-94 documentation (see I-94 website sidebar) may have their status confirmed by the electronic I-94 printout and/or a CBP stamp, showing class of admission and date admitted or paroled in their passport to confirm this status. Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) are noncitizens who are legally permitted to live and work in the U.S. permanently. The standard docu - ment is the Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551 since 1997) or Resi - dent Alien Card (Form I-551 before 1997) . Both forms are referred to colloquially as \"green cards,\" though they have changed colors over the years. Possessors of the older Alien Registration Receipt Card (Form I-151 , issued prior to June 1978) should have replaced it with a newer card, but for receiving FSA funds it is acceptable as evidence of perma - nent residence. Permanent residents may also present an Arrival/Departure Record (CBP Form I-94) or the Departure Record ( Form I-94A , with the endorsement \"Processed for I-551. Temporary Evidence of Law - ful Admission for Permanent Residence. Valid until ____________. Employment Authorized. \" This is used at land border ports of entry. If available, an I-551 (also known as a \"green card\") is preferable to es - tablish LPR status. The form will have an ARN annotated on it and is acceptable if the expiration date has not passed. The U.S. Department of State issues a machine readable immigrant visa (MRIV) in the holder's passport. The MRIV will have a U.S. CBP inspector admission stamp, and the statement \"UPON ENDORSE - MENT SERVES AS TEMPORARY I-551 EVIDENCING PERMA - NENT RESIDENCE FOR 1 YEAR\" will appear directly above the ma - chine readable section. An MRIV with this statement, contained in an unexpired foreign passport and endorsed with the admission stamp, constitutes a temporary I-551, valid for one year from the date of en - dorsement on the stamp. The USCIS issues the U.S. Travel Document (mint green cover), which contains the Reentry Permit ( Form I-327 ) and the Refugee Travel Document ( Form I-571 ). It is used by lawful permanent resi - dents, as well as refugees and asylees, and is annotated with \"Permit to Reenter Form I-327 (Rev. 9-2-03). \" If the student has an I-551 with a baby picture , she should update the I-551 with the USCIS. Permanent residents are expected to get a new picture and be fingerprinted at the age of 14. But you can submit the documents to USCIS and pay a student who has an I-551 with a baby picture as long as you can confirm that it belongs to the student. Y ou Eligible noncitizen name chang - es When an eligible noncitizen student changes his or her name, the student needs to update it with SSA and DHS. To update their name with DHS, stu - dents can call 1-800-375-5283. For the SSA update, the student may refer to https://www.ssa.gov/agency/contact or visit their local SSA office .1-37 Chapter 2\u2014U.S. & Eligible Noncitizens FSA HB May CFR DCL can do this by comparing the I-551 to a current photo ID that has the student's name, date of birth, and signature. The current ID must also be consistent with any identifying information in the student's file. A student who has an approved application for permanent residence on file with the USCIS and who is waiting for a permanent resident card should have an I-797 Approval Notice from USCIS indicating such, as well as an alien number, which will give notice of current sta - tus. Note that an application for permanent resident status alone is not sufficient for determining eligibility for FSA funds. If a person is applying to suspend deportation, she must request a hearing before an immigration law judge who will render an oral or written decision. If that is favorable, the USCIS will give the applicant a Form I-551 , which will certify her lawful permanent resident status. There is no special category for persons who have been granted sus - pensions of deportation. Conditional resident aliens are eligible for aid if their documentation has not expired. They may have a valid I-551, I-94, I-94A, or a pass - port with an MRIV bearing the statement, \"Upon endorsement serves as temporary I-551 evidencing permanent residence for 1 year. \" The Marriage Fraud Amendments established a two-year conditional permanent resident status for alien spouses of U.S. citizens or legal immigrants whose marriage took place less than two years before the spouse applied for permanent resident status. This status may also ap - ply to any of the spouse's children who are aliens. A Form I-551 of a conditional permanent resident alien is the same I-551 that is issued to regular permanent residents, except that the card for a conditional permanent resident expires in two years, as op - posed to 10 years for the regular card. A conditional permanent resi - dent must file a petition for removal of this restriction in the 90 days before the end of the two years. The USCIS will review the petition and, if the result of the review is satisfactory, drop the restriction and issue new documents. Refugee status continues unless revoked by DHS. Refugees are re - quired to apply for Lawful Permanent Residency (LPR) status after one year, and continue to be refugees even after the grant of LPR sta - tus. In September 2015, CBP automated the refugee process. A refugee will have an electronic I-94 showing \"RE\" as the class of admission and \"DS\" as the admit until date. The refugee travel letter provided by the Department of State will be annotated with a stamp showing admission under Section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). While the form is now automated, a refugee may be in posses - sion of an older paper I-94 or I-94A form or be provided a paper form upon request. The paper form I-94 or I-94A is annotated with a stamp showing admission under Section 207 of the Immigration and Nation - ality Act (INA). They may also have the old Refugee Travel Docu - ment (Form I-571) or the newer U.S. Travel Document annotated with \"Refugee Travel Document Form I-571 (Rev. 9-2-03). \" Refugees USCIS retires red ink On July 1, 2014, U.S. Citizenship & Im - migration Services (USCIS) began using a new blue colored ink for its secure stamps. The old red ink previously used for such stamps has been retired and will no longer be used (note also that some stamps still use black ink). Use of copy of I-94 or I-94A Note that a refugee or an asylee may apply for permanent-resident status. During the period in which the application is being reviewed, the student may have a copy of the I-94 that includes the endorsement \"209a (or 209b) pending. Employment Authorized.\" Students with this form of documentation are eligible for FSA funds as long as the I-94 has not expired. Photocopying immigration docs DCL GEN-15-08 In most cases you will examine and copy original immigration documents, and you must keep a copy in the stu - dent's file with the results from the third step verification/SAVE. While generally not permitted, for the purpose of apply - ing for Title IV aid, students may legally photocopy, scan, or otherwise image immigration documents (such as Forms I-551 or I-94) to complete the third step 2018-19 FSA HB May2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR employment authorized and may present an employment authori - zation document. Persons granted asylum can apply for permanent residence after one year. Asylee status continues unless revoked by DHS or until perma - nent resident status is granted. Asylees will have an I-94 or I-94A with a stamp showing admission under Section 208 of the INA. They may also have the same travel documents described for refugees. Per - sons granted asylum in the U.S. are authorized for indefinite employ - ment. Persons paroled into the U.S. for at least one year must provide evidence (such as having filed an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status [I-485] or being the named alien relative from a petitioner, I-130) from the DHS that they are in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose and intend to become a citizen or permanent resident. DHS will usually respond to the filing of an I-485 with an I-797 and a parolee must provide this I-797 to you before you go through the third step verification process as their evidence that they intend to become a citizen or permanent resident. They must also provide documentation of their parole status (such as an I-94 ) and it must have a stamp indicating that the student has been paroled into the U.S. for at least one year, with a date that has not expired (federal student aid cannot be disbursed after the document has expired). Cuban-Haitian Entrants as defined by Section 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act (REAA) of 1980. All Cuban-Haitian entrants are potentially eligible for Federal Student Aid. Note that certain doc - uments showing that the holder is a Cuban-Haitian entrant continue to convey CHE status even if the expiration date has passed. When submitting CHE documentation, add a note in the \"Special Com - ments\" box of the SAVE \"Submit Document\" screen requesting review for CHE status verification. Conditional entrants are refugees who entered the U.S. under the seventh preference category of P .L. 89-236 or whose status was ad - justed to lawful permanent resident alien under that category. Students may have an I-94 with a stamp displaying \" Section 203(a)(7) \" and indicating that the person was admitted to the U.S. as a conditional entrant. Because DHS stopped using this category after enacting the Refugee Act on March 31, 1980, you should not disburse FSA funds if the student has an I-94 with conditional entrant status granted after that date. The stamps mentioned use red and blue security ink: the date of ad - mission is red, and the rest of the stamp is blue. The stamp contains three codes: the first is a two-digit code to the left of the date that designates the field office with jurisdiction over the port of entry. On most stamps, this code will be two numbers and no letters. Letters are currently only used on HQ stamps. The three-letter code located under the word \" ADMITTED\" shows the port of entry. The third code, to the right of the date, is the unique four-digit number. When referring to a particular stamp, the port of entry code and the stamp's unique number should be used.VAWA verification Battered immigrants-qualified aliens DCL GEN-10-07 If the school has reservations about the documentation provided, or is unclear about the outcome reflected in the doc - umentation, after reviewing this section of the FSA Handbook, the financial aid administrator must submit third step verification data to DHS-USCIS. Asylees abroad and eligibility Asylees who leave the U.S. for an ex - tended amount of time without USCIS approval forfeit their current immigra - tion status, so it may thus be difficult for them to be considered an eligible non- citizen for FSA purposes. Victims of human trafficking DCL GEN-06-091-39 Chapter 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL The endorsement or stamp can be placed anywhere on the I-94. If the original stamp does not copy well due to the ink color, you should replicate it by hand on the photocopy. Because CBP offices don't have uniform procedures or stamps, you should contact the local office with questions regarding acceptable immigration documents. Victims of human trafficking have the same eligibility for federal benefits as refugees under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro - tection Act (VTVPA), though the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), rather than the DHS, is responsible for certifying this status. Because of this, these students will not pass the DHS match, and the normal paper third-step confirmation does not apply. These individuals may have an I-94 with a T1, T2, T3, or T COA code for principal, spouse, child, or parent, respectively. Y ou must instead re - view the student's certification or eligibility letter from the HHS and call the Office on Trafficking in Persons at 1-866-401-5510, as noted on the letter, to verify its validity and confirm that the eligibility has not expired. Y ou must note the date, time, and results of the call and retain a copy of the letter. If the student applies for federal student aid in a subsequent year at your school, you must call again to ensure that the student's status is still in force. The spouse, child, or parent of a trafficking victim might be eligible for aid. He will not have a certification letter but will have a T-visa (e.g., T-2 or T-3) . He will also likely fail the DHS match; if so you must call the same office, verify the validity of his T-visa as well as the victim's certification letter, note the time and results, and save a copy of both documents. Battered immigrants-qualified aliens are victims of domestic vio - lence by their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) spouses or parents. They may, with their designated children, be eligible under the Violence Against Women Act (V AW A) for federal public benefits, including federal student aid. Note that both men and women may be approved as victims under the Violence Against Women Act. They indicate on the FAFSA that they are eligible noncitizens, though they will not pass the automated DHS match. Instead, they will need to obtain and provide you with documentation based on their case type: self-petition, suspension of deportation, or cancellation of re - moval. In self-petitioning cases under V AW A, the immigrant submits an I-360 form to the USCIS, which will deny the petition, approve it, or find that a \"prima facie\" case has been established. Either an approval or a prima facie finding makes a student eligible for aid, though the latter has an expiration date after which the person becomes ineligible. In some cases, the USCIS will acknowledge receipt of a petition. This does not establish eligibility for aid. With an approval of a petition , the USCIS will provide a Form I-797, Notice of Action form , that will indicate it is an approval notice for a 1-40 or L.P .R. and that the petition has been approved. A separate I-797 will be issued with the names and dates of birth of children listed by the applicant, and it will indicate that they are named on the approved petition. These children are eli - gible for aid, and because their USCIS status continues after reaching the age of majority, their eligibility for aid continues as well. In some cases, a dependent child can petition for battered immigrant status; the I-797 would then indicate a self-petitioning child of a U.S.C. or L.P .R. With a prima facie case , the USCIS will sometimes issue an I-797 that indicates an establishment of prima facie case. This status is usu - ally for a period of up to 180 days, though the USCIS may extend that period until the case is approved or denied. Petitioners can submit a written request for the extension. As long as the deadline has not ex - pired, the person is eligible for FSA funds. Children may be included on the I-797, though their eligibility is subject to the same expiration date. If a spouse is ultimately denied approval, the children on the I-797 would also be denied and ineligible for aid. Therefore, it is important to examine the notice carefully. For ex - ample, USCIS may issue a Notice of Deferred Action on an I-797, which is an administrative choice to give lower priority for removal of an immigrant from the U.S. Such a notice could pertain to cases un - related to petitions for battered immigrant status, and it would not be sufficient for documentation of a self-petitioner. It generally will have a termination date. Be sure to examine the notice carefully to be sure it relates to the student's claim for eligible noncitizen status and that it conveys relevant information to the student's case. If a termination date is indicated on the I-797, a petition approval or an establishment of prima facie case will be eligible for aid through that date and ineli - gible afterward. An immigration judge may issue a suspension of deportation of the abused person under the V AW A. The applicant will receive a copy of the court order . As long as it has not expired and clearly indicates suspension of deportation by the judge, an otherwise eligible person can receive FSA funds. An immigration judge can also issue a cancellation of removal of the abused person under the V AW A. The applicant will receive a copy of the court order . As long as that has not expired and clearly indicates cancellation of removal by the judge, an otherwise eligible person can receive FSA funds. Y ou must examine the USCIS document and keep a copy in the stu - dent's file. If it indicates he is eligible for aid and the expiration date has not passed, you may award aid. If the student applies for FSA funds in a subsequent year, you may rely on the original document NEW Form I-797 Notice of Action Form I-797 is USCIS's formal communi - cation with customers issued when an application or petition is approved or to confer an immigration benefit.1-41 Chapter 2\u2014U.S. Citizenship & Eligible Noncitizens FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL if it has not expired, but you must have the student provide a dated, written statement that his immigration status under V AW A remains in effect without change. If his documentation has expired, he must renew it. If documentation is lost, or is expired, or if you are unclear about it, submit third step verification data and attach a copy of the document(s). Submit the request through the SAVE system. Add a note in the \"Special Comments box of the SAVE \"Submit Document\" screen requesting review for V AW A status verification. The student's eligibility for aid will be based on the result of the submission. Jay Treaty Section 289 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) gives per - sons with at least 50% Native American blood who were born in Canada the legal right to live and work indefinitely in the U.S. This is based on the Jay Treaty of 1794 and subsequent court decisions. Such individuals are not subject to the legal restrictions typically imposed on aliens by the DHS, are not required to obtain documentation from the DHS, and are considered \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" They must obtain an SSN for purposes of applying for Title IV aid. Students who may be eligible for FSA funds should enter their valid ARN (or a A999999999 if they don't have an ARN) on the FAFSA and in - dicate they are eligible noncitizens. If they fail the DHS match, you must submit a third step verification with the documentation. If they fail third step verification, they can still be considered eligible if they meet the documenta - tion requirements below for students without an ARN. Students who enter all 9's for their ARN will receive comment 144 on the output document. The school must obtain proof that such a student has 50% Native American blood and was born in Canada. To do so, the student should provide one or more of the following documents: A \"band card\" issued by the Band Council of a Canadian Reserve, or by the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa; Birth or baptism records; An affidavit from a tribal official or other person knowledgeable about the applicant's or recipient's family history; Identification from a recognized Native American provincial or territorial organization. If the student can provide this documentation and is otherwise eligible, the school must note this in the student's file and can award statuses and documents Several types of documentation do not prove a student's eligible nonciti - zen status. Below, we list a variety of forms and their related statuses which are ineligible. If a student does not provide a document that proves his eligi - bility for Title IV aid, he is not eligible with these documents alone. A Social Security card or driver's license isn't acceptable for docu - menting U.S. citizenship or national status since these individuals can also have these forms of identification. \"Enhanced\" driver's licenses (provided by a limited number of states to permit non-air travel entry to the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean) are also not acceptable. Someone who has only a \"Notice of Approval to Apply for Per - manent Residence (I-171 or I-464)\" cannot receive FSA funds. The State Department publishes a list of nonimmigrant visas at: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit.html . Employment authorization card. Someone with a nonimmigrant visa isn't eligible for FSA funds unless she has a Form I-94 with one of the endorsements given in the eligible document section. Nonimmigrant visas include those with work visas, students, visitors, and foreign government officials. Someone with a nonim - migrant visa isn't eligible for FSA funds unless she has a Form I-94 with one of the endorsements given in the eligible document sec - tion. Nonimmigrant visas include (but are not limited to) the F-1, F-2, or M-1 Student Visa, NATO Visas (NATO), A2 and A3 Visas (foreign official, including attendants), B-1 or B-2 Visitor Visa, J-1 or J-2 Exchange Visitors Visa, H series or L series Visa (which allow temporary employment in the U.S.), or G series Visa (pertaining to international organizations). Form I-817, Application or approval for Family Unity Benefits. Temporary residents are allowed to live and work in the U.S. un - der the Legalization or Special Agricultural Worker program. This usually is recognized on an I-688 form. These residents are no longer eligible for Title IV funds. Illegal aliens under the legalization (also called the amnesty) pro - gram established by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). These individuals were given documentation that allowed them to work while their application for permanent resident status was being processed, but they aren't eligible for aid unless their appli - cation was approved. 1-43 Chapter CFR DCL U-Visa information More information on U Visas may be found on the following website: www.uscis.gov/green-card/other-ways- get-green-card/green-card-victim-crime- u-nonimmigrant.

Students granted DACA often are assigned an SSN, and they are not eligible for Title IV aid, but may be eligible for state or college aid, and submitting a FAFSA can help them access those other types of aid. To complete the FAFSA, DACA status students must enter their SSN and answer the \" Are you a U.S. citizen?\" question as \"No, I am not a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. \" After submitting the FAFSA, the student should check with the school's financial aid office to see what types of non-federal financial aid they may be eligible to receive. \"Withholding of removal\" order issued by an immigration judge or by the Board of Immigration Appeals. This is used to protect a person from return to a country that threatens the person's life or free - dom. \"U-Visa\" holders are not designated as qualified aliens under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) and are therefore not eligible for Title IV program funds. However, U-Visa holders may convert to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status after they have physically been present in the U.S. for a continuous period of at least three years after the date of admission given on their U-Visa. Documentation is usually on an form I-797. It is important for you to inspect the content of the document since the I-797 is used for a variety of purposes. If the student becomes an LPR, he or she becomes a qualified alien under the PRWORA (see above), and thus potentially eligible for Title IV funds (assuming they meet all other eligibility requirements. U- Visa holders should be encouraged to explore non-federal aid options to help them pay for school while waiting for their application for LPR status (I-485) to be approved. The website www.studentaid.gov con - tains information to help students search for possible scholarships and other resources. If the document a student submits is for an ineligible status, you shouldn't submit the documentation for secondary confirmation. Un - less you have conflicting information or the student compels you to do so. USCIS will only confirm current immigration status based on the document presented; it doesn't determine whether the student is eli - gible for FSA funds. Unless the student can submit documentation for an eligible status, as described above, or USCIS confirms the student's status as an eligible student, the student can't receive aid. Procedures when ineligibility is determined after disbursement 34 CFR 668.136(c) SAVE Guide to Immigration Documents The USCIS's Systematic Alien Verifica - tion for Entitlements (SAVE) Program office publishes the SAVE Guide to Im - migration Documents.

Follow the instructions in the Electronic Announce - ment of December 21, 2017.USING THE SAVE SYSTEM FOR THIRD STEP VERIFICATION If the student's immigration documentation appears to demonstrate that he is an eligible noncitizen, you must complete a third step verifica - tion request. Through April 24, 2018, complete a Form G-845 and follow the instructions in Volume 1, Chapter 2 of the 2017-18 Federal Student Aid Handbook. Using the DHS verification number, submit it through the SAVE system to confirm that the documentation is valid and to obtain the student's immigration status. After April 24, 2018, watch for an EA announcing the date that a SAVE user ID will be sent to each school's Primary Destination Point Administra - tor (PDPA) and follow the instructions in the EA. After your PDPA has created a SAVE third step only user ID for you, begin submitting third step verification via the SAVE system. SAVE Instructions will be found on the \"DHS-SAVE, Eligible Noncitizen\" link in the \"Information Pages\" section (see sidebar on right side of the page) on IFAP homepage (IFAP.ed.gov) as they become available in late April, 2018. In May, 2018, DHS and the Department of Education, in a collabora - tive effort, will issue (to the PDPA with CPS access at each school) a unique SAVE user ID to submit third step data electronically through the DHS/ SAVE system. On May 1, 2018, DHS will no longer accept paper forms nor return paper responses. To prepare for the transition, refer to the Electronic Announcement (EA) dated 2/26/2018: https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/0 22618TransitionG845FormElectEligNoncitizenStat.html . SAVE Third Step Responses A USCIS status verifier will search the SAVE databases, and enter the student's immigration status in the SAVE system within 3-5 of the request. If you haven't received a response within 20 business days, call the SAVE help desk, at 1-877-469-2563. Do not give this number to students or anyone not authorized to submit third step verification requests. If you don't receive a response from the USCIS after at least 15 business days from the date you sent the third step verification request, if you have sufficient documentation to make a decision, and if you have no information that conflicts with the student's documents or claimed status, you should re - view his file and determine whether he meets the eligible noncitizen require - ments. If he does meet the requirements, make any disbursement for which he is eligible and note in his file that SAVE exceeded the time allotment and that noncitizen eligibility was determined without their verification. When third step verification results in an eligible status, you must keep a copy of the SAVE response screen. If the confirmation process indicates a discrepancy, you must ask the student to correct the discrepancy with the USCIS. No certification of loans or further disbursement of funds can be made until the discrepancy is corrected. If the discrepancy isn't reconciled, the student must repay all aid except wages earned under FWS. Whenever the student is able to provide new information, it must be submitted to the USCIS as a third step verification request. If you have followed the procedures outlined here, including notifying the student of the discrepancy and withholding further payments and loan NEWNEW DHS-SAVE Eligible Noncitizen Information page https://ifap.ed.gov/DHSSAVEEligibleNon CFR DCL NEWcertifications as soon as a discrepancy is found, your school isn't liable for aid disbursed prior to third step verification. This assumes that you had no other conflicting information prior to making the disbursement and had reviewed the available documentation and concluded that the student was otherwise eligible. Interpreting the SAVE response When you receive the SAVE response, you determine the student's eligi - bility by referencing the SAVE response against the following list. The SAVE response does not directly state whether the student is eligible for Title IV funds. The following list explains whether a response means the student is eli - gible or ineligible for Title IV aid. For descriptions of the following immigra - tion statuses, see the earlier sections on eligible and ineligible noncitizens and their documentation: Potentially eligible statuses: \"Lawful Permanent Resident\" Resident\" \" Application Pending for the following USCIS benefit\" A pending ap - plication for an immigration status doesn't by itself make the student eligible for FSA funds; he must have an eligible status checked on the form or provide other documentation of an eligible status. \" Asylum or refugee status\" \"Parolee\" The student is eligible for aid if paroled into the U.S. for one year or more. The SAVE response will include the parole expiration date which must be after the day the student starts classes AND has evidence from the DHS (such as a form I-797 Notice of Approval of I-485 Perma - nent Residence Status) that he is in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose and intends to become a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. The SAVE response will include a note that the student's I-485 applica - tion is pending, if applicable. Note that if the student has not filed the I-485, nor had that application accepted by DHS, they are not an eli - gible noncitizen parolee. \"U.S. citizen\" Because the verification request is used to check the status of noncitizens, this box should be infrequently checked. You should not see this in the financial aid office because, as explained ear - lier in the chapter, you would have reviewed the student's documenta - tion, which identified him as a U.S. citizen, and you would not have submitted it to the USCIS. \"Cuban/Haitian Entrant\" \" American Indian born in Canada\" For details, see the Jay Treaty sec - tion earlier in this chapter. \"Texas or Oklahoma Band of Kickapoo Indians\" If this response is 15 business days timeframe received, the financial aid administrator must contact U.S. Department of Education staff by emailing either Aaron Washington (Aaron.Wash - ington@ed.gov). \"V AW A Self-Petitioner\" See GEN-10-07. If 17.a is checked, the finan - cial aid administrator must contact U.S. Department of Education staff by emailing either Aaron Washington (Aaron.Washington@ed.gov). If 17.b is checked, the student is eligible for federal student aid. Ineligible statuses Each of the following statuses are by themselves insufficient to make a student eligible for FSA funds. Unless an eligible status is also submitted, or the student can provide other documentation that can be confirmed by the USCIS, the following types of student are not Title IV eligible: \"Employment Authorized\" \"Not Action Status\" \"Withholding of Removal\" \"Document Expired, Altered, or Counterfeit. \" Notify the student that unless corrective action is taken with the USCIS, the case will be sub - mitted to the Office of Inspector General (OIG). Until this is resolved, no further aid may be disbursed, awarded, or certified. If the student does not take corrective action in a timely manner, you must report the case to the OIG. If SAVE was unable to process the request you may receive one of the following error messages. \"Resubmit request with both sides of the applicant's immigration document. \" Resubmit the student's immigration documents with copies of both sides of each document. \" Applicant's Immigration document is illegible. \" Resubmit the stu - dent's immigration documents with higher quality copies of the original documentation. \"Unable to verify status based on the document provided. \" If this is checked, DHS-USCIS was not able to verify the student's status based on the documentation provided. The student must contact the appropriate agency, i.e., USCIS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to correct their records. Determining eligibility if USCIS response is late 34 CFR 668.136(b)1-47 Chapter 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Student rights You must allow the student at least 30 days from the time you receive the output document to provide documentation of his immigration status. Dur - ing this period and until the results of the third step verification are received, you can't deny, reduce, or terminate aid to him. Unless you can determine that the documentation doesn't support an eligible noncitizen status, you must submit the student's immigration documents within ten business days of receipt. If the documentation supports the student's status as an eligible noncitizen, and if at least 15 business days passed since the date on which the documentation was submitted to the USCIS, you can disburse aid to an oth - erwise eligible student pending the USCIS response. Your school isn't liable if you erroneously conclude that a student is an eligible noncitizen, provided that you had no conflicting data on file and you relied on: A SAR or ISIR indicating that the student meets the requirements for federal student aid; A USCIS determination of an eligible immigration status in response to a request for third step verification; or Immigration status documents submitted by the student, if the USCIS did not respond in a timely fashion. The student (or parent borrower of a PLUS loan) is liable for any FSA funds received if he is ineligible. If you made your decision without having one of the documents above, your school is held responsible for repaying FSA funds to the Department. Your school should establish procedures to ensure due process for the student if FSA funds are disbursed but the aid of - fice later determines (using third step verification) that the student isn't an eligible noncitizen. The student must be notified of his ineligibility and given an opportunity to contest the decision by submitting to your school any ad - ditional documents that support his claim to be an eligible noncitizen. If the documents appear to support the student's claim, you should submit them to USCIS using third step verification. You must notify the student of your of - fice's final decision based on the third step verification results. For every student required to undergo third step verification, you must furnish written instructions providing: An explanation of the documentation the student must submit as evi - dence of eligible noncitizen status; Y our school's deadline for submitting documentation (which must be at least 30 days from the date your office receives the results of the pri - mary confirmation); Notification that if the student misses the deadline, he may not receive FSA funds for the award period or period of enrollment; and A statement that you won't decide the student's eligibility until he has a chance to submit immigration status documents.1-48 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL DOCUMENTING IMMIGRATION STATUS IN LATER AWARD YEARS There are several cases in which you must document a student's im - migration status in a subsequent award year if that student is not confirmed through the application process. For example, a student who presented a Temporary Form I-551 in a prior award year should have received a perma - nent I-551 by the next year and shouldn't still have a temporary card. You should refer the student to USCIS to obtain a permanent I-551 or an updated endorsement on the previous card. You must also document the eligible noncitizen status each award year for a conditional permanent resident, a refugee, a Cuban-Haitian entrant, or a person granted asylum . Students in any of these categories may have been redesignated to permanent-resident status or may have had their status - es revoked. You will have to send the documents for third step verification if the student's status isn't confirmed through the USCIS match. You don't have to document a student's eligible noncitizen status in subsequent award years if you've documented that the student is a U.S. citi - zen or national, is a citizen of the Freely Associated States, or has a Form I-551 or I-151. In addition, you aren't required to request third step verifica - tion if, for a previous award year, the response showed that the student was an eligible noncitizen and the documents used for that third step verification haven't expired. You must also have no conflicting information or reason to doubt the student's claim of having eligible noncitizen status. Also note that you must have confirmed the status in a previous award year. You may dis - burse aid without the USCIS response if the USCIS doesn't respond in time, but you can't count that lack of response as confirmation for the following year. REPLACING LOST DHS DOCUMENTS If a student can't locate his official USCIS documentation, the student must request that the documents be replaced because noncitizens who are 18 years and older must have immigration documentation in their possession at all times while in the U.S. Requests for replacement documents should be made to the nearest USCIS District Office. The student will be asked to complete a Form I-90 , \"Application to Re - place Alien Registration Card\" or a Form I-102 , \"Application for Replace - ment/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document.\" PDF versions of these forms can be downloaded from the USCIS website at uscis.gov . A temporary I-94 may be issued while the replacement documents are pending. In cases of undue hardship, where the student urgently needs documen - tation of his status, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows him to obtain photocopies of the documents from the USCIS District Office that is - sued the original documents. The student can submit a Form G-639 to make this request or can simply send a letter to the district office. If he is not sure which district office issued the original documents, he can submit the request to the field office nearest to his place of residence.Exclusion from subsequent confirmation 34 CFR 668.133(b)1-49 Chapter 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL A naturalized U.S. citizen student who lost documents or surrendered them when entering prison is responsible for getting copies of them before third step verification is submitted for the student.

If the passport is unexpired and endorsed with an admission stamp and the state - ment, \"Upon endorsement serves as temporary I-551 evidencing perma - nent residence for 1 year, \" it serves as a temporary I-551 and as valid documentation for establishing aid person generally isn't eligible for FSA funds if he is in default on an FSA loan or he owes an overpayment on an FSA grant or loan and he has not made a repayment arrangement for the default or overpayment. Also, for a parent to receive a PLUS Loan, neither the parent nor the student may be in default or owe an overpayment on an FSA loan or grant (though a parent in default on a PLUS loan does not make a student ineligible for aid). Exceptions to these general rules are noted in the discussion below. Any student applying for FSA funds must certify that he isn't in default on any FSA loan and doesn't owe an overpayment on any FSA grant, or that he has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the overpayment or default. This certification statement is printed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). A student is also ineligible if she inadvertently exceeded annual or aggregate loan limits. When this occurs, you must identify the loan(s) that resulted in the overborrowing and discuss the overborrowing with the student. The student can regain eligibility by repaying the extra amount borrowed or making arrangements, satisfactory to the loan holder, to repay it. See Dear Colleague Letter GEN-13-02 and Volume 4 of the FSA Handbook for more details. A student who has been convicted of, or has pled no contest or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining FSA funds must have completely repaid the fraudulently obtained funds to the Department or the loan holder before regaining aid eligibility. Any Perkins or Direct Loan so obtained is not eligible for rehabilitation. You can handle this requirement as you would a judgment lien\u2014you don't need to collect certification from each student but can deal with the situation when you become aware of it. Finally, a student is ineligible if his property is subject to a judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States, and a parent can't receive a PLUS loan if either the student or parent is subject to such a lien. For example, if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has placed a lien on a student's property for failure to pay a federal tax debt or make satisfactory arrangements for repayment, the student would be ineligible for federal student aid. Students who have previously attended other colleges may have a financial aid history that affects their eligibility for FSA funds at your school. You can review a student's financial aid history by using the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) online at www.nsldsfap.ed.gov; for questions call 1-800-999-8219. NSLDS will also help you track changes to the student's financial aid history through the postscreening and transfer student monitoring processes.NSLDS Financial Aid History FSA loans Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans Direct PLUS Loans (for parents or for graduate/professional students) Direct Consolidation Loans Federal Perkins Loans The following loan types from earlier programs also appear in NSLDS: Federal Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) Federal PLUS Loans Federal Consolidation Loans Federally Insured Student Loans (FISL) Guaranteed Student Loans Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) National Direct Student Loans and National Defense Student Loans (prede - cessors of Perkins Loans) Income Contingent Loans (ICL) Financial aid history 34 CFR 668.19 Dear Colleague Letter GEN-96-13Loan limits and eligibility See Volume 3, Chapter 5 for loan limits HEA Sec. 484(f), 34 CFR 668.32(g)(2), 668.35(d) DCL FAFSA is processed, the Central Processing System (CPS) matches the student against the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to see if she is in default, owes an overpayment, or has exceeded the loan limits. The CPS doesn't perform any matches to determine whether or not the student is subject to a judgment lien for a federal debt, and you aren't required to check for such liens. However, if you know that she is subject to such a lien, you can't pay her FSA funds. NSLDS MATCH To help you identify students with problems such as defaulted loans or overpayments, the CPS matches the student against the NSLDS database to obtain her financial aid history. You must resolve any conflicts between NSLDS and other information you have about the student before disbursing FSA funds (for example, if NSLDS shows that a student isn't in default but you have documentation showing that she is in default). The results of the NSLDS match are provided on the SAR and ISIR on the NSLDS Financial Aid History page. As with other matches, a \"C\" next to the student's expected family contribution (EFC) indicates problems that must be resolved. See Appendix B of the ISIR Guide for the complete tables of NSLDS match results. Successful match The SAR and ISIR will contain the NSLDS financial aid history only if the student's identifying information matches the database and there is relevant information for the student in the database. If the student has no defaults or overpayments or has made satisfactory repayment arrangements on a defaulted loan, the NSLDS match flag will be 1 and no C code will appear on the output document. A match flag of 2, 3, or 4 indicates that the student has defaulted loans or owes an overpayment or both. You will need to document that the problem has been resolved before disbursing aid. Note that for \"real-time\" processing\u2014if a student uses Corrections on the Web or an aid administrator uses FAA Access to CPS Online\u2014the CPS does not match against the NSLDS database (except when a school is added; see the sidebar), but the output document will show NSLDS data from the last transaction that did match against NSLDS. The ISIR might not, therefore, reflect the most current information. No data from match There are several reasons why an output document may not have financial aid history information: for example, if the application was rejected for lack of a signature or if identifying information was missing. For other cases, you can check the NSLDS flags reported in the \"FAA Information\" section. Partial match. If the student's SSN is in the NSLDS database but the first name or date of birth don't match what the student reported, no financial aid history will be reported and the output document will have an NSLDS match flag of \"7\" and a C code. There will also be a comment explaining why the financial aid history isn't given and directing the student to work with the school to resolve any discrepancies. A partial match requires resolution ; otherwise you won't have information from the Department on defaults and overpayments. If the student originally Example of incorrect NSLDS data Lydia is a first-year undergraduate at Lackey College and has never attended college before. When Lackey receives Lydia's ISIR, it shows that there was a partial match, and there is some data associated with her SSN. Lackey checks with NSLDS and learns that a guaranty agency is reporting a loan made years ago (when Lydia was in elementary school) under her SSN but with a com - pletely different name and birth date. Lackey determines that this isn't Lydia's loan, so she has no financial aid history in NSLDS. Lackey also suggests that Lydia provide documentation that the SSN belongs to her so the school can request that NSLDS data be corrected to prevent problems for her later.Judgment lien example When Jake provides his parents' tax return to the aid administrator at Hendricks College, he notices that they've reported business income but didn't report a business asset on the FAFSA. Jake explains that they didn't report the business as an asset because there's a lien against the business for a federal loan. The aid administrator tells her that the asset must still be reported, and also that her parents won't be able to borrow a PLUS Loan as long as they are subject to the lien. Adding a school and the NSLDS match When a school is added after the FAFSA has been submitted, it goes through the NSLDS match again rather than be - ing processed in real time. This ensures that the new school receives the latest financial aid history (FAH) on the ensu - ing transaction. This does not affect schools' responsibility to use transfer student monitoring. To supplement the ISIR and ensure a student's history is considered, some schools submit entire rosters of FAH re - quests. See the TSM/FAH processes and batch file layouts posted on the IFAP website at the NSLDS Reference Materi - als link under Processing Resources.1-59 Chapter Financial Aid History FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL reported incorrect identifying information, you can have them submit correct information, which will be sent through the match again. If the student did not submit incorrect identifying information, you can call the NSLDS customer support center (see sidebar) for help with determining the identifiers with the SSN in the NSLDS database. If you discover the discrepancy is due to the student misreporting the name or date of birth on the FAFSA, you should have the student make a correction. However, you may use the NSLDS record to determine the student's eligibility; you don't need to wait for the corrected data to be reported. If you find that the financial aid history associated with the student's SSN doesn't belong to the student, you should assume that the student has no relevant financial aid information. You may request that the data in NSLDS be corrected by providing relevant supporting documents. NSLDS will work with the previous data providers to correct the identifiers. You aren't required to request a correction; however, doing so will prevent the same FAFSA response in subsequent award years. Student not in database. If a match with NSLDS is completed but there's no information on the student in the database, the output document will comment that the student's SSN is not associated with any financial aid history. You can assume this is correct unless you have conflicting information. If you believe NSLDS should show a loan history, help the student by contacting the appropriate loan servicer or, for FFEL, guaranty agency. No relevant history. If a student's SSN matches a record in the NSLDS database but there's no relevant financial aid history to report, no information will be on the output document, because it isn't needed to determine the student's aid eligibility for the current award year. Conversely, if a student has relevant prior data, for example a prior Pell award, that will appear on the SAR/ISIR. The SAR and ISIR will have a comment that the student's record was matched with NSLDS but no information was found to print on the NSLDS page. Processing problem. If there was a problem with the match, the SAR and ISIR won't include financial aid history information. The output document will have a C code and a comment explaining that the CPS couldn't determine whether the student has loans in default and will direct her to contact the financial aid administrator. You must get the student's financial aid history before disbursing aid. If she has to make corrections of any kind, her information will go through the match again when the corrections are submitted, and you can use the results of that match to determine her eligibility. Postscreening\u2014changes after initial match Once you receive the financial aid history through NSLDS, you aren't required to check for changes to the data before disbursing funds to the student. But if you learn from NSLDS or another source that the student was not or is no longer eligible, you must not disburse any more FSA funds and must help make sure the student arranges to rep ay the aid for which he/she wasn't eligible.Example of misreported information on the FAFSA When Lester University receives Ben's ISIR, it shows that there was a discrepancy with the NSLDS database, so no financial aid history information is provided. The aid administrator at Lester asks Ben if he provided the correct name and birth date on the application. Ben says he wrote in the wrong month for his birth date, but his name is correct. The administrator checks the NSLDS database using Ben's first name, SSN, and date of birth. NSLDS shows the correct birth date, but the first name of the student is Warren, not Ben. She checks again with Ben, who explains that Ben is a nickname and Warren is his real name. The administrator determines that the financial aid history associated with the SSN belongs to Ben. She could disburse aid without requiring a correction, but Ben has other corrections to make, so she will wait for the ISIR correction before disbursing aid.NSLDS nslds@ed.gov Getting the student's financial aid history There are several ways for you to get a student's financial aid history from NSLDS. You can: use the NSLDS Financial Aid History section of the ISIR, log on to the NSLDS Professional Access website and access the data on - line for a student, for multiple students, use the FAT 001 Web report, which you submit from the Reports tab on the NSLDS site (you retrieve the results through the SAIG), or send a batch TSM/FAH Inform file to request aid history data for several students, which will be returned in either extract or report format through SAIG. The TSM/FAH processes and batch file layouts are posted on the IFAP website at the NSLDS reference materi - als link under Processing ses a postscreening process to let you know when there are significant changes (such as a defaulted loan or an overpayment) to a student's financial aid history. If postscreening identifies changes that may affect the student's eligibility, the CPS will generate new output documents so schools that are listed for receipt of the student's FAFSA information will automatically be notified. Items that have changed since the last transaction are marked on the output document with a \"#\" sign, and the reason code for the postscreening will be given. To help you identify when NSLDS data has changed, the document will include an NSLDS transaction number in the \"FAA Information\" section with the other match flags. This is the number of the last transaction on which NSLDS data changed, so if you receive an ISIR on which that number is higher than the one on the ISIR you used to determine the student's eligibility, you must review the NSLDS data on the new ISIR to be sure there are no changes affecting the student's eligibility (be aware of the new Pell LEU limits and codes; for more on Pell LEU, see Volume 3, Chapter 3 ). There will be postscreening codes (see The ISIR Guide for the list) to help determine what changed. Unusual enrollment history (UEH) There is a flag in NSLDS for students whose pattern of enrollment and/ or award history for either Federal Pell Grants or Direct Loans (other than a Direct Consolidation Loan or Parent PLUS Loan) is identified as unusual. You are required to respond to the unusual enrollment history (UEH) status for Pell and/or Direct Loans as described below. The CPS will flag the UEH on the student's SAR/ISIR. A value of \"N\" requires no action, as it denotes no unusual history. A value of \"2\" or \"3\" in the UEH field (aka SAR comment codes 359 and 360, respectively) requires review and resolution by your school (see below). UEH flags 2 and 3 do not necessarily mean the student has improperly received Pell or Direct Loan funds, but it is a sign of unusual activity, for example, receiving Pell and/or Direct Loans at multiple schools in the same semester, or receiving aid and then withdrawing before earning any credit. To resolve a UEH flag of \"2,\" (SAR comment code 359) you must check the student's enrollment and financial aid records to determine if, during any of the four award years prior to the current award year (i.e., 2014-15, 2015- 16, 2016-17, and 2017-18), the student received a Pell Grant or Direct Loan at your school. If so, no further action is required unless you have reason to suspect that the student in question remains enrolled just long enough to col - lect student aid funds before disappearing. In such a case, you must follow the guidance below for UEH flag \"3.\" To resolve a UEH flag of \"3,\" (SAR comment code 360) you must check the student's academic records to determine if they received academic credit at the schools attended during any one of the four award years prior to the current award year (i.e., 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18). Using data from NSLDS, you must determine, for each prior attended institution for each student, whether academic credit was earned during the award year in which the student received Pell or Direct Loan funds. Academic credit is considered for this purpose to mean co mpleting one or more clock-hour or credit-hour. Unusual Jan 10, 2017 DCL GEN-15-05 DCL GEN-13-09 UEH change for Undergraduate to Graduate Student Progression E-Announcement January 20, 2016 UEH is assessed separately for under - graduate enrollment and graduate enrollment. This reduces the number of UEH flags, but still correctly flag stu - dents whom the UEH flags are intended to further scrutinize. This change eliminates the improper flagging of students whose normal course of academic progression leads directly from undergraduate to gradu - ate coursework, which does not consti - tute what the Department considers an unusual or suspicious pattern of enroll - ment. 1-61 Chapter 3\u2014NSLDS Financial Aid History FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL For UEH flag 3, if the student did earn academic credit at all of the schools previously attended for a relevant award year, no further action is required unless you have reason to believe that the student has had a practice of enrolling just long enough to receive credit balances before disappearing. In such cases, follow the guidance below for cases when academic credit is not earned (next paragraph). For UEH flag 3, when academic credit is not earned at a previously at - tended school, and, if applicable, at your school, you must obtain documen - tation from the student explaining why the student failed to earn academic credit. You must determine whether the documentation provided supports the reasons described by the student and that the student did not enroll only to receive credit balance funds. Acceptable reasons may include personal ill - ness, a family emergency, a change in where the student lives, and military obligations, or an academic complication, such as unexpected academic chal - lenges, or the student having determined that the academic program in ques - tion did not meet their needs. You should, to the maximum extent possible, obtain third party documentation to support the student's claim. In similar fashion to the exercise of professional judgment, you must determine whether the circumstances of the failure of the student to receive academic credit, as evidenced by the student's academic records and docu - mentation, support the continuation of Title IV eligibility. If the student with a UEH flag of 2 or 3 fails to provide compelling reasons and documentation for a failure to receive academic credit for a period for which they received Title IV funds, you must conclude that their eligibility is terminated. Your determination is final and is not subject to appeal to the Department . You must document and maintain a file of reason(s) for the decision for possible review. When a student's eligibility is terminated in this way, you must provide information to the student on how they may subsequently regain eligibility, and the student must be given an opportunity to question and appeal the de - cision to your school , consistent with the opportunities to question and ap - peal similar determinations such as SAP and professional judgment determi - nations. Since the basis for denial is lack of academic performance, successful completion of academic credit may be considered basis for renewing the student's Title IV eligibility, assuming they are in all other ways eligible for the aid in question. This could include meeting the requirements of the plan that you established with the student, although such a plan is not necessarily required. When a student regains eligibility after losing it in this manner, the student's eligibility is retroactive to the beginning of the current period of en - rollment, for Direct Loans, and for all other types of Title IV aid, retroactive to the beginning of the current payment period. If you approve the student's continuing eligibility , you may choose to require the student to establish an academic plan, similar to the type of plan used to resolve SAP appeals. You may also wish to counsel the student about the Pell Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) limitation and the impact of the student's attendance pattern on future Pell Grant eligibility (see Volume 3, Chapter 3 and DCL GEN-12-01 and GEN-12-18). Resolving UEH flags in a subsequent Award Y ear When a student receives a UEH flag that includes an award year(s) that was resolved by the reviewing school for a previous award year, that school must determine if there was a change in the schools the student attended for that award year(s). If there were no changes to the schools the student attended, no further action is necessary. If the student attended another school(s) that was not previously reviewed and received Pell Grant and/or Direct Loans at that school(s), the reviewing school must determine if the student earned academic credit at the additional school(s) under review. If the student did not earn academic credit at the additional school(s) under review, the student must provide documentation explaining why academic credit was not earned.1-62 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Documenting credits earned when a school has closed For UEH flag 3, or when you believe that the student remains enrolled just long enough to collect a credit balance (refund), you must review the student's academic records to determine if the student earned any academic credit at each school the student attended during the prior four award year periods (i.e., for 2018-19, assess 2017-18, 2016-17, 2015-16, and 2014-15. If the student informs you that they previously attended and received Title IV aid at a school which has closed, you must first verify that the school has closed. You may determine this using the Department's Closed School Reports, at: www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/PEPS/closedschools.html . If the student states that academic credits were earned at the closed school, you must request documentation that indicates academic credits were earned. Acceptable forms of documentation could include a grade report, or an official or unofficial transcript. If the student does not have any documentation of academic credit earned at the closed school, and you have obtained documentation that shows the student earned academic credit at all the other schools correspond - ing with the UEH flag, you may accept a signed and dated statement from the student to substantiate their claim. The statement must provide the name of the closed school, the academic period or calendar year in which the aca - demic credit was earned, and, if known, the type and number of academic credits which were earned. If the student is unsure of the number and/or type of academic credits earned at the closed school, the student must state, in general terms, that academic credit was earned at the closed school. If the student has not earned academic credits at the closed school, you must follow the guidance in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-15-05. Reporting data for students at closed schools E-Announcement Sept 21, 20161-63 Chapter 3\u2014NSLDS Financial Aid History FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Transfer student monitoring Dear Partner Letters GEN-00-12 and GEN-01-09 Through this process for checking the eligibility of transfer students, you may either check the student's financial aid history on the NSLDS website for professionals, or wait seven days (because NSLDS issues alerts weekly) after you've submitted the student's information for monitoring to receive an alert if data has changed. NSLDSFAP www.nsldsfap.ed.govSending batch files To begin sending batch files, you must sign up at https://fsawebenroll.ed.gov/ PMEnroll/index.jsp for the Transfer Stu - dent Monitoring/Financial Aid History (TSM/FAH) batch service. Then you must designate a profile for your school on the School Transfer Profile Page (www.nsldsfap.ed.gov ) prior to creating any Inform records. The School Transfer Profile tells NSLDS who will be submit - ting Inform files from or on behalf of your school and how your school wants to receive an alert notice.CHECKING THE FINANCIAL AID HISTORY FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Before disbursing FSA funds to a transfer student, you must obtain his financial aid history if he may have received aid at another school since your latest ISIR. The NSLDS Transfer Student Monitoring Process was established to allow schools to use NSLDS information for its transfer students. Reviewing the student's NSLDS financial aid history. If a student transfers to your school during the award year, you'll need to review her aid history on the ISIR or online at the NSLDS website. From this, you can determine: Whether the student is in default or owes an overpayment on an FSA loan or grant; The student's Pell Grant and the amount already disbursed for the award year; Data pertaining to TEACH grants, including those converted to loans; The student's balance on all FSA loans; and The amount and period of enrollment for all FSA loans for the award year. Usually the financial aid history on the ISIR will be enough, but there are cases where you might check NSLDS for more information. For example, if the student has more than six loans, the ISIR won't have detailed information for some of the loans. If you need that level of detail for those loans, you can get the information from NSLDS. Or, as discussed previously, you might need to use NSLDS to resolve a partial match situation (see \"Partial match\" in \"NSLDS match\" section, earlier in this chapter). Transfer student monitoring process. You must send NSLDS identifying information for students transferring to your school during the award year so that NSLDS can notify you of changes to their financial aid history. You may send information for students who have expressed an interest in attending your school even if they have not yet formally applied for admission. Through transfer student monitoring, NSLDS will alert you to any relevant changes in the transfer student's financial aid history\u2014other than the default and overpayment information reported in the postscreening process\u2014that may affect the student's current award(s). There are three steps: inform, monitor, and alert. Inform . Y ou must identify students who are transferring to your school by creating a list of transfer students on the NSLDS website or by sending the list to NSLDS as an electronic batch file (see the mar - gin note) through SAIG. Y ou may use either or both methods, and a change in method does not require prior notification to the Customer Service Center.Resolving grant overpayments Because FSA grants have priority in packaging, aid overpayments can often be resolved by adjusting other types of aid in the package. If necessary, you can also adjust later grant payments for the same award year. But if a student receives more grant money than she is eligible for and the excess can't be offset, she must return the overpay - ment. As noted at the beginning of the chapter, a student with an outstanding FSA grant overpayment is ineligible for aid until she repays it or makes satisfac - tory repayment arrangements. See Volume 4 for a complete discussion of resolving overpayments and over - awards.1-64 NSLDS Professional Access offers a Transfer Monitoring Repopulate web page that enables you to repopulate your TSM list of students from the In - form list used during a prior monitoring period so you can continuously add from one monitoring time period to an - other. For more information see NSLDS Newsletter 23. Monitor . NSLDS will monitor these students for a change in financial aid history that may affect their current awards and alert you when: a new loan or grant is being awarded, a new disbursement is made on a loan or grant, or a loan or grant (or a single disbursement) is can - celled. Note that defaulted loans and overpayment information are not monitored in transfer student monitoring, as they are already cov - ered in the postscreening process. If the student has not listed your school in Step Six when filing the FAFSA, he has to add your school for you to receive the postscreening information. Alert . Finally, if changes are detected for one or more of your students and NSLDS creates an alert, it will also send an email notification reminder to the address given on the School Transfer Profile setup page. Y our school's designated contact person may then either review the alert list on the NSLDS for Financial Aid Professionals website or download a batch file, if batch alerts were requested, through SAIG in report or extract format. Timing of the disbursement. To pay the student, you'll need to have an output document and an accurate Expected Family Contribution (EFC). A valid ISIR will include that and the student's financial aid history, and it will also tell you if he is in default or owes an overpayment. The postscreening process will send you another ISIR if he subsequently goes into or out of default or owes or ceases to owe an overpayment. When you initiate transfer monitoring for a student, NSLDS will alert you to significant award changes since you last received an ISIR or alert for her; this will continue for 30 to 120 days (depending on the monitoring duration you've established) after the enrollment begin date. If you start transfer monitoring before you receive ISIRs for a student, NSLDS will track changes in her financial aid history from the date of your request or a future monitoring begin date you choose. The regulations state that a school may not make a disbursement to the student for seven days following the transfer monitoring request to NSLDS, unless it receives an earlier response from NSLDS or checks the student's current financial aid history by accessing NSLDS directly. Therefore, it's usually a good idea to submit the student's name to NSLDS for monitoring as soon as possible, even if he has not yet decided to enroll at your school. Consequences when a transfer student subsequently is found to be ineligible for all or part of an aid disbursement. If the school has followed the proper procedures for obtaining financial aid history information from NSLDS, it is not liable for any overpayments if the student's situation subsequently changes. However, the student will be liable for the overpayment in this situation, and you may not pay the student further FSA funds until the overpayment is resolved. (See Volume 4 for information on resolving overpayments.)No defense of infancy Students who are minors may receive federal student loans, and they may not refuse to repay those loans based on a \"defense of infancy,\" i.e., that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note. See HEA Sec. 484A(b)(2). Perkins writeoffs Note that Perkins writeoffs don't make a student ineligible. See Volume 6 for more information.Checking Discharge Status with loan servicer When it is not possible to determine the precise status of a potentially dis - charged loan in NSLDS, you should con - tact the Department's \"DDP,\" or Disability Discharge Provider.1-65 Chapter History FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Total and permanent disability The condition of an individual who: is unable to engage in substan - tial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be ex - pected to result in death; has lasted for a continuous period of at least 60 months; or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 60 months; OR has been determined by the De - partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to be unemployable due to a service- connected disability.Total and permanent disability www.disabilitydischarge.com/faqs/ 34 CFR 686.42(b) (TEACH Grant)EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY OR DISABILITY DISCHARGE A student who has filed for bankruptcy or had a loan discharged for disability may need to give additional documentation before receiving aid. Bankruptcy A student with an FSA loan or grant overpayment that has been discharged in bankruptcy remains eligible for FSA loans, grants, and work- study (NSLDS loan status code BC for loans that did not default and status code DK or OD for loans that defaulted prior to the bankruptcy discharge). A borrower doesn't have to reaffirm a loan discharged in bankruptcy to be eligible. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 prohibits denial of aid based solely on filing for, or having a debt discharged in, bankruptcy. A borrower who lists a defaulted FSA loan or grant overpayment in an active bankruptcy claim is not eligible for further FSA funds unless she provides you with documentation from the holder of the debt stating it is dischargeable (NSLDS loan status code DO). A borrower who includes a non-defaulted FSA loan in an active bankruptcy claim, so that collection on the loan is stayed, is eligible for aid as long as he has no loans in default (including the stayed loan). Total and permanent disability (TPD) discharges Qualifying for TPD Discharge: Perkins Loans, FFEL and Direct Loans, as well as TEACH Grant service obligations may qualify to be discharged if the borrower/obligation holder becomes totally and permanently disabled. Except for veterans who qualify for a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge based on a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that they are unemployable due to a service-connected disability, the Department of Education monitors the status of borrowers who have received a TPD discharge for a three-year period. Borrowers whose discharge applications are received on or after July 1, 2010, receive a final discharge followed by a post-discharge monitoring period that begins on the date the discharge was granted and lasts for up to three years. Taking out another loan: If a borrower whose prior loan was dis - charged due to a total and permanent disability wishes to take out another FSA loan or wishes to receive a TEACH grant, he must obtain a physician's certification (the student only needs to obtain the physician certification once; the school keeps a copy of it in the student's file. But the school must collect a new borrower acknowledgment from the student each time he receives a new loan) that he has the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, and he must sign a borrower statement acknowledging that the new FSA loan or the TEACH grant service obligation can't later be discharged for any present impairment unless it deteriorates so that he is again totally and permanently disabled.1-66 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL If the borrower requests a new loan or TEACH Grant during the post- discharge monitoring period, he must also resume payment on the old loan before receipt of the new loan or TEACH grant. If the loan on which the borrower must resume payment was in default when it was discharged, it remains in default upon reinstatement, and the student must make satisfactory repayment arrangements before receiving the new loan, in addition to meeting the other requirements described. A borrower who received a TPD discharge based on a determination from the VA that he is unemployable due to a service-connected disability is not subject to a monitoring period and is not required to resume payment on the discharged loan as a condition for receiving a new loan. But he must still provide the physician's certification and borrower acknowledgement described above. RESOLVING DEFAULT STATUS A student in default on an FSA loan can't receive further FSA funds until she resolves the default, which she can do in a few ways. Repayment in full (including consolidation). A student can resolve a default and regain eligibility for FSA funds by repaying the loan in full (loan status code DP). If the school writes off a regulatorily permissible amount that the student repays (for Perkins), that counts as paying the loan in full (code DC). If a defaulted loan is successfully consolidated, it is also counted as paid in full (code DN). However, if the loan holder just writes off the entire loan (except for Perkins), it isn't paid in full, and the student remains ineligible for FSA funds (code DW). The student regains eligibility whether repayment was completed voluntarily or involuntarily (that is, through IRS offset or wage garnishment). For the Perkins Loan program, while a student who has repaid her defaulted loan in full is eligible for aid if the repayment was voluntary, you can still consider the default to be evidence of a student's unwillingness to repay loans. If the repayment was involuntary, you should consider the default as such evidence and deny the student additional Perkins Loans. If a student has paid a defaulted loan in full but the SAR and ISIR have a comment showing that he is ineligible because of the default, he must give you documentation proving that the loan was paid. Satisfactory repayment arrangements. A student in default on an FSA loan can be eligible for FSA funds if he has made repayment arrangements that are satisfactory to the loan holder. After he makes six consecutive, full, voluntary payments on time, he regains eligibility for FSA funds (loan status code DX). Voluntary payments are those made directly by the borrower and do not include payments obtained by federal offset, garnishment, or income or asset execution. A student may regain eligibility under this option only one time.Substantial gainful activity For TIV aid purposes, the phrase \"sub - stantial gainful activity\" means a level of work performed for pay that involves doing significant physical or mental activities or a combination of both. If a physician's certification does not appear to support this status, the school should contact the physician for clarification. Example: documenting loan \"paid in full\" Carl had a Direct Loan as an undergraduate that went into default while he was out of school. When he applies for financial aid so he can go to graduate school, his ISIR shows that the loan is still in default. Carl tells the aid administrator at Guerrero University that he paid off the loan last year. The aid administrator asks Carl to bring in a letter from the Default Resolution Group documenting that the loan has been paid and advises Carl that he should ask the guaranty agency to update his status in NSLDS.1-67 Chapter 3\u2014NSLDS Financial Aid History FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Satisfactory repayment and rehabilitation HEA Sec. 428F(a) and (b), 464(h)(1) and (2) can pay the student as soon as you have documentation that she has made satisfactory repayment arrangements. For example, the loan holder may update the code for the loan in NSLDS to DX once six payments have been made; you could then use that as confirmation of the repayment arrangement. You may also use a written statement from the loan holder indicating that the student has made satisfactory repayment arrangements as documentation of the arrangement. Loan rehabilitation. Although a student can regain eligibility for all FSA funds by making satisfactory repayment arrangements, the loan is still in default. After the student makes more payments, the loan may be rehabilitated, that is, it won't be in default anymore, and the student will have all the normal loan benefits, such as deferments. A loan is rehabilitated once the borrower makes nine full, voluntary payments on time (no later than 20 days after the due date) within 10 consecutive months. See Volume 6 for more information on rehabilitation in the e/NDSL program.1-68 SARs & ISIRs Code Status Eligible for FSA funds AL Abandoned Loan Yes BC No Prior Default Bankruptcy Claim, Discharged Yes, because loan was not in default and was discharged BK No Prior Default Bankruptcy Claim, Active Yes, because loan was not in default CA Cancelled (For Perkins means Loan Reversal) Yes CS Closed School Discharge Yes DA Deferred Yes DB Defaulted, then Bankrupt, Active.

The CPS verifies that the name and birth date associated with the SSN match the name and birth date on the application. For the full list of SSN match results, see 2018-2019 SAR Comment Codes and Text (www.ifap.ed.gov ). The CPS won't process an application without an SSN. A student who doesn't have an SSN or doesn't remember it must contact their local Social Security office for help. There is one exception to the requirement to provide SSNs (see the Exception for the Freely Associated States section later in this chapter). The SSN is a key identifier for the student's records, so you must be sure the Department knows the right SSN if you find out it's wrong on the application or output document. We discuss correcting such errors later. SSN MATCH The CPS prints the SSN match result in the \"FAA Information\" section of the output document as the SSN Match Flag. If the match is successful, the CPS doesn't match the student's data against the Social Security database on subsequent transactions. However, the CPS will attempt the match again if the student makes corrections to the name, birth date, or SSN. The FAFSA will not be processed without a valid SSN for the aid applicant. Successful match If the CPS match with the SSA confirms the student's SSN and the So - cial Security records have the same name and birth date as reported on the FAFSA, you may disburse aid to the otherwise eligible student. No com - ment is provided on the output document when the SSN match is success - ful. Of course, if you have any conflicting information about the SSN, you must resolve the conflict before disbursing FSA funds to the student. Once a student's SSN is confirmed and there is no discrepancy on the name or birth date, the student can't change the SSN. Social Security Number To be eligible to receive FSA funds, each student must provide a correct Social Security number (SSN). To confirm the student's SSN for schools, the Department conducts a match with the Social Security Administration. In this chapter, we discuss the SSN requirement and the match process. SSN requirement HEA Sec. 484(p) Student Assistance General Provisions 34 CFR 668.32(i), 668.36 Contacting the SSA For more information (in English and Spanish), students should call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 or go to its website (www.ssa.gov ). Name change on the SSA website If a student legally changes their name because of marriage, divorce, court order or any other reason, they should notify Social Security so they can get a corrected card and have correct SSN matches. Direct students May 2018 If a student whose match data have been confirmed subsequently tries to change his SSN, the CPS won't accept the change. Instead, the student's SAR will have a comment telling the student to contact his financial aid admin - istrator for help. In the unlikely event that the confirmed SSN is wrong, the student must correct it by filing a new FAFSA. No match on the Social Security number You must resolve any problems with the match before disbursing aid. If the SSN is not found in the SSA database, the student's application will be rejected. The student will also receive a comment that instructs her to correct her SSN or contact the SSA if she believes the number reported is correct. If it is wrong on the application, the student will have to correct it with the CPS and get a successful match result before she can receive aid. Student reported wrong SSN on the FAFSA. If the student's applica - tion is rejected because she reported an SSN that is not in the SSA's database, the student must provide the correct SSN to the CPS. This will change the current SSN in the CPS, but it will not change the original, identifying SSN. A student can file a new FAFSA to correct the original SSN, but since the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System will use the current SSN to process records, changing the original SSN is not always necessary (however, see Applicants Using Same SSN later in this chapter). COD replaced the Direct Loan and Pell reporting systems, but there are other systems, such as EDExpress and some mainframe and servicer systems, that will still use the original SSN to identify records. These systems will be able to interface with COD but might still need the original SSN to process records. FAFSA data entry error. If a student provided the correct SSN on the FAFSA, but the SSN on the output document is wrong, the student can contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1- 800-433-3243). If the Information Center confirms that there was a data en - try error, it will refer the error to the Department for correction\u2014the student does not need to submit a correction. After the data entry error is corrected, the CPS will produce new output documents. See Chapter 5 of the Applica - tion and Verification Guide for general information on data entry error cor - rections. Error in Social Security database. If the SSN on the FAFSA is correct but isn't in the Social Security database, the student must contact a local or regional SSA office to correct the database, which is updated daily with infor - mation from local and regional offices. The student must report the correct SSN and provide verifying documentation. He must also contact a Social Security office directly\u2014the Department of Education cannot correct SSA re - cords. Once the database is updated, the student can submit a correction by re-entering the SSN originally reported as if it is a correction. The CPS will then do another SSN match. The student can't simply verify that the SSN is correct; the application will be rejected until the SSA database is updated.COD and SSN changes June 22, 2017 E-AnnouncementSSN doesn't match Student reported wrong SSN Correct FAFSA data FAFSA processing error Call 1-800-4-FED-AID Error in SSA database Contact SSA office; resubmit SSN as correction after SSA change is made Other match problems SSN matches, but name and date of birth don't match Missing FAFSA information: student didn't report a name or birth date, or didn't sign the FAFSA SSN record includes date of death Parents with no SSN On the FAFSA, parents with no Social Security Numbers, for example, eligible noncitizen parents, should enter 000- 00-0000 in place of a SSN, in order to avoid a reject code. NEW1-73 Chapter 4\u2014Social Security NumberDCL Glossary-Acronyms CFR FSA HB May 2018 No match on name or birth date The student's application will be rejected if her or a parent's SSN is in the Social Security database but the name there differs from the one she gave. Misspellings or name changes due to marriage are common reasons for a non-match. The student should make sure that the name on the application matches the one on the Social Security card. This reject is verifiable, which means that the name is questionable but not necessarily wrong. The student can eliminate the reject by entering the right name. If the name was correct on the application, she reenters it on the paper SAR, or she chooses \"Data is Correct\" for both the first and last name on Corrections on the Web. If her name is incorrect in the SSA database, we strongly recommend that she contact the SSA to correct it. If the student's (or parent's) name and SSN match the SSA's database but the date of birth does not, the application will also be rejected, and the student must correct the application. If the error is with the SSA's database, he should contact the SSA to correct the record. He can override the reject by reentering the date on the paper SAR or on Corrections on the Web, by choosing \"Data is Correct\" for the date of birth. The application will be sent through the match again, and if the SSA's record has been corrected, the match flag will be cleared and no further action is needed. If there is still a disagreement with the SSA record, the student will need to provide the aid office with documentation of his date of birth. If the student reported the current or a later year as her birth date, her application will be rejected and she must correct the error. Missing information No match is performed if the student doesn't sign the FAFSA or provide a last name or birth date. The student's FAFSA will be rejected and the stu - dent must submit the missing information. Although the CPS doesn't conduct the match, the student will receive a comment explaining that the match could not be conducted without the name, birth date, or signature. The student must submit a correction provid - ing the missing information. When the correction is sent, the information will be sent to the SSA for matching, and you should check the new output document for match results. Date of death If the SSA's database shows a date of death associated with the SSN the student reported, the student's application will be rejected. Students resolve this problem in the same way as problems matching the SSN. The student must either contact SSA to get the records corrected, or must submit a change with the correct SSN (see \"No match on the Social Security number\").Example: Incorrect name on application When Zobrist Technical Institute receives Miguel's ISIR, the SSN match shows the name on the application isn't the one associated with the SSN in the database. The aid administrator asks Miguel to bring in documentation showing his correct name and SSN. He brings in his Social Security card, and the first name on the card is Jose, not Miguel. He also has a driver's license showing his first name is Jose. The administrator tells Miguel to correct his name on the FAFSA to Jose. Example: Correct name not in database Elizabeth's ISIR shows that her name doesn't match the one the SSA has on file for her SSN. When the administrator talks to Elizabeth, she explains that she recently got married and changed her last name. Elizabeth gives the administrator a copy of her marriage certificate. The administrator plans to disburse aid to Elizabeth and tells her to reenter her current name and advises her to contact SSA to have its database updated to prevent future problems.1-74 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19DCL Glossary-Acronyms CFR FSA HB May 2018 DEATH MASTER FILE The CPS will verify that student SSNs do not appear on a master death file the Department obtains from the SSA. This will be in addition to the date of death match. The CPS will regularly compare its records with those in the master death file. If a match is found, the CPS will resend the student record to SSA. If the SSA does not confirm a date of death for the applicant, the CPS will do nothing further. If the SSA does confirm a date of death, the CPS will send an ISIR to the schools listed on that transaction but will not send a SAR to the student. Also, the CPS will disable PINs and will not generate renewal applica - tions for individuals found in the death file. Their record will not be deleted from the CPS database. If an applicant wrongly appears in the death file, he will need to apply for a PIN again and receive a clean match before a new PIN will be issued. APPLICANTS USING SAME SSN When one student uses another's SSN, the duplicate SSN flag will be set in the ISIR, and the student's application will likely fail the SSN match, but it will be processed. She will have to make a correction as described earlier in this chapter. If a student uses the same SSN and first two letters of the last name (to - gether these data are the record identifier) as another student, the CPS will not accept her application because it will assume it to be a duplicate applica - tion of the first student. If she is using FAFSA on the Web, she will receive an immediate message telling her the proper way to make a correction, or if her record identifier is correct and she is trying to apply for aid, how she can proceed. If she is submitting a paper FAFSA, she will receive a letter giving her the same information and stating that the application was not processed. If the student using the correct SSN applied after the other student, she must submit a special \"correction application\" that she can only get from the Department of Education. It will enable the CPS to accept her data instead of treating her application as a duplicate. The first student, who used the wrong SSN, must correct the error by filing a new FAFSA because the CPS uses the record identifier for students for the entire award year, even if they later change their SSN or last name. If the student simply corrected her SSN, her record identifier would still be wrong. If the student using the correct SSN applied first, the CPS will have her data, so a correction application isn't necessary. The second student will need to submit a new application.Example: Students using same SSN Hector completes an application in January, but uses his brother Aroldis's SSN instead of his own. When Hector gets his SAR, he realizes that he used the wrong SSN, corrects the SAR, and mails it back to the processor. He gets a new SAR with the correct SSN, but it has the same identifier as the first SAR. Aroldis files an application in April and is surprised to receive a SAR that doesn't match what was on his application because it has Hector's information instead. Aroldis goes to the financial aid office at Guerrero University, where a counselor tells him he'll need to file a correction application. Hector is also attending Guerrero, so the counselor contacts Hector to explain why he'll need to file a new application even though he already has a SAR with the correct information.When a student dies For full discussion of how to handle Title IV aid when a student dies, see the FSA Handbook appendix FSA HB May 2018 Both students should keep copies of all output documents, including those from the first FAFSAs filed. When a student files a correction applica - tion or a new FAFSA, the application receipt date is changed. Because some schools and agencies use this receipt date to determine if the student met a deadline, she should keep the output documents to show the original receipt date and to show why a later application was necessary. Contact the Department at 1 (800)-433-3243 if you believe that a correc - tion application may be needed; one can be mailed to your office or to the student. EXCEPTION FOR THE FREELY ASSOCIATED STATES: MICRONESIA, MARSHALL ISLANDS, AND PALAU Persons from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau (the Freely Associated States) typi - cally do not have SSNs. First-time FAFSA filers who indicate on the FAFSA that their state of legal residence is one of the above Pacific island groups should enter \"666\" for the first three digits of their SSN, and the CPS will as - sign them an identification number. They should use this number in place of the SSN throughout their financial aid years. For returning FAFSA filers from one of the Freely Associated States, any FAFSAs must be submitted under the same nine-digit pseudo-SSN assigned originally by the CPS when the earlier award year was processed. Returning filers and FAAs should not provide only the first three digits of the pseudo- SSN, as this will result in the inappropriate creation of an entirely new SSN. We strongly encourage you to follow this guidance when submitting ap - plication data through the FAA Access to CPS Online website, and to share this guidance with Pacific Island applicants who used a pseudo-SSN in prior years and plan to submit another FAFSA (either online or paper). For more information on eligibility for students from the Freely Associated States, see chapter 2 of this volume.NEW Pseudo-SSNs for Pacific Islanders and the FAFSA June 22, 2017 Electronic Announce REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT Males (any person assigned the sex of male at birth) aged 18-25 are required to register with the Selective Service System (SSS). This requirement covers males residing in the United States who are U.S. citizens or noncitizens, except that a male who is in the U.S. as a lawful nonimmigrant isn't required to register as long as he maintains that status (see the exceptions to the registration requirement under \"Exemptions\" below). Students who are required to register with the Selective Service must do so to be eligible for FSA funds, but parents who want to borrow a PLUS loan aren't required to have registered. The student has several ways to register, which include using the FAFSA; there is a question that asks if the student wants Selective Service to register him. If he indicates that he wants to be registered, we will submit his registration information to the Selective Service. If he doesn't answer this question, he can do so later on the student aid report (SAR) and submit the correction (the answer to the question \"Are you male?\" must be answered \"yes\"). The student may also register online at the Selective Service website (www.sss.gov ) or by filling out a form available at the post office. Generally, a male student who is 18-25 and who has not registered previously may register using the FAFSA or SAR. Students who have questions about Selective Service registration may contact the Selective Service at 1-(847)-688-6888 or on the www.sss.gov website. EXEMPTIONS Males exempted from the requirement to register include: Males currently in the armed services and on active duty (this exception does not apply to members of the Reserve and National Guard who are not on active duty); Males who are not yet 18 at the time that they complete their applications (an update is not required during the year, even if a student turns 18 after completing the application);Selective Service Any male required to register with Selective Service at any time must have done so to receive federal student aid. The Central Processing System (CPS) performs a match with Selective Service to confirm a student's registration status. In this chapter we discuss that match and the registration requirement. Selective Service requirement General Provisions 34 CFR 668.32(j), 668.37 PLUS exemption 682.201(b)(1)(v) Age and registration The student can be registered with Se - lective Service as early as 30 days before his 18th birthday. If the student is too young, Selective Service will hold the registration until the student is within 30 days of his 18th birthday. Students 26 and older can't be registered. Gender and registration Only persons assigned the sex of male at birth are required to register. If a student's gender identity is now female but she was assigned the sex of male at birth, the student must register with the SSS, unless one of the exemptions described in this chapter apply, regard - less of subsequent sexual reassignment surgery or any other gender transition process. If a student's gender identity is now male but he was assigned the sex of female at birth, the student is not re - quired to register with the SSS, regard - less of subsequent sexual reassignment surgery or any other gender transition process. 1-78 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 Males born before 1960; Citizens of the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or the Federated States of Micronesia*; Noncitizens who first entered the U.S. after they turned 26; Noncitizens who entered the U.S. as lawful nonimmigrants on a valid visa and remained in the U.S. on the terms of that visa until after they turned 26. Transgender males who were assigned the sex of female at birth. There are certain less common situations in which registration isn't necessary. Students who weren't required to register prior to meeting one of these criteria and who meet a criterion for the entire time through the age of 25 qualify for the waiver if: They are unable to register due to being hospitalized, incarcerated, or institutionalized; They are enrolled in any officer procurement program at The Citadel, North Georgia College and State University, Norwich University, Virginia Military Institute, Texas A&M University, or Virginia Polytechnic and State University; or They are commissioned Public Health Service officers on active duty or members of the Reserve of the Public Health Service on specified active duty. If the student is clearly not required to register, you must document this, but do not have him request a status information letter from the Selective Service. You should only ask the student to provide such a letter to document an exemption from the requirement to register if it is not clear that he is exempt. For example, noncitizens who first enter the U.S. after the age of 26 aren't required to register. Only those immigrant males who enter and live in the U.S. at ages 18-25 are required to be registered. If a male immigrant can show proof that he first entered the U.S. when he was past registration age, he is clearly not required to be registered, and no status information letter is needed. The student's entry documentation is enough to show whether he was required to register. Documentation for exempt noncitizens includes: proof of birth date on a passport, birth certificate, or U.S. driver's license or state ID; proof of immigration date into the U.S. from an entry date stamp on the I-94 form or in the passport, or a letter from the USCIS indicating the entry date; and, for those here on a valid visa who are at least 18 and less than 26 years old, a student visa form (I-20) or other valid U.S. passport visa stamp on a foreign passport with expiration date (the dates must be from entry until after the male turned 26).Exemptions 34 CFR 668.37(a)(2) Exemption examples Jorge has been on active duty in the Army from the time he was 18 and didn't register with Selective Service before he joined the Army. He's now 24, is planning to leave the Army, and wants to receive financial aid. If he applies while he's still on active duty, he doesn't need to be registered with Selective Service. Once he leaves, he must be registered, or else he won't be able to receive aid in later years. In most cases, when someone completes an enlistment contract, he is automatically registered, so Jorge is probably already registered even though he didn't complete a separate registration form. Kyle was enrolled in an officer procurement program at the Virginia Military Institute, which he started a month before he turned 18. When he was 22, he had a serious accident and was hospitalized; he officially dropped out of school a month after he was hospitalized. Due to his injuries, he was hospitalized for four years. Because he qualified for a waiver for the entire time he was 18-25, he was not required to register with Selective Service. *A citizen or national of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia who lives in the United States for more than one year for any reason except as a student or employee of the government of his homeland must reg - ister.1-79 Chapter 5\u2014Selective Service FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL SELECTIVE SERVICE MATCH The CPS performs a match with the SSS to determine if relevant students are registered. The output document displays the match result in the FAA Information section, as well as a comment about the result. Successful matches If the match shows that the student is registered or exempt, a comment confirming this fact will be on the student's output document. The student is then eligible for aid. The student is also eligible for aid if the match shows that the student is still too young to register. If the student asks to be registered, Selective Service will hold onto that registration request until 30 days before the student's 18th birthday and will then register the student. Finally, the student is also eligible if the CPS successfully forwards the student's name to Selective Service for registration. Unsuccessful matches If the match doesn't confirm the student's registration or the student can't be registered, the output document will have a comment about the problem. A \"C\" code will also be printed next to the student's EFC. Until the student resolves the registration problem, you can't pay FSA funds to the student or certify or originate a loan. Registration not confirmed. If the match shows that the student isn't registered, he must either register or provide evidence that he is registered or is exempt from registration. His Selective Service Registration Acknowledgement or letter of registration shows that he is registered. You can also go to the Selective Service System web page at www.sss.gov and check on the student's status\u2014a printout of the web page is acceptable documentation that the student is registered. If he doesn't have an acknowledgement or letter of registration and the web page doesn't confirm his registration, he'll have to contact Selective Service to resolve the problem. If the conflict is resolved in his favor, he'll receive a letter from the Selective Service documenting that he is registered or is exempt from registering. Unsuccessful registration. The CPS won't be able to forward the student for registration if certain information\u2014first and last name and date of birth\u2014is missing. The student should submit a correction with the required information, and you can check the match results from this correction to see if the student is eligible. If the student is 26 or older, the CPS cannot register the student but will send his record through the data match. If the student is not registered, he can no longer do so, but may qualify for a status information letter from the SSS. You will have to determine if he is eligible for aid despite failing to register.Status information letter codes The Selective Service has different status information letters, which are indicated by a code that appears in the lower left-hand corner. Determination of aid eligibility for a male who failed to register with Selective Service should not be based solely on these letter codes. Financial aid administrators are obliged to review all evidence presented by a student to determine if he has shown \"by a preponderance of evidence\" that his failure to register was neither willful nor knowing. The codes are: E1-E8: These codes indicate that the student was not required to register or was exempt the entire time he could have registered (ages 18-25). NM: The student did not register although he was on active duty in the armed forces only for a portion of the time when he could have registered (between ages 18-25) and was, therefore, required to register. NR: The student was born before 1960 and is therefore not required to register. RD: The student gave a reason for not registering or documentation to show he was exempt from the requirement, but the Selective Service determined the reason or documentation to be invalid. Therefore, the student was required to register but did not. No requests to comply with the registration requirement were sent. RH: The student was sent one or more letters requesting that he register during the required period, but all letters were returned by the post office as undeliverable. RL: The student was required to register, but the Selective Service has no record of his registration, and their records show he was sent one or more letters requesting that he register. RR: The student said he attempted to register, but Selective Service has no proof of the attempt. Out of concern for privacy, the SSS only displays the last four digits of the Social Security number on correspondence.1-80 CFR DCL FAILURE TO REGISTER Some students have been denied aid because they failed to register with the Selective Service before their 26th birthday. The Selective Service will register only males aged 18-25, leaving older students with no way to rem - edy their situation if they failed to register. However, the student may still be eligible to receive aid if he can demonstrate that he did not knowingly and willfully fail to register. A student who served on active duty in the armed forces but who did not register before turning 26 is still eligible to receive FSA funds because it's reasonable to conclude that he was not trying to avoid registering for the Selective Service. Ask the student to provide a copy of his DD Form 214, \"Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,\" showing military service in the armed forces\u2014other than the reserve forces, the Delayed Entry pool, and the National Guard. Students without military service who knew of the registration requirement but chose not to register are considered to have knowingly and willfully failed to register and are therefore ineligible for FSA funds. Your school's decision in this case is final and cannot be appealed to the Department except as noted in the \"Appeals\" sidebar in this chapter. Determining if non-registration was knowing and willful Unless you can document that the student meets one of the registration exemptions or that he served on active duty in the armed forces (with a character of service other than dishonorable), he must write to the Selective Service to get a status information letter addressing his failure to register. He may also download a request form from www.sss.gov to print out, complete, and mail. The student should provide as complete a description about his situation as possible: where he was living during the period when he should have registered, whether he was incarcerated or institutionalized, his citizenship status during the period, if applicable, and so on. If the student receives a \"general exemption letter\" (codes E1-E8) or a \"DOB before 1960\" letter (code NR), he is exempt from registration and may receive FSA funds. If he receives any other type of letter, you must determine based on all relevant evidence whether he knowingly and willfully failed to register. The letter from Selective Service may provide information that is crucial to your decision. For example, if the student received a letter indicating a compliance letter had been sent (code RL), this would be a negative factor when you make the determination. If the student received a \"Military Service: Noncontinuous\" letter (code NM), you might reasonably determine that the student did not knowingly and willfully avoid registration.Unsuccessful registration example On his FAFSA, Andre asks the CPS to forward his information to the Selective Service for registration. However, he's over 26, so the Selective Service can't register him. His output document comes back with a blank match flag and comment 33. Andre didn't enter the U.S. until after his 26th birthday, so he doesn't have to be registered. Guerrero University already has information about his citizenship status, including the date he arrived in the U.S., so it has documentation that he is exempt from registration. The aid administrator explains to Andre why he wasn't required to register.Failure to register 34 CFR 668.37(d), (e) Veteran status match See the Application and Verification Guide for information on the veteran match and dependency status.1-81 Chapter 5\u2014Selective Service FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Most of the status information letters state that the final decision regarding the student's eligibility rests with the agency awarding funds. For the purposes of the FSA Programs, the decision is made by your school, which represents the Department of Education. If you determine that the student's failure to register was knowing and willful, the student loses FSA eligibility. When deciding whether the student had knowingly and willfully failed to register, you should consider the following factors: Where the student lived when he was aged 18-25. For example, if a student was living abroad, it is more plausible that he would not come into contact with the requirement for registration. Whether the student claims that he thought he was registered. Mistakes in recordkeeping can occur. Correspondence indicating an attempt to register could form a basis for determining that the student did not knowingly and willfully fail to register. On the other hand, a letter from Selective Service stating that it received no response to correspondence sent to the student at a correct address would be a negative factor. Why the student claims he was not aware of the widely publicized requirement to register when he was aged 18-25.Appeals The school's decision is final and cannot be appealed to the Department except in one limited instance. The regulations state that the Department will hear ap - peals from students who have provided their schools with proof that they are in compliance (i.e., that they are registered or exempt from registration) but who are still being denied federal student aid based on the registration requirement. 34 CFR 668.37(f)Exception if SSS does not re - spond in 30 days As of this writing, the Selective Service System does not have a delay in responding to requests for status information letters. However, you may award aid while waiting for the letter from the SSS if their response time is longer than 30 days and if you have no evidence that a student intentionally failed to register. If the SSS response or other subsequent information causes you to conclude the student did knowingly and willfully fail to register, then he becomes ineligible for federal student aid and he, not your school, is responsible for returning the aid he received.1-82 Vol. PELL GRANTS In general, a student must be enrolled in an undergraduate course of study at a non-foreign institution to receive a Pell Grant, though there are teach - ing certification exceptions (see the next page). A student who has earned a baccalaureate degree or a first professional degree cannot receive a Pell Grant. A student who completes a master's program has earned a degree be - yond the baccalaureate level (in many instances a professional degree), mak - ing the student ineligible for a Pell Grant even if he or she does not have a bachelor's degree and enrolls in an undergraduate program. A student who has received an associate degree \u2014or any certificate or diploma below the baccalaureate level\u2014and who enrolls in another under - graduate program continues to be considered an undergraduate student until she has completed the curriculum requirements for a first bachelor's degree. A student with a baccalaureate or professional degree is ineligible even if the degree is from an unaccredited school or is not recognized by your school. Similarly, a student with a baccalaureate or professional degree from a foreign school usually isn't eligible for a Pell Grant. But because a foreign degree often won't translate neatly into the American classification, the school must judge whether it equates to a U.S. bachelor's degree. If the stu - dent provides written documentation that the foreign degree is not equiva - lent to a bachelor's degree awarded in the United States, you may determine that he does not have a bachelor's degree. Documents supporting such a conclusion may include information about the type of school the student at - tended and total years of education leading to the degree. Occasionally a student will complete all the requirements for a bachelor's degree but will continue taking undergraduate courses without accepting the degree. Your school must decide whether and at what point the student completed the baccalaureate course of study. If your school determines that the student did complete a bachelor's program (regardless of whether the student accepted the degree), then the student is no longer eligible to receive a Pell Grant.Eligibility for Specific FSA Programs Most of the student eligibility requirements we have discussed so far apply to all or most of the FSA programs. In this chapter we'll describe some additional eligibility requirements which are program specific. Undergraduate student definition 34 CFR 668.2(b) A student enrolled in a program of study that is usually four, or sometimes five, academic years and that leads to a baccalaureate degree. A student enrolled in a program that lasts longer than five years, typically first profession - al degree programs such as a six-year pharmacy program, can be considered an undergraduate for only the first three or four years. Students enrolled in dual degree pro - grams that confer a bachelor's degree and either a graduate or first profes - sional degree are undergraduates for at least the first three years of the program. The school determines at what point after three years the student ceases to be an undergraduate. For the FSEOG, Pell, and TEACH Grant programs, a student is an undergradu - ate only if he has not earned, or com - pleted the requirements for, a bach - elor's or professional degree. Students enrolled in an eligible postbaccalaure - ate program as described on the next page are still undergraduates for receiv - ing TEACH and Pell Grants. 34 DCL Incarcerated students and sex offenders Students incarcerated in federal and state penal institutions aren't eli- gible for Pell Grants, but those incarcerated in local and county penal institu - tions are potentially eligible for Pell. A student confined or incarcerated in a juvenile justice facility is potentially eligible for Pell. Students incarcerated by jurisdictions defined as a state in the law, such as the District of Columbia, are considered to be in a state penal institution and aren't eligible for Pell Grants. A student isn't considered incarcerated (and thus barred from po - tential Pell eligibility) if he or she is in a halfway house or home detention or is sentenced to serve only on weekends, or if he/she is confined in any sort of facility prior to the imposition of any criminal sentence or juvenile disposi - tion while awaiting trial. The cost of attendance for students who are incarcerated in local penal institutions is limited to tuition and fees and the price of books and supplies specifically related to the student's course of study. For more information on the cost of attendance, see Volume 3, Chapter 2 . A student cannot receive a Pell Grant if he is subject to an involuntary civil commitment following incarceration for a sexual offense (as determined under the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program). Duration of eligibility All students may receive Pell Grants for up to the equivalent of 12 se - mesters, measured by percentage of Scheduled Award(s) disbursed (\"Lifetime Eligibility Used,\" or \"LEU\" field in COD up to 600%). This limitation is not limited to students who received their first Pell Grant on or after July 1, 2008, as was the previous limit on Pell grant eligibility. For more information on the duration of Pell eligibility and LEU, see Volume 3, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook . Eligible postbaccalaureate program A student who is enrolled at least half time in a postbaccalaureate teacher certification or licensure program is eligible to receive a Pell Grant for the pe - riod necessary to complete the program if: The program does not lead to a graduate degree; The school offering the program does not also offer a bachelor's degree in education; The student is pursuing an initial teacher certification or licensing cre - dential within a state; and The program consists of the courses required by a state to receive a pro - fessional certification or licensing credential necessary for employment as a teacher in an elementary or secondary school in that state. Under this very limited provision , a postbaccalaureate program is defined as a program that generally requires a student to have a bachelor's degree before being admitted to the program. Accordingly, a program in which undergraduate students are routinely allowed to enroll would not meet Incarcerated Students and Pell DCL GEN-14-21 HEA Sec. 401(b)(6) 34 CFR 668.32(c)(2),(3) Costs for incarcerated students: HEA Sec. 472(6) Professional degree A degree that signifies both comple - tion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree. Professional licensure is also generally required. Some examples are pharmacy (Pharm.D.), dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), and law (L.L.M. or postbaccalaureate and the FAFSA 34 CFR 690.6(c) HEA Sec. 484(a)(4)(B) Normally a student who indicates on the FAFSA that he has a bachelor's de - gree won't be listed in the Department's records as a Pell-eligible student, and the school won't be able to receive Pell funds for the student. However, to al - low students who are eligible under the postbaccalaureate program provision to be paid, students who correctly report that they have a bachelor's degree but also indicate on the FAFSA that they're in a teaching credential program will be listed as Pell-eligible students. Of course, you must determine whether the student actually falls under the eli - gible postbaccalaureate provision.Prohibition of Pell for concurrent enrollment 34 CFR 690.11 20 U.S.C. 1070a A student may not receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Department and a school.1-85 Chapter 6\u2014Eligibility for Specific FSA Programs FSA CFR DCL the definition of a postbaccalaureate program for this purpose, nor would a program that is generally open to undergraduates but that also admits students with bachelor's degrees. For FSA purposes, a school must treat a student who receives a Pell Grant under this provision as enrolled in an undergraduate program. He is eligible for federal work-study and fifth-year undergraduate (not graduate student) Direct Loan limits. He is not eligible for an FSEOG. Restoring semesters of Pell eligibility for students affected by closed schools The Department has modified the COD system to restore semesters of Pell Grant eligibility for eligible students who were unable to complete their programs because their school has permanently ceased operations (i.e. is now a \"closed school\"). The Department has determined to restore semesters of Pell Grant eligibility for Pell recipients at closed schools. The Department has begun to identify students who received a Pell Grant for attendance at a now-closed school and who were not reported to NSLDS as having graduated from that school. The Pell LEU adjustment will be equivalent to the Pell Grant Eligibility Used (EU) at the closed school for each award year for which the student received Pell Grant funds. The De - partment will make one LEU adjustment per school, per award year. These adjustments in COD will be processed in batches following the final closeout at each school. If you have a student to whom this provision applies, the Department will return a COD Warning Edit 221 for the student. See the April 3, 2017 E- Announcement for detail on how to award the student Pell. Please note that this change is very important because students have a limited number of semesters in which they can receive Pell Grants to contin - ue and complete their education\u2014in 2008, Congress established a maximum Pell Grant lifetime eligibility of 18 semesters, and in 2012, Congress reduced the lifetime eligibility further to 12 semesters and applied it to all students, including a group of students \"grandfathered\" from the original 18-month limitation (for more information on this limitation and the current percent - age method of measuring progress towards the limit, please see the main discussion under \" Pell Grant and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) \" in Chapter 3 of Volume 3 of the FSA Handbook . This restorative action will benefit several thousand students immedi - ately, who were at or near their lifetime limit, as well as more students whose institutions might close moving forward, and those who hadn't reached their limits but who will be able to go back to school if they choose.Wrong grade level on the FAFSA When an undergraduate student incor - rectly reports on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) that he will be a graduate student or has a bachelor's degree, he must correct that information. Because the application shows that the student isn't an under - graduate, the Department's records will show that he is ineligible for Pell. If the application isn't corrected, the school won't be able to pay him a Pell Grant. NEW Pell Grant Restoration for students who attended closed schools April 3, 2017 E-AnnouncementNEW1-86 IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SERVICE GRANTS & ZERO EFCS A student whose parent or guardian died as a result of U.S. military ser - vice in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, may receive increased FSA funds if at the time of the parent or guardian's death the student was either less than 24 years old or was enrolled in college. If the student is eligible for a Pell Grant, you award and package all Title IV aid based on an EFC of zero. If the student is ineligible for a Pell Grant only because his EFC is too high, he may receive an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant. As with Pell Grants, there is a receipt limit of 12 semesters (600% Life - time Eligibility Used/LEU in COD), and this limitation is not limited to students who received their first Pell Grant on or after July 1, 2008. Payments are adjusted for students enrolled less than full time. Un - like Pell Grants, these non-need-based grants do not count as esti - mated financial assistance. A student is tracked for LEU separately for Pell and IASG, and may concurrently have a running LEU tally for each. See Volume 3 , Chapters 3 and 7 for more details on awarding and pack - aging these students. DIRECT LOANS To be eligible for Direct Loans, undergraduate students attending a school that participates in the Pell Grant Program must first receive a deter - mination of their eligibility for Pell Grants. Generally a student must be en - rolled or accepted for enrollment in a degree or certificate program to receive FSA funds, but there are exceptions that apply to Direct Loans. Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two compo - nents of a single loan program. Therefore, a school may not choose to make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible undergraduate and graduate students. A school may choose whether to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program. A school that chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and that has both undergraduate and graduate/professional students must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of its dependent undergraduate students and to its graduate/professional students. That is, such a school may not limit Direct PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate/pro - fessional students. Preparatory coursework A student may apply for a Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan (or a parent may apply for a Direct PLUS Loan on behalf of a dependent student) for coursework the school has documented is necessary for the student to en - roll in an eligible program. The preparatory courses must be offered as part of an eligible program offered by the school, though the student does not have to be enrolled in that program. You may not award Direct Loans for stand - alone courses that do not count towards an eligible program and exist solely to serve as preparatory coursework.Refusing or reducing loans 34 CFR 685.301(a)(8) DCL GEN-11-07 A school may refuse to originate a Di - rect Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the loan if the reason for that action is documented and provided to the bor - rower in writing, and if\u2014 (i) The determination is made on a case- by-case basis; (ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in the stu - dent's file; and (iii) The school does not engage in any pattern or practice that results in a deni - al of a borrower's access to Direct Loans because of the borrower's race, gender, color, religion, national origin, age, dis - ability status, or income. NEWPreparatory coursework example 34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii) 34 CFR 685.203(a)(6) Ryne has a bachelor's degree with a major in mathematics. He wants to enroll in a graduate computer science program at Banks University. He needs 12 more semester hours of computer science coursework to meet Banks's admission requirements. He enrolls in courses that are part of Banks's undergraduate degree program, but because he is not enrolled for the purpose of receiving an undergraduate degree, he is not a regular student. However, because the coursework is necessary for his enrollment in the graduate program, he may receive a Direct Loan for this coursework.Direct Loan program 34 CFR 6851-87 Chapter 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL If enrolled at least half time in these prerequisite courses, the student is eligible for loans for one consecutive 12-month period (not per program) beginning on the first day of the loan period. If the period of preparatory courses spans more than one academic year, the student may receive multiple loans. To be eligible for loans under this exception, the student must be taking classes that are a prerequisite for admission. A student who is only taking courses to raise his or her GPA in order to be admitted would not qualify. Teacher certification coursework Chapter 1 explains when a student may receive a Direct Subsidized/Un - subsidized (or a parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan, among other aid, for courses necessary for an elementary or secondary school teaching creden - tial or certification). Parent borrower eligibility To borrow a Direct PLUS Loan for a student, the parent must be the student's biological or adoptive mother or father, (regardless of whether he or she is the \"custodial\" parent or provided financial information on the FAFSA), or in some cases, a stepparent (see below). More than one parent may get a Direct PLUS Loan for the same dependent student as long as the total aid package does not exceed the student's cost of attendance. A stepparent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan if he or she is con - sidered to be a parent in accordance with the instructions on the FAFSA for purposes of reporting financial information on the FAFSA. A legal guardian is not considered a parent for FSA purposes. In all cases, the dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan must have filed a FAFSA and received an ISIR or SAR for the dependent student for whom a parent is applying for a Direct PLUS Loan. This requirement ensures that student eligibility data matches are conducted to verify that the dependent student on whose behalf the par - ent is borrowing: Is not in default on an FSA loan and does not owe an overpayment on an FSA grant; Has had his or her Social Security number verified by the Social Security Administration; Has had his or her citizenship status confirmed by either the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland Security; and If required, has registered with the Selective Service System. Note that this requirement is for the student to submit a FAFSA. It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to submit a FAFSA in his or her name, and it does not preclude a \"non-custodial\" parent whose information is not included on the FAFSA, from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan. Before originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools Preparatory coursework at a different school A student may take the preparatory courses at School A (as long as they are part of an eligible program there) to prepare for enrollment at School B. Also, School A may require documenta - tion from School B that these courses are required for the student's enroll - ment. NEW When Preparatory course- work is not Title IV eligible The Nightingale School of Nursing (NSN) is part of the T.O. General Hospital and offers a 2-year RN program leading to a diploma. The two-year RN program is the only Title IV eligible program at NSN. To be admitted to the RN pro - gram, students must have: a high school diploma or G.E.D. ; completed Human Anatomy and Physiology with a minimum grade of \"C\"; completed college level English Composition with a minimum grade of \"C\"; and completed college level Algebra with a minimum grade of \"C\". For applicants who have not successful - ly completed post-secondary courses in Human Anatomy and Physiology, Eng - lish Composition, and Algebra, NSN of - fers 8-week courses that upon success - ful completion qualify applicants for admission. Because NSN does not offer a Title IV eligible program that includes its courses in Human Anatomy and Physiology, English Composition, and Algebra, students enrolled in those stand-alone courses are not eligible to receive Title IV funds.1-88 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms must review the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or Student Information Record (SAR) of the dependent student to determine that there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can receive the Direct PLUS Loan. Both parents may get a Direct PLUS Loan as long as the total aid package does not exceed the student's cost of attendance. Stepparents are also eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan if their income and assets would be taken into account when calculating the dependent student's EFC. A legal guardian is not considered a parent for FSA purposes. A parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who meets the eligible student definition. A parent must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a student. Similarly, a parent who owes an overpayment on an FSA grant or is in default on an FSA loan is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless he has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the grant or loan. Yet the parent's ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student's eligibility for other FSA funds. If the parent had a prior FSA loan that was cancelled for total and permanent disability, he or she must adhere to the same eligibility requirements outlined for borrowers in Chapter 3 . Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal gov - ernment holds a judgment lien on her property or if she is incarcerated. Subsidized Loan Eligibility Time Limitation (150% rule) First-time borrowers (those who have no principal or interest balance on any Direct or FFEL Loan on July 1, 2013 or on the date they receive a Direct Loan after July 1, 2013) may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for a period that exceeds 150% of the published length of the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. This length of time is known as the \"maximum eligibility period.\" For example, a first-time borrower in a 4-year program would have six years of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility, and a borrower in a one-year program would have 1.5 years of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibil - ity. COD will edit and reject awards that would exceed 150% subsidized us - age for a student (Reject Edit 206). For the full discussion on how to calculate subsidized usage periods and maximum eligibility periods, and what to do when a borrower exceeds his/her maximum eligibility period, see Volume 3, Chapter 5, Calculating Direct Loan Periods & Amounts . Adverse credit history for Direct PLUS A parent or graduate/professional student with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless he meets additional criteria. The Department obtains a credit report on each applicant for a loan from at least one national credit bureau. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if: The applicant has one or more debts with a total combined outstand - ing balance greater than $2,085 that are 90 or more days delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or that have been placed in collection or charged off during the two years preceding the date of the credit report; orSubsidized Loan Eligibility Time Limitation (150% rule) Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) HEA Sec. 455(q) First Time Borrower: 34 CFR 34 CFR 685.200(f)(iv) April 20, 2015 E-Ann: Reporting issues July 20, 2015 E-Ann: Loss of subsidy Sept 25, 2015 E-Ann: Required reporting Oct 19, 2015 E-Ann: Remaining period of enrollment of less than 1 year For more information about the150% limit, see the 150% limit FAQ on IFAP, at: https://www.ifap.ed.gov/150PercentDirect SubsidizedLoanLimitInfo . the 150% emailed to: 150Percent-Questions@ed.gov (include your organizational affiliation).1-89 Chapter FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL During the five years preceding the date of the credit report, he has been determined to be in default on a debt, his debts have been dis - charged in bankruptcy, or he has been the subject of foreclosure, re - possession, tax lien, wage garnishment, or write-off of an FSA debt. An applicant cannot be rejected for a Direct PLUS Loan because she has no credit history\u2014i.e., the absence of a credit history cannot be construed as an adverse credit history. For more detail on adverse credit history, see https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/faqs.action , then click \"credit check,\" then \"what is considered adverse credit\" (note the \"s\" in the http s portion of the URL). Someone with an adverse credit history can qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by securing an endorser who doesn't have an adverse credit history. For a parent borrower, the endorser may not be the dependent student for whom he is borrowing. Instead of securing an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may submit documen - tation to the Department showing that there are extenuating circumstances (see https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?declinedPast Amt=2085#docExt-header ). The Department has the final decision on wheth - er to make a loan to the person. A borrower who qualifies for a PLUS loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting extenuating circumstances must also complete PLUS counseling provided by FSA before receiving the loan; see the sidebar on this page. If your school participates in the Direct PLUS program but a student's parent cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the student is allowed to borrow additional unsubsidized funds (see Volume 3 , Chapter 5 ). CAMPUS-BASED AID GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Unlike the Direct and Direct PLUS Loan programs, a student does not have to be enrolled at least half time to be eligible to receive aid through the Campus-Based Programs unless the student is seeking aid to attend a teacher certification or professional credential program. A student enrolled as an undergraduate, graduate, or professional stu - dent is eligible to receive assistance from the Federal Perkins Loan and Fed - eral Work-Study (FWS) programs. Only undergraduate students who do not have a baccalaureate or first professional degree are eligible to receive Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOGs). This means that a student who has earned a bachelor's or first professional degree may receive a Perkins Loan or FWS wages to pursue an additional undergraduate degree, but may not receive an FSEOG. See the \"No FSEOG and FWS\" sidebar note in Chapter 2 of this volume about how the Compact Act affects FSEOG and FWS eligibility for students from the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Teacher certification programs As with Direct Loans, a student may receive a Perkins Loan or FWS for coursework that doesn't lead to a degree or certificate from the school but that is required by a state for an elementary or secondary school teaching cre - dential or certificate. See Chapter 1 of this volume.Required counseling for endorser or extenuating circum - stance PLUS loans Any PLUS Loan applicant who has an adverse credit history but who qualifies for a PLUS Loan through the process for reconsideration due to extenuating circumstances or by obtaining an en - dorser for the loan must complete PLUS Loan counseling provided by FSA. While the counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, FSA offers voluntary counseling for all PLUS Loan borrowers. Note that this special PLUS Loan coun - seling is separate and distinct from the PLUS Loan entrance counseling that all graduate and professional student PLUS Loan borrowers must complete.Direct PLUS adverse credit history 34 CFR 685.200(c) E-Announcement January 27, 2015 \"Charged off\" means, for purposes of FSA aid, a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still subject to col - lection action. \"In collection\" means, for purposes of TIV aid, a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or that is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not respond - ed satisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor's billing procedures. Student credit checks Financial aid administrators may not perform credit checks on students in connection with awarding them federal aid. 1-90 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL PERKINS LOANS The Federal Perkins Loan Extension Act has extended Perkins Loan eligibility. As noted in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-16-05, schools may not make Perkins Loans to graduate student borrowers after September 30, 2016, and to undergraduate student borrowers after September 30, 2017 , however, if an eligible undergraduate student received a disbursement of a Perkins loan prior to October 1, 2017, this student may receive subsequent disbursement(s) of that Perkins Loan until June 30, 2018. No Perkins funds disbursements of any type are allowed under any circumstances after June 30, 2018. Perkins eligibility criteria Before awarding an undergraduate student Perkins Loan funds, if they have an existing balance on a Perkins Loan made by that school (current borrowers), you must first award the student all Direct Subsidized Loans for which they are eligible. If the prospective Perkins borrower does not have an outstanding balance, before awarding them Perkins funds, you must first award all Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan funds for which the student is eligible (an undergraduate who consolidates his/her Perkins Loan is treated as though they do not have an outstanding Perkins balance and is considered a new Perkins Loan borrower). When awarding Perkins Loans, you must give priority to those students with exceptional financial need, as defined by your school. Your school's Perkins selection procedures must be in writing, uniformly applied, and kept on file at the school. See Volume 2 for record retention and consumer infor - mation requirements. Before you may award a student a Perkins Loan, you must determine the student's Pell Grant eligibility. You may use an unofficial calculation to determine Pell Grant eligibility before a student has filed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, your school may not disburse the Perkins Loan until you have received the student's official EFC for that award year (on the student's valid SAR or ISIR). The maximum amount an undergraduate student may borrow is $5,500 per award year. Like Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized and Direct PLUS Loans, Perkins Loans also have aggregate loan limits: $11,000 for any student who has not completed two academic years of undergraduate work. $27,500 for an undergraduate student who has completed two academic years and is pursuing a bachelor's degree. The aggregate loan limit includes only unpaid principal. (Previously, a student who had borrowed the maximum cumulative amount for a graduate or professional student would not be eligible for another loan even if the student had repaid part or all of the amount he or she had borrowed.) The annual maximums and aggregate maximums include any amounts borrowed previously under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, including National Direct/Defense Student Loans. For more detail on making Perkins loans to undergraduate students, see Appendix A of Volume 6 of the FSA Handbook . Remaining Perkins authority DCL GEN-17-10 Federal Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 Perkins Q & A: https://ifap.ed.gov/cbp/PerkinsFAQ.html Perkins eligibility\u2014willingness to repay 34 CFR 674.9(e) Previous disability cancellation 34 CFR 674.9(g) and (h) Impact of declining Direct Loan on Perkins eligibility When an undergraduate student eli - gible for Direct Subsidized or Unsub - sidized Loans declines either type of Direct Loan, the student's Direct Loan must be included in the calculation of the student's Perkins Loan amount.Perkins Loan eligibility 34 CFR 674.9 Default: 464 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Additional Perkins disclosures In addition to disclosures required under the existing 34 CFR 674.16, the Perkins Loan Extension Act requires additional disclosures before you make a first disbursement of a Perkins loan: A notice and explanation regarding the end of future availability of Perkins Loans; A notice and explanation that repayment and forgiveness benefits available to Direct Loan borrowers are not available to Perkins Loan borrowers; A notice and explanation regarding the borrower's option to consoli - date a Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan, including any benefit of consolidation; For current undergraduate borrowers, a notice and explanation pro - viding a comparison of interest rates of Perkins Loans and Direct Loans, and informing the borrower that the borrower has reached the maximum annual borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans; and For new undergraduate borrowers, a notice and explanation provid - ing a comparison of the interest rates of Perkins Loans and Direct Loans, and informing the borrower that they have reached the maxi - mum borrowing limit for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Staf - ford Loans. A borrower who is in default on an FSA loan is not eligible for a Perkins Loan unless she has regained eligibility. However, a borrower who satis - fies any of the conditions that remove her defaulted Perkins Loan from the school's cohort default rate becomes eligible for additional Perkins Loans. As with Direct Loans, if a borrower received a discharge of a Perkins Loan or NDSL due to total and permanent disability and applies for another Perkins Loan or NDSL, she must follow the procedure explained in Chapter 3 of this volume. Willingness to repay In selecting Perkins Loan recipients, a school must consider evidence of a borrower's willingness to repay the loan. Delinquency, default, or other failure to meet repayment obligations on a previous loan is evidence that the borrower is unwilling to repay a loan. For example, if a borrower has previ - ously satisfied a defaulted student loan involuntarily (such as by garnishment of the borrower's wages), a school should consider this as evidence of unwill - ingness to repay and should deny further loan assistance to the borrower. Previous Perkins Loan discharged in bankruptcy Due to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, a student or parent may not be denied FSA loans solely on the basis of a bankruptcy filing or discharge. They also may not be required to repay a previously discharged loan in order to reestablish eligibility for new loans. However, aid administrators have more latitude in making awards under the Perkins than the Direct Loan 1-92 Vol. 1\u2014Student Eligibility 2018-19 FSA HB May program because they may consider a student's willingness to repay. If a student has filed for or received a loan discharge in bankruptcy or has had an FSA loan determined dischargeable by a court of law, the bankruptcy may be considered when determining a student's willingness to repay provided it is not the sole basis for the determination and for a denial of a Perkins Loan. Schools may also, of course, consider the student's post-bankruptcy credit history in determining willingness to repay. FEDERAL WORK-STUDY (FWS) To be eligible for a Federal Work-Study (FWS) job, a student must meet all general eligibility criteria and must have financial need, that is, his cost of attendance must be greater than his expected family contribution (EFC). Also, a financial aid administrator may not award FWS employment to a student if that award, when combined with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. However, unlike the other two Campus-Based Programs, the FWS Program does not require that priority be given to students who have exceptional financial need. In choosing students for FWS employment, schools must follow the procedures discussed in Volume 3 , Chapter 6 . A student can be employed in an FWS job during a period of non- attendance, such as a summer term. He must be planning to attend school during the next period of enrollment and must have financial need for that period\u2014his current FWS earnings must be used to cover expenses for it and will count as estimated financial assistance. See Volume 6 , Chapter 2 for more information. FSEOG To receive a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), a student must have financial need and must meet the general eli - gibility requirements discussed in the other chapters of this volume. Students with the lowest EFCs who will also receive Pell Grants for the award year have primary consideration for an FSEOG. If, after giving FSEOG awards to all its Pell recipients, a school has FSEOG funds remaining, it can award those funds to eligible students with the lowest EFCs who will not receive Pell Grants. See Volume 3 , Chapter 6 . Additionally, to receive an FSEOG, one must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as an undergraduate student and must not have previously earned a bachelor's or first professional degree. A school must make FSEOG funds reasonably available (to the extent that funds remain) to all eligible stu - dents. TEACH GRANTS The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program provides $4,000 annual grants to students who plan to become teachers. As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant, stu - dents must agree to teach full-time in a high-need field, for at least four aca - demic years at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves low-income families. The grant recipient must complete the required four years of teaching within eight years of completing (or oth -FSEOG eligibility 34 CFR 676.9 and 34 Additional FWS criteria For information on eligible FWS jobs, see Volume 6 .1-93 Chapter 6\u2014Eligibility erwise ceasing to be enrolled in) the course of study for which a TEACH Grant was received. If a grant recipient does not meet that obligation, the TEACH Grant funds received are converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan that must be repaid with interest. Amount of grant funds available A full-time TEACH Grant recipient may receive four scheduled awards of $4,000 each, or a total of $16,000, for the student's first baccalaureate and first postbaccalaureate programs combined. Programs after the first bac - calaureate are not eligible. A graduate student may receive two scheduled awards, or a total of $8,000, for a master's degree program. Students who are enrolled less than full time have the same maximums, though the annual awards will be smaller: for example, a student enrolled half time in a master's program could receive an annual award of $2,000 for each of the four years it would take to complete the program. A TEACH Grant in combination with other assistance the student receives cannot exceed the cost of attendance; if it does, the aid package must be reduced. An otherwise eligible student who received a TEACH Grant for enroll - ment in a TEACH Grant-eligible program is eligible to receive additional TEACH Grants to complete that program, even if that program is no longer considered a TEACH Grant-eligible program. This extension is not to exceed four Scheduled Awards for an undergraduate student and up to two Sched - uled Awards for a graduate student. Receiving a TEACH Grant To qualify for a TEACH Grant, a student fills out not only a FAFSA but also an agreement to serve (explained later) and must be enrolled in a pro - gram and at a school that are both TEACH-grant eligible. Students must adhere to an academic standard: they must have a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent (see \"Schools without a traditional GPA\"), or must have scored above the 75th percentile on at least one of the batteries on a nationally-normed stan - dardized undergraduate, postbaccalaureate, or graduate school admissions test. An undergraduate student uses, for the first year, her final high school GPA or the GPA for all the classes she has taken at college through the most recently completed payment period; after the first year, she uses the latter GPA. A graduate student uses her undergraduate GPA for the first payment period and her cumulative graduate school GPA thereafter. You must have documentation of the GPA from the cognizant author - ity or from the student. For high school grades, the authority is typically the high school or, in the case of homeschooled students, the parents or guard - ians. If the student provides the document and you have reason to question its accuracy, you must obtain documentation directly from the cognizant authority. The previous academic requirements do not apply to certain graduate students. This group comprises current teachers or retirees from another occupation with expertise in a high-need field who are seeking a master's de - gree, as well as current or former teachers who are completing a high-quality alternative certification, such as Teach for America.TEACH Grant definitions High-need field \u2014 1. Bilingual education and English language acquisition 2. Foreign language 3. Mathematics 4. Reading specialist 5. Science 6. Special education 7.

Postbaccalaureate program \u2014a program for those who have completed a bachelor's degree that: 1. does not lead to a graduate degree, 2. consists of courses required by a state for a credential necessary for teaching at an elementary or secondary school in that state (this does not include any program offered by a TEACH Grant- eligible school that offers a bachelor's degree in education), and 3. is treated as an undergraduate pro - gram for FSA purposes.

For subsequent payment periods, follow your academic policy regard - ing the calculation of the GPA, whether that is to include grades for courses that transfer or to exclude them. Agreement to serve To receive a TEACH Grant, a student must sign an agreement to serve. This document explains that the student will do the following: Serve as a full-time teacher for a total of at least four academic years within eight calendar years of completing or otherwise ceasing to be enrolled in the course of study for which the TEACH Grant was re - ceived; Teach at a school or educational service agency serving low-income students; Comply with the requirements for being a highly qualified teacher (see the sidebar note); Teach (in the majority of classes) in a high-need field, which includes subjects on the nationwide shortage area list at www.ed.gov/about/ offices/list/ope/pol/tsa.html that is updated each year by the Depart - ment; Upon completion of each year of service, provide certification of that service from the chief administrative officer of the school or educa - tional service agency; and If the student fails or refuses to carry out the service obligation in the required timeframe, the student must repay as a Direct Unsubsidized Loan the total amount of all TEACH Grants received, with interest ac - crued as of the date of disbursement of each grant. A TEACH Grant recipient must complete a four-year service obliga - tion for each program of study for which a TEACH Grant was received. The eight-year period for completing this obligation begins when the student's enrollment in the program ends. Teaching may apply to more than one obligation: for example, a student who completes a bachelor's and a master's program consecutively and receives TEACH Grants for both would have two service obligations. The student could receive a suspension for completing the obligation for the undergraduate program while enrolled in the master's program. Once that is done, four years of qualifying teaching would satisfy the service obligations for both programs. However, a student who finishes the bachelor's program, completes the obligation for it, and later enrolls in the master's program would need to complete another four-year service obli - gation.Highly qualified teacher The definition of \"highly qualified\" with respect to teachers is lengthy and is explained in Section 9101(23) of the El - ementary and Secondary Education Act [USC 7801(23)] and Section 602(10) of the Individuals with Disabilities Educa - tion Act [USC 1401(10)]. TEACH Grant-eligible program This is an eligible program as described in Volume 2 , Chapter 2 , that prepares one to be a highly qualified teacher in a high-need field and that leads to a bachelor's or master's degree or is a postbaccalaureate program. A two-year program acceptable for full credit to - ward a bachelor's degree is considered a program that leads to a bachelor's degree.1-95 Chapter 6\u2014Eligibility 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL For each year of the service obligation, the TEACH Grant recipient must teach a majority of classes in a high-need field. Fields on the nationwide list must be designated as high-need by the state where and when the individual begins teaching or they must have been listed at the time a TEACH Grant was received. Teaching in a geographic region of a state or in a grade level not associated in the nationwide list with the student's field does not satisfy the service obligation. Schools without a traditional GPA Schools that do not use a standard 4.0 GPA scale for a program must have a written equivalency policy with a numeric scale and must make it available upon request. The policy must clearly differentiate student perfor - mance so that it can support a determination that a student has achieved at a level commensurate with at least a 3.25 GPA on a 4.0 scale. Generally a grad - ing scale that includes only \"pass/fail,\" \"satisfactory/unsatisfactory,\" or some other non-numeric evaluation will not meet this requirement unless it can be shown that a \"pass\" or \"satisfactory\" grade has a numeric equivalent to a traditional 3.25 GPA (or higher) or that a student's performance on tests and assignments yielded such a numeric equivalent. Such a policy must be consistent with other grading scales that the school has developed for academic and other (including FSA) purposes\u2014e.g., grad - uate school applications, scholarship eligibility, insurance certifications\u2014to the extent that such scales distinguish between levels of student academic performance.School without a traditional GPA At Sandberg University, instructors submit, at the end of the semester, an evaluation that the work a student does in a class is \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfac - tory.\" The catalog indicates that the evaluation is never translated into a grade by the registrar's office. Neither the catalog, the faculty handbook, nor any other school publication differenti - ates levels of satisfactory student perfor - mance. Even though the state scholar - ship program accepts a \"satisfactory\" as the equivalent of a \"B,\" the university may not make such an assumption for the TEACH Grant program. Moreover, a \"B\" grade generally corresponds to a GPA of 3.0, while TEACH Grants require a GPA of 3.25 or better.1-96 Vol. and \"institution\" interchangeably unless some more specific use Similarly, \"student,\" \"applicant,\" and \"aid recipient\" are synonyms. \"Parents\" in this volume refers to the parents of dependent students, and \"you\" refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid administrators at colleges. \"We\" indicates the United States Department of Education (Department, ED), and \"federal student aid\" and \"Title IV aid\" are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.

Some schools apply only for designation as an eligible institution\u2014they do not seek to participate\u2014so that their students may receive deferments on FSA program loans or be eligible for the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits or other non-FSA programs that require schools to be FSA-eligible. The same application is used to apply for both eligibility and certification for participation (see Chapter 2 ). TYPE AND CONTROL The three types of eligible institutions The law defines three kinds of eligible institutions\u2014 institutions of higher education , proprietary institutions of higher education , and postsecondary vocational institutions . Each type of school is eligible to participate in all the FSA programs, provided it offers the appropriate type of program (see the chart on the next page). This section covers the key elements of the three definitions, giving special attention to those requirements that affect the definition of an eligible program. Although the criteria for the three types of institutions differ, it is possible that an institution of higher education can also qualify as a postsecondary vocational institution by offering programs that are less than an academic year in length and lead to a certificate or other non- degree recognized credential. Institutional control The control of an institution distinguishes whether it is public or private, nonprofit or for-profit. By definition, an institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational institution can be either public or private but is always nonprofit. A proprietary institution of higher education is always a private, for-profit institution.Institutional Eligibility This chapter discusses the three types of institutions that are eligible to participate in the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs. If circumstances change and a participating school no longer qualifies as an eligible institution, it must notify the Department of Education (the Department; see Chapter 5 ) and carry out the closeout procedures described in Chapter 8 . Assessing your school's compliance To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment module for \"Institutional Eligibility\" at: https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/FSAAssessments.jspRelated information Eligible program\u2014 Chapter 2 Closeout procedures\u2014 Chapter 8 Applying to participate, New School Guide Eligibility of homeschooled and correspondence students\u2014 Volume 1 , Chapter 1 Definitions of eligible institutions 34 CFR 600.4, 600.5, and FSA HB February 2019 2-4Type and Control of Eligible Institutions The institution offers (1) associate, bachelor's, gradu - ate, or professional degree programs; (2) a program of at least two years that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree; or (3) a training program of at least one academic year that leads to a certificate or other nondegree recognized credential and prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.The institution must (1) provide training for gainful employment in a recognized occupation or (2) have provided a program leading to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts continuously since 1/1/09 (with continuous regional accreditation since 10/1/07 or earlier). Programs offered must meet the criteria of at least one category below: (1) They are at least a 15-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours. They may admit students without an associate degree or equivalent. (2) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) program of 300 clock hours, 8 semester or trimester hours, or 12 quarter hours. They must be a graduate/professional program or must admit only students with an associate degree or equivalent. (3) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 300-599 clock hours. They must admit at least some students who do not have an associate degree or equivalent and must meet specific qualitative standards. Note: These programs are eligible only for Direct Loan participation. Any school may act as a postsecondary vocational institution to offer GE programs less than one academic year in length. Also, all three institutional types may provide a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program for individuals with intellectual disabilities. \"Two-Year Rule\" (applicable to proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions): Legally authorized to give (and continuously have been giving) the same postsecondary instruction for at least two consecutive years. The institution must provide training for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Programs offered must meet the criteria of at least one category below: (1) They are at least a 15-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours. They may admit students without an associate degree or equivalent. (2) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) program of 300 clock hours, 8 semester or trimester hours, or 12 quarter hours. Must be a graduate/professional program or must admit only students with an associate degree or equivalent. (3) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 300-599 clock hours. Must admit at least some students who do not have an associate degree or equivalent and must meet specific qualitative standards.

These requirements are discussed in the following sections. Legal authorization by a state Generally, an eligible institution must be located in a state. A school is physically located in a state if it has a campus or instructional site in that state. There are certain limitations and exceptions: Institutions of higher education in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program. Institutions of higher education in the Republic of Palau are eli - gible for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS programs. Foreign schools may participate in the Direct Loan Program, subject to the rules of Subpart E of 34 CFR Part 600. There are two basic requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state for the purpose of Title IV program eligibility: (1) the state must authorize the institution by name to operate postsecondary educational programs; and (2) the state must have a process to review and act on complaints concerning the schools, including enforcing applicable state laws. The following are exempt from both of these requirements: schools authorized by name by the federal government to offer educational programs beyond secondary education, and schools authorized by name by an Indian tribe [as defined in 25 USC 1801(a)(2)] to offer educational programs beyond secondary education, provided they are located on tribal lands and the tribal government has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the schools and enforces applicable tribal requirements or laws.Nonprofit institution A school that is owned and operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or associations whose net earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or individual, legally authorized to operate as a non - profit organization by each state in which it is physically located, and determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be eligible for tax- deductible contributions in accordance with the IRS Code [26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)]. State defined \"State\" includes not only the 50 states, but also American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. 34 CFR 600.2. Definition of Indian tribe The institutional eligibility regulations (see 34 CFR 600.9) incorrectly cite 25 USC 1802(2); this will be corrected in the Federal Register to 25 USC 1801(a)(2). Role of state entities The regulations mention, as one option, that an institution may be established by name through some \"other action\" by an appropriate state entity. Other institutions, established as businesses or nonprofit charitable institutions, must show that the state took an active role in approving or licensing them to operate postsecondary educational programs. For details on these and other issues, see DCL GEN-13-20.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility February 2019 2-6Religious institutions must comply with (2) but are exempt from (1) above\u2014i.e., they are already considered to be legally authorized to operate postsecondary educational programs\u2014if they are exempt from state authorization as religious institutions under the state constitution or by state law. See the definition in the margin. Authorization to operate postsecondary educational programs A school can be established by name as an educational institution through a state charter, statute, constitutional provision, or other action by an appropriate state entity. The school must be authorized to operate educational programs beyond the secondary level, including programs leading to a degree or certificate. In addition, the institution must comply with any applicable state approval or licensure requirement, although the state may exempt the school from that approval or requirement based on the school being in operation for at least 20 years or on its accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department. If a school was not established by name as an educational institution but was established by a state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization, it must be approved or licensed by name by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate. Such a school can't be exempted from state approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or a comparable exemption. A school must have documentation that it has the authority to operate in a state at the time of its certification to participate in the FSA programs. For more information on applying for participation in the FSA programs, see the New School Guide . Existing Title IV schools should ensure that they are currently in compliance with the regulations, but they are not required to immediately update their Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR). Instead, they can include the information showing their state authorization when they next submit their application for approval to participate in the FSA programs. For questions about documenting state legal authorization, schools should contact their participation team, information for which can be found at https://eligcert.ed.gov.Definition of religious institution An institution that is owned, controlled, operated, and maintained by a religious organization lawfully operating as a nonprofit reli - gious corporation; and awards only religious degrees or cer - tificates including but not limited to a certificate of Talmudic studies, an as - sociate of Biblical studies, a bachelor of religious studies, a master of divinity, or a doctor of divinity. 34 CFR 600.9(b)(2)Chapter 2-7How different types of schools meet state authorization requirements Legal Entity Entity Description Approval or Licensure Process Educational InstitutionA public, private nonprofit, or for-profit institution established by name through a charter, statute, articles of incorporation, or other action issued by an appropriate state entity as an educational institution authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate.The institution must comply with any applicable state approval or licensure process and be approved or licensed by name. It may be exempted from such requirement based on its accreditation or being in operation at least 20 years. Business A for-profit entity established by the state on the basis of an authorization or license to conduct commerce or provide services.The state must have a state approval or licensure process, and the institution must comply with that process and be approved or licensed by name to offer postsecondary education. An institution in this category may not be exempted from state approval or licensure based on accreditation, years in operation, or a comparable exemption.Charitable OrganizationsA nonprofit entity established by the state on the basis of an authorization or license for the public interest or common good. Notes: The chart does not apply to federal, tribal, and religious institutions, which are exempt from these requirements, or to distance education programs offered out of state. A state must have a process to review and address complaints directly or through referrals; this applies to all institutions except tribal and federal institutions. For tribal institutions, the tribal government must have a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning them and to enforce applicable tribal requirements or laws. State complaint process The state must have a process to review and act on complaints (for example, about fraud or false advertising) concerning a school, which must provide the contact information for filing those complaints to enrolled and prospective students. Complaints can be handled by the state attorney general's office or a state agency as long as that entity can review, investigate, and resolve complaints against the school. There may be different complaint processes for different types of schools. Whatever entity handles complaints, the state must have the final authority for the process. See DCL GEN-14-04 for more FSA HB February 2019 2-8ACCREDITATION Generally, a school must be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association (both referred to here as agencies) to be eligible. Except as provided here, a school must be accredited by an agency that has the authority to cover all of the institution's programs. An agency such as this is referred to as the school's primary accrediting agency . A school can have only one primary accreditor. A school may also be accredited by one or more programmatic accrediting agencies. A programmatic accrediting agency is one that accredits only individual educational programs that prepare students for entry into a profession, occupation, or vocation. If a school is seeking to change primary accreditors, it must first provide the Department and the agencies all materials documenting the reasons for the change. You can find information on accreditation changes is in Chapter 5 . Alternatives to regular accreditation The law provides two statutory alternatives to accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency. First, a public or private nonprofit institution may be preaccredited by an agency or association that has been approved by the Department to grant such preaccreditation. Second, public postsecondary vocational educational institutions may be eligible for FSA funds if accredited by a state agency that the Department determines to be a reliable authority. Primary accreditor The primary accreditor typically is an accrediting agency whose scope is institution-wide rather than only programmatic. A participating institution must tell the Department which accrediting agency it wants to serve as its primary accrediting agency for FSA eligibility. If a school offers only programs of a singular nature, the school's primary accreditor may be an agency that accredits only those specific educational programs. Dual accreditation If a school is accredited by two agencies at the same time, the school must designate which agency's accreditation will be used in determining institutional eligibility for FSA funds and must inform the Department via the E-App. Further, the school must provide to the Department and to both agencies all materials documenting the reasons for dual accreditation before the school adds the additional accreditation. See Chapter 5 for more on changes in accreditation and loss of eligibility.Nationally recognized accrediting agency An agency or association the Department has recognized to accredit or preaccredit a category of institution, school, or educational program according to 34 CFR Parts 602 and 603. List of accrediting agencies The Department periodically publishes a list of nationally recognized accrediting bodies in the Federal Register based on criteria in 34 CFR Part 602. The list of accrediting agencies recognized for FSA purposes is on the Department's website at (https://www2. ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html ). Agencies recognized for their preaccreditation categories are in Section 7. Information about national recognition of state approval agencies is in Section 10. Alternatives to accreditation Institutions of Higher Education 34 CFR 600.4(a)(5)(ii) Postsecondary Vocational Institutions 34 CFR 600.6(a)(5)(ii) Preaccredited A status granted by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association to a public or private nonprofit institution that is progressing toward accreditation within a reasonable period of time. Institutions of Higher Education 34 CFR 600.4(a)(5)(ii) Postsecondary 2-9ADMISSIONS STANDARDS An eligible institution may admit as regular students only persons who have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state in which the school is located, or are dually enrolled in the college and a secondary school. An eligible student must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent or be beyond the age of compulsory attendance and meet the criteria for homeschooled students. Students who are dually enrolled in high school and college are not eligible for FSA funds. See Volume 1 , Chapter 1 . High school diploma A high school diploma is a document recognized by the state in which the high school is located. Unless required by its accrediting or state licensing agency, the college is not required to keep a copy of a student's high school diploma or recognized equivalent of a high school diploma (see below). Rather, the college may rely on the student's certification (including that on the FAFSA) that he or she has received the credential and a copy of the certification must be kept on file. This certification need not be a separate document. It may be collected on the college's admissions application. The college may also require the student to provide supporting documentation. Recognized equivalent of a high school diploma The following are the equivalent of a high school diploma: A GED certificate A state certificate awarded after passing an authorized test and that the state recognizes as equivalent to a high school diploma. This includes evidence of a passing score on tests recognized by the state and similar to the GED, such as the High School Equivalency Test or HiSET and the Test Assessing Secondary Completion or TASC An academic transcript showing that the student has success - fully completed at least a two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree (including a previously earned bachelor's degree) For a student seeking enrollment in a program of at least the associate degree level, documentation showing that he excelled academically in high school and has met the formalized written admissions policies of the collegeRelated requirements A school may not deny readmission to a service member of the uniformed services for reasons relating to that service. See Chapter 3 for more information.Admissions standards 34 CFR 600.4(a)(2), 600.5(a)(3), 600.6(a)(2) Checking validity of high school diplomas A school must evaluate the validity of a student's high school completion if the school or the Department has reason to believe that the high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education. This is discussed in detail in Volume 1 , Chapter 1 . 34 CFR 668.16(p) Dual enrollment in high school and college 20 USC 1001(b)(2)(B), 1002(b)(2)(B) and (c) (2)(B)Regular student definition A person who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible program to obtain a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential. If a person is not yet beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state where the college is physically located, it may only enroll her as a regular student if she has a high school diploma or its equivalent or is dually enrolled in high school and college. 34 CFR 600.2 Students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students who do not have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent has additional considerations. See Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent in Chapter 4 .Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations, 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-10Homeschooled students and compulsory school attendance The Department considers a homeschooled student to be beyond the age of compulsory school attendance if the state in which the college is located does not consider him truant once he has completed homeschooling. For instance, if your state requires children to attend school until age 17, you may admit as a regular student a child who completes her secondary homeschooling curriculum at age 16 if your state would not consider her truant and would not require her to go to high school or continue homeschooling until age 17. You may rely on a homeschooled student's self-certification that he completed secondary school in a homeschool setting, as discussed in Volume 1, Chapter 1 , under \"Academic Qualifications.\" Preparatory programs for students without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students without a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent (except homeschooled students) must make available to them a program that has proven successful in helping students obtain the equivalent of a high school diploma. For example, such a program might assist a student in obtaining a GED certificate or the state certificate mentioned earlier. It could be a preparatory program conducted by state and local secondary school authorities, or any other program for which the school has documentation that statistically demonstrates success. The school must provide information about the availability of the program to interested students. The school does not have to provide the program or pay for its cost. The program must be offered at a place that is convenient for students, and the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that they have access to it, such as coordinating the timing of school programs and the preparatory program. The law does not require a school to verify that a student is enrolled in a preparatory program or to monitor his progress in it. A student who does not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent is not required by law to enroll in such a program, but the school may make this an admission requirement. A student may not receive FSA funds for the program, and a school cannot include the cost of the program in a student's cost of attendance.Related topics See Chapter 2 for transition programs for students with intellectual disabilities. See also Volume 1, Chapter 1 , about that and about remedial coursework.Students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students who do not have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent has additional considerations. See Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent in Chapter 4 . Career pathway programs Students enrolled in an eligible career pathway program who are not high school graduates and don't have a diploma equivalent may be eligible to receive Title IV aid if they pass an independently administered, ED-approved ability-to-benefit test or complete at least 6 credit hours or 225 clock hours that apply to a degree or certificate offered by the school. See DCL GEN-16-09 for more information, including a list of Q's and A's about career pathway programs.Chapter \"TWO-YEAR\" RULE FOR NEW PROPRIETARY OR VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS To be eligible as a proprietary institution or a postsecondary vocational institution, a school must be legally authorized to give (and have continuously been giving) the same postsecondary instruction for at least two consecutive years prior to its application. The educational program(s) offered must remain substantially the same in length and subject matter except for changes made because of new technology or requirements of other federal agencies. A school subject to the two-year rule may not award FSA funds to a student in a program that is not included in the school's approval documents. If a school is subject to the two-year rule, during the school's initial period of participation in the FSA programs, the Department will not approve additional programs that would expand the institution's eligibility. An exception would be considered if the school demonstrates that the program has been legally authorized and continuously provided for at least two years prior to the date of the request. A branch campus of an eligible proprietary institution or postsecondary vocational institution seeking status as a main campus or freestanding institution is subject to the two-year rule. It must be designated as a branch campus for two years after certification as such by the Department before it can seek certification as a main or freestanding school. An additional location must obtain approval from the Department to become a branch campus. A branch campus then must satisfy the two-year rule before it may be considered for status as a freestanding institution. Time at an additional location of an eligible proprietary institution or postsecondary vocational institution does not count toward the two years.Notifying ED of changes to school's E-App information If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted Electronic Application (E-App), which deal with enrollment thresholds for the limitations below, the school must notify the Department via the E-App (see Chapter 5 ). The Department will advise the school of its options, including whether the school might be eligible for a waiver. Waivers are available for the correspondence student limitation, the incarcerated student limitation, and the limitation on students without a high school diploma or equivalent. 34 CFR 600.7(h)Branch campus A branch campus is geographically apart from and independent of the school's main campus. It is considered to be independent of the main campus if it is permanent in nature; offers educational programs leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized credential; has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization; and has its own budgetary and hiring authority. Branch campus 34 CFR 600.2 and 600.8 Additional location February 2019 2-12FACTORS LEADING TO LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY Limitations An otherwise eligible institution becomes ineligible if it violates, among other requirements, the 50% limit on students without a high school diploma or equivalent (for schools that don't offer a 4-year bachelor's de - gree program or a 2-year associate degree program), the incarcerated student limitation (25%), or the correspondence course limitation (50%) or correspondence student limitation (50%). The school must demonstrate compliance with these limitations, and its calculations must be attested to by the independent auditor. Chapter 4, which describes FSA audit requirements, discusses the calculations in more detail and how the school must notify the Department of a failure to meet any of these requirements. Bankruptcy or crimes involving FSA programs A school is not eligible if it files for relief in bankruptcy or has entered against it an order for bankruptcy. The school is also ineligible if either of these circumstances apply to an affiliate of the school that has the power, by contract or ownership interest, to direct or cause the direction of the management of policies of the school. A school also loses eligibility if it, its owner, or its executive officer has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or is found guilty of, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of FSA program funds; or been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving FSA program funds. If a school becomes ineligible for any of these reasons, it must notify the Department of the change within 10 days. A school that becomes ineligible because of one of these factors must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and must follow the requirements for a school that has lost its FSA participation (see Chapter 8) . The loss of eligibility is effective as of the date of the bankruptcy or the date the school or individual pleads guilty to, or is found responsible for, the crime, as applicable. A loss of eligibility for these two reasons is permanent\u2014the school's eligibility cannot be reinstated.Conditions of institutional ineligibility 34 CFR 600.7 Prohibition on employment of individuals who have misused government funds A school may not have as principals or employ or contract with other organizations that employ individuals who have engaged in the misuse of government funds. See Chapter 3 for details. Chapter 1\u2014Institutional Eligibility CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-13Accreditation of teacher preparation programs At the present time there are no agencies for the accreditation of high-quality teacher preparation programs that are recognized by the Department. Thus, a school that offers a high-quality teacher preparation program at the baccalaureate or master's degree level can only qualify as a TEACH Grant-eligible institution if the teacher preparation program is approved by a state, includes a minimum of 10 weeks of full-time pre-clinical experience, or its equivalent, and provides either pedagogical coursework or assistance in the provision of such coursework. 34 CFR 686.2(d), definition of Grant Program 34 CFR Part 686PARTICIPATING IN THE TEACH GRANT PROGRAM Eligibility for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program is not automatically extended to an FSA-eligible postsecondary school. A school qualifies as a \"TEACH Grant-eligible institution\" if it offers a high-quality teacher preparation program at either the baccalaureate or master's level that provides supervision and support services to teachers (or assists in the provision of such services). The teacher preparation program must also be accredited by a specialized accrediting agency recognized by the Department for the accreditation of professional teacher education programs (see the margin note) or be approved by a state and meet certain other requirements. If a school does not have a teacher preparation program, it can qualify as a TEACH Grants-eligible institution if it provides one or more 2-year programs of study that are accept - able for full credit to either a baccalaureate teacher preparation degree program or a baccalaureate degree program in a high- need field at another TEACH-eligible school with which it has an agreement; offers a baccalaureate degree that, in combination with other training or experience, will prepare a student to teach in a high-need field and has an agreement with another institution that offers a teacher preparation program or a post-baccalaure - ate program that prepares students to teach; or offers a postbaccalaureate program. APPLYING AS AN ELIGIBLE NONPARTICIPATING SCHOOL Some schools choose to establish their eligibility for FSA programs but elect not to participate in them because designation as an eligible institution qualifies a school or its students to take advantage of non- FSA programs or benefits, such as the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits. In addition, only students attending eligible institutions qualify for in-school deferments of payments on their federal education loans. A school wishing to be designated an eligible nonparticipating institution may submit an E-App to the Department at any time. The application must be materially complete.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations, 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-14The Department will contact the school, generally within 90 days of receiving the application, if it has additional questions. If it approves the school's application, it will send an electronic notice to the president and financial aid officer stating that the school is eligible and that its approval letter and ECAR must be printed and maintained. If the Department does not approve the school's application, it will tell the school why. WITHDRAWAL RATES Students are considered to have withdrawn if they officially withdraw, unofficially drop out, are expelled from the school, or receive a 100% refund of their tuition and fees. Those who withdraw from one or more courses or programs but do not withdraw entirely from the school (e.g., the students reduced their credit hours from 12 to 6) do not meet the definition of withdrawn. Instead, this action is considered a change in enrollment status. New schools (those seeking to participate in an FSA program for the first time) must have an undergraduate withdrawal rate for regular students of no more than 33% during the last completed award year. When calculating the withdrawal rate, the school must include all regular, enrolled students. The definition of enrolled does not require either payment of tuition or class attendance; therefore, the withdrawal rate calculation must include enrolled students who have not yet paid tuition or begun attending classes.\"Enrolled\" for the purpose of withdrawal rates Students enroll when they complete the school's registration requirements (except payment of tuition and fees). Correspondence students are enrolled if they have been admitted to the program and have submitted one lesson (that was completed without the assistance of a school representative). Chapter 1\u2014Institutional Eligibility CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-15THE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT To participate in the FSA programs, a school must have a current Program Participation Agreement (PPA), signed by the school's president, chief executive officer, or chancellor and an authorized representative of the Secretary of Education. Purpose and scope of the PPA With the PPA the school agrees to comply with the laws, regulations, and policies governing the FSA programs. After being certified for FSA program participation, the school must administer FSA program funds in a prudent and responsible manner. A PPA contains critical information: in addition to the effective date of a school's approval, the date by which the school must reapply for participation, and the date on which the approval expires, the PPA lists the FSA programs in which the school is eligible to participate. Beginning to disburse funds when first signing the PPA A school may make Pell and TEACH Grant disbursements to students for the payment period in which the PPA is signed by the Secretary. Schools receiving initial certification can participate in the Campus-Based programs in the next award year that funds become available. Direct Loan program disbursements may begin in the loan period that the PPA is signed. Expiration or termination of the agreement Either the school or the Department may terminate the PPA. The agreement automatically terminates if the school loses eligibility. A school's Program Participation Agreement expires on the date that the school changes ownership that results in a change in con - trol (see Chapter 5 ), the school closes or stops offering educational programs for a reason other than a normal vacation period or natural disaster that directly affects it or its students (see closure procedures in Chapter 8 ), the school ceases to meet the eligibility requirements (see Chapter 4 and \"Factors Leading to Loss of Eligibility\" in this chapter), the school's period of participation expires, or its provisional certification is revoked ( Chapters 4, 5, and 8). A school's PPA no longer covers an additional location as of the date on which that location ceases to be a part of the school.Program Participation Agreement Sec. 487 of the HEA covered by the PPA An eligible school must enter into a PPA with the Department to participate in the following programs: Federal Pell Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant* TEACH Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work-Study (FWS) Federal Direct Loan Program (DL) * A school that is certified for Pell Grant purposes is considered to be certified for the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant program. Experimental sites The Experimental Sites Initiative permits statutory and regulatory flexibility for schools participating in the experiments. This gives the Department data for judging the effectiveness of certain laws and regulations and whether they should change. For example, the Dual Enrollment Experiment allows participating colleges to award Pell grants to students for their Title IV-eligible college program while still being enrolled in high school. For more information and other experiments, see the website at ( https://experimentalsites. ed.gov HB February 2019 2-16Selected Provisions of the PPA Most of the provisions of the Program Participation Agreement (PPA) are discussed in detail in Volume 2 and other volumes of the Federal Student Aid Handbook . In this section, we highlight some of the general school requirements in the PPA that may not be as familiar to financial aid professionals. Note that the PPA may list additional requirements that are school-specific; schools must carefully review all of the requirements listed on their PPA. General Terms & Conditions The school certifies that it will comply with a. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, barring discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin; b. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, barring discrimination on the basis of sex; c. The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (see Chapter 7 ); d. Sections 501 and 505(b)(2) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, on safeguarding information (see Chapter 7 ); e. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, barring discrimination on the basis of physical handicap (34 CFR Part 104); and f. The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (34 CFR Part 110). The school acknowledges that the Department, states, and accrediting agencies may share information about the school without limitation. The school acknowledges that the school must, prior to any other legal action, submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation to initial arbitration. General Provisions The school will use funds received under any FSA program, as well as any interest and other earnings thereon, solely for the purposes specified for that program . If the school is permitted to request FSA program funds under an advance payment method, the school will time its requests for funds to meet only the school's immediate FSA program needs (see Volume 4, Chapter 2 ). The school will not charge for processing or handling any application, form, or data used to determine a student's FSA eligibility (see Chapter 3 ). The school will establish administrative/fiscal procedures and reports that are necessary for the proper and efficient management of FSA funds, and it will provide timely information on its administrative capability and financial responsibility to the Department and to the appropriate state, guaranty, and accrediting agencies (see Chapter 6 ). The school must acknowledge the authority of the Department and other entities to share information regarding fraud, abuse, or the school's eligibility for participation in the FSA programs (see Chapter 8 ). The school must, in a timely manner, complete reports, surveys, and any other data collection effort of the Department including surveys under the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (see Chapter 6 ). The school cannot penalize in any way a student who is unable to pay school costs due to compliance with the FSA program requirements or due to a delay in an FSA loan disbursement caused by the school. The school must comply with the program integrity requirements established by the Department, state authorizing bodies, and accrediting agencies (see Chapter 8 ). The school is liable for all improperly administered funds received or returned under the FSA programs, including any funds administered by a third-party servicer (see Chapter 3 ).Chapter FSA HB February 2019 2-17Selected Provisions of the PPA, continued If the program offered by the school is preparing students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, the school will a. demonstrate a reasonable relationship [as defined in 34 CFR 668.14(b)(26)(i)] between the length of the program and entry level requirements for the recognized occupation, and b. establish the need for the training for students to obtain employment in the recognized occupation. Certifications Three certifications are included in the PPA: Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension, and other responsibility matters; and Drug-Free Workplace Requirements (see Chapter 6 ). Drug Prevention Certification (see Chapter 6 ). Certification regarding Debarment, Suspension, Eligibility, and Voluntary Exclusion\u2014lower-tier covered transactions. Direct Loans The school will not charge any fees of any kind to student or parent borrowers for loan application, origination activities, or the provision and processing of any information needed to receive a Direct Loan. The note or evidence of obligation of the loan shall be the property of the Secretary. The school accepts responsibility and financial liability stemming from its failure to perform its functions under this Program Participation Agreement. Additional requirements In addition to the requirements listed on the PPA, a school must meet any requirements for participation in the General Provisions (34 CFR Part 668), as well as those specific to an individual FSA program. FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM, 20 USC 1070a et seq; 34 CFR Part 690. FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM, 20 USC 1087a et seq; 34 CFR Part 685. FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT PROGRAM, 20 USC 1070b et seq; 34 CFR USC 2751 et seq; 34 CFR Part 675. These requirements are discussed in the Application and Verification Guide and volumes 1-6 of this Federal Student Aid Handbook .CHAPTERC 2 Many of the program eligibility requirements are derived from the institutional definitions that we discussed in Chapter 1 . However, bear in mind that institutional eligibility does not mean that all programs at the school are eligible. A financial aid office should have a process to confirm the eligibility of an educational program before paying any FSA funds to students enrolled in that program and should promptly report changes to the Department following the procedures in Chapter 5 .CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-19 Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationDETERMINING PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY A school's eligibility does not necessarily extend to all its programs, so the school is responsible for ensuring that a program is eligible before awarding FSA funds to students in that program. In addition to determining that the program meets the eligible program criteria given in this chapter, the school should make certain that the program is included under the notice of accreditation from a nationally recognized accrediting agency (unless the agency does not require that particular program be accredited). The school should also make certain that it is authorized by the appropriate state to offer the program (if the state licenses individual programs at postsecondary institutions). In some instances a school or program may need a general authorization as well as licensure for a specific program approval. (See the chart on eligible institutions and the discussion under Legal Authorization By a State in Chapter 1 .) A school's eligibility extends to all eligible programs and locations on its E-App, unless the school participation division (SPD) determines that certain programs or locations did not meet the eligibility requirements or it has not approved the expansion's FSA eligibility. Generally, the school's eligible nondegree programs and locations are specifically named on the Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR). Additional locations and programs may be added later. Once the SPD has approved the program/location, it will notify the school and an updated ECAR can be printed . See the discussion under Changes to Educational Programs in Chapter 5 for a discussion of when and how a school must notify the Department when adding programs and when the school must wait for approval from the Department. Note that all GE programs must be reported to ED and all direct assessment programs, comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs, and short-term programs must be reported to and approved by and student eligibility To qualify as an eligible institution, a school must offer at least one eligible program. Not all programs at an eligible institution must be eligible, but at least one of the programs at the school must meet the eligible program requirements. Except for students enrolled in certain preparatory or teacher certification courses, a student must be enrolled in an eligible program to receive FSA funds (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 for more information).Related topics Eligibility requirements for specific educational programs\u2014 Volume 1, Chapter 1 Types of educational programs defined for eligible institutions\u2014 Volume 2, Chapter 1 Updating the E-App to change programs and locations\u2014 Volume 2, Chapter DCL FSA HB February 20192-20If a program offered through distance or continuing education meets the definition of an eligible program, students enrolled in that program must be considered for FSA program assistance on the same basis as students enrolled in eligible programs offered through traditional modes. With some limitations, if a correspondence program meets the definition of an eligible program, students enrolled in that program are considered eligible (see Distance Education & Correspondence Study in this chapter). BASIC TYPES OF ELIGIBLE PROGRAMS There is a wide variety of programs that are eligible for Title IV aid. This section explains some of the most common for each type of institution. Later in the chapter we explain others, such as direct assessment programs and comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs. Eligible programs at an institution of higher education At a public or private nonprofit institution of higher education, the following types of programs are Title IV-eligible: a program that leads to an associate, bachelor's, professional, or graduate degree, a transfer program of at least two academic years in duration that does not award a credential and is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree, a program of at least one academic year in duration that leads to a certificate or other nondegree recognized credential and prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, a program consisting of courses required for elementary or secondary teacher certification or recertification in the state where the student plans to teach that is offered in credit or clock hours, or a certificate or diploma training program that is less than one year and prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation (if the school also meets the definition of a postsecondary vocational institution). Note that with a few exceptions detailed later in this chapter, a nondegree program at a public or private nonprofit institution is subject to the rules for a gainful employment program. Schools Must Accurately Report Their Programs' Published Length The Department's regulations require each school to have established a normal time for completion for each of its academic programs. 34 CFR 668.41(a) defines normal time as the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the school's catalog . The definition goes on to say, This is typically four years for a bachelor's degree . . . two years for an associate degree . . . and the various scheduled times for certificate programs . Therefore, a school must have established a program's published length in time (years, months, or weeks), not just in credit or clock hours to comply with 34 CFR 668.41(d)(4) and 668.45 and must report that published length in time to COD and NSLDS. If the school has published, in its catalog, on its website, or in any pro - motional materials, the length of the program in weeks, months, or years, the program length to be reported to COD and NSLDS must be the same as the program length that the school has published. Note: For gainful employ - ment programs, the school must have published the program's length in weeks, months, or years on the school's website. If the school has not published a pro - gram length and the program is an associate or bachelor's degree program, the program length to be reported should be 2 years or 4 years, respec - tively, unless the academic design of the program makes it longer or shorter than the typical, 2-year associate degree program or 4-year bachelor's degree program. For all other programs for which the school has not published a program length, the program length is based on the school's determination of how long, in weeks, months, or years, the program is designed for a full-time student to complete. EA 2015-04-20, Direct Subsidized Loan Limit: Electronic Announcement #17 - School Misreporting of Data to COD and NSLDSReminderChapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL HB February 20192-21Eligible programs at a proprietary or postsecondary vocational institution There are several types of eligible programs at a proprietary institution or a postsecondary vocational institution. Generally these programs must have a specified number of weeks of instruction and must provide training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The program provides at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours of undergraduate instruction offered during a minimum of 15 weeks of instruction. The program may admit as regular students persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. The program provides at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks of instruction. The program must be a graduate or professional program or must admit as regular students only persons who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. The program is known as a short-term program, which qualifies for the Direct Loan program only. This type of program must provide at least 300 but less than 600 clock hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks of instruction. The program must admit as regular students some persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. It must also have been in existence for at least one year, have verified completion and placement rates of at least 70% (see below), and not be more than 50% longer than the minimum training period required by the state or federal agency, if any, for the occupation for which the program of instruction is intended. Lastly, a program that leads to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts at an accredited proprietary institution is an eligible (non-GE) program. The school must have been continuously accredited by a recognized regional accrediting agency or association since at least October 1, 2007, and have provided the program continuously since January 1, 2009. PROGRAMS LEADING TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT To be eligible for Title IV funding, an educational program at a postsecondary school must lead to a degree\u2014associate, bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree from a public or non-profit institution\u2014 or prepare students for \"gainful employment in a recognized occupation.\" We refer to the latter as \"gainful employment programs\" or \"GE programs\" for short. They include nondegree programs offered by public and private nonprofit institutions and almost all academic programs offered by proprietary institutions; see below for details. They are subject to the Department's regulations on disclosures (see Chapter 6 ).Definition A program leading to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts is one that the school's recognized regional accreditation agency determines is a general instructional program in the liberal arts, the humanities, or the general curriculum, falling within one or more of the following categories: 1. A program that is a structured combination of the arts, biological and physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities, emphasizing breadth of study. 2. An undifferentiated program that includes instruction in the general arts or general science. 3. A program that focuses on combined studies and research in the humanities subjects as distinguished from the social and physical sciences, emphasizing languages, literatures, art, music, philosophy, and religion. 4. Any single instructional program in liberal arts and sciences, general studies, and humanities not listed in 1 through 3 above. Instruction must be in a regular program, not an independently designed or individualized program or unstructured studies. 34 CFR February 20192-22The school must document the employment of any student it includes as employed in the placement rate calculation. Examples of such documentation include but are not limited to a written statement from the employer, signed copies of state or federal income tax forms, or written evidence of payment of Social Security taxes. The school must reasonably determine whether a related occupation is comparable. For instance, for a student who was trained as an auto mechanic, it is reasonable to determine that a job as a boat mechanic is comparable. However, for a person trained in retail sales management, a counter-service job at a fast-food restaurant is not comparable. An auditor may use his or her discretion to choose the award year used to calculate a program's completion and placement rates under 34 CFR 668.8(e), (f), and (g) based on the circumstances and appropriate audit standards, with these caveats: The auditor must use the same procedure from year to year; and The auditor may not use the rates from award years that ended more than two years prior to the institution's fiscal year end date. For example, for a fiscal year that ends on 8/31/16, the auditor could calculate rates from the 2015-2016 award year or the 2014-2015 award year, but not from the 2013-2014 award year or any award year prior to that.For the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the standards for short-term ( at least 300 but less than 600 clock hours ), a school must calculate the completion and placement rates for the award year. The independent auditor who prepares the school's compliance audit report must attest to the accuracy of the school's calculation of completion and placement rates. See 34 CFR 668.8(e), (f), and (g).Completion and Placement Rates for Short-Term Programs Number of students who obtained employment* within 180 days of receiving credential and who are employed (or have been employed) for at least 13 weeks following receipt of credential Number of regular students who received credential for successfully completing the program during the award year *in the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation= Placement RateNumber of regular students who earned credentials for successfully completing the program within 150% of its length Number of regular students enrolled in the program for the award year, including the number of regular students who withdrew with a 100% refund of tuition and fees and the number of regular students enrolled at the end of the award year= Completion RateChapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written HB February 20192-23Programs offered by for-profit institutions All educational programs offered by for-profit (proprietary) institutions are GE programs with the following three exceptions: 1. Preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in a Title IV- eligible program [34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii)]; 2. Approved Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary (CTP) programs for students with intellectual disabilities [34 CFR 668.231]; and 3. A limited number of bachelor degree programs in liberal arts if offered by the school since January 2009 and if the school has been regionally accredited since October 2007 [34 CFR 600.5(a) (5)(i)(B)]. Programs offered by public and private nonprofit institutions All non-degree educational programs offered by public or private non-profit institutions are GE programs with the following four exceptions: 1. Preparatory coursework as noted under (1) above; 2. Approved CTP programs as noted under (2) above; 3. Programs that are at least two years long and are designed to be fully transferable to a bachelor's degree program and for which the school does not confer a credential [34 CFR 668.8(b)(1)(ii)]; and 4. Teacher certification programs the institution does not award a credential for [34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(iii)]. See also the margin note on embedded programs. A student who is concurrently enrolled in a GE and a non-GE program must be included as an enrolled student in the former for purposes of GE reporting and in the calculation of information for disclosures. State requirements and program length The institution must demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of th e GE program and entry level requirements for which the program prepares the student. The Secretary considers the relationship to be reasonable if the number of clock hours provided in the program does not exceed by more than 50% the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student, as established by the State in which the program is offered, or as established by any federal agency (if applicable). See 34 CFR 668.14(b)(26).Gainful employment guidance Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #53 on May 20, 2015, explains GE program identification.Recognized occupation 34 CFR 600.2 All non-degree programs must prepare students in that program for gainful employment in a specific recognized occupation. This requirement also applies to degree programs at proprietary schools. A recognized occupation is one that is identified by a Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code established by the Office of Management and Budget or an Occupational Information Net - work O*NET-SOC code established by the Department of Labor and available at O*NET OnLine at ( www.onetonline. org) or its successor site, or considered by ED, in consultation with the Department of Labor, to be a recog - nized occupation. If the title of the program does not clearly indicate the specific occupation that the program prepares the student for, that information must appear on the E-App. Embedded programs Some public and private nonprofit institutions offer degree programs in which students may also be awarded a non- degree credential (e.g., certificate, diploma) after completing a portion of the degree program. These are not GE programs as long as a significant number of the students enrolled in the program earn the degree rather than withdraw after obtaining the certificate. If a significant number of students enrolled in the program do not earn the degree, all of the students are considered to be enrolled in a non degree program, that is, a GE program. State process for complaints Note that under 34 CFR 668.43(b) you must provide state contact information to students or prospective students for filing complaints in each state in which you operate. (See Chapter 6 for the school consumer information requirement.)Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary limitation applies and credit-hour GE programs. If a school's credit-hour program is subject to the clock-to- credit hour conversion, the school must include all the hours used in the conversion calculation (both in-class and out-of-class) when determining whether the hours in the program exceed state requirements by more than 50%. If a school's credit hour GE program is not subject to the conversion, but is still subject to the limitation because its state has established a minimum number of clock hours required for training, the school must multiply the number of credit hours in the program by 37.5 (if a semester hour program) or 25 (if a quarter hour program) to determine the maximum number of credit hours that may be offered in such a program. Certification requirements for GE programs When providing updated GE Program information to the Department, institutions must provide a new GE Certification to cover the updated list of GE Programs. Updates that require a new certification include establishing or re-establishing the eligibility of a program, or changing the name, CIP code, or credential level of a currently-approved GE Program. The institution certifies that each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E- App is approved by a recognized accrediting agency or is other - wise included in the institution's accreditation by its recognized accrediting agency, or, if the institution is a public postsecond - ary vocational institution, the program is approved by a rec - ognized State agency for the approval of public postsecondary vocational education in lieu of accreditation; each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E-App is programmatically accredited, if such accreditation is required by a Federal governmental entity or by a governmen - tal entity in the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State ap - proval under 34 CFR 600.9; for the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State approval un - der 34 CFR 600.9, each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E-App satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification require - ments in that State so that a student who completes the pro - gram and seeks employment in the State qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter; andGE programs at foreign colleges The only programs at foreign proprietary institutions that are eligible for FSA loan funds are degree programs in medicine, nursing, and veterinary science. All Title IV- eligible programs at these institutions are GE programs. The determination if a program is a GE program at a foreign public or nonprofit institution is the same as for domestic public and nonprofit institutions.Fulfilling GE Certification Requirements when Updating the E-App Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #77ClarificationChapter 2\u2014Program HB February 20192-25 for a gainful employment program for which the institution is establishing initial eligibility for Title IV , HEA program funds, the program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the institution that in the prior three years, became ineligible for Title IV , HEA program funds under the debt-to-earnings rates measure or was failing, or in the zone with respect to, the debt-to-earnings rates measure and was voluntarily discontin - ued by the institution. A school may not include in its list of eligible GE programs a failing or zone GE program that it voluntarily discontinued, a program that became ineligible due to D/E rates, or a program that is substantially similar to a discontinued or ineligible program until three years have passed. ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS There are additional FSA program eligibility requirements for specific educational programs. For example, only undergraduate educational programs are eligible under the Pell Grant and FSEOG programs. Correspondence programs are not eligible unless they meet the general requirements for an eligible program and are required for the student's regular program of study leading to a degree. TEACH Grant eligible programs One of the eligibility requirements for a student to receive a TEACH Grant is that the student must be enrolled in a TEACH Grant-eligible program. A TEACH Grant-eligible program is an eligible program that is designed to prepare an individual to teach as a highly quali - fied teacher in a high-need field and lead to a baccalaureate or master's degree (including 2-year programs of study that are ac - ceptable for full credit toward a baccalaureate degree), or post-baccalaureate program of study for students who have completed a baccalaureate degree. A postbaccalaureate program consists of courses required by a state for a student to receive a professional certification or licensing credential that is needed for employment as a teacher in an elementary or secondary school in that state. It must be a program that is treated as an undergraduate program for FSA purposes and may not lead to a graduate degree. Note that the program cannot be considered a postbaccalaureate program if the school offers a baccalaureate degree in education. For additional TEACH grant student eligibility requirements, see Volume 1 , Chapter 6 . February 20192-26Programs for students with intellectual disabilities A student with an intellectual disability who enrolls in a comprehensive transition and postsecondary (CTP) program at a school that participates in the FSA programs is eligible for non-loan assistance (Pell Grants, FSEOG, and Federal Work-Study). As discussed in Volume 1, the student is exempt from some student eligibility requirements. A CTP program is a degree, certificate, non-degree, or non-certificate program that is designed to support students with intellectual disabilities who want to continue their instruction (academic, career and technical, and independent living) at a postsecondary school to prepare for gainful employment. Schools must apply to the Department to have such a program judged eligible. The program must be delivered to students physically attending the institution, include an advising and curriculum structure, and provide students with intellectual disabilities opportunities to participate in coursework and other activities with students without disabilities. Such programs must require that at least half of the students' participation in the program, as determined by the school, focuses on academic components through one or more of the following activities: taking credit-bearing courses with students without disabilities, auditing, or otherwise participating in, courses the student does not receive regular academic credit for with students without disabilities, taking non-credit-bearing, nondegree courses with students without disabilities, and participating in internships or work-based training in settings with individuals without disabilities.Applying for eligibility for a CTP program When applying to the Department for eligibility for a CTP program, a school must follow the procedures in 34 CFR 600.20 and provide the information described in 34 CFR 668.232. See the electronic announcement dated 6/21/10 on the IFAP website. Definition of intellectual disability A student with an intellectual disability means a student with mental retardation or a cognitive impairment characterized by significant limitations in\u2014 (i) Intellectual and cognitive functioning; and (ii) Adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills; and (2) Who is currently, or was formerly, eligible for special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1401), including a student who was determined eligible for special education or related services under the IDEA but was homeschooled or attended private school.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-27ESL programs Students enrolled in a program that consists solely of English as a second language (ESL) instruction are only eligible for Pell Grants. An ESL program must meet the general requirements for eligible programs (e.g., it must lead to a degree or other credential), and a school must request an eligibility determination for it from the Department. The program may admit only students who need instruction in English to be able to use the knowledge, training, or skills they already have. The school must document its determination that the ESL instruction is necessary for each student enrolled. Schools should pay attention to the effect that awarding Pell Grants for more than one academic year of attendance in an ESL program has on a student's Pell LEU (See Volume 3 ). See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the requirement that schools define the effect of non-credit remedial courses (including ESL on a student's academic progress. Competency-based education programs Competency-based education (CBE) is an innovative approach in higher education that organizes academic content according to competencies\u2014what a student knows and can do\u2014rather than follow a more traditional scheme, such as by course. As with all Title IV-eligible programs (except correspondence programs), CBE programs must be designed to ensure that there is regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors. Interaction that is wholly optional, initiated primarily by the student, or occurring only upon the request of the student is not sufficient. Some schools use a CBE model where instructors perform different roles and no single faculty member is responsible for all aspects of a course or competency. Such a model may be used, but schools must ensure that regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors occurs, that instructors meet accrediting agency standards for instruction in their subject, and that the faculty resources dedicated to the program are sufficient for the accrediting agency. Interactions between students and personnel who don't meet accrediting agency standards for providing instruction in the subject area would not be considered substantive interaction with an instructor.TIPVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-28FSA funds may be awarded only for learning that results from instruction provided or overseen by the school. FSA funds cannot be awarded for any portion of the program based on study or life experience prior to enrollment in the program or based on tests of learning that are not associated with educational activities overseen by the school. A school must ensure that the instructional materials and faculty support necessary for academic engagement are available to students every week that the school counts toward its defined payment period or academic year. Educational activity in a CBE program includes but is not limited to participating in regularly scheduled learning sessions (where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the student and the faculty member); submitting an academic assignment; taking an exam, an interactive tutorial, or computer-assisted instruction; attending a study group that is assigned by the institution; participating in an online discussion about academic matters; consultations with a faculty mentor to discuss academic course content; and participation in faculty-guided independent study (as defined in 34 CFR 668.10(a)(3)(iii)). For direct assessment programs only, educational activity also includes development, in consultation with a qualified faculty member, of an academic action plan that addresses competencies identified by the school. As with other types of eligible programs, CBE programs may be offered as nonterm or as standard or nonstandard term programs. Such programs may also last less than a year if all applicable requirements are met. See DCL GEN-14-23 for more information, including guidance about CBE programs and cost of attendance, satisfactory academic progress, return of Title IV funds, and direct assessment programs.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & HB February 20192-29Types are two types of CBE programs: those that measure progress using clock or credit hours and direct assessment programs. Credit- or clock-hour CBE programs are organized by competency but measure student progress using clock or credit hours. In such programs, Title IV aid must be administered under normal statutory and regulatory provisions for credit- or clock-hour programs. An institution offering a CBE program using credit hours must ensure that for Title IV purposes each credit hour in the program requires sufficient educational activity to fulfill the federal definition of a credit hour (See the discussion under Determining program eligibility and Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversions later in this chapter.) and must reasonably approximate not less than one hour of classroom instruction and two hours of out-of-class work each week. A credit hour in a CBE program might not require structured class sessions but must still require sufficient academic activity\u2014for instance, reading and writing assignments with feedback from an instructor\u2014to reasonably approximate three hours of expected academic engagement per week for each credit hour. The CBE program could allow this work to be completed more flexibly and at the student's pace as long as he is making satisfactory academic progress. Direct assessment programs are a type of CBE program that does not use credit or clock hours. Progress in a direct assessment program is measured solely by assessing whether students can demonstrate that they have a command of a specific subject, content area, or skill or can demonstrate a specific quality associated with the subject matter of the program. Therefore, unlike a CBE program measured in credit hours, a direct assessment program does not specify the level of educational activity in which a student is expected to engage in order to complete the program. Because direct assessment programs do not use credit or clock hours, schools must establish credit- or clock-hour equivalencies for the programs and provide a factual basis for that to the Department as part of the application process for direct assessment programs. The equivalencies must be approved by a school's accrediting agency, and the school must document that approval. See GEN-14-23 for more about equivalencies. The entire program must be provided by direct assessment\u2014one offered partly with credit or clock hours is not Title IV-eligible\u2014and the assessment must be consistent with the accreditation of the institution or program. A direct assessment program may use learning resources (e.g., courses or portions of courses) that are provided by entities other than the school providing the direct assessment program without regard to the limitations on contracting for part of an educational program (see Written Arrangements Between Schools later in this chapter).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary 20192-30Several types of programs and coursework that might otherwise be eligible for FSA purposes are not eligible if they involve direct assessment: Programs at foreign schools. Preparatory coursework required for entry into an eligible program ( see Volume 1, Chapter 6 ). Courses necessary for an elementary or secondary school teaching credential or certificate ( see Volume 1, Chapter 6 ). Remedial coursework measured through direct assessment. However, note that remedial instruction offered in credit or clock hours in conjunction with a direct assessment program is eligible for FSA funds. A school that wishes to award FSA funds for a program using direct assessment must submit an updated E-App at ( https://eligcert. ed.gov/ ) to the Department to apply for approval of the program. In addition to updating the E-App, the school will email to the case teams (at CaseTeams@ed.gov) supporting documentation: a detailed program description (recommended length not to exceed 20 pages), a detailed description of financial aid administration (not to exceed 5 pages), and documentation that the school's accrediting agency has evaluated and approved the program and agrees with the school's credit- or clock-hour equivalency. See DCL GEN-13-10 for complete instructions. The detailed program description will be a succinct narrative clearly indicating the name of the program and how it meets the regulatory requirements of 34 CFR 668.10(b). Each requirement must be specifically identified in the narrative; for example, there must be a description of how the assessment of learning is done [668.10(b)(2)]. The detailed description of financial aid administration for the program explains how the program meets the Title IV requirements. For example, the school must provide a basis for its credit- or clock-hour equivalent for the program or portion thereof (the clock or credit hours will be used as the basis for the FSA award calculations described in Volume 3 , Chapter 1 ). If a school plans to change any aspect of the program, it must obtain prior approval from the Department by reapplying.Direct assessment programs 34 CFR 668.10 For more information, including step-by- step instructions on how to apply for Title IV approval of a direct assessment program, see DCL GEN-13-10. Direct assessment definitions An academic year in a direct assessment program consists of a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time, during which a full-time student is expected to complete the equivalent of at least 24 semester or trimester credit hours or 36 quarter credit hours for an undergraduate program. A week of instructional time is any seven- day period in which at least one day of educational activity occurs. Educational activity includes assessments, regularly scheduled learning sessions, faculty-guided independent study, consultations with a faculty mentor, and development of an academic action plan addressed to the competencies identified by the school. Independent study occurs when a student follows a course of study and works with a faculty member to decide how the student will meet defined course objectives. Both agree on what the student will do (e.g., readings, research, and work products), how the student's work will be evaluated, and the time frame for completion. The student must interact with the faculty member on a regular and substantive basis to assure progress within the course or program. A full-time student is one carrying a full- time academic workload, as determined by the school, that is the standard for all students in the program. For undergraduate students, the school's standard must equal or exceed the minimum requirements in the definition of full-time student in 34 CFR 668.2, based on the credit- or clock-hour equivalency for the program.Chapter 2\u2014Program EducationCFR February 20192-31Apprenticeships instruction with on-the- job experience. Postsecondary schools may provide related classroom instruction, technical training, or other certified training. If all or part of an apprenticeship meets an academic requirement of a Title IV-eligible educational program, students enrolled in that program may receive Title IV aid for the entire program, including for the apprenticeship portion. Since student aid is partly determined by the number of credit or clock hours in the program, the structured on-the-job portion must be associated with a defined number of credit or clock hours. For clock-hour educational programs, students' completion of the clock hours associated with the on-the-job training must be under the supervision of school faculty. Except as may be required by the accrediting agency or state, there is no limit on the percentage of the program that consists of on-the-job training as long as the school provides the training. Note that schools must report to the Department any location at which 50% or more of an educational program is provided, including any on-the-job component. If an entity other than the school provides the on-the-job training, that component must be 25% of the program or less or, with specific permission of the institution's accrediting agency, over 25% but less than 50% of the program. In such contracted situations, the school must enter into a written arrangement with the entity providing the on-the-job training. If the program is offered in credit hours, the written arrangement should establish the equivalent credit hours for the non-coursework portion of the program. A school's policies for establishing credit hours must meet all requirements and standards set by its accrediting agency. See the discussion under Written Arrangements Between Schools later in this chapter for additional information.Apprenticeships For more information see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-14-22 and Volume 6 , Chapter 2 , of FSA 20192-32Study-abroad programs A participating institution may establish study-abroad programs for which students are eligible to receive FSA funds. The study-abroad program does not have to be a required part of the eligible program at the home school for the student to be eligible to receive FSA funds, but the credits earned through the study-abroad or exchange program must apply toward graduation in the student's program at the home school. In addition, students in the study-abroad program must remain concurrently enrolled at their home school. Moreover, the school must mention the availability of FSA funds in the information it provides to students about the study-abroad program. Types of study-abroad programs Study-abroad program configurations include the following: A home school sends students to a study-abroad program at an eligible or ineligible foreign host school. The home school must have a contractual agreement with the foreign school. A written arrangement between a domestic institution and one in another country is always considered a contractual agreement in which the domestic institution is the home school. A home school has, instead of a separate agreement with each foreign school, a written arrangement with a study-abroad organization that represents one or more foreign schools. The arrangement must adequately describe the duties and responsibilities of each entity and meet the requirements of the regulations. A variant of the study-abroad program occurs when a home school sends faculty and students to a foreign site. This is not a consortium or contractual study-abroad program; rather, the foreign site is considered an additional location under 34 CFR 600.32. A study-abroad program must be part of a written contractual agreement between two or more schools. If a study-abroad program has higher costs than the home school, those should be reflected in the student's cost of attendance. This may result in the student being eligible for additional FSA funds. Some eligible students have had problems receiving FSA funds for study-abroad programs because neither their home school nor the school they were temporarily attending documented that they were enrolled in an eligible program of study. The Program Participation Agreement requires participating schools to establish procedures that ensure that students participating in study-abroad programs receive the FSA funds to which they are entitled.Written arrangements between domestic and foreign schools An eligible U.S. school may have a written arrangement with a foreign school or organization that is acting on behalf of a foreign school, but such an arrangement is always considered to be one between an eligible domestic school where the student enrolls and an ineligible foreign school, even if the latter is otherwise Title IV- eligible. Therefore, these arrangements are considered contractual agreements that must follow the rules that apply to such. See DCL GEN-11-18 for more information about Title IV eligibility of programs offered through written arrangements between U.S. and foreign schools.Study abroad references Arrangements with a study-abroad organization 34 CFR 66 8.5(b) Student eligibility in study-abroad 34 CFR FSEOG Maximum Awards 34 CFR 676.20 The maximum FSEOG for a full academic year is usually $4,000. However, a school may award as much as $4,400 to a student participating in a study-abroad program that is approved for credit by the home school.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR February 20192-33Flight school program 34 CFR 668.8(i)Flight school programs A flight school program must maintain current valid certification by the Federal Aviation Administration to be eligible. WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN SCHOOLS Under a consortium or contractual agreement (including those for study-abroad programs), the home school must give credit for courses taken at the other schools on the same basis as if it provided the training itself. The underlying assumption of such an agreement is that the home school has found the other school's or organization's academic standards equivalent to its own and the instruction an acceptable substitute for its own. A home school may decline to give credit for courses in which a student earns a grade that is not acceptable at the home school even though the host school has a policy of accepting that grade for its resident students. Also, although grades received through consortium or contractual agreements do not have to be included in a student's grade point average, they must be included when calculating the quantitative component (the percentage of credits earned vs. attempted) of her satisfactory academic progress. If not written for an individual student or group of students, agreements between schools can go on indefinitely. These agreements do not have to be renewed unless the terms of the agreement change. A school must provide enrolled and prospective students with a description of the written arrangements it has entered into, including the portion of the educational program that the school that grants the degree or certificate is not providing, the name and location of the other schools or organizations that are providing that portion of the educational program, the method of delivery of that part of the educational program, and estimated additional costs students may incur by enrolling in an educational program provided under the written arrangement.Definitions Consortium agreement \u2014a written agreement between two or more eligible schools.

Under a consortium agreement, students may take courses at a school other than the home school and have those courses count toward the degree or certificate at the home school. A student can only receive FSA assistance for courses that are applicable to the student's certificate or degree program. A consortium agreement can be a blanket agreement between two or more eligible schools, or it can be written for a specific student. Such an agreement is often used when a student takes related courses at neighboring schools or when a student is enrolled in an exchange program with another eligible school for a term or more. A school could have one agreement for each student, a separate agreement with each host school, or a blanket agreement with a group of schools. In a consortium agreement there is no limit on the portion of the eligible program that may be provided by eligible schools other than the home school. Agreement contents can vary widely and will depend upon the interests of the schools involved and the accrediting or state agency standards. (See sidebar for required contents of an agreement.) Usually the home school is responsible for disbursing funds, but if the student is enrolled for a full term or academic year at the host school, it may be easier for the host school to monitor his eligibility and make payments. When there is a written arrangement between eligible schools, any of the schools participating in the written arrangement may make FSA calculations and disbursements without that school being considered a third-party servicer. This is true even if the student is not currently taking courses at the school that is calculating and disbursing the aid. The school that disburses an FSA award is responsible for maintaining information on the student's eligibility, how the award was calculated, what money has been disbursed, and any other documentation associated with the award, even if some of that documentation comes from other schools. Moreover, the school paying the student must return FSA funds if required, for example, in refund/return or overpayment situations. For determining enrollment status under a consortium agreement, see Volume 3 , Chapter 3 .Requirement to inform students of an arrangement 34 CFR 668.43(a)(12) Contents of a consortium agreement The Department does not dictate the format of the agreement (which can be executed by several different offices) or where the agreement is kept. However, the following information should be included in all agreements: The school that will grant the degree or certificate The student's tuition, fees, and room and board costs at each school The student's enrollment status at each school The school that will be responsible for disbursing aid and monitoring student eligibility The procedures for calculating awards, disbursing aid, monitoring satisfactory progress and other student eligibility requirements, keeping records, and re - turning funds when the student withdrawsChapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-35Contractual agreement If the limitations in the following paragraphs are adhered to, an eligible school may enter into a contractual agreement with an ineligible school or organization that provides part of the educational program of students enrolled at the eligible school. Such a contract is prohibited with an ineligible school or organization whose eligibility or certification to participate in the FSA programs has been terminated or revoked by the Department or application for certification or recertification to participate in the FSA programs was denied by the Department. Similarly, an eligible school is prohibited from entering into a contract with an ineligible school or organization that has voluntarily withdrawn from participation in the FSA programs under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar type of proceeding initiated by the Department or the school's state licensing agency, accrediting agency, or guarantor. Under a contractual agreement, the eligible school is always the home school. It performs all the aid processing and disbursement for students attending the ineligible school and is responsible for maintaining all records necessary to document student eligibility and receipt of aid (see Chapter 7 ). With a contractual agreement, the ineligible school can in general provide no more than 25% of the educational program. However, it may provide more than 25% but less than 50% of the program as long as (1) the home and ineligible schools are not owned or controlled by the same individual, partnership, or corporation; and (2) the home school's accrediting agency or state agency (in the case of a public postsecondary vocational institution) determines and confirms in writing that the agreement meets its standards for contracting out education services. Schools sometimes contract with providers of software platforms designed to support distance education programs. When such a contractor provides only the software or platform for coursework and instruction in the program is still performed by the school's own faculty under the school's supervision, such an arrangement is not considered a written arrangement under 34 CFR 668.5. However, if the contractor's staff provides instruction as part of its provision of software or other services, the school must have a contractual agreement in place that establishes the proportion of the program provided by the contractor and ensures it does not exceed the legal limits.Written arrangements between schools under same ownership or control If the written arrangement is between two or more eligible institutions that are owned or controlled by the same individual, partnership, or corporation, the Department considers the educational program to be an eligible program if the educational program offered by the school that grants the degree or cer - tificate otherwise satisfies the require - ments of an eligible program (described in this chapter), and the school that grants the degree or cer - tificate provides more than 50% of the educational program. Contracts for online program management Schools sometimes contract with providers of software and other services designed to support distance education programs. When such a contractor is only providing a service or a software platform but instruction in the program is still performed by the school's own faculty under the school's supervision, such an arrangement is not considered a written arrangement under 34 CFR 668.5. However, if the contractor's staff provides instruction as part of its provision of software or other services, the school must have a contractual agreement in place that establishes the proportion of the program provided by the contractor and ensures it does not exceed the legal limits.Internships and externships Internships and externships that are part of a program and are provided by organizations other than the institution are subject to the written arrangement requirements. However, an internship or externship portion of a program does not have to meet the written arrangement requirements if the internship or externship is governed by explicit accrediting agency standards that require the oversight and supervision of the institution, where the institution is responsible for the internship or externship and students are monitored by qualified institutional personnel.Volume 2\u2014School and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-36DISTANCE EDUCATION AND CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Schools use distance education and correspondence courses to respond to students' needs for alternatives to the schedules and locations at which courses traditionally have been offered. A school may not refuse to provide FSA funds to a student because she is enrolled in correspondence or distance education courses unless the courses are not part of an eligible program. Some participating institutions contract with distance education providers that are not eligible to participate in the FSA programs. These participating institutions must ensure that they do not exceed the limitations on contractual arrangements (see previous section). Distance education A distance education program at a domestic school is considered an eligible FSA program if it has been accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department for accreditation of distance education. It is not subject to the rules that apply to correspondence coursework, which are discussed in the next section. Distance education means education that uses certain technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor . The interaction may be synchronous (student and instructor are in communication at the same time) or asynchronous. The technologies may include the Internet; audio conferencing; or one-way and two-way transmissions through open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, broadband lines, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless communications devices. A course taught through video cassettes or discs is also considered a distance education course but only if one of the three technologies listed is used to support interaction between the students and the instructor.Accreditation for distance education Distance education programs must be evaluated by an accrediting agency that is recognized by ED for the purpose of evaluating distance education, just as an agency must be specifically reviewed and recognized for the evaluation of correspondence education. Dear Colleague Letter GEN-06-17 includes specific instructions on notifying ED if the school intends to seek new accreditation and updating the E-App to reflect changes to the school's accreditation.Chapter 2\u2014Program FSA HB February 20192-37Correspondence courses Unlike distance education courses, which are treated the same as all other eligible programs, some restrictions apply to correspondence courses. A correspondence program at a domestic school is considered an eligible FSA program if it has been accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department for accreditation of correspondence education. A correspondence course is a home-study course for which the school provides instructional materials, including examinations on the materials, to students who are not physically attending classes at the school. Interaction between the instructor and student is limited, not regular and substantive, and primarily initiated by the student. Correspondence courses are typically self-paced. When a student completes a portion of the instructional materials, the student takes the examinations that relate to that portion of the materials and returns the examinations to the school for grading. If a course is part correspondence and part residential training, the course is considered to be a correspondence course. If a school adds distance education technology, such as electronic delivery of course materials or an online discussion board, to a correspondence course, the school must ascertain the predominant method of instruction (correspondence or distance education), keeping in mind that a distance education course must use technology to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and instructor. The school must use the rules for the predominant method in administering the FSA programs. If a school offers more than 50% of its courses by correspondence or if 50% or more of its students are enrolled in its correspondence courses, the school loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs (see Chapter 1 ). Note that correspondence students enrolled in certificate programs are not eligible for FSA funds. For a full discussion of when a school may pay a student for correspondence study, see Volume 1, Chapter 1. Also see Volume 3, Chapter 2 for limitations on the cost of attendance for correspondence students and Volume 3, Chapter 1 for the timing of disbursements to correspondence students.Correspondence courses and institutional eligibility 34 CFR education\" HEA Sec. 102(a)(3)(A) and (B) A combined correspondence and residential program example A school offers a truck driving program, the first part of which is offered via correspondence. After completing that part of the program, the student has to attend a residential site where he learns how to drive trucks. This is a correspondence program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AND CLOCK-HOUR TO CREDIT-HOUR CONVERSIONS The credit hour definition and the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion rules serve two purposes: to determine program eligibility and to determine the award amount for certain FSA programs. In this section, we discuss the first of these topics\u2014the use of the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion rules in determining if a program meets the minimum program length requirements discussed earlier in the chapter. Definition of a clock hour A clock hour is defined as a period of time consisting of 1. a 50- to 60-minute class, lecture, or recitation in a 60-minute period; 2. a 50- to 60-minute faculty-supervised laboratory, shop training, or internship in a 60-minute period; or 3. sixty minutes of preparation in a correspondence course. Definition of a credit hour A credit hour is an amount of work that reasonably approximates not less than 1. one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or at least the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 2. at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. The regulations make an exception to this definition in the case of programs that are subject to one of the clock-hour/credit-hour conversion formulas, as described in the following text.Clock-hour to credit-hour conversions 34 CFR 668.8(k) & (l) See the Program Integrity Q&As at www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ hearulemaking/2009/credit.html#credit. Definitions of clock hour and credit hour 34 CFR 600.2 Measuring attendance in clock hours A student's period of attendance is measured according to one of several commonly accepted academic standards. A clock hour is based on an actual hour of attendance (though each hour may include a 10-minute break). Credit hours are typically based on two hours of homework for each hour of class attendance. A school is not permitted to count more than one clock hour per 60-minute period; in other words, a school may not schedule several hours of instruction without breaks and then count clock hours in 50-minute increments. For instance, a school could not consider seven consecutive hours of instruction to be 8.4 hours by dividing 50 minutes into 420 minutes. Seven 60-minute periods of instruction may not count for more than seven clock hours. Exemption if ED determines that the program offers \"equivalent degree\" The regulations also stipulate that the school is exempted from using the clock- hour/credit-hour formulas if the Department determines that the program provides a degree equivalent to an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, or a professional degree. This does not permit a school to ask for a determination that a nondegree program is equivalent to a degree program.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & HB February 20192-39Clock-hour to credit-hour conversions in determining program eligibility If your school offers an undergraduate educational program in credit hours that is considered a GE program, it must use one of the following conversion formulas unless the program is at least two academic years in length and provides an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, a professional degree, or an equivalent degree as determined by the Department; or each course within the program is acceptable for full credit toward a single associate degree, bachelor's degree, professional degree provided by that institution, or equivalent degree as determined by the Department, provided that 1) the school's degree requires at least two academic years of study; and 2) the school demonstrates that students enroll in, and graduate from, the degree program. The formula will determine if after the conversion the program includes the minimum number of credit hours to qualify as an eligible program for FSA purposes. For determining the number of credit hours in that educational program a semester hour must include at least 37.5 clock hours of instruction, a trimester hour must include at least 37.5 clock hours of instruction, and a quarter hour must include at least 25 clock hours of instruction. For more information on how to perform the clock-hour/credit-hour conversion, see the Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversion Example at the end of this chapter. Rounding A school must have a policy that specifies the number of decimal places it will use in the steps of its calculation, and round at each of the steps in the calculation to that number of significant figures. Because the results of these formulas determine the eligibility of a program, the resulting number of credit hours both in each step and final result may not be rounded up. Since the E-app accepts whole numbers only, when reporting on the E-app, a school must round down to the whole number. In determining the enrollment level of a student, a school must use the exact number of significant figures (decimals places) specified in its policy on rounding.Clarification Exception example Although for a program to be eligible for the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion exception all of the classes must be acceptable for full credit toward a degree program at the school, only a majority need to actually be accepted into the program. For example, a school has a two-year program in plumbing and a bachelor's degree program in construction technology. Any of the five plumbing courses taken by a student in the two-year plumbing program may be used to satisfy the plumbing requirement in construction technology. However, that requirement is only for three plumbing courses, and no more than that can be accepted toward the construction technology degree. But since all of the plumbing courses that are part of the two-year program are acceptable in the bachelor's program and a majority (three out of five or 60%) will be accepted, the plumbing program qualifies for the exception.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary 20192-40Credits approved by state and accrediting agencies When states and accrediting agencies approve programs, they sometimes also approve the number of credits in those programs. The credits approved by states and accrediting agencies are not necessarily the credits that will be approved if the program becomes eligible for Title IV aid. For Title IV purposes, the number of credits in the program will be those determined by the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion formula, but they will never be more than those approved by a state or accrediting agency. State requirements and credit-hour to clock-hour conversions If a state requires that a program that prepares students for a recognized occupation be composed of a minimum number of hours of training and a school offers a GE program that prepares a student for that occupation, the number of hours in the program cannot exceed the state minimum by more than 50%. For example, if Alaska requires that students preparing for a career in air conditioning and refrigeration repair complete 1,000 hours of training, the Department will not approve Title IV participation for any GE program (clock hour or credit hour) in air conditioning and refrigeration repair that is composed of more than 1,500 hours (150% X 1,000). If a school provides a credit-hour GE program that is subject to the clock-hour to credit hour conversion, and the school includes out-of-class hours in the conversion calculation (using the \"Full Formula\" described at the end of this chapter), the school must include those out- of-class hours when determining whether the hours in the program exceed the minimum hours required by the state by more than 50%. If a school applies the appropriate formula and finds that a program is eligible, the converted credit hours are used to determine the amount of FSA funds that a student who is enrolled in the program is eligible to receive as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 .State/accrediting agency criteria The regulations for state and accreditation agencies explain how an agency reviews a school's assignment of credit hours. 34 CFR 602.24 and 603.24Chapter February 20192-41Out-of-class student work The school's minimum number of clock hours of instruction per credit may be less if its designated accrediting agency or recognized state agency for the approval of public postsecondary vocational institutions for participation in the FSA programs has not identified any deficiencies with the school's policies and procedures for determining the credit hours that the school awards for programs and courses. In such cases student work outside of class combined with the clock hours of instruction must meet or exceed the numeric requirements (37.5 or 25), and a semester hour must include at least 30 clock hours of instruction, a trimester hour must include at least 30 clock hours of instruction, and a quarter hour must include at least 20 hours of instruction. Merely having coursework that is outside of class does not mean a school can automatically divide by 30 or 20. The minimum may be higher than 20 or 30 depending on the amount of out-of-class work that is expected in the different educational activities of a program and may vary depending on the particular activity. The case study that follows illustrates a method for accurately accounting for any out-of-class work a student may have in a course. Also, the amount of out-of-class work in a particular course or activity in a program does not carry over to other courses or activities.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and to Credit-Hour Conversion Example Prejean Community College (PCC), a public institution located in Louisiana that offers its courses in a semester format, has been told by the state that it must begin offering a 27 semester-hour career-training program previously offered in a clock-hour format by a post-secondary vocational-technical school. The program does not lead to a degree, and all of its courses do not transfer into a single degree program at the institution. Therefore, the program is subject to the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion. Alice Defontes, PCC's financial aid officer discovers that a school has two options when performing a clock- hour/credit-hour conversion\u2014a Default Formula and a Full Formula. Alice decides to perform the calculation both ways in order to determine which option would most benefit students, and that she will ultimately select. Neither the state or PCC's accrediting agency specifies rounding rules, but PCC's policies and procedures state that PCC performs calculations to 2 decimal points and awards credits using whole credit hours. The program's information is as follows: To apply the Default Formula, Alice ignores the out-of-class hours and simply divides the number of hours of in- class instruction by 37.5 and rounds down to the nearest whole number. As she performs the calculation using the Default Formula, Alice must keep in mind the following rules: A school must perform the calculations on each individual component (course) in the program. Regardless of the results of the conversion calculation, a school cannot award more credit for Title IV purposes than the academic credit assigned to a course by the school and/or approved by its state or accrediting agency. A school must have a policy that specifies the number of decimal places (fractions of credit hours) it will use in its calculation. A school that elects to round its calculations, when determining student eligibility, must round down at the level of each individual course or educational activity. The school must not wait until the last step and round the total.Course Hours of Classroom InstructionOut-of-Class Hours in CourseCredits assigned by school 1 105 30 4 2 83 18 4 3 78 25 4 4 111 35 2 5 195 45 6 Externship 375 0 7 Total 947 153 27 The first four courses are offered in the first semester, and the fifth course and the externship are offered in the second semester.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-43Default Formula Semester 1 Course Hours of Classroom InstructionCredits assigned by schoolConversion Calculation 1 105 4 105/37.5 = 2.80 rounded to 2 2 83 4 83/37.5 = 2.21 rounded to 2 3 78 4 78/37.5 = 2.08 rounded to 2 4 111 2 111/37.5 = 2.96 rounded to 2 Totals 377 14 8 Semester 2 5 195 6 195/37.5 = 5.20 rounded to 5 Externship 375 7 375/37.5 = 10.0 limited to 71 Totals 570 13 12 Program Totals947 27 20 1 Regardless of the results of the conversion calculation, a school cannot award more credit for Title IV purposes than the academic credit assigned to a course by the institution, and/or approved by a state or accrediting agency.Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversion Example (Continued) After applying the Default Formula, Alice finds that during the first semester of the program, students are eligible to be paid for only 8 credit hours of instruction. Because this is less than the full-time student minimum of 12 credit hours, students who attend the first semester are eligible to be paid for only half-time attendance. In the second semester of the program, students are eligible to be paid for 12 credit hours of instruction. Students attending the second semester can be paid as full-time students. Including the two previous rules, Alice must now follow some additional rules when applying the Full Formula. Since Alice cross trains her staff, she gathers Barry, Jack, Lucille, Agnes and Miles, and together they make the following list of the rules. Performing the Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversion using the Full Formula A school must perform the calculations on each individual component (course) in the program. Regardless of the results of the conversion calculation, a school cannot award more credit for Title IV purposes than the academic credit assigned to a course by the school and/or approved by its state or accrediting agency. A school must satisfy the requirement that a credit hour must include at least 30 in-class hours of instruction for a program offered in semesters or trimesters or 20 clock-hours of instruction for a program offered in quarters. A school may include in the conversion calculation only 7.5 out-of-class hours for every 30 in-class hours for a semester program, and 5 out-of-class hours for every 20 in-class hours in a quarter hour program.Volume 2\u2014School 20192-44Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversion Example (Continued) A school must have a policy that specifies the number of decimal places (fractions of credit hours) it will use in its calculation. A school that elects to round its calculations, when determining student eligibility, must round down at the level of each individual course or educational activity. The school must not wait until the last step and round the total. As Alice calculates the program's eligibility using the Full Formula, she will proceed through the following steps: Step 1 For each course, calculate the maximum number of credits your course could be eligible for by dividing the hours of classroom instruction by 30 if the course is offered in semester or trimesters and 20 if the course is offered in quarters. Step 2 Multiply the maximum number of credits by 7.5 to find the number of out-of-class hours required for the course to be worth that maximum number of credit hours. Step 3 If, after rounding, the number of out-of-class hours is equal to or greater than the number of out-of-class hours required, then the course is worth the number of credits established in Step 1. If not, go to Step 4. Step 4 Sum the in-class hours and out-of-class hours and divide by 37.5 hours (for a program offered in semesters or trimesters) or 25 hours (for a course offered in quarters) and go to step 5. Step 5 Apply school's rounding policy\u2014either one mandated by the state or the accrediting agency or otherwise chosen by the school and included in its policies and procedures. You must round down to the whole number or decimal specified in your school's policies.

For example, 105 in-class hours divided by 30 equals 3.5, which multiplied by 7.5 equals 26.25. For this class, the maximum number of out-of-class hours that may be considered is 26.25. 2 Regardless of the results of the conversion calculation, a school cannot award more credit for Title IV purposes than the academic credit assigned to a course by the institution, and/or approved by a state or accrediting agency.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written HB February 20192-45Clock-Hour to Credit-Hour Conversion Example (Continued) For the first semester of the program, students are eligible for payment for only 9 credit hours of instruction. Because this is less than the full-time student minimum of 12 credit hours, students who attend the first semester are eligible to be paid for only 3/4-time attendance. In the second semester of the program, students are eligible to be paid for 13 credit hours of instruction. Students attending the second semester can be paid as full-time students. The state of Louisiana requires 700 clock hours for employment in the occupation for which the program prepares students. Therefore, the maximum number of hours included in the conversion calculation cannot be more than 150% of 700 or 1,050 hours. Since the sum of the number of classroom hours and out-of-class hours (after the limits are applied) in the Full Formula is 1,065.5 (377 + 91.5 + 570 + 45) and that total exceeds 1,050, Alice cannot use the Full Formula results unless the school reduces the number of in-class or out-of-class hours in the program to the point at which the sum of the number of classroom hours and out-of-class hours (after the limits are applied) is less than or equal to 1,050.

U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Inspector General, 2016. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/nonfed/schoolservicerauditguide.pdf This chapter describes aid-related requirements a school must meet to participate in the Federal Student Aid programs. Many of these requirements require coordination with other school offices. For instance, the requirements for adequate staffing, the incentive compensation prohibition, and hiring restrictions related to the misuse of government funds might apply to your school's human resources office. Similarly, your school's academic divisions and its business office will need to be aware of the standards for satisfactory progress policies, readmission of service members, and in-state tuition rates for service members and their families.ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE Consistency of information and conflicting information A school must have a system of identifying and resolving discrepan - cies in all FSA-related information received by any school office. A school must resolve discrepancies for all students, not just those selected for veri - fication. Resolution includes determining what information is correct and documenting the school's findings in the student's file. Such a system must include a review of: All student aid applications, need analysis documents, multiple reporting records, potential overawards from COD, statements of educational purpose, statements of registration status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on behalf of each applicant. The Student Aid Report/ISIR for a student. Even if a school has already verified the information on a student's SAR/ISIR, it must review all information on subsequent SARs/ISIRs. Any documents, including copies of federal tax return and tax account transcripts, that are normally collected by the school to verify information received from the student or other sources. Any other information submitted or normally available to the school regarding a student's citizenship, previous educational experience, or Social Security number or other factors relating to the student's eligibility for FSA funds. For instance, if a student receives an academic scholarship through one school office, that office must notify the aid administrator of these benefits to ensure that the amounts are correctly reported on the student's aid application and are counted as estimated financial assistance for the Campus-based and Direct Loan programs.Related information Financial Standards, Chapter 4 Consumer Information, Campus Safety, Reports, & Other Requirements, Chapter 6 Records, Electronic Processes, Chapter 7 Administrative capability To participate in the FSA programs, a school must demonstrate that it is administratively capable of providing the education it promises and of properly managing the FSA programs. 34 CFR 668.16 FSA Assessments To assess your school's compliance with these requirements, see Activity 1 under \"Conflicting Information\" in the \"Verification A school's admissions or registrar's office must provide the aid office with any information it has that might affect a student's eligibility, such as the student's enrollment in an ineligible pro - gram or in summer classes immediately preceding a fall term of enrollment. A school's business office must inform the aid office whenever it receives information about a student receiving an outside scholarship. There is a distinction between how long you need to be alert for con - flicting information and how long you have to actually resolve a conflict. Even if the processing year has ended, you must continue to resolve con - flicting information unless all aid for the period of enrollment has been disbursed, at the time of disbursement there was no conflicting informa - tion, and the student is no longer enrolled at the school (and is not in - tending to reenroll). You may not ignore a document in your files unless a student is no longer enrolled. If you have conflicting information in your files, you must resolve it as expeditiously as possible. If you become aware of con - flicting information for a student who is no longer enrolled and there is aid to be disbursed, you must resolve the conflict before making the late or post-withdrawal disbursement. If aid that the school was unaware of is received after the end of a period of enrollment for a student who is intending to re-enroll, that aid must be treated as estimated financial assistance for either the period of enrollment just completed or for the subsequent period of enrollment. See the discussion of estimated financial assistance and packaging in Volume 3 . Remember, if any office at your school has information that might affect a student's eligibility for FSA funds, it must provide that informa - tion to the school's designated coordinating official (described later). That person must forward it to the financial aid office, where procedures must be in place to ensure that any conflicting information is resolved and doc - umented before the student receives any (or any additional) FSA funds.Death of a student If a student dies during the award year, the school isn't required to resolve conflicting information. OIG referrals 34 CFR 668.16(g)Students who turn out to be ineligible Sometimes resolving conflicting information will reveal that a previously eligible student who received Title IV aid was actually ineligible, for example, a student who indicated on his FAFSA that he had a high school diploma when he really did not. In such cases the student must return* all the Title IV aid he received (except earned FWS wages) while ineligible, even if it was in a previous award year. Also, you are required to update COD data to reflect the adjustments. If you suspect that the student intended to deceive rather than made a mistake, see \"OIG referrals\" later in this chapter. * While the student is generally responsible for repaying aid in such cases, there might be situations where the school is responsible. See DHC-Q4 at ( www2.ed.gov/ February 2019 2-49Sources of conflicting information include: tax returns or schedules, Federal tax transcripts, other information provided by the student to the financial aid office, supplemental financial aid applications, other offices within the school, offices at other educational institutions (not just aid offices), the Department, scholarships and information from outside sources, state agencies such as scholarship and vocational rehabilitation agencies, Workforce Investment Act offices, etc., tips from outside sources, transcripts from other colleges, SARs or ISIRs, verification, C flags, reject codes, comment codes. Examples of conflicting information include: citizenship status, accuracy of SSN, default or overpayment status, changes in student's academic status (including grade level progression), elements considered in determining Cost of Attendance other student financial assistance or resources, and inconsistent information used in calculating the student's EFC. Conflicting information does not include such things as a household size that differs from the number of exemptions on a tax return; dependency under IRS rules vs. ED definition of dependency; a roster of candidates for an outside scholarship, as opposed to a list of recipients; privacy-protected information, such as information from professional counselors, chaplains, doctors, etc.; assumptions made by the Central Processing System; and a student who has an expired immigration document but whose secondary confirmation match is successful.Sources and Examples of Conflicting InformationVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-50OIG referrals A school must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) any credible information indicating that an applicant for federal student aid may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application. Common misconduct includes false claims of independent student status, false claims of citizenship, use of false identities, forgery of signa - tures of certifications, and false statements of income. Remember that fraud is the intent to deceive as opposed to a mistake. If you suspect such intent on the part of a student, report it to the OIG by phoning 1-800-MISUSED. Schools must also refer to the OIG any third-party servicer who may have engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the FSA Programs. It is always appropriate for a financial aid administrator to consult with a school's legal counsel prior to referring suspected cases of fraud or misconduct to an agency outside of the school. Referrals to the IG are also mentioned in the Application and Verification Guide. Coordinating official A school must designate a capable individual to be the coordinating official. This person performs a key role in demonstrating the school's administrative capability. She administers the FSA programs and coordi - nates the aid from those programs with that from all other sources (fed - eral, state, school, and private). As noted earlier, all the information the school receives and any changes processed by an office of the school that might affect a student's FSA eligibility are communicated to the coordi - nating official and by her to the financial aid office. For example, when aid administrators create a student's financial aid package, they must consider financial assistance (scholarships, grants, awards, etc.) the student is receiving from external and internal sources to ensure that he is not overawarded. Therefore, any information the school's admissions office or an academic department gets about finan - cial assistance a student is receiving must be made available to the co - ordinating official. Another example is that the financial aid office must be informed of any changes in a student's enrollment status. Therefore, whenever he adds or drops a class, changes from credit to audit, or with - draws from school, the change must be communicated to the coordinat - ing official.Separation of function For further guidance on the separation of functions, contact the appropriate school participation division.Coordinating official\u2014definition of capable individual 34 CFR 668.16(b)(1) An individual is \"capable\" if he or she is certified by the state in which the school is located, if state certification is required. Other factors affecting capability include the individual's successful completion of FSA program training provided or approved by the Department and previous experience and documented success in FSA program administration.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative HB February 2019 2-51Counseling Schools must provide adequate financial aid counseling to all enrolled and prospective students and their families. In addition, schools must also provide entrance and exit counseling for student borrowers in the Direct Loan progr ams and exit counseling for borrowers in the Perkins Loan Programs. For a complete discussion of Direct Loan counseling requirements, see Chapter 6 . For a discussion of Perkins counseling and disclosure requirements, see Volume 6 . Adequate staffing To manage a school's aid programs effectively, the aid administrator must be supported by an adequate number of professional and clerical personnel. The number of staff that is adequate depends on the num - ber of students aided, the number and types of programs in which the school participates, the number of applicants evaluated and processed, the amount of funds administered, and the type of financial aid delivery sys - tem the school uses. What may be adequate at one school may be insuf - ficient at another. The Department will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a school has an adequate number of qualified persons, based on program reviews, audits, and information provided on the school's appli - cation for approval to participate in the FSA programs. System of checks and balances In addition to having a well-organized financial aid office staffed by qualified personnel, a school must ensure that its administrative proce - dures for the FSA programs include an adequate system of internal checks and balances. This system, at a minimum, must separate the functions of authorizing payment and disbursing or delivering funds so that no single person or office exercises both functions for any student receiving FSA funds. Small schools are not exempt from this requirement even though they may have limited staff. Individuals working in either authorization or disbursement may perform other functions as well but not both au - thorization and disbursement. These two functions must be performed by individuals who are not members of the same family and who do not together exercise substantial control over the school. If a school performs any aspect of these functions via computer, no one person may have the ability to change data that affect both authorization and disbursement. While electronic processes enhance accuracy and efficiency, they also can blur separation of functions so the awarding and disbursement oc - cur virtually simultaneously. Schools must set up controls that prevent an individual or an office from having the authority or the ability to perform both functions. Family definition and example A member of a person's family is a parent, sibling, spouse, child, spouse's parent or sibling, or sibling's or child's spouse. Example: Charlie works in the financial aid office at Krieger University, and he notices that there is an opening in the business office. He thinks of telling his daughter Sarah about the job but then realizes that because the business office disburses student aid, she would not be able to work there while he is responsible for awarding aid in the financial aid office. 34 CFR 668.15(f)(3)Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility February 2019 2-52In addition, your system also should have controls that prevent cross- functional tampering. For example, financial aid office employees should not be able to change data elements that are entered by the registrar's office. Finally, your system should only allow individuals with special security classifications to make changes to the programs that determine student need and awards, and it should be able to identify the individuals who make such changes. OWNERSHIP, EMPLOYEES, AND CONTRACTORS Debarment of school owners or staff If one of the principals of a school is debarred or suspended by a fed - eral agency, that person is prohibited from participating in any FSA pro - gram as long as the agency's procedures include due process protections that are equivalent to those provided by ED. The principals of a school include its owners, directors, officers, partners, employees, and anyone else with management or supervisory responsibilities. A principal may also be someone who is not employed by the school but who has critical influence on or substantive influence over a covered transaction (such as the receipt of Pell Grant or Campus-Based funds). For example, a principal may be someone, employed by the school or not, who is in a position to handle federal funds, is in a position to influence or control the use of those funds, or occupies a technical or professional position capable of sub - stantially influencing the development or outcome of an activ - ity required to perform the covered transaction. Schools participating in the FSA programs have a fiduciary respon - sibility to safeguard FSA funds and ensure those funds are used for the benefit of the students for whom they are intended. We expect participat - ing institutions to thoroughly examine the background of individuals they employ (or are considering employing) in management or supervisory positions. If a school discovers that a person employed in a management or supervisory capacity has been suspended or debarred by a federal agency, the school must remove that person from such a position or risk losing its FSA eligibility. Moreover, a school may not enter into a relation - ship (and must terminate an ongoing relationship) with a lender, third- party servicer, or loan servicer the school determines has been debarred or suspended.Debarment and suspension To protect the public interest, it is the policy of the federal government to conduct business only with responsible individuals. To implement this policy, the government takes debarment and suspension actions against individuals whom it determines constitute a current risk to federal agencies. Executive Order 12549 Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Part 9, Subpart 9.4) 34 CFR Part 85 Similar debarment and suspension limitations apply to lenders, third- party servicers, loan servicers, and any individuals who provide services described in 34 CFR 668.2 or 682.200 to an FSA recipient whether or not they are employed by the schoo l. Covered transactions For purposes of the debarment/ suspension rules, covered transactions include: disbursement of FSA funds to a student or borrower, certification by an educational institu - tion of eligibility for an FSA loan, and acquisition or exercise of any servicing responsibility for a grant, loan, or work study assistance under an FSA program. Checking debarment/suspension status online You can search for entity registration and exclusion records on the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-53Certifying current or prospective employees or contractors Before a school may receive FSA funding, it must certify that neither the school nor its employees have been debarred or suspended by a fed - eral agency. You can find this certification in the Program Participation Agreement and in the web-based FISAP package available to schools par - ticipating in the Campus-Based programs. The certification provided by the school is a material representation of fact relied upon by the Department when it enters into a participation agreement with the school. Moreover, a school is expected to have knowl - edge and information normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. Although the Department doesn't dictate how a school must ensure that its principals/employees have not been debarred or suspended by a federal agency, we do hold the school responsible for any information it could reasonably have been expected to know in the course of ordinary operations. In addition, we expect the school to expend a reasonable amount of effort ensuring that it and its employees are in compliance. If the Department learns that a prospective participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available, the Department may terminate the participation of the institution. A school chooses the method and frequency for making a determi - nation about the eligibility of its principals. This might include asking current and prospective employees and contractors, in person or in writ - ing, about their debarment or suspension histories. In addition, a school might also examine the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs to find out if an individual or organiza - tion is debarred or suspended. A school should discuss with its attorney the procedures appropriate to its circumstances. The employees who award FSA funds and those who disburse them should always be included in those whose backgrounds are examined. In addition, employees who participate in other transactions from which the regulations exclude individuals who have been debarred or suspended should be included. A school should consult with its attorney on the indi - viduals it must certify. The debarment or suspension of a person who is not a principal of the school and who does not work in the financial aid office will not affect the school's FSA eligibility so long as that person is not involved in any covered transactions. Disqualified individuals & PPA 34 CFR 668.14(b)(18)(i)Notifying the Department of change of control A school must report any changes of control under which a person acquires the ability to affect substantially the actions of the school. Such changes in control trigger a review to determine if the school is financially responsible (see Chapter 5 ).Control and ownership interest Definition of control 34 CFR 600.31(b) Ownership interest 34 February 2019 2-54Lower-tier covered transactions A school must not enter into lower-tier covered transactions with a debarred or suspended individual or organization. A lower-tier covered transaction is any transaction between a participant in a covered transaction (such as the school) and another individual or organization, if that transaction stems from a covered transaction. A school must obtain a certification from any lower-tier organization if the amount of the lower-tier transaction is $25,000 or more. The lower-tier organization must inform the school in writing if the organization or its principals are debarred or suspended. Therefore, the certification does not need to be renewed from year to year. Crimes involving FSA program funds Schools are prohibited from having as principals those who have engaged in the misuse of government funds or from employing or contracting with other organizations that employ such persons. Specifically, a school must not knowingly employ, in a capacity that involves the administration of the FSA programs or the receipt of funds under those programs, an individual who has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds, or has been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds; contract with a school or third-party servicer that has been limited, suspended, or terminated by the Department within the preceding five years; or terminated from the FSA programs for a reason involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds or that has been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds; contract with a school or third-party servicer that h as had, during the servicer's two most recent audits, a finding that resulted in the servicer being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the funds that the servicer administered under the Title IV programs for any year; or has been cited during the preceding five years for failure to submit audit reports required under Title IV in a timely fashion. contract with or employ any individual, agency, or organization that has been, or whose officers or employees have been: (1) convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds; or (2) administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material vio - lation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds .Referring criminal conduct to OIG The regulations provide the following examples of criminal misconduct: False claims by the school for FSA pro - gram assistance False claims of independent student status False claims of citizenship; Use of false identities Forgery of signatures or certifications; False statements of income and Payment of any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity en - gaged in any student recruitment or ad - mission activity or in making decisions regarding the award of FSA program funds. See the next section on incentive compensation.Lower-tier transactions Examples of common lower-tier covered transactions are a school's contracts with a financial aid consultant service or with a loan collection or billing agency. Sample certification statement from lower-tier organization The Department disseminated the following language in April 1989 as a model that schools may use to obtain the required certification statement from a lower-tier organization. \"The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participating in this transaction by any Federal department or agency. Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.\" Federal Register , May 26, 1988, page 19211, disseminated in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-89-21.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-55Code of conduct If a school participates in an FSA loan program, it must publish and enforce a code of conduct that includes bans on the following: revenue-sharing arrangements with any lender, steering borrowers to particular lenders or delaying loan certi - fications, and offers of funds for private loans to students in exchange for providing concessions or promises to the lender for a specific number of FSA loans, a specified loan volume, or a preferred lender arrangement. The code of conduct applies to the officers, employees, and agents of the school and must also prohibit employees of the financial aid office from receiving gifts from a lender, guaranty agency, or loan servicer. The code must also prohibit financial aid office staff (or other employ - ees or agents with responsibilities with respect to education loans) from accepting compensation for any type of consulting arrangement or contract to provide ser - vices to or on behalf of a lender relating to education loans; and service on an advisory board, commission, or group established by lenders or guarantors, except for reimbursement for reason - able expenses. Compensation for serving on an advisory board A person employed in a financial aid office who serves on an advisory board established by a lender or group of lenders cannot receive anything of value from the lender but can receive reimburs ement for reasonable ex - penses associated with participation. A school must report annually to ED any such reasonable expenses paid or provided to any employee who is employed in the financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans or other financial aid of the institution. The report must include the following: the amount of each specific instance of reasonable expenses paid or provided; the name of the financial aid official, other employee, or agent to whom the expenses were paid or provided; the dates of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided; and a brief description of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided.Advisory board compensation HEOA Section 1011 Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act Disclosures of Reimbursements for Service on Advisory Boards HEOA section 1011 HEA section 2-56CONTRACTS WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICERS Schools are permitted to contract with consultants for assistance in administering the FSA programs. However, the school ultimately is responsible for the use of FSA funds and will be held accountable if the consultant mismanages the programs or program funds. A third-party servicer administers any aspect of the school's FSA participation. Examples of functions that third-party servicers perform include the following: processing student financial aid applications, performing need analysis, and determining student eligibility or related activi - ties; certifying loans, servicing loans, or collecting loans; processing output documents for payment to students, and receiving, disbursing, or delivering FSA funds; conducting required student consumer information services; preparing and certifying requests for cash monitoring or reim - bursement funding; preparing and submitting notices and applications required of eligible and participating schools, or preparing the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP); performing default prevention/aversion activities, such as contacting student loan borrowers to discuss repayment options or borrower account history, assisting with completion and/or collection of borrower deferment or forbearance forms, performing entrance/exit loan counseling, implementation and oversight of a written default management plan, and /or accessing borrower information contained in Department systems; accessing Department systems (NSLDS, COD, CPS, etc.) that contain personally identifiable student information, and/or accessing personally identifiable student information down - loaded from a Department system to perform any Title IV function or service on behalf of an eligible institution; determining student eligibility and related activities, such as completing verification, performing satisfactory academic progress evaluations, determining award amounts, performing Return of Title IV aid calculations, and/or reconciling Title IV program accounts; and processing enrollment verification for deferment forms or NSLDS enrollment reporting.

Questions and Answers about and Examples of Third-Party Servicer Activities are available in the attachment to DCL-GEN-16-15 2-57Requirements of a third-party servicer contract Under a contract with a school, a third-party servicer agrees to comply with all Title IV provisions, which includes those that refer solely to schools as well as to servicers, and to be jointly and severally liable with the school for a violation by the servicer of any of those provisions. A school must ensure that its contracts accurately and specifically detail the functions that the servicer (or its subcontractor(s), if applicable) performs on behalf of the institution, and those functions that are required to be completed by the institution. The contract must identify the third-party servicer by its legal name and include any other name the servicer does business as (d/b/a). The contract must provide the physical address and primary phone number of the servicer's primary lo - cation, as well as the name, title, phone number, and e-mail address of the president or chief executive officer of the entity. If a third-party servicer subcontracts any of its contractual responsibilities, the contract must identify the subcontractor and clearly describe the functions performed on behalf of the servicer and institution by the subcontractor. The servicer agrees to use any Title IV funds (and interest or earn - ings on them) in accordance with the regulations and, if it disburses those funds, to confirm student eligibility and make the required returns to Title IV funds (see Volume 5 ) when a student withdraws. A third-party servicer must refer to the Department's inspector general any suspicion of crime relating to FSA program administration, including any information that there is reasonable cause to believe the school might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct per - taining to the FSA programs (see the examples in the margin). If the contract is terminated or the servicer files for bankruptcy or ceases to perform any functions prescribed under the contract, the ser - vicer must return to the school all unexpended FSA funds and records related to the servicer's administration of the school's participation in the FSA programs. For more information about elements to include in Third-Party Servicer contracts see DCL GEN 15-01, January 9, 2015, and DCL GEN-16-15, August 18, 2016. All contracts between schools and their third-party servicers must contain specific language under which the servicer agrees to comply with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and other Title IV requirements; refer any suspicion of fraudulent or criminal conduct in relation to the school's Title IV program administration to the Department's Office of the Inspector General; return all records related to the servicer's administration of the school's participation in the Title IV programs to the school;Third-party servicer definition An individual or a state or a private, profit or nonprofit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible school to administer, through manual or automated processing, any aspect of the school's participation in any Title IV program. 34 CFR 668.2 Notifying ED of third-party servicer contracts Schools must notify the Department of new third-party servicer contracts, changes t o and termination o f existing contracts, as described in Chapter 5 . No additional submission is required if a school has already submitted the same information as part of a recent application for certification or recertification. Institutional liability Both the school and third-party servicer remain liable for any and all FSA-related actions taken by the servicer on the school's behalf. TIPThird-Party Servicers and Information Security Institutions are subject to the information security requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for financial institutions. Third-party servicers must provide the same security. Third-Party Servicers and Privacy Third-party servicers must comply with all aspects of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) with regard to their receipt and use of any education records provided by the institution.ReminderVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB 2-58 confirm student eligibility and if the servicer disburses funds return Title IV funds (if required) when a student withdraws; if the servicer disburses or releases Title IV funds, return all unexpended Title IV funds to the institution if the contract with the school is terminated or the servicer ceases to perform any functions prescribed under the contract; be jointly and severally liable with the institution for any violation of Title IV requirements resulting from the functions performed by the servicer. Excluded functions Examples of functions that are not considered administering the par - ticipation in a Title IV program include: performing lockbox processing of loan payments, performing normal electronic fund transfers (EFTs) after being initiated by the school, acting as a Multiple Data Entry Processor (MDE), financial and compliance auditing, mailing documents prepared by a school or warehousing school records, participating in a written arrangement with other eligible schools to make eligibility determinations and FSA awards for certain students (see Chapter 2 ), and providing computer services or software. A person or organization performing these functions is not consid - ered to be a third-party servicer and is not subject to third-party servicer requirements. Excluded entities An employee of a school is not a third-party servicer. For this pur - pose, an employee is one who: is paid directly by the school; works full or part time or on a temporary basis; performs all duties under school supervision, whether on site or remotely; is not employed by or associ - ated with a third-party servicer; and is not a third-party servicer for any other school. A school may not have as a third-party servicer one that has been limited, suspended, or terminated by the Department within the preceding five years; has had, during the servicer's two most recent audits, a finding that resulted in the servicer being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the funds that the servicer adminis - tered under the Title IV programs for Administrative February 2019 2-59Incentive compensation in the law and regulations The prohibition of incentive compensation appears in Section 487(a)(20) of the HEA and in the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations at 34 CFR 668.14(b)(22). On March 22, 2013, the Department published a revision to the preamble of the October 29, 2010, final regulations in accordance with the remand in \"Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities v. Duncan\" 683F.3d 427 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Incentive compensation On March 17, 2011, the Department issued additional guidance on incentive compensation. In addition to the tables included in this text, that Dear Colleague Letter provided examples of how the incentive compensation rules are applied, as well as guidance on \"tuition sharing\" and \"profit sharing\" and other forms of compensation. Since that time, the Department posted additional related questions and answers to address study abroad situations for Title IV-eligible students and to clarify when bundled services provided by a third party are subject to the incentive compensation ban. See GEN-11-05 and the webpage at (www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ hearulemaking/2009/compensation. html ). \"Safe harbors\" exceptions Regulations issued on October 29, 2010, eliminated the safe harbors effective July 1, 2011. Definitions See Table 3 for regulatory definitions of commission, bonus, or other incentive payment securing enrollments or the award of financial aid entity or person engaged in any stu - dent recruitment or admission activ - ity or in making decisions about the award of financial aid, and enrollment. has been cited during the preceding five years for failure to submit audit reports required under Title IV in a timely fashion. INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROHIBITION Schools may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any individual or entity engaged in recruiting or admis - sion activities or in making decisions about awarding FSA program funds. As stated previously, only two types of activities are subject to the in - centive compensation ban: securing enrollment (recruitment) and secur - ing financial aid. No other activities are subject to the ban. The incentive compensation prohibition applies to all individuals with responsibility for recruitment or admission of students or making deci - sions about awarding FSA funds. As shown in Table 1, the Department draws a distinction between recruitment activities that involve working with individual students and policy-level determinations that affect re - cruitment, admission, or the awarding of FSA funds. The Department expects that employees who have titles such as enrollment counselors, recruitment specialists, recruiters, and enrollment managers have suffi - ciently direct involvement in recruitment that the incentive compensation ban applies to them. Senior managers and executive level employees who are only involved in the development of policy and do not engage in indi - vidual student contact or the other covered activities listed in Table 1 will not generally be subject to the incentive compensation ban. When other activities are coupled with recruitment or securing finan - cial aid, a school must consider how they compensate persons or enti - ties to avoid payments that are prohibited. Table 1 illustrates how these principles would be applied to activities that schools carry out in support of recruitment and financial aid. Payments to persons or entities that undertake or have responsibility for recruitment and decisions related to securing financial aid are subject to the incentive compensation ban even if their work also includes other activities. Schools may use factors such as seniority or length of employment as a basis for compensating employees covered by the incentive compensa - tion prohibition. Many other qualitative factors may also be used so long as they are not related to the employee's success in securing student enrollments or the award of financial aid. These factors may include such things as job knowledge and professionalism; skills such as analytic abil - ity, initiative in work improvement, clarity in communications, and use and understanding of technology; traits such as accuracy, thoroughness, dependability, punctuality, and FSA HB February 2019 2-60Two-part test to evaluate if a payment is incentive compensation 1. Is the payment a commission, bonus, or other incentive payment, defined as an award of a sum of money or something of value paid to or given to a person or entity for services rendered? 2. Is the commission, bonus, or other incentive payment provided to any person based, in any part directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid? If the answer to each question is \"yes,\" the payment would be prohibited.

For a school to exchange data with the FSA systems, it must have Internet access through its network or through an Internet service provider. Your school will also need to enroll in the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) and establish a data mailbox. (Doing this and other tasks related to electronic processing is the most frequent duty for third-party servicers.) Most schools prepare student data records in a software package such as EDExpress and transmit the records as batch files to the SAIG mailbox. The Department's systems send edited records back to the SAIG mailbox, where the school downloads the records and uses its software to update the records in its own database. Schools must use COD's common record format, complying with the published schema for the corresponding award year, to send and receive origination and disbursement data for Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, and Direct Loans. This format uses Extensible Markup Language (XML). To create and edit student records, your school may use the Department's EDExpress software, develop its own software, or rely on a third-party software vendor. If you are not using EDExpress software to prepare your records, it is your responsibility to ensure that the software you use is capable of generating COD records in XML format. As an alternative, you can now create and edit student records directly on many of our websites, such as COD, CPS, and NSLDS. When creating and editing records on the Web, you do not use PC software and you do not have to transmit the changes through your SAIG mailbox. Electronic processes 34 CFR 668.16 (o) 55418-55420 Validation of TG Numbers Required by December 14, 2018 Every organization enrolled for a Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) account is required to review and validate its assigned TG numbers and Electronic Services user accounts by December 14, 2018. This includes TG numbers (SAIG mailboxes) with access to the NSLDS Professional Access website, the COD Web Site, and all FAA Access to CPS Online and EDconnect user accounts. It also includes TG numbers enrolled for SAIG batch services for the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS\u00ae), the Central Processing System (CPS), the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System, and the Financial Management System (FMS). Failure to accurately complete this process by December 14, 2018 will result in loss of access to Federal Student Aid data systems, including services such as Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) deliveries, ISIR requests, Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA\u00ae) corrections, and NSLDS enrollment reporting and updates.

Several of Federal Student Aid's systems, such as COD, eCB, and NSLDS, are located behind the Access and Identity Management System (AIMS), for which users have a single ID and pass - word. From March 7, 2014, on, an ID that has not been used within 90 days will be suspended or, after 365 days, deactivated. See the electronic announcement from 1/24/14 for more infor - mation and instructions how to reinstate a suspended or deactivated user ID.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL 2019 2-65Information for Financial Aid Professionals (IFAP) Program information is communicated through our IFAP website (ifap.ed.gov ) in the form of electronic announcements, Dear Colleague letters, and Federal Registers. One of the most useful features of this website is its notification service, which sends you daily or weekly emails that summarize recent postings to IFAP. (Go to \"My IFAP\" on the web - site and select \"New User Registration.\") Even if you use a third-party servicer to manage your student aid activities, you are responsible for knowing about all new statutory, regula - tory, and procedural requirements. The IFAP website is a convenient and comprehensive place to get that information. The IFAP site also has links to all major FSA websites and services and a \"Help\" link that includes contact information for FSA call centers and customer service offices. Minimum system requirements In the past ED has issued the minimum system requirements schools must meet to participate in the Department's electronic processes. (The most recent issuance was for 2005-2006 and gave an optimal configu - ration of a 2.8 GHz/333 MHz processor and 80 GB hard drive with a high-speed Internet connection.) When reviewing your office's computer needs, you should be aware that its system requirements (processor speed, RAM, hard-drive storage, etc.) will depend on which FSA functions the school uses, the number of records processed, and school database inter - faces.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Perkins Go to iLibrary > NSLDS Reference Materials on the IFAP website for NSLD S newsletters, updates, and other information.

Enrollment information is used to determine if the student is still considered in school, must be moved into repayment, or is eligible for an in-school deferment. Program-level enrollment data is also used to determine a student's eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans. For students moving into repayment, the out-of-school status effective date determines when the grace period begins and how soon a student must begin repaying loan funds. You're required to report changes in the student's enrollment status, the effective date of the status, and an antici - pated completion date. You must report enrollment status at both the school and program level. For this purpose an academic program is defined as the combina - tion of your school's Office of Postsecondary Education Identification (OPEID) number and the program's Classification of Instructional Pro - gram (CIP) code, credential level, and published program length. When a student is enrolled in more than one major (or comparable designation under your school's academic policies), each is considered an academic program and is reported separately whether the student receives separate degrees or certificates for each major or only receives one for completing the requirements for all majors. Enrollment in a minor is not a separate program and therefore would not be reported as such. Report a student's \"active enrollment status\" (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, and less than half-time) based on the total number of credit or clock hours in which he or she is enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether specific credits apply to the academic program being reported. See DCL GEN-14-17 for examples and more information. NSLDS will send a roster file electronically to your school or its des - ignated servicer every 60 days (or more frequently depending on your schedule) through its SAIG mailbox. The file includes all of the school's students who are identified in NSLDS as Pell recipients, Stafford (Direct and FFEL) Loan borrowers or the beneficiaries of a PLUS loan. The file is not necessarily connected to loans made at your school\u2014it may also re - port information for students who received some or all of their FSA loans at other schools but are currently attending your school. Your school or servicer must certify the information and re - turn the roster file within 15 days of receiving it. You may also go to (www.nsldsfap.ed.gov ) and update information for your students online. As already noted, you must report enrollment changes within 30 days; however, if a roster file is expected within 60 days, you may provide the updated data on that roster file.Enrollment To NSLDS During The Summer A student is considered to be continuously enrolled at least half time during the summer, or in another period in which students are not generally expected to attend classes, as long as there is no reason for the school to be - lieve that the student will not enroll on an at least half time basis for the next regularly scheduled term; and the student was enrolled at least half time at the end of the previous regularly scheduled term. Therefore, a student should not be reported to NSLDS as \"Withdrawn\" as of the end of the spring term if the student was enrolled at least half time during the spring term and is expected to enroll at least half time for the upcoming fall term.ReminderChapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-67If the roster file that you are returning contains records that don't pass the NSLDS enrollment reporting edits, you will receive a response file with the records that didn't pass. Within 10 days you'll need to make the necessary corrections to these records and resubmit them. If you are using a servicer, you may need to assist the servicer in correcting these errors. Please remember that your school is ultimately responsible for no - tifying NSLDS of student enrollment changes. When your school reports enrollment data to the NSLDS, it does not have to complete enrollment reporting rosters received directly from guaranty agencies. Additionally, your school may request that a lender confirm a borrower's enrollment status using NSLDS rather than com - pleting an in-school deferment form. Updating borrower information at separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling rather than have students complete it on studentloans.gov must, within 60 days after the exit counseling session, provide the appropriate federal loan servicer or the guaranty agency for FFEL that is listed in the borrower's student aid records any updated information about: her name, address, references, future permanent address, Social Security number, the identity and ad - dress of her expected employer, the address of her next of kin, and her driver's license number and state of issuance. This information may be uploaded with the NSLDS Exit Counseling Submittal template at (https://fsadownload.ed.gov/ ). NSLDS will then provide the data to the appropriate loan holders. Sharing information about delinquent and defaulted borrowers To promote loan repayment, schools are encouraged to notify the ap - propriate Direct Loan servicer with new information about a delinquent borrower's location or employment and to work with defaulted borrowers to bring their loans out of default. The Direct Loan servicers send electronic reports to participating schools listing all delinquent and defaulted Direct Loan borrowers who took out loans while attending the school. The report, which contains the borrowers' names, addresses, and phone numbers, is organized by the number of days past due so that schools can contact and counsel borrow - ers to avoid default. Schools can also request delinquency reports through NSLDS (viewable online or for delivery to their TG mailbox) for all their borrowers with any of the DL servicers. A former FFEL school may agree to provide the holders of delinquent loans information about delinquent borrowers' location or employment. The school may also try to contact borrowers and counsel them to avoid default.Updating enrollment information on the Web You can create or update student enrollment status by using the \"Enroll\" tab on the NSLDS Professional Access site (https://www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/ ). Phone support: 1-800-999-8219 Accurate program-level reporting It is critical to completely and accurately report students' program-level enrollment information to NSLDS. This information is used to determine the subsidy status of loans under the 150% Direct Subsidized Loan Limit and for other purposes. Pay particular attention to correctly reporting published program length, the field for which is a six-digit number with an implied decimal after the third digit. See the electronic announcements from December 23, 2014 ,and May 13, 2016. Enrollment status codes These codes are used for enrollment reporting and are listed in the Enrollment Reporting Guide: F = Full time Q = At least three-quarter time but less than full time H = At least half time but less than three-quarter time L = Less than half time G = Graduated W = Withdrawn (voluntary or involuntary) A = Approved Leave of Absence D = Deceased X = Never attended Z = Record not foundReceiving roster files A school or its servicer must sign up to receive roster files through the SAIG Enrollment site (https://fsawebenroll.ed.gov/ ).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility February 2019 2-68Former FFEL schools ask a guaranty agency to provide informa - tion about students who were enrolled at the school who have defaulted on their Stafford loans. The guarantor may not charge for this informa - tion. The school may also ask the guarantor to notify the school when - ever a lender requests default aversion assistance on a loan made at your school, and provide the borrower's name, address, and Social Security number. The guaranty agency may charge a reasonable fee for this service. Your school may only use the information to remind the borrower to re - pay her loan(s). If you've requested it, the guaranty agency must also notify your school when loans to its students are sold, transferred, or assigned to another holder. The notification must include the address and telephone number of the new loan holder. This notification requirement only ap - plies to loans that are in the grace period or repayment and only if your school was the last the borrower attended before the loan entered repay - ment. For instance, if a student received Stafford Loans earning a bach - elor's degree at your school but pursued a master's degree at another school before those loans entered repayment, the guarantor is not re - quired to notify you if the loans are sold. FINANCIAL AID HISTORY AND TRANSFER MONITORING A school must consider a student's financial aid history in making FSA program awards. The regulations require that schools use NSLDS data to ob - tain information about a student's financial aid history. To receive a student's financial aid history, your school must register for the Transfer Student Monitoring Process . Through this process, NSLDS will monitor a transfer student's financial aid history and alert you to any relevant changes\u2014other than the default and overpayment information reported in the postscreening process\u2014that may affect the student's current award(s). You must send NSLDS identifying information (or enter it online) for students transferring to your school so that NSLDS can use transfer moni - toring to notify you of changes to their financial aid history. You may send information for students who have expressed an interest in attending your school even if they have not yet formally applied for admission. You can find a complete discussion of this requirement and the trans - fer student monitoring process in Volume 1, Chapter 3 .Financial aid history 34 CFR 668.19 DCL GEN-00-12 DCL GEN-01-09, July 2001 (including July 16, 2001, update)Privacy: sharing student records with lenders A student authorizes his school to release information to lenders by signing the promissory note as part of the loan application process. This authorization covers information relevant to the student's or parent's eligibility to borrow as well as locating the borrower. Examples of such information are enrollment status, financial assistance, and employment records. See Chapter 7 for more information about recordkeeping and privacy. Loan information from the guarantor Upon request, the guarantor must inform the school of students in default on FFELs. 34 CFR 682.401(b)(24) If the lender requests preclaims assistance, the guarantor must inform the school of this request if the school has requested such notification. 34 CFR 682.404(a)(4) Sec. 428(c)(2)(H) of the HEA The guarantor must notify the school when a loan made at that school changes hands if the school requests such information. Sec. 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA 34 CFR 682.401(b)(25) Transfer student monitoring You must verify the eligibility of transfer students for FSA funds. You may either check the student's financial aid history on the NSLDS Professional Access site or wait seven days after you've submitted the student's information for monitoring to receive a response from NSLDS. To begin using the \"inform\" feature, you must designate a contact on the \"School Transfer Profile\" page at www.nsldsfap.ed.gov DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-69SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) To be considered administratively capable, a school must have a satisfactory academic progress policy that is the same as or more strict for an FSA recipient as the school's standards for a student enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving FSA funds. Because satisfactory academic progress issues are most often raised in specific student eligibility cases, we discuss the details of SAP standards in Volume 1 , Chapter 1 , of the FSA Handbook. You should carefully review that discussion if your school is developing or amending its SAP policy. Basic elements of an SAP policy As discussed in Volume 1 , a school's policy must include evaluations at least annually for programs longer than one year and every payment period for programs of one year or less. There must be a qualitative component consisting of a minimum grade point average or comparable factor that is measurable against a norm. For programs longer than two academic years, the policy must stipulate that a student must have at the end of the second year a GPA of at least a \"C\" or its equivalent or have an academic standing consistent with the school's requirements for graduation. There must also be a quantitative component that consists of a maximum time frame in which a student must complete her educational program and a pace of completion that ensures she will complete the program within the time frame. In addition, your school's policy must explain the effect of ESL and remedial courses on progress, how progress is measured if a student changes majors or seeks to earn additional degrees, how course repetitions are handled, whether you have appeals for an adverse SAP determination and the procedures for any such appeals, and the procedures for otherwise re-establishing satisfactory progress. The policy must include provisions for consistent application of the standards to all students within categories (e.g., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, and graduate students) and educational programs established by the school. Generally, the quantitative and qualitative standards used to judge academic progress include all periods of the student's enrollment. Even periods in which the student did not receive FSA funds must be counted.Satisfactory academic progress School policy: February 2019 2-70PROVISIONS FOR U.S. ARMED FORCES MEMBERS AND FAMILY In-state tuition rates for active duty service members and family attending public institutions A public postsecondary school may not charge a member of the armed forces who is on active duty for a period of more than 30 days more than the school's tuition rate for residents of the state. Similarly, the service member's spouse and dependent children are entitled to the in- state tuition rate. In addition, if the service member, spouse, or dependent child pays the in-state tuition rate, the public institution must allow the person to continue to pay such a rate as long as the individual is continuously en - rolled, even if there is a subsequent change in the permanent duty station of the service member to a location outside of the state. Readmission of service members A school must promptly readmit a service member with the same academic status as he had when last attending the school or accepted for admission to the school. This requirement applies to any student who cannot attend school due to military service (see the definition in the mar - gin). The student must notify the school of his military service and inten - tion to return to school as follows: Notification of military service. The student (or an appropri - ate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the cir - cumstances. This notice does not have to indicate whether the student intends to return to the school and may not be subject to any rule of timeliness. (Timeliness must be determined by the facts in each case.) Alternatively, at the time of readmission, the student may submit an attestation of military service that necessitated the student's absence from the school. No notice is required if precluded by military necessity, such as service in operations that are classified or would be compromised by such notice. Definitions for readmission For purposes of this discussion: Military service (or service in the uniformed services)\u2014service, whether voluntary or involuntary, in the armed forces, including service by a member of the National Guard or Reserve on active duty, active duty for training, or full-time National Guard duty under federal authority, for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 consecutive days. This does not include National Guard service under state authority. Service member \u2014someone who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform, service in the uniformed services on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service. Appropriate officer \u2014A warrant, commissioned, or noncommissioned officer authorized to give such notice by the military service concerned. Definitions for tuition rates for military families Armed Forces \u2014the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Active duty \u2014 full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Active duty includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Active duty does not include full-time National Guard duty.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative FSA HB February 2019 2-71 Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of her intent to return to the school within three years after the completion of the period of service. A student who is hospitalized or convalescing due to an illness or injury incurred or aggravated during the performance of service must notify the school within two years after the end of the period needed for recovery from the illness or injury. A stu - dent who fails to apply for readmission within these periods does not automatically forfeit eligibility for readmission but is subject to the school's established leave of absence policy and general practices. A school must designate one or more offices that a student may con - tact to provide notification of service and notification of intent to return. The school may not require that these notices follow any particular format. The school must promptly readmit the student into the next class or classes in the program beginning after he provides notice of intent to reenroll, unless he requests a later date or unusual circumstances require the school to admit him at a later date. This requirement supersedes state law\u2014for example, a school must readmit a qualifying service member to the next class even if that class is at the maximum enrollment level set by the state. The school must admit the student with the same academic status, which means to the same program to which the student was last admitted or, if that exact program is no longer offered, the program that is most similar to that program, unless she chooses a different program; at the same enrollment status, unless the student wants to en - roll at a different enrollment status; with the same number of credit hours or clock hours previously completed, unless the student is readmitted to a different pro - gram to which the completed credit hours or clock hours are not transferable, and with the same academic standing (e.g., with the same satisfactory academic progress status) the student previously had.Termination for bad conduct A student's readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR 668.18(h). Reasonable efforts to help prepare student If the school determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where she left off or will not be able to complete the program, the school must make reasonable efforts at no extra cost to help her become prepared or to enable her to complete the program. This includes providing refresher courses and allowing the student to retake a pretest at no extra cost. The school is not required to readmit the student if it determines that there are no reasonable efforts it can take to prepare her to resume the program at the point where she left off or to enable her to complete the pro - gram, or that after it makes reasonable efforts (those that do not place an undue hard - ship on the institution), the student is not prepared to resume or complete the program. \"Undue hardship\" means an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of the overall financial resources of the institution and the impact otherwise of such action on the operation of the institution. The school has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where she left off or that she will not be able to complete the program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 2019 2-72If the student is readmitted to the same program, for the first aca - demic year in which he returns, the school must assess the tuition and fee charges that he was or would have been assessed for the academic year during which he left the school. However, if his veterans education ben - efits or other service member education benefits will pay the higher tu - ition and fee charges that other students in the program are paying for the year, the school may assess those charges to the student as well. If the student is admitted to a different program, and for subsequent academic years for a student admitted to the same program, the school must assess no more than the tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year. The cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from the school for military service may not exceed five years. Only the time the student spends actually performing service is counted. See the next page for additional rules pertaining to cumulative length of absence.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & 2-7334 CFR 668.18 (a) General (3) This section applies to an institution that has continued in operation since the student ceased attending or was last admitted to the institution but did not begin attendance, not - withstanding any changes of ownership of the institution since the student ceased attendance. (4) The requirements of this section supersede any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this section for the period of enrollment during which the student resumes attendance, and continuing so long as the institution is unable to comply with such requirements through other means. 668.18 (e) Cumulative length of absence.

(G) Letter from National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Team Leader or Administrative Officer verifying dates and times of NDMS training or Federal activation. (ii) The types of documents that are necessary to establish eligi - bility for readmission will vary from case to case. Not all of these documents are available or necessary in every instance to estab - lish readmission eligibility. (3) An institution may not delay or attempt to avoid a readmission of a student under this section by demanding documentation that does not exist, or is not readily available, at the time of readmission..Readmission for Service Members\u2014Additional 2019 2-74Executive Order 13607 For the text of the executive order, see https://www.dodmou.com/ See also DCLs GEN-12-10, 12-12, 12-17, and 13-05 and the electronic announcements issued September 11, 2012, and January 18, 2013.Executive Order 13607: Principles of Excellence On April 27, 2012, the White House issued EO 13607, which created the Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members. The principles apply to all postsecondary schools that receive funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs. They strengthen consumer protections for students who receive these benefits and provide access to information to help them make informed choices about their college education. Adoption of the principles is voluntary but encouraged. The principles describe requirements in the following key areas: (1) providing a standardized cost form, (2) providing federal aid informa - tion, (3) aggressive and fraudulent recruiting, (4) state authorization, (5) misrepresentation, (6) incentive compensation, (7) accreditation, (8) read - mission, (9) refunds, (10) individual education plans, and (11) academic and financial counseling points of contact. Title IV schools are likely already complying with many of the prin - ciples through their participation in the Title IV programs (for example, the refund requirement). One principle requires institutions to provide affected students with a personalized and standardized form describing the students' educational costs and how those may be covered by financial aid. The Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, released by the Department in July 2012, helps institutions satisfy that principle.CHAPTERC 4FSA HB February 20192-75CFR Glossary DCL Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default Rates Schools that participate in the FSA programs are generally required to have annual compliance and financial statement audits. This chapter will discuss the audit requirement and the financial standards and limitations that apply to a school's FSA eligibility. In addition, we will discuss the annual calculation of a school's cohort default rate. FSA AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS A school that participates in any FSA program, including a participating foreign school, generally must have an independent auditor conduct an annual audit of the school's compliance with the laws and regulations that are applicable to the FSA programs in which the school participates (a compliance audit) and an audit of the school's financial statements (a financial statement audit). While a compliance audit covers the school's administration of the FSA programs, a financial statement audit provides the Department with information necessary to evaluate a school's status vis-a-vis the financial standards that are discussed later in this chapter. The type of compliance audit a school or servicer must undergo depends on its type of control: public, for-profit, or nonprofit. All for-profit schools must have an FSA compliance audit con - ducted under the Inspector General's Audit Guide (for FSA school audits), which is available on the IFAP website. Public and nonprofit schools must comply with the Single Au - dit Act. The Single Audit Act requires these schools to have an audit conducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations. (Circular A-133 allows an FSA compliance audit under the criteria of the Audit Guide under limited circumstances.) The Office of Inspector General (OIG) also conducts audits, usually in cases where there is concern over a school's administration of the FSA programs. An OIG or other federal audit does not satisfy the requirement that a school have annual compliance and financial statement audits performed by an independent public accountant. Note that audit requirements also apply to third-party servicers. However, a school may never use a third-party servicer's audit in place of its own required audit because the school is ultimately liable for its own violations as well as those incurred by its third-party servicers. School participation divisions For information regarding accounting and compliance issues, a school should contact the school participation division for its region. Go to the IFAP website ( ifap.ed.gov ) > Help > Contact Information > Federal Student Aid Offices > School Participation DivisionRelated information Administrative requirements, Chapter 3 Program reviews, Chapter 8 Audit requirements & waiver HEA: Sec. 487(c) 20 USC Waiver: 34 CFR 668.27Single Audit Act Not Applicable The Higher Education Act and the implementing regulations require annual submissions of the audit of a school's financial statements and the compliance audit of its administration of the Title IV aid programs. Therefore, a submission prepared under the Single Audit Act provisions that does not include a compliance audit does not meet the HEA audit requirement. Read the announcement from August 5, 2016.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations FSA audit submissions A school that has an audit performed under the Audit Guide for FSA schools must submit both the compliance audit and the audited financial statements within six months of the end of the school's fiscal year. Both audits must be prepared by an independent public accountant in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The compliance audit and financial statement audit may be performed by different auditors. However, the audits must be submitted as one package. Both the compliance audit and the financial statement audit must be performed on a fiscal-year basis. In cases where the school's fiscal year does not coincide with an award year, the school's compliance audit will cover parts of two award years (see example).Independent CPA/auditor An independent certified public accountant or government auditor, except that a government auditor must meet the Government Auditing Standards qualification and independence standard, including standards related to organizational independence. Opportunity to send comments to Small Business Ombudsman The Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and 10 Regional Fairness Boards were established to receive comments from small businesses about federal agency enforcement actions. The Ombudsman annually will evaluate the enforcement activities and rate each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on the enforcement actions of the Department of Education, call 1-888-REG-Fair (1-888-734-3247). Submission dates for FSA audits A school's or servicer's annual compliance and financial statements audits performed under the Audit Guide must be based upon the fiscal year and submitted to the Department within six months after the end of the school's or servicer's fiscal year. (These requirements do not apply to audits performed under the Single Audit Act that are due as specified in OMB Circular A-133.) The chart on the next page lists audit due dates and the period the audit must cover. (The chart provides information for the most common institutional fiscal-year-end dates.)Fiscal year for 2018-2019 For schools using a calendar year as their fiscal year, the most recently completed one is the fiscal year that ends on December 31, 2018. For those schools using the award year as their fiscal year, the most recently completed one will be the fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2019. July 1, June 30/July 1, June 30, 2017 2018 2019 Jan Dec 2018 2018Example: school's fiscal year FSA award year 2017-2018 award year School's 2018 fiscal year2018-2019 award year 2018 calendar year (period covered by audit) Audit Requirements for Federal Awards Title 2, Subpart A, Part 200, Subpart F Requirements 200.501 Relation to other audit requirements 200.503 Note that the full reference is Title 2 (Grants and Agreements), Subtitle A (OMB Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements), Chapter II (OMB Guidance), Part 200 (200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards), Subpart F (Audit Requirements).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, HB February 20192-77Generally, a school's first audit performed under these requirements must cover the entire period of time since the school began to participate in the FSA programs. Each subsequent audit must cover the period since the end of the period covered by the preceding audit that is accepted by the Department. Waivers of requirement for an annual FSA audit A school may request a waiver of the requirement for an annual audit for up to three years. A proprietary school must have disbursed less than $200,000 in each of the two most recently completed award years to be eligible for the waiver, and the school must also meet the other regulatory conditions in 34 CFR 668.27. A public or private nonprofit institution that expends less than $750,000 in federal funds in a fiscal year is exempt from filing compliance audits aft er the school gains initial eligibility. If a waiver is approved, at the end of the waiver period, the school must submit a compliance audit covering each individual fiscal year in the waiver period and a financial statement audit for the last year of the waiver period. This exception to the annual audit requirement may not be granted for the award year preceding a school's required recertification.Audits required at end of waiver period The regulations do not waive the requirement that a school audit its administration of the FSA programs; they waive the requirement that these audits be submitted on an annual basis. Therefore, if a school is granted a waiver for three years, when the waiver period expires and the school must submit its next compliance audit, that audit must cover the school's administration of the FSA programs since the end of the period covered by its last submitted compliance audit. The auditor for a proprietary school must audit, and attest to, the school's annual 90/10 determination for each individual year in the waiver period (in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4)). Criteria for granting waiver 34 CFR 668.27(c) Waiver for Public or Nonprofit Institution Title 2, Subpart A, 200.501(d)Audit submission due dates School's Both audits Period audited fiscal year due (financial and end date compliance) September 30, March 31, October 1, 2017, through 2018 2019 September 30, 2018 December 31, June 30, January 1, 2018, through 2018 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, September 30, April 1, 2018, through 2019 2019 March 31, 2019 June 30, December 31, July 1, 2018, through 2019 2019 June 30, 2019Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-78If the Department grants the waiver, the school does not have to submit its compliance or audited financial statement until six months after the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the school last submitted a compliance audit and audited financial statement, or the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the school last submitted compliance and financial state - ment audits if the award year in which the school will apply for recertification is part of the third fiscal year. A school's waiver request may include the fiscal year in which that request is made, plus the next two fiscal years. A school remains liable for repaying any FSA funds it improperly expends during the waiver period. A compliance audit is the vehicle for discovering improper expenditures. Therefore, a school will be required to pay any liabilities when the school eventually submits a compliance audit for the fiscal years in which it made improper expenditures.Rescinding the waiver The Department rescinds a waiver if the school disburses $200,000 or more of FSA program funds for an award year; undergoes a change in ownership re - sulting in a change of control; or becomes the subject of an emergency action or a limitation suspension, fine, or termination action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort HB February 20192-79Effects of waivers\u2014examples Example 1: The school is still required to have its administration of the FSA programs audited for the waiver period. If a school is granted a waiver for three years, when the waiver period expires, the next audit must cover the school's administration of the FSA programs since the end of the period covered by its last submitted compliance audit. For example, if a school's fiscal year coincides with an award year (July 1-June 30) and it submits a compliance audit for its fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2017, and then receives a waiver, its next compliance audit is due six months after the end of its 2019-2020 fiscal year. When it submits that audit, it must cover the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 fiscal years. Example 2: If a school's fiscal year ends June 30, 2017, and the school receives a waiver on May 1, 2017, that includes the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 fiscal years, the next compliance audit is due six months after the end of the school's 2019-2020 fiscal year.Qualifying for and Effects of Waivers Qualifying for a waiver To qualify for a waiver, a school must demonstrate that it is not a foreign school; disbursed less than $200,000 in FSA program funds during each of the two completed award years prior to the audit period; agrees to keep records relating to each award year in the unaudited period for two years after the end of the regular record retention period for the award year; has participated in the FSA programs under the same ownership for at least three award years preceding the school's waiver request; is financially responsible under the general requirements of financial responsibility and does not rely on the alternative standards and requirements of exceptions to participate in the FSA programs; is not receiving funds under the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment; has not been the subject of a limitation, suspension, fine, or termination proceeding, or emergency action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency in the three years preceding the school's waiver request; has submitted its compliance audits and audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years, and no individual audit disclosed liabilities in excess of $10,000; and submits a letter of credit in the amount as determined below, which must remain in effect until the Department has resolved the audit covering the award years subject to the waiver. For purposes of this section, the letter of credit amount is 10% of the total FSA program funds the school disbursed to or on behalf of its students during the award year preceding the school's waiver request.Volume 2\u2014School 20192-80STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR FSA AUDITS Audited financial statement requirement A school's audited financial statement must cover the school's most recently completed fiscal year. The Department uses the information in a school's audited financial statement to evaluate the school's status vis- a-vis the financial standards discussed in this chapter. In addition to a school's audited financial statement, the Department may require that the school submit additional information. For example, the Department may require a school to submit or provide access to the auditor's work papers. Also, if the Department finds it necessary to evaluate a particular school's financial condition, the Department can require a school to submit audited financial statements more frequently than once a year. FSA compliance audits Compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with the general standards and the standards for compliance audits contained in the U.S. Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) Government Auditing Standards. In addition, the auditor should use the following guidance, based on school type: OMB Circular A-133 for public and private nonprofit schools audited under the Single Audit Act the latest Audit Guide for the FSA programs (see sidebar) for for-profit schools, foreign schools, and third-party servicers In conducting an audit, the auditor may also find it useful to consult the accounting and record keeping guidance in the FSA Handbook and the G5 Users Guide , as applicable. A school (or third-party servicer) may use the same independent auditor or auditing firm for its required nonfederal audit as the one that usually audits its fiscal transactions. To produce unbiased conclusions, the auditor must be independent of those authorizing the expenditure of FSA funds. The Department may require a school to provide a copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies, lenders, state agencies, other federal agencies, or accrediting agencies. Financial statements, accrual basis, and GAAP standards Financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with GAGAS and other guidance contained in OMB Circular A-133, or in the Department's Audit Guide (for FSA school audits).Audit guide (for FSA programs) The official title of the Inspector General's audit guide for the FSA programs is Guide for Audits of Proprietary Schools and for Compliance Attestation Engagements of Third- Party Servicers Administering Title IV Programs. The audit guide is available on the IFAP website ( ifap.ed.gov ) under \"Publications.\" The G5 is available at ( www. g5.gov/ ).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, February 20192-81Submitting A-133 audits The Form SF-SAC and the Single Audit Reporting packages for fiscal periods ending on or after January 1, 2008, must be submitted online to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. harvester.census.gov/facweb/ Annual financial statement Section 487(c) of the HEA provides that all schools participating in the Federal Student Aid programs must submit annual financial statements to the Department. This applies to all schools, including nonprofit schools that are otherwise exempt from submitting annual audited financial statements under the A-133 standards. Circular A-133 and the Single Audit Act Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 was issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984. The Single Audit Act was amended in 1996\u2014the current requirements are found in Chapter 75 of title 31, U.S. Code . Circular A-133 is titled \"Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations \" and is applicable to nonprofit postsecondary schools, states, local governments, and Indian tribal governments. For many schools, this is a combined audit of all the federal programs at that school. OMB circular A-133 is available through the OMB homepage at https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/ whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A133/ a133.pdf .Single Audit Act (A-133 audit) guidelines Nonprofit and public schools are required to have audits performed under the guidelines of the Single Audit Act. (These audits are also known as \"A-133 audits\" because the audit guidelines are established in OMB Circular A-133). A-133 audits satisfy the Department's audit requirements. A-133 audits have distinct auditing and submission requirements and must be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. (A copy of the audit must also be submitted to the Department through the eZ-Audit website.) A school submitting an audit under the guidelines of the Single Audit Act must use the submission deadlines established by the Single Audit Act. Exemptions A school that expends less tha n $750,000 of federal funds during a fiscal year is exempt from submitting an annual A-133 audit. However, a school that spends less than $750,000 in a ll federal funds is still required to submit a financial statement to the Department within six months after the close of its fiscal year. The financial statement does not have to be audited by a CPA and may be created as compiled or reviewed statements. If the school has prepared a set of audited financial statements for its own use or for another entity, the school must submit those audited financial statements to the Department no later than six months after the end of the institution's fiscal year. Circular A-133 permits the submission of program-specific audits if an entity expends funds in only one federal program and the program's regulations do not require a financial statement audit. The FSA program regulations require a financial statement audit. Therefore, a school may not submit a program-specific audit to satisfy the Department's audit submission requirements. Circular A-133 also now allows an independent auditor to use professional judgment to determine whether certain federal programs must be included in the scope of an audit. An independent auditor can exclude certain program components, such as FSA program funds, if they fall below a predetermined dollar and risk threshold. The independent auditor must make an annual assessment of the dollar and risk conditions and determine whether such exclusions are appropriate and whether any FSA programs must be included within the scope of the audit. You can find additional information on this topic in the latest Compliance Supplement to Circular A-133.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA 20192-82FSA consolidated statements In some cases, a school's relationship with another entity may cause the Department to require a school to submit additional financial statements both of the school and the entity, such as audited consolidated financial statements; audited full consolidated financial statements; audited combined financial statements; or, under certain circumstances, audited financial statements of one or more related parties. This occurs when the Department determines that the activities or financial health of another entity may impact the school's total financial health. So that the Department can make this determination, a school must include in its audited financial statements a detailed description of related entities based on the definition of a related entity in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 . In addition, the description must include all related parties and a level of detail that would enable the Department to easily identify them. This information may include but is not limited to the name, location, and description of the related entity, including the nature and amount of any transaction between the entity and the school, financial or otherwise, regardless of when it occurred. 90/10 REVENUE TEST To be eligible for FSA participation, a proprietary school must derive at least 10% of its revenues for each fiscal year from sources other than the FSA programs or be subject to sanctions. The calculation of this percentage and the funds included must be arrived at using the cash basis of accounting. A school must determine its revenue percentages using the formula described on the following pages each fiscal year. A proprietary school must report as a footnote to its audited financial statements the percentage of its revenues derived from the FSA programs for the fiscal year covered by the audit. The school must also report in the footnote the dollar amount of the numerator and denominator of its 90/10 ratio as well as the individual revenue amounts identified in section 2 of appendix C to subpart B of part 668 (see the margin). Proprietary schools have 45 days after their most recent fiscal year has ended to report to the Department if they did not satisfy the 90/10 rule for that period. If a school fails to satisfy the 90/10 rule for any fiscal year, it be - comes provisionally certified for up to two fiscal years after the fiscal year it failed to satisfy the revenue requirement. (Among other factors, the provisional certification is limited by the ex - piration date of the school's program participation agreement.) If a school fails to satisfy the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years, it loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA pro - grams for at least two fiscal years. If the school loses eligibility, it must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and follow the closeout procedures described in Chapter 8 . 90/10 Rule Guidance on footnote disclosures can be found in the FSA Audit Guide , in 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4), and in appropriate accounting references. See DCL GEN-08-12 for changes made by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (section 493), moving 90/10 rule to the Program Participation Agreement (from the definition of a proprietary institution of higher education). Earlier guidance on 90/10 and institutional loans and scholarships can be found in Dear Partner Letter GEN-99-33 and Dear CPA Letters CPA-99-01 and CPA-99-02. HEA section 487 34 CFR 668.14(b)(16) 34 CFR 668.28 Notifying ED\u201490/10 A school must send notice of its failure to satisfy the 90/10 rule to the Department by U.S. mail or commercial overnight to the following address: U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid School Eligibility Service Group 830 First Street, NE Washington, DC 20202-5403 General e-mail: Caseteams@ed.gov Contact phone numbers for the teams are provided at https://eligcert.ed.gov/ .Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-83A school that converts from a proprietary to a nonprofit or public status for Title IV purposes must continue to report its compliance with the 90/10 revenue test for at least one complete fiscal year after the change in status has been approved by the Department. For example, a change in status is approved with an effective date of 10/31/18 for a school whose fiscal year ends on December 31. The school would be required to report the 90/10 revenue attestation for the complete 2018 fiscal year, and it would also be required to report its 90/10 compliance for its first complete fiscal year (2019) of participation as a nonprofit school. If the school failed the test for that first year under the new status, it would need to report an additional year. If there were other problems with the attestation, the school could also be required to report one more year.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Revenues for the 90/10 Rule Section 668.28(a) of the Student Assistance General Provisions provides the following explanation of how to count revenue from FSA vs. non-FSA sources: See Appendix C of Subpart B of the Student Assistance General Provisions for calculation procedures. ...

The institution must consider as revenue only those funds it generates from\u2014 (i) Tuition, fees, and other institutional charges for students enrolled in eligible programs as defined in \u00a7668.8; (ii) Activities conducted by the institution that are necessary for the education and training of its students provided those activities are\u2014 (A) Conducted on campus or at a facility under the institution's control; (B) Performed under the supervision of a member of the institution's faculty; and (C) Required to be performed by all students in a specific educational program at the institution; and (iii) Funds paid by a student, or on behalf of a student by a party other than the institution, for an education or training program that is not eligible under \u00a7668.8 if the program\u2014 (A) Is approved or licensed by the appropriate state agency; (B) Is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary under 34 CFR part 602; (C) Provides an industry-recognized credential or certification, or prepares students to take an examination for an industry-recognized credential or certification issued by an independent third party; (D) Provides training needed for students to maintain state licensing requirements; or (E) Provides training needed for students to meet additional licensing requirements for specialized training for practitioners that already meet the general licensing requirements in that field. (4) Application of funds. The institution must presume that any Title IV, HEA program funds it disburses, or delivers, to or on behalf of a student will be used to pay the student's tuition, fees, or institutional charges, regardless of whether the institution credits the funds to the student's account or pays the funds directly to the student, except to the extent that the student's tuition, fees, or other charges are satisfied by\u2014 (i) Grant funds provided by non-federal public agencies or private sources independent of the institution;(ii) Funds provided under a contractual arrangement with a federal, state, or local government agency for the purpose of providing job training to low-income individuals who need that training; (iii) Funds used by a student from a savings plan for educational expenses established by or on behalf of the student if the saving plan qualifies for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or (iv) Institutional scholarships that meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section. (5) Revenue generated from institutional aid. The institution must include the following institutional aid as revenue: (i) For loans made to students and credited in full to the students' accounts at the institution on or after July 1, 2008, and prior to July 1, 2012, include as revenue the net present value of the loans made to students during the fiscal year, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, if the loans\u2014 (A) Are bona fide as evidenced by standalone repayment agreements between the students and the institution that are enforceable promissory notes; (B) Are issued at intervals related to the institution's enrollment periods; (C) Are subject to regular loan repayments and collections by the institution; and (D) Are separate from the enrollment contracts signed by the students. [For rules on calculating the net present value of these loans, see 34 CFR 668.28(b) and Appendix C to Subpart B.] (ii) For loans made to students before July 1, 2008, include as revenue only the amount of payments made on those loans that the institution received during the fiscal year. (iii) For loans made to students on or after July 1, 2012, include as revenue only the amount of payments made on those loans that the institution received during the fiscal year. (iv) For scholarships provided by the institution in the form of monetary aid or tuition discount and based on the academic achievement or financial need of its students, include as revenue the amount disbursed to students during the fiscal year. The scholarships must be disbursed from an established restricted account and only to the extent that the funds in that account represent designated funds from an outside source or income earned on those funds. Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-85Other 90/10 guidance Cash basis of accounting Except for institutional loans made to students under 34 CFR 668.28(a)(5)(i), a proprietary school must use the cash basis of ac - counting in calculating its revenue percentage under the 90/10 Rule. Under the cash basis of accounting, revenue is recognized when received rather than when it is earned. Revenue For the purpose of calculating the qualifying percentages under the 90/10 Rule, revenue is an inflow or other enhancement of assets to an entity, or a reduction of its liabilities resulting from the delivery or production of goods or services. A school may recognize revenue only when the school receives cash, i.e., when there is an inflow of cash. As a result, in order for a school to recognize revenue under the cash basis of accounting, that revenue must represent cash received from a source outside the institution. Tuition waivers Institutional grants in the form of tuition waivers do not count as revenue because no new revenue is generated. Similarly, internal transfers of cash among accounts are not considered revenue because they are not an inflow of cash to the school. Institutional scholarships are not revenues generated by the school unless they are donated by an unrelated or outside party. An exception is permitted for schools to use donations from a related party to create restricted accounts for institutional scholarships, but only the amount earned on the restricted account and used for scholarships would count as revenue in the denominator of the calculation. Funds held as credit balances in institutional accounts cannot be counted in the 90/10 formula. However, once funds held as credit balances are used to satisfy institutional charges, they would be counted in both the numerator and the denominator of the formula. Revenues from loans When a school makes a loan to a student, it does not receive cash from an outside source. Accordingly, cash revenue from institutional loans is recognized only when those loans are repaid, because that is when there is an inflow of cash from an outside source. Loan proceeds from institutional loans that were disbursed to students may not be counted in the denominator of the fraction, because these proceeds neither generate nor represent actual inflows of cash. The school may include only loan repayments it received during the appropriate fiscal year for previously disbursed institutional loans. Loans made by a private lender that are in any manner guaranteed by the school are known as recourse loans. The proceeds from recourse loans may be included in the denominator of an institution's 90/10 calculation for the fiscal year in which the revenues were received, provided that the institution's reported revenues are also reduced by the amount of recourse loan payments made to recourse loan holders during that fiscal year. Note that recourse loan payments may be for recourse loans that were made in a prior fiscal year. Under the cash basis of accounting, the reductions to total revenues in the denominator of the 90/10 calculation are reported in the fiscal year when the payments are made. The nonrecourse portion of a partial recourse loan may be included in a 90/10 calculation. In order to include a partial recourse loan in a 90/10 calculation, the contract must identify the percentage of the sale that is nonrecourse; only that percentage may be included. Furthermore, no after-the-fact adjustments may be provided for. Revenue generated from the sale of nonrecourse institutional loans to an unrelated third party may be counted as revenue in the denominator of the 90/10 calculation to the extent that the revenues represent actual proceeds from the sale. The sale of institutional loan receivables is distinguishable from the sale of a school's other assets because receivables from institutional loans are produced by transactions that generate tuition revenue. Tuition revenue represents income from the major service provided by a school. That would not be true in the case of the sale of other school assets. (7) Funds excluded from revenues. For the fiscal year, the institution does not include\u2014 (i) The amount of Federal Work-Study (FWS) wages paid directly to the student. However, if the institution credits the student's account with FWS funds, those funds are included as revenue; (ii) The amount of funds received by the institution from a state under the LEAP, SLEAP, or GAP programs; (iii) The amount of institutional funds used to match Title IV, HEA program funds; (iv) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under \u00a7668.22. If any funds from the loan disbursement used in the return calculation under \u00a7668.22 were counted as non-title IV revenue under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under \u00a7668.22 is considered to consist of pre-ECASLA loan amounts and loan amounts in excess of the loan limits prior to ECASLA in the same proportion to the loan disbursement; or (v) The amount the student is charged for books, supplies, and equipment unless the institution includes that amount as tuition, fees, or other institutional charges.Counting Revenues for the 90/10 Rule, HB February 20192-86AUDIT AND AUDIT REVIEW PROCESS Having the audit performed The school or servicer must make its program and fiscal records, as well as individual student records, available to the auditor. (Required recordkeeping is discussed in Chapter 7 .) Both the financial aid and business offices should be aware of the dates the auditors will be at the school, and make sure that someone is on hand to provide requested documents and answer questions during that period. At the end of the on-site review, the auditor conducts an exit interview. At a school, this exit interview is usually conducted with the personnel from the school's financial aid and other relevant offices. The exit interview is not only an opportunity for the auditor to suggest improvements in procedures, but it also gives the school or servicer a chance to discuss the draft report and review any discrepancies cited in the report. The exit interview is a good time to resolve any disagreements before the final report is prepared. The final report is prepared by the auditor and submitted to the school or servicer. Review of FSA audit submissions The Department reviews the audit report for format and completeness and to ensure that it complies with the government's auditing standards. We will use the general information to make an initial determination of whether the audits are materially complete and conducted in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Based on the financial data, we will also make a preliminary determination as to whether your school is financially responsible with respect to the financial responsibility ratios, or in the case of a change in ownership resulting in a change in control, whether the school satisfies the financial ratio requirements (discussed later in this chapter). Later, the Department will review submissions to determine whether the school must provide additional information or ED should take further action. Based on the audit findings and the school's or servicer's written explanation, the Department will determine if any funds were spent improperly. Unless the school or servicer has properly appealed the decision, the school or servicer must repay any improperly spent funds within 45 days.Use of eZ-Audit required Schools are required to submit their compliance audits, audited financial statements, and letters confirming their status as public schools through the Department's eZ-Audit Electronic Financial Reporting System. This requirement applies to any compliance audits or financial statements required under 34 CFR 600.20(a) or (b) to begin or continue participating in the FSA programs, any financial statements required due to a change in ownership resulting in a change in control as provided under 34 CFR 600.20(g), any compliance audits and financial statements required annually under 34 CFR 668.23, and any compliance audits and financial statements required when a school ceases to participate in the FSA programs as provided under 34 CFR February 20192-87eZ-Audit The eZ-Audit website provides a paperless single point of submission for financial statements and audits (i.e., compliance reports). eZ-Audit provides automatic error checking as you enter the data and before submission. In addition, it gives you instant acknowledgment of receipt. All schools that participate in the FSA programs must use eZ-Audit to submit financial statements and compliance audits (including copies of the A-133 reports that nonprofit and public institutions file with the Federal Audit Clearinghouse). Nonprofit and public institutions are still required to submit their A-133 audits in writing to the federal clearinghouse. The eZ-Audit process To access the eZ-Audit website, you must be a registered user. Each school must select an eZ-Audit institution administrator who will be responsible for managing your school's access to the eZ-Audit website. This institution administrator will receive the user name and password necessary for your school's access and will be responsible for granting access to others you name as additional users. Each registered user must sign and retain the eZ-Audit rules of behavior. For registration instructions and to download the rules of behavior, please visit www.ezaudit.ed.gov . Once you have obtained your school ID, you will access the appropriate page on the audit website and 1. enter general information about your school's compliance audit and financial statement, 2. enter specific financial data directly from the audited financial statement, and 3. attach authentic electronic copies of the audit originals. After you have entered the required information, you must attach a copy of the audit prepared and signed by the independent auditor. The copy must be in a non-editable, portable document format (PDF) created using Adobe Acrobat version 5.0 or higher.Cooperation with audit and review process Throughout the audit process, and for other examinations such as program reviews and state reviews, the school or servicer is required to cooperate fully with its independent auditor, the Department and its Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, its accrediting agency, and the appropriate guaranty agency.Access to records Once the audit is complete, the school or servicer must give the Department and the OIG access to all records and documents needed to review the audit. A school that uses a third-party servicer must give the Department and the OIG access to all records and documents needed to review a third-party servicer's compliance or financial statement audit. In addition, the school's or servicer's contract with the auditor must specify that the auditor will give the Department and the OIG access to the records and documents related to the audit, including work papers. Cooperation includes providing timely and reasonable access to records (including computer records) for examination and copying and to personnel for the purpose of obtaining relevant information. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations apply to third-party servicers. If a servicer contracts with several FSA schools, a single compliance audit can be performed that covers its administrative services for all schools. If a servicer contracts with only one FSA school and that school's own audit sufficiently covers the functions performed by the servicer, the servicer does not have to submit a compliance audit. A servicer must submit its compliance audit within six months after the last day of the servicer's fiscal year. The Department may require a servicer to provide a copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies, lenders, state agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or accrediting agencies. In addition to submitting a compliance audit, a servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's programs must submit annually audited financial statements. The financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards ( GAGAS) and any other guidance contained in audit guides issued by the Department's Office of the Inspector General. If the Department determines that, based on audit findings and responses, a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of the FSA programs, the servicer must notify each school with which it has a contract of the liability. Generally, unless they submit an appeal, schools and servicers owing liabilities must repay those liabilities within 45 days of being notified by the Department. As noted earlier, a school may never use a third-party servicer's audit in place of its own required audit because the school is ultimately liable for its own violations as well as those incurred by its third-party servicers. (See Chapter 3 for more information on third-party servicers.)Third-party servicers Guidance for audits of third-party servicers is found in the January 2000 Department of Education's \"Audit Guide, Audits of Federal Student Aid Programs at Participating Institutions and Institution Servicers.\" 34 CFR 668.23(a)(3) and (c) 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4) Failure to submit audits The Department is aware that some third-party servicers have told schools not to report them as servicers, creating confusion about who should be reported. Also, some servicers have not filed annual compliance audits because they incorrectly determined that they don't meet the regulatory definition of a third-party servicer or because of the omission of specific audit procedures in the OIG Audit Guide for some services or functions performed on behalf of colleges. See DCL GEN-15-01 for clarification of the third-party servicer requirements in the regulations.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, HB February 20192-89Financial responsibility Sec. Higher Education Act 34 CFR 668 Subpart LDEMONSTRATING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY To participate in the FSA programs, a school must demonstrate that it is financially responsible. To provide the Department with the information necessary to evaluate a school's financial responsibility, schools are required to submit financial information to the Department every year. A school must provide this financial information in the form of an audited financial statement as part of a combined submission that also includes the school's compliance audit. For-profit schools have six months from the end of the schools' fiscal year to provide the combined submission; other schools have nine months. What follows is an overview of the financial responsibility standards. Schools should refer to Subpart L of the Student Assistance General Provisions for complete information. The Department determines whether a school is financially responsible based on the school's ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer the FSA programs in which the school participates, and meet all of its financial obligations. The financial responsibility standards can be divided into two categories: (1) general standards, which are the basic standards used to evaluate a school's financial health, and (2) performance and affiliation standards, which are standards used to evaluate a school's past performance and to evaluate individuals affiliated with the school. Financial responsibility for public schools A public school is financially responsible if its debts and liabilities are backed by the full faith and credit of the state or another government entity. The Department considers a public school to have that backing if the school notifies the Department that it is designated as a public school by the state, local, or municipal government entity, tribal authority, or other government entity that has the legal authority to make that designation. The school must also provide the Department with a letter from an official of the appropriate government entity confirming the school's status as a public school. A letter from a government entity may include a confirmation of public school status for more than one school under that government's purview. The letter is a one-time submission and should be submitted as a separate document. Public schools also must meet the past performance and affiliation standards discussed later and must submit financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and prepared on the accrual basis. Tuition recovery funds When a state submits a tuition recovery fund for approval by the Department, the Department will consider the extent to which the recovery fund provides returns to both in-state and out-of-state students; complies with FSA requirements for the order of return of funds to sources of assistance; and is replenished if any claims arise that deplete the fund.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-90Financial responsibility for proprietary or private nonprofit schools A proprietary or private nonprofit school is financially responsible if the Department determines that the school has a composite score of at least 1.5; the school has sufficient cash reserves to make the required refunds, including the return of Title IV funds (these require - ments are known as the refund reserve standards); the school is meeting all of its financial obligations, including making required refunds, including the return of Title IV funds and making repayments to cover FSA program debts and li - abilities; and the school is current in its debt payments. These requirements are discussed in more detail in the next section. Even if a school meets all of the general requirements, the Department does not consider the school to be financially responsible if in the school's audited financial statement the opinion ex - pressed by the auditor was adverse, qualified, or disclaimed, or the auditor expressed doubt about the continued existence of the school as a going concern (unless the Department deter - mines that a qualified or disclaimed opinion does not have a significant bearing on the school's financial condition), or the school violated one of the past performance requirements discussed later in this chapter.Deposit to operating account or separate federal bank account A school that maintains a separate federal bank account must deposit to that account, or transfer from its operating account to its federal account, the amount of unearned program funds, as determined under the Return of Title IV funds regulations. The date the school makes that deposit or transfer is the date used to determine whether the school returned the funds within the 45-day time frame permitted in the regulations. Unless the Department requires a school to use a separate account, the school may use its operating account for FSA purposes. In this case the school must designate that account as its federal bank account and have an auditable system of records showing that the funds have been allocated properly and returned in a timely manner. If there is no clear audit trail, the Department can require the school to begin maintaining FSA funds in a separate bank account. See the sections on accounting for funds and depository accounts in Chapter 1 of Volume 4 . 34 CFR 668.163(a)Change in ownership When a change in ownership occurs, the Department applies the standards in 34 CFR 668.15. Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, DCL FSA HB February 20192-91Additional information on composite scores For complete information on the calculation of the composite score, schools should refer to Appendices A and B of Subpart L in the General Provisions regulations. The Department has issued guidance on the treatment of long-term and other debt in calculating these ratios. The most recent can be found in DCL GEN-03-08. STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Composite score The composite score standard combines different measures of fundamental elements of financial health to yield a single measure of a school's overall financial health. This method allows financial strength in one area to make up for financial weakness in another area and gives an equitable measure of the financial health of schools of different sizes. The composite score methodology takes into account the differences between proprietary schools and private nonprofit schools. The variance takes into account the accounting differences between these sectors of postsecondary schools. However, the basic steps used to arrive at the composite score are the same. These steps are described later in this section. Refund reserve standards One of the standards that a school must satisfy to be considered financially responsible is that it must have sufficient cash reserves to return FSA funds when a student withdraws. A school is considered to have sufficient cash reserves if it is located in a state that has an ED-approved tuition recovery fund and the school contributes to that fund, or for its two most recently completed fiscal years, the school made all required returns in a timely manner (see Volume 5, Chapter 2 for more information on returns, including timely payment). Returning funds in a timely manner Unearned funds must be returned no later than 45 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew. ED considers the school to have returned funds, depending upon the method it uses to return them. Specifically, the regulations provide that a school has returned funds when it has deposited or transferred the funds into the bank account it maintains for federal funds (see sidebar) no later than 45 days after the date it determines that the student withdrew, initiated an electronic funds transfer (EFT) no later than 45 days after the date it determines that the student withdrew, or issued a check no later than 45 days (as supported by the school's records) after the date it determines that the student withdrew. If a check is used to return unearned funds, the Department requires that the check be endorsed by ED no later than 60 days after the school's determination that a student withdrew to be considered a timely return.Return of Title IV funds The requirements for return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw from the educational program are described in Volume 5 . Making new awards with returned funds After a school has returned unearned funds to its federal account, provided those funds were originally received from the Department under a process that allows the school to reuse the unearned funds, the school can use the funds to make disbursements to other eligible students through the same program and in the same award year.Financial responsibility Treatment of long-term debt DCL GEN 03-08, July 2003 34 CFR 668, Subpart L, Appendices A and B Ratios 34 CFR 668.172 Refund reserve standards 34 CFR 668.173 Returning funds in a timely manner 34 February 20192-92Letter of credit required when funds are not returned in a timely manner Public schools and schools covered by a state tuition recovery fund that has been approved by the Department are not subject to the letter of credit requirements. If any other school exceeds the compliance thresholds in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years, the school must submit an irrevocable letter of credit acceptable and payable to the Department. The letter of credit must be equal to 25% of the returns the school made or should have made during its most recently completed fiscal year. A school that is required to submit a letter of credit must do so no later than 30 days after the earlier of the date that the school is required to submit its compliance audit; the OIG issues a final audit report; the designated department official issues a final program review determination; the Department issues a preliminary program review report or draft audit report, or a guaranty agency issues a preliminary re - port showing that the school did not return unearned funds for more than 10% of the sampled students; or ED sends a written notice to the school requesting the letter of credit that explains why the school has failed to return un - earned funds in a timely manner. If the finding in the preliminary report is that the school did not return unearned funds in a timely manner for 10% or fewer of the sampled students, a school would generally be required to submit the letter of credit only if the final report shows that the school did not return unearned funds in a timely manner for 5% or more of all the students in the sample. If the final report indicates that a letter of credit is required, the school would have to submit it no later than 30 days after the final report is issued. Address for Letters of Credit Letters of credit are submitted to Director, Performance Improvement & Procedures U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid 830 First Street, NE UCP-3, MS 5435 Washington, DC 20002-8019Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-93Exceptions to the letter of credit requirement A school is not required to submit a letter of credit of less than $5,000. However, to meet the reserve requirement, such a school would need to demonstrate that it has available at all times cash reserves of at least $5,000 to make required returns. In addition, a school may delay submitting a letter of credit while it asks for reconsideration of a finding that it failed to return unearned FSA funds in a timely manner. A school may request that the Department reconsider its finding if the school submits documents showing that the unearned FSA funds were not returned in a timely manner solely because of exceptional circumstances beyond the school's control and that the school would not have exceeded the ap - plicable threshold had it not been for the exceptional circum - stances; or it did not fail to make timely returns. A school that submits an appeal, together with all required supporting documents, by the date the letter of credit would be due is not required to submit a letter of credit unless the Department notifies the school that its request has been denied. Current in debt payments A school is not current in its debt payments if it is in violation of any existing loan agreement at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial statements or audit opinion, or it fails to make a payment in accordance with existing debt ob - ligations for more than 120 days, and at least one creditor has filed suit to recover funds under those obligations. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-94The first step in calculating a school's composite score is to determine the school's primary reserve, equity, and net income ratios by using information from the school's audited financial statement. These ratios take into account the total financial resources of the school. The Primary Reserve Ratio represents a measure of a school's viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio represents a measure of a school's capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio represents a measure of a school's profitability. Upon review, some items from a school's audited financial statement may be excluded from the calculation of the ratios. For example, the Department may exclude the effects of questionable accounting treatments, such as excessive capitalization of marketing costs, from the ratio calculations. (See the regulatory exclusions below.) All long-term debt obtained for the school's purposes may be included for purposes of the Primary Reserve Ratio calculation. However, it is important to note that the overall level of debt obtained for long-term purposes that can be included in the numerator of the Primary Reserve Ratio is limited under the regulations. It cannot exceed the amount of the school's net property, plant, and equipment. A strength factor score is then calculated for each ratio using equations established by the Department. A strength factor score reflects a school's relative strength or weakness in a fundamental element of financial health, as measured by the ratios. Specifically, the strength factor scores reflect the extent to which a school has the financial resources to: 1) replace existing technology with newer technology; 2) replace physical capital that wears out over time; 3) recruit, retain, and retrain faculty and staff (human capital); and 4) develop new programs. A weighting percentage is applied to each strength factor score to obtain a weighted score for each ratio. The weighting percentages reflect the relative importance that each fundamental element has for a school in a particular sector (proprietary or private nonprofit). The sum of the weighted scores equals the school's composite score. Because the weighted scores reflect the strengths and weaknesses represented by the ratios and take into account the importance of those strengths and weaknesses, a strength in the weighted score of one ratio may compensate for a weakness in the weighted score of another ratio. Once a composite score is calculated, it is measured along a common scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0 as indicated in the diagram on the following page. This scale reflects the probability a school will be able to continue operations and meet its obligations to students and the Department.Calculating a Composite Score Excluded items. In calculating an institution's ratios, the Secretary\u2014 (1) Generally excludes extraordinary gains or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior period adjustments, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and the effect of changes in accounting estimates; (2) May include or exclude the effects of questionable accounting treatments, such as excessive capitalization of marketing costs; (3) Excludes all unsecured or uncollateralized related- party receivables; (4) Excludes all intangible assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and(5) Excludes from the ratio calculations federal funds provided to an institution by the Secretary under programs authorized by the HEA only if\u2014 (i) In the notes to the institution's audited financial statement, or as a separate attestation, the auditor discloses by name and Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number the amount of HEA program funds reported as expenses in the Statement of Activities for the fiscal year covered by that audit or attestation; and (ii) The institution's composite score, as determined by the Secretary, is less than 1.5 before the reported expenses arising from those HEA funds are excluded from the ratio calculations. 34 CFR 668.172(c)Exclusions Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, DCL FSA HB February 20192-95Example: Calculation Of A Composite Score For A Proprietary Institution* Calculation of Ratios Primary Reserve = = = 0.0800 Ratio Equity Ratio = = = 0.3320 Net Income = = = 0.0509 Ratio Calculation of Strength Factor Score Primary Reserve Strength Factor Score = 20 x Primary Reserve Ratio 20 X 0.0800 = 1.6000 Equity Strength Factor Score = 6 x Equity Ratio 6 X 0.3320 = 1.9920 Net Income Strength Factor Score = 1 + (33.3 x Net Income Ratio) 1 + (33.3 x 0.0509) = 2.6950 Calculation of Weighted Score Primary Reserve Weighted Score = 30% x Primary Reserve Strength Factor Score 0.30 X 1.6000 = 0.4800 Equity Weighted Score = 40% x Equity Strength Factor Score 0.40 X 1.9920 = 0.7968 Net Income Weighted Score = 30% x Net Income Strength Factor Score 0.30 X 2.698 = 0.8094 Composite Score Sum of All Weighted Scores 0.4800 + 0.7968 + 0.8094 = 2.0862 rounded to 2.1 * The definition of terms used in the ratios and the applicable strength factor algorithms and weighting percentages are found in the Student Assistance General Provisions (regulations) (34 CFR 668) Subpart L, Appendix A for proprietary schools and Appendix B for private nonprofit schools.Composite Score Scale 1.5 to 3.0 Financially responsible without further oversight. 1.0 to 1.4 In the \"Zone. \" The school is considered financially responsible, but additional oversight is required. -1.0 to 0.9 Not financially responsible.

If the Department determines that a school that does not meet one or more of the general standards and does not qualify for an alternative, the Department may initiate a limitation, suspension, or termination action against the school (see Chapter 8 for more information on corrective actions and sanctions). Letter of credit alternative for new schools A new school (a school that seeks to participate in the FSA programs for the first time) that does not meet the composite score standard (i.e., has a composite score of less than 1.5) but meets all other standards may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department. The letter of credit must be acceptable and payable to the Department and equal to at least 50% of the FSA program funds that the Department determines that the school will receive during its initial year of participation. Letter of credit alternative for participating schools A participating proprietary or private nonprofit school that fails to meet one or more of the general standards or is not financially responsible because it has an adverse audit opinion may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department. The letter must be acceptable and payable to the Department and equal to at least 50% of the FSA program funds the school received during its most recently completed fiscal year. The school is then considered to be financially responsible.Provisional certification 34 CFR 668.13Chapter 4\u2014Audits, FSA HB February 20192-97Zone alternative A participating school that fails to meet the composite score standard (i.e., has a composite score of less than 1.5) but meets all other standards may demonstrate financial responsibility for up to three consecutive fiscal years if the Department determines that the school's composite score is equal to 1.0 to 1.4 for each of those years and the school meets specific monitoring requirements. This alternative gives a school the opportunity to improve its financial condition over time without requiring the school to post a letter of credit or participate under provisional certification. Under the zone alternative, a school's operations, including its administration of the FSA programs, are monitored more closely. If a school does not score at least 1.0 in one of the three subsequent fiscal years or does not improve its financial condition to attain a composite score of at least 1.5 by the end of the three-year period, the school must satisfy another alternative standard to continue participating. In addition, if a school fails to comply with the information reporting or payment method requirements, the Department may determine that the school no longer qualifies under this alternative. Under the zone alternative, a school must request and receive funds under the cash monitoring or reimbursement payment methods, as specified by the Depart - ment (see Volume 4, Chapter 2 ); must provide timely information regarding certain oversight and financial events (see the sidebar); may be required to submit its financial statement and compli - ance audit earlier than normally required (see the discussion of audit submission deadlines earlier in this chapter); and may be required to provide information about its current op - erations and future plans. The school must also require its auditor to express an opinion, as part of the school's compliance audit, on the school's compliance with the requirements of the zone alternative, including the school's administration of the payment method under which the school received and disbursed FSA program funds. Information to be provided under the zone alternative The school must provide timely information regarding any of the following oversight and financial events: Any adverse action, including a probation or similar action, taken against the school by its accrediting agency; Any event that causes the school, or related entity as defined in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 , to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution's or related entity's most recent audited financial statement; Any violation by the school of any loan agreement; Any failure of the school to make a payment in accordance with its debt obligations that results in a creditor filing suit to recover funds under those obligations; Any withdrawal of owner's equity from the school by any means, including declaring a dividend; or Any extraordinary losses, as defined according to Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30. The school may also be required to: submit its financial statement and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under 34 CFR 668.23(a)(4); and provide information about its current operations and future plans. 34 CFR 668.175(d)(2)Volume 2\u2014School February 20192-98Provisional certification for schools not meeting standards The Department may permit a participating proprietary or private nonprofit school to participate under provisional certification for up to three years if the school is not financially responsible because it does not satisfy one or more of the general standards, has an unacceptable audit opinion, or has a past performance problem that has been resolved. If the Department permits a school to participate under provisional certification, it will require the school to submit a letter of credit, payable and acceptable to the De - partment, for a percentage (10%-100%) of the FSA program funds received by the school during its most recent fiscal year; and to demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations and was current on debt payments for its two most recent fiscal years. Moreover, the school must comply with the requirement under the zone alternative that it provide timely information regarding certain oversight and financial events. Finally, a school that is required to post a letter of credit will be placed on heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement. If a school is still not financially responsible at the end of a period of provisional certification, the Department may again permit provisional certification. However, the Department may require the school or persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school to submit financial guarantees to the Department to satisfy any potential liabilities arising from the school's FSA program participation. The same persons may be required to agree to be jointly and severally liable for any FSA program liabilities. The Department is not required to offer provisional certification to a school. It is an alternative that the Department may choose to offer in exceptional circumstances.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-99Provisional certification for schools where persons or entities owe liabilities If a school is not financially responsible because the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school owe an FSA program liability, the Department may permit the school to participate under provisional certification if the persons or entities that owe the liability repay or enter into an agreement with the Department to repay the liability (or the school assumes the liability and repays or enters into an agree - ment to repay the liability); the school meets all the general standards of financial respon - sibility and demonstrates that it has met all of its financial ob - ligations and was current on its debt payments for its two most recent fiscal years; and the school submits to the Department a letter of credit, payable and acceptable to the Department, for an amount determined by the Department (at least 10% of the FSA program funds re - ceived by the school during its most recent fiscal year). The school also must comply with the requirements under the zone alternative. In addition, the Department may require the school or persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school to submit financial guarantees to the Department to satisfy any potential liabilities arising from the school's FSA program participation. The same persons may be required to agree to be jointly and severally liable for any FSA program performance 34 CFR 668.174 Notifying the Department of change of control A school must report any changes of control under which a person acquires the ability to affect substantially the actions of the school. Such changes in control trigger a review to determine if the school is financially responsible (see Chapter 5 ).PAST PERFORMANCE AND AFFILIATION STANDARDS In addition to meeting the numeric standards of financial responsibility and fulfilling all its financial obligations, a school must demonstrate that it properly administers the FSA programs in which it participates. Past actions of the school or individuals affiliated with the school may reveal mismanagement of FSA program funds, thereby demonstrating that a school is not financially responsible. Therefore, in evaluating the way a school administers the FSA programs, the Department considers the past performance of both the school and individuals affiliated with the school. Past performance of a school A school is not financially responsible if it in the last five years, has been subject to a limitation, suspen - sion, or termination action or has entered into an agreement to resolve a limitation, suspension, or termination action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency; in either of its two most recent FSA program reviews or audits, has had findings for the current fiscal year or two preceding fis - cal years that required repayment of more than 5% of the FSA program funds received by the school; has been cited during the last five years for failing to submit au - dits as required; or has failed to satisfactorily resolve any compliance issues identified in program reviews or audit reports, upheld in a final decision of the Department. Past performance of persons affiliated with a school A school is not financially responsible if any person who exercises substantial control over the school (or any members of the person's family alone or together) owes a liability for an FSA program violation or has ever exercised substantial control over another school (or a third-party servicer) that owes a liability for an FSA program violation, unless that person, family member, school, or servicer demonstrates that the liability is being repaid in accordance with an agreement with the Department.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-101The Department may consider a school that does not meet this requirement to be financially responsible if the school notifies the Department that the individual repaid to the De - partment an acceptable portion of the liability, in accordance with the regulations; notifies the Department that the liability is currently being re - paid in accordance with a written agreement with the Depart - ment; or demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department: (1) why the person who exercises substantial control should nevertheless be considered to lack that control, or (2) why the person who exercises substantial control and each member of that person's family does not or did not exercise substantial control over the school or servicer that owes the liability. LIMITATIONS An otherwise eligible institution becomes an ineligible institution if the school exceeds the 50% limit on students without a high school diploma or equivalent, the incarcerated student limitation (25%), or the correspondence course limitation (50%) or the correspon - dence student limitation (50%). A school must calculate these percentages to demonstrate compliance with a requirement or to demonstrate eligibility for a limitation waiver. For each of the tests, the calculation performed by the school must be attested to by the independent auditor who prepares the school's audited financial statement or its FSA compliance audit. If a school's initial or previous calculation was in error, the auditor's report must be part of the audit workpapers and must include a recalculation. The auditor's attestation report must indicate whether the school's determinations (including any relevant waiver or exception) are accurate. For each of the limitation requirements, the school must notify the Department (via Section G of the E-App) of the school's failure to meet a requirement, its falling within a prohibited limitation, or its ineligibility for a continued waiver, as applicable. The school's notification must occur by July 31 following the end of an award year. A school that fails to meet any of these requirements loses its eligibility to participate in any FSA program as of the last day of the most recent award year for which the school failed to meet the requirement .Conditions of institutional ineligibility 34 CFR 600.7 In addition to the limitations discussed in this chapter, a school is not eligible if it (or its owner) files for bankruptcy or if the school, its owner, or its CEO is responsible for a crime involving FSA program funds. See Chapters 1 and 3. A school that becomes ineligible because of one of these factors must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and must follow the requirements for a school that has lost its FSA participation (see Chapter 8) .Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-102If a school loses its eligibility because it failed to meet one or more of the limitation requirements, the school cannot regain eligibility until it can demonstrate that it was in compliance with all of the limitation requirements for the most recently completed award year. Once this has occurred, the school may apply to regain its eligibility. In addition, it must also show how its administrative practices and policies have been changed to ensure that it will not fall within prohibited limits in the future. Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that does not provide a 4-year bachelor's degree program or a 2-year associate degree program is ineligible if, for its latest complete award year, more than 50% of its regular enrolled students had neither a high school diploma nor its equivalent. If a public or private nonprofit institution exceeds the 50% limit because it serves significant numbers of these students through contracts with federal, state, or local government agencies, the Department may waive the limitation. The waiver will only be granted if no more than 40% of the school's regular students (those students not receiving job training through contracts with federal, state, or local government agencies) do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent. If granted, the waiver may be extended in each year the public or private nonprofit school continues to meet the requirements. The public or private nonprofit school's calculation must be attested to by an independent auditor each year an audit is conducted. Incarcerated student limitation and waiver A school is ineligible if, in its latest complete award year, more than 25% of its regular students are incarcerated. For information on the eligibility of incarcerated students for FSA, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 . A public or private nonprofit school can ask the Department to waive this limitation. If granted, the waiver is effective as long as the school continues to meet the waiver requirements each award year. For a school offering only 2-year or 4-year programs that lead to associate or bachelor's degrees, the waiver applies to all programs at the school. But if the school offers other types of programs, the waiver would apply to any of the school's 2-year associate degree programs or 4-year bachelor's degree programs and also to any other programs in which the incarcerated regular students enrolled have a 50% or greater completion rate. The calculation of this completion rate is specified in 34 CFR 600.7(e)(2) of the institutional eligibility regulations and must be attested to by an independent auditor. A public or private nonprofit school may request the waiver using the E-App ( www.eligcert.ed.gov ) by answering the questions in Section G and explaining in question 69.Incarcerated student definition A student who is serving a criminal sentence in a federal, state, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, work farm, or other similar correctional institution (this does not include detention in a halfway house, home detention, or weekend-only sentences).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, FSA HB February 20192-103A school is the sum only of its eligible programs Some postsecondary institutions offer programs that are eligible for FSA as well as programs that are not FSA-eligible. For FSA program purposes, we consider an eligible institution to be the sum of its eligible programs. To minimize the effect on its institutional eligibility of offering programs solely by correspondence that do not lead to a degree, a school might choose to identify those programs as not part of its FSA-eligible programs. A program (and students enrolled therein) that was so identified would not be considered part of the school in these two formulas.Correspondence student eligibility For information about a student's eligibility for FSA funds while enrolled in a correspondence course and cost of attendance information for correspondence courses, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 and Volume 3, Chapter 2 . Limitations on incarcerated students and correspondence study Incarcerated students 34 CFR 600.7(a)(1)(iii) and 600.7(c) Correspondence study Sec. 102(a)(3)(A) and (B) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.7(a)(1)(i) and (ii) and 600.7(b)(2)(i) and (ii) Notifying ED when limit is exceeded 34 CFR 600.7(h) If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted Electronic Application (E-App) (which deal with enrollment thresholds in these areas), the school must notify the Department via the E-App (see Chapter 5 ). The Department will advise the school of its options, including whether it might be eligible for a waiver. (Waivers are available for the limitations for correspondence students, incarcerated students, and students without a high school diploma or equivalent.)Correspondence course and correspondence student limitation In general, a school is ineligible if for the latest complete award year more than 50% of the school's courses were correspondence courses (correspondence course limitation) or 50% or more of the school's regular students were enrolled in correspondence courses (correspondence student limitation). This limitation may be waived for a school that offers a 2-year associate degree or 4-year baccalaureate degree program if the school demonstrates to the Department that in that award year, the students enrolled in its correspondence courses receive no more than 5% of the total FSA program funds received by all of the school's students. Note that the correspondence course and student limitations do not apply to a school that exclusively or mainly provides vocational adult education or job training as defined under Sec. 3(3)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. Also note that the 50% limits apply to the school, not to its individual programs. An educational program composed entirely of correspondence courses could still be an eligible program if no more than 50% of the school's courses were offered through correspondence and the program met other eligibility requirements. The school's correspondence course calculation and correspondence student calculation must be attested to by an independent auditor. For additional information on correspondence study in the context of program eligibility, see Chapter 2. Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 20 U.S.C. 2301Volume 2\u2014School February 20192-104 If a school offers a course both by correspondence and residential training, the course counts twice, as a correspondence course and as a residential course. Thus, it would count as one in the numerator and as two in the denominator. Regardless of how many sections of a course or program are offered during the award year (as a residential or as a correspondence course), the course is counted only once under each type. A program not offered in courses or modules counts as one correspondence course. Using the latest complete award year, the formula for determining the percentage of correspondence courses is as follows: All regular students enrolled in an institution's Title IV-eligible programs must be counted. (A regular student is \"a person enrolled for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential offered by the school. \") A school must use a straight head count of enrolled students, including full-time and part-time students and students who don't receive aid as well as FSA recipients. If a student withdrew from the school and received a full refund, the student is not counted. Using the latest complete award year, the formula for determining the percentage of enrolled students is as follows: Calculating the Percentages Calculating the Percentage of Correspondence Courses Calculating the Percentage of Correspondence Studentsnumber of school's correspondence courses total number of school's courses= % of correspondence courses number of regular students enrolled in the school's correspondence courses number of regular students enrolled in all of the school 's courses= % of correspondence studentsChapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, RatesCFR HB February 20192-105COHORT DEFAULT RATES A school's eligibility for the FSA programs can be affected by a high cohort default rate (CDR). The Department calculates a school's CDR based on information from guaranty agencies and federal loan servicers. The Department sends draft default rates to participating schools in February to allow each school an opportunity to review and correct the data that will be used to calculate its official cohort default rates. In September of each year, the Department issues the official cohort default rates. These rates are electronically delivered to schools and posted on the NSLDS Professional Access website. A school must be enrolled in the eCDR process for electronic delivery of the rates (see sidebar note for instructions and appeal procedures). Time frames for cohort default rates A school's annual CDR is based on a \"cohort\" of students who received FFEL or Direct Loans at the school and entered repayment in a single fiscal year\u2014the federal fiscal year, October 1-September 30. For instance, a school's FY2016 CDR is based on the cohort of students who received FFEL or Direct Loans at the school and entered repayment on those loans between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016. This number becomes the denominator (the lower part of the fraction) in the CDR calculation. X Total borrowers who entered repayment during FY2016 The Department tracks this group of students during the fiscal year in which they enter repayment and through the end of the second following fiscal year. The number of students who default on their loans (or meet other related conditions) during those three fiscal years becomes the numerator (top part of the fraction) in the CDR calculation. Total borrowers who entered repayment in FY2016 and defaulted in FY2016, 2017, and 2018 Total borrowers who entered repayment during FY2016 Because it takes three years to track the outcomes, the initial FY2016 CDR for a school is not released until three years later, at the beginning of 2019. This is one of the reasons that schools should closely monitor student borrowing and implement effective default prevention procedures as soon as possible. The steps taken to help students this year may reduce the number of defaults in the CDR three years from now. The terminology, criteria, calculations, and exceptions for the rates are described in more detail in the Cohort Default Rate Guide .The eCDR process ED sends the draft and official cohort default rates electronically to all schools participating in the FSA Programs. You must enroll in the eCDR process to receive your rates. If your school is not enrolled, go to https://fsawebenroll.ed.gov/ . On that page choose \"Enroll\" and then select the radio button for \"Modify Existing Services for a Destination Point.\"Default rates HEA 20 34 rates 34 CFR 668.206 DCL GEN-14-03 Cohort Default Rate Guide For information on procedures for challenges, adjustments, and appeals, refer to Part 4 of the Cohort Default Rate Guide . https://ifap.ed.gov/DefaultManagement/ guide/attachments/CDRMasterFile.pdf Default rates on the Web Searchable default rates for all schools participating in the FSA programs are posted on the Web at The Department also publishes Budget Lifetime Default Rates and Cumulative Lifetime Default Rates for the FFEL and Direct Loan Programs. These rates, which include additional defaults in years after the close of the CDR \"default window,\" do not affect a February 20192-106Consequences of high cohort default rates Schools face sanctions under the following conditions: For a cohort default rate of greater than 40 percent for any year, schools lose eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Pro - gram. For a default rate of 30 percent or more for any year, they must create a default prevention taskforce that will develop and im - plement a plan to address the high default rate. That plan must be submitted to the Department for review. For a default rate of 30 percent or more for a second consecu - tive year, they must submit to the Department a revised default prevention plan and may be placed on provisional certification. For a cohort default rate of 30 percent or more for three con - secutive years, schools lose eligibility to participate in both the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program. Moreover, a school is not considered to be administratively capable when the CDR for Federal Stafford/SLS loans or Direct Subsidized/ Unsubsidized Loans made to students for attendance at the school equals or exceeds 30% for two of the three most recent fiscal years or the CDR for Perkins loans made to students for attendance at the school exceeds 15%. See Volume 6 for other rules and asso - ciated penalties related specifically to high Perkins default rates. When a high default rate demonstrates a lack of administrative capability, a school may become ineligible to participate in the Direct Loan, Pell Grant, or Perkins programs, or the Department may choose to provisionally certify such a school. For detailed information on default rates, including challenges and appeals, refer to the Cohort Default Rate Guide on the IFAP website.Contacting the default office The Operations Performance Division in Federal Student Aid responds to questions about FFEL/DL cohort default rates, and reviews FFEL/DL cohort default rate challenges, adjustments, and appeals.

A school must submit its default prevention plan to its school participation division for review. If the cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% for two consecutive fiscal years, the default prevention plan must be revised and submitted again for review. Default prevention and management plan for new schools New schools are required to implement a default prevention and management plan prior to certification. In addition, a school that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control or a school that changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or additional location must implement a default management plan. A school applying to participate is exempt from submitting a default plan if the school, including its main campus and any branch campus, does not have a cohort default rate greater than 10% and the new owner of the school does not own and has not owned any other school that had a cohort default rate greater than 10% during the owner's 20192-108DEBT-TO-EARNINGS (D/E) RATES FOR GE PROGRAMS As with cohort default rates and financial standard composite scores, the D/E rates for schools' gainful employment (GE) programs are a measure that bears on eligibility, in this case the eligibility of specific programs. Schools must report for an award year information on each student who received Title IV aid for enrollment in a GE program. The information includes private and institutional loans, as well as the amount assessed for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment . Refer to the NSLDS Gainful Employment User Guide for the specific data to report for each student each award year. The information reported will be used by the Department for calculating D/E rates and creating other information that schoo ls must disclos e: for example, completion, median earnings and loan debt. Schools must report GE data annually by October 1 following the end of the award year (e.g., October 1, 2017, for the 2016-2017 award year), unless the Secretary establishes a different date. In cases where a student received Title IV aid for more than one GE program, he is reported for each program. If he was enrolled in a program for more than one award year, he is reported separately for each year, beginning with the year he first received Title IV aid for the program and for each following year even if he does not receive Title IV aid in that year. If he withdrew from a GE program and then re-enrolled in it, he is reported separately for each enrollment even if they were in the same award year.Gainful employment programs 34 CFR 668 Subpart Q DCL GEN-15-12 GE publications The webpage at https://ifap.ed.gov/GainfulEmploymentInfo/indexV2.html is a compilation of GE materials. Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA February 20192-109Calculation of D/E rates The Department calculates D/E rates for each GE program for each award year using the debt and earnings of students who completed the program during a specified cohort period. That period will be two years if 30 or more students completed the program during that period or four years if fewer than 30 students completed the program in two years. If fewer than 30 students finished in the four-year cohort, D/E rates will not be calculated for that GE program. Students who qualify for exclusion are not included in that number. The two-year and four-year cohorts comprise students who completed the program during the third and fourth years and the third through sixth years respectively prior to the award year the D/E rates are being calculated for. For example, to determine the D/E rates for the 2015-2016 award year, the two-year cohort period will be award years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, and the four-year cohort period will be 2009- 2010 through 2012-2013. We calculate separately an annual earnings rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual earnings rate equals Annual loan payment The higher of the mean or median annual earnings The discretionary income rate equals Annual loan payment The higher of the mean or median annual earnings - (1.5 \u00d7 HHS poverty guideline) The annual loan payment is determined by amortizing the median loan debt of students who completed the GE program during the cohort period. Median loan debt includes not only the amount of Title IV loans that students borrowed for enrollment in the GE program, but also private education loans and the total amount outstanding, as of the date they completed the program, on any other credit (including unpaid charges) extended by or on behalf of the institution that the students are obligated to repay. For the purpose of this calculation, students' loan debt is capped at the lesser of the debt they incurred for enrollment in the program or the total amount of their tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment.Challenges to draft rates 34 CFR 668.405(f)Calculating D/E 20192-110The median loan debt is amortized over a repayment period of 10 years for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, a post-baccalaureate certificate, an associate degree, or a gradu - ate certificate; 15 years for a program leading to a bachelor's or master's degree; or 20 years for a program leading to a doctoral or first professional degree. We calculate the annual loan payment using the average interest rate over a three-year or six-year period ending in the last year of the cohort period: for programs two years or less in length, we use a three-year period, and we use a six-year period for programs longer than two years. The average rate for undergraduate (or graduate, respectively) programs is based on the statutory interest rate on Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans applicable to undergraduate (or graduate) students for the three- or six- year period. The Department gets the annual earnings by using the student information, mentioned earlier, that a school reports. We create for each award year a list of students who received Title IV aid and completed the GE program during the cohort period. We also indicate which students we intend to exclude and then submit the list to the school for its review. It may make corrections to the list and challenge the exclusion or inclusion of any students; the burden of proof for substantiating this is on the school. After reviewing corrections or challenges , we provide the school with a final list and submit it to the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA calculates and sends the Department the mean and median annual earnings of students on the final list for whom it was able to match data for the \"earnings year,\" which is the first of the calendar years in the award year for which the D/E rates are calculated. For example, for the D/E rates that will be calculated for the 2016-2017 award year, the SSA earnings year will be calendar year 2016. When calculating a program's D/E rates, we use the higher of the SSA-reported mean or median earnings. The SSA does not send the Department any individual earnings data or the identity of any students and is prohibited by law from doing so. Moreover, to protect student privacy, SSA will only return mean and median earnings for programs with matched data for at least ten students.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL HB February 20192-111Exclusions Students are excluded from the D/E rates calculation if one or more of their Title IV loans were in a military-related deferment status at any time during the calendar year for which earnings information was received from SSA; one or more of their Title IV loans have been approved or are under consideration for a total and permanent disability discharge; they were enrolled in any other eligible program at any school during the calendar year for which SSA earnings were received; for undergraduate or graduate GE programs, t hey later completed a higher-credentialed undergraduate or graduate GE program respectively at the same school (see below about stu - dents completing more than one GE program); the student is dead. Students may complete more than one GE program at different credential levels. For example, they might enroll in and complete a one- year certificate program an d then e nroll in and complete an associate degree program at the same school. To account for this, we attribute the loan debt fr om the lower-credentialed program to the higher-credentialed program completed. This \"rolling-up\" of loan debt only happens if both programs are GE undergraduate programs or both are GE graduate programs, and if the higher credential is completed subsequent to completion of the lower credential. Draft rates and challenges We will calculate and send schools the draft D/E rates with the source data used to calculate the annual loan payment. Draft rates are released only to the school; they are not made public. A school may challenge the accuracy of information we used to calculate a GE program's median loan debt no later than 45 days after the school is notified of the program's draft rates. The challenge must provide satisfactory evidence that all or some of the information used to calculate the program's median loan debt is incorrect. As with challenges or corrections to the student list, the burden of proof for substantiating this challenge is on the school. Final rates are issued after the 45-day period. Student exclusions 34 CFR 20192-112Outcomes of the D/E rates measure A GE program passes the D/E rates measure if its annual earnings rate is less than or equal to 8 percent or its discretionary income rate is less than or equal to 20 percent. The program fails if both parts of this test are met: (1) the annual earnings rate is greater than 12 percent or the denominator of the rate (annual earnings) is zero and (2) its discretionary income rate is greater than 30 percent or the income for the denominator of the rate (discretionary earnings) is negative or zero. A program with rates that are neither passing nor failing is in the \"zone.\" A program becomes ineligible for Title IV program funds if it (1) fails the D/E rates measure for two of any three consecutive award years for which rates were calculated or (2) has a combination of zone and failing D/E rates for four consecutive award years for which rates were calculated. We inform an institution through a Notice of Determination of a GE program's final D/E rates whether the program is passing, failing, in the zone, or ineligible; whether it could become ineligible based on final D/E rates for the next award year; whether the school is required to provide student warnings; and, if the program's final rates are failing or in the zone, how it may make a n alternate earnings appeal. The determination is effective on the date specified in the notice and constitutes the final decision of the Department with respect to the D/E rates for the program. Transition period calculation For several years we will calculate alternate D/E rates that use the loan debt of a more recent one-year cohort of students who completed the program to calculate the annual loan payment (the same earnings information from SSA wi ll be used). As a result, a school may improve a program's D/E rates in the initial years after the regulations take effect. For example, a school might reduce tuition and fees for the more recent cohort such that there would be a lower annual loan payment amount for the transitional D/E rate calculations. For a GE program of one year or less, the transition period is the first five award years for which the Department calculates D/E rates. For programs more than one and less than or equal to two years in length, the transition period is the first six award years. For programs longer than two years, the transition period is seven award years. Each of the years for which we issue any D/E rates is included in the transition period whether or not we issued rates for a specific GE program. During the transition period, if the program is failing or in the zone based on its draft D/E rates, we will calculate transitional draft rates using the median loan debt of students who completed the program in the most recently completed award year, not the median loan debt for the applicable two-year or four-year cohort period. Final rates for the program will be t he better o f the draft or transitional draft D/E rates.D/E rates outcomes 34 CFR 668.403(c)Chapter FSA HB February 20192-113Appealing final rates If a GE program is failing or in the zone, a school may file an appeal to request recalculation of the program's most recent final D/E rates. The appeal must be based on the actual earnings of all the students who received Title IV aid and completed the program during the same or a comparable cohort period. The school must use the annual loan payment data used in the calculation of the final D/E rates. The school may obtain alternate earnings data from a survey it conducts of its graduates or from a state-sponsored data system, and would then use the higher of the mean or median alternate earnings for the appeal. Using a survey to get earnings data The Department's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has developed an earnings survey, and standards for its administration, that schools can use called the Recent Graduates Employment and Earnings Survey (RGEES). NCES has also developed a Best Practices Guide with explanations and examples of how to implement the standards in their collection of graduate earnings. The appeal must include a certification signed by the school's chief executive officer (CEO) attesting that the survey was conducted according to RGEES standards and that the mean or median earnings figure used to recalculate the D/E rates was accurately determined. The school must also submit an examination-level attestation engagement report prepared by an independent public accountant or independent government auditor attesting that the survey was conducted according to the requirements of the RGEES. The Department may also require additional supporting documentation. Using a state-sponsored data system for earnings data With this method a school must submit to the administrator of each state-sponsored data system used for the appeal a list of all students who received Title IV aid and completed the program during the same cohort period the Department used to calculate the final rates. The school must demonstrate that it obtained annual earnings data for more than 50% of the number of students in the cohort period and alternate earnings data for 30 or more of those students. The school must include with the appeal a certification signed by its CEO attesting that state-provided data were accurately used to recalculate the D/E rates. The Department may also require more supporting documentation.Alternate earnings appeals 34 CFR 668.406 Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #95 - Debt-to-Earnings Rate Alternate Earnings Appeals, October 26, 2016 Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #105 - Additional Time for Submission of an Alternate Earnings Appeal and to Comply with Gainful Employment (GE) Disclosure Requirements, March 6, 2017 For a complete list of Gainful Employment Electronic Announcements and Dear Colleague Letters, please visit https://ifap.ed.gov/ GainfulEmploymentInfo/ February 20192-114Timing of an appeal A school must submit notice of its intent to appeal no earlier than the date the Department provides it with its draft D/E rates but no later than 14 days after the Department issues the notice of determination that as a result of the program's final rates, the program either failed or was in the zone. The school must then submit its appeal, including its recalculated rates, certifications, and any supporting documentation, no later than 60 days after the date the Department issues the notice of determination. When a timely and complete appeal has been submitted, the school is not subject to any consequences (i.e., student warnings and loss of program eligibility) while the appeal is considered. If the Department denies the appeal, it notifies the school of the reasons for the denial and the program's final rates previously issued in the notice of determination will stand. If the appeal is granted, the institution is notified of the recalcula ted rates, which become the new final D/E rates for the program. Consequences of failing and zone rates For three years after the date of a voluntary discontinuation a school may not (1) reestablish the eligibility of an ineligible program or of a failing or zone program that it discontinued voluntarily or (2) establish the eligibility of a program that is substantially similar to the discontinued or ineligible program. Two programs are substantially similar if they share the same four-digit CIP code. If a GE program could become ineligible based on its final D/E rates for the next award year, the school must warn students and prospective students. The warnings must contain language specified in the regulations or alternate language subsequently provided by the Department and must refer students and prospective students to, and include a link for, the Department's College Navigator website for information about similar programs. Warnings to students enrolled in the GE program must describe the academic and financial options available to stu - dents to continue their education in another program at the school, including whether they can transfer credits (and which credits) earned in the program to another program. indicate whether, if the program loses Title IV eligibility, the school will continue to provide instruction allowing students to complete the program or will refund tuition, fees, and other required charges. explain whether students could transfer credits earned in the program to another institution.GE program warning content 34 CFR 668.410(a)(2)(i)Chapter 4\u2014Audits, FSA HB February 20192-115The school must provide the warning in writing to each enrolled student no later than 30 days after the date of the Department's notice of determination. The school must either hand deliver the warning as a separate document or send it to the student's primary email address with the warning as the only substantive content in the email. If email is used, the school must receive an electronic or written acknowledgment that the student received the email. You may not deliver an initial warning using regular U.S. Postal Service mail or commercial courier service. If a resp onse indicating that the email could not be delivered is received, the warning must be sent using a different address or method of delivery, which could include U.S. Postal Service mail or commercial courier service. A school must keep records of its efforts to provide warnings. Requirements for delivering warnings to prospective students are similar to those for enrolled students except that the warning must be provided at the point when the prospective student initially contacts the school about the program. Also, schools have the additional options of providing prospective students with a copy of the disclosure template that includes the warning or providing them the warning orally if the contact is by telephone. However, a school may not enroll or register students or have them enter into a financial commitment after receiving just an oral warning. Accordingly, any student who received an oral warning must, prior to enrolling, registering, or entering into a financial commitment with the school, receive a non-oral warning as described above. A school may not enroll, register, or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student earlier than three business days after it first provides that warning to the student or, if more than 30 days have elapsed since the warning was first given, three business days after an additional warning is given. In addition to providing warnings directly to students and prospective students, the school must update the disclosure template for the GE program to include the warning within 30 days of receiving notice from the Department that a warning must be provided for the program.CHAPTERC 5CFR Glossary DCL This chapter describes the regular recertification of schools, as well as changes that can affect a school's participation and how and when to report these changes to the Department on the E-App .Updating Application Information FSA HB February 20192-117RECERTIFICATION A school may be certified to participate for up to six years. Recertification is the process through which a school that is presently certified to participate in the FSA programs applies to have its participation extended beyond the expiration date of its current Program Participation Agreement (PPA) . The Department will notify a school six months prior to the expiration of its PPA. The school must submit a materially complete application before the expiration date in its PPA. If a school that is currently certified submits its materially complete application to the Department no later than 90 calendar days before its PPA expires, its PPA remains valid, and its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs continues until its application is either approved or not approved. This is true even if the Department does not complete its evaluation of the application before the PPA's expiration date. (For example, if a school's PPA expires on June 30 and it submits its application by March 31, the school remains certified during the Department's review period\u2014even if the review period extends beyond June 30.) If the 90th day before the PPA's expiration falls on a weekend or a federal holiday and the school submits its application (E-App) no later than the next business day, the Department considers the application to be submitted 90 days before the PPA expires. If the school's application is not received at least 90 days before the PPA expires or is not materially complete by that date, the school's PPA will expire on the scheduled expiration date and the FSA program funding will cease. If a school's eligibility lapses, the school may not continue to disburse FSA funds until it receives the Department's notification that the school is again eligible to participate in the programs. Following submission of an application, the school participation division will contact the school if it has questions about the application. Generally, this will be within 90 days of the Department receiving an application. If a school's application has been approved, the Department will send an electronic notice to the president and financial aid officer notifying them that the school's PPA is available to print, review, sign, and return. If the school's application is not approved, ED will notify the school and explain why. Recertification Sec 498(g) and (h) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.20(b) and (f) Eligible nonparticipating school Nonparticipating eligible schools are only required to renew their eligibility when the Department requests it. Their eligibility status continues indefinitely as long as they continue to meet the institutional eligibility requirements. If a school wants to be certified to participate in the FSA programs, it must submit an application and supporting documentation (see Chapter 1 ). 34 CFR 600.20(b)(1)FSA Assessment modules To assess your compliance with the provisions of this chapter see \"Recertification,\" at https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/FSAAssessments.jspVolume 2\u2014School HB February 20192-118CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP Changes at public institutions The Department does not consider that a public institution has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change of control if there is a change in governance, and the institution after the change remains a public institution, provided the new governing authority is in the same state as included in the institution's program participation agreement; and the new governing authority has acknowledged the public insti - tution's continued responsibilities under its PPA. Within 10 days of undergoing a change in governance, however, a public institution must report that change to the Department. The institution must also explicitly acknowledge its continued responsibilities under its PPA. If the documentation transferring control of a public institution to another in-state entity does not specifically acknowledge the aforementioned responsibilities, the institution must acknowledge them in a separate letter or notice. Change in ownership that results in a change of control, structure, or governance A change in ownership and control occurs when a person or corporation obtains new authority to control a school's actions, whether the school is a proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. A change in ownership that results in a change in control includes any change through which a person or corporation acquires an ownership interest in the entity that owns the school or the parent corporation of that entity, or who owns or acquires an ownership interest attains or loses the ability to control the school. Changes in ownership Sec. 498(i) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.31 Family defined 34 CFR 600.21(f) Excluded Transactions 34 CFR 600.31(e)(1) and (2) Change in ownership-publicly traded corporation 34 CFR 600.31(c)(2) Electronic submission required Changes to previous applications, including changes in ownership, reporting, expanding eligibility, and certification, must be submitted to the Department through the E-App at http://www.eligcert.ed.gov .

Parent corporation An institution that is a wholly-owned subsidiary changes ownership and control when the parent corporation changes ownership and control as described in this section.Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-119The most common example of this change in controlling interest is when the school is sold to a new owner. Other kinds of \"covered transactions\" include the transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the school or its parent corporation; the merger of two or more eligible schools; the division of one school into two or more schools; the transfer of the liabilities of a school to its parent corpora - tion; a transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the educational business of the school, except if it is exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those assets; or a conversion of the school from a for-profit to a nonprofit school or a nonprofit to a for-profit. Change in ownership for closely held corporations A closely held corporation (including the term close corporation ) is a corporation that qualifies under the law of the state of its in - corporation as a closely held corporation; or if the state of incorporation has no definition of closely held corporation, a corporation whose stock is held by no more than 30 persons and has not been and is not planned to be publicly offered. For a closely held corporation, a change in ownership and control occurs when a person acquires more than 50% of the total outstanding vot - ing stock of the corporation; a person who holds an ownership interest in the corporation acquires control of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or a person who holds or controls 50% or more of the total out - standing stock of the corporation ceases to hold or control that proportion of the stock of the corporation.Excluded transactions\u2014transfers to family members Changes of ownership do not include a transfer of ownership and control to a member of the owner's family (whether or not the family member works at the school) that includes: parent, stepparent, sibling, step-sibling, spouse, child or stepparent, sibling, step-sibling, - child or step-grandchild; child's spouse; and sibling's spouse. Nor does it include a transfer of ownership and control, upon the retirement or death of the owner, to a person (who is not a family member) with an ownership interest in the school who has been involved in management of the school for at least two years preceding the transfer and who has established and retained the ownership interest for at least two years prior to the transfer. These are known as excluded transactions, and they apply only to the transfer of the entire portion of the owner's interest. 34 CFR 600.21(f) 34 CFR 600.31(e) Training requirement after a change in ownership or control If a school undergoes a change in ownership, the school's chief financial aid administrator and its chief administrator (or a high-level school official designated by the chief administrator) must attend Fundamentals of Title IV Training. If the financial aid administrator and/or the chief administrator have not changed, the school may request a waiver of the training requirement from its school participation division. ED may grant or deny the waiver for the required individual, require another official to take the training, or require alternative training.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-120Change in ownership for publicly traded corporations For publicly traded corporations , a change in ownership and control occurs when a person acquires ownership and control of the corporation such that the corporation is required to file a Form 8K with the Securities and Exchange Commission notifying that agency of the change in control, or a person who is a controlling shareholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling shareholder. A controlling shareholder is a shareholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25% or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other shareholder. A controlling shareholder for this purpose does not include a shareholder whose sole stock ownership is held as a U.S. institutional investor, held in mutual funds, held through a profit-sharing plan, or held in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. For a publicly traded corporation, when a change of ownership occurs, instead of a same-day balance sheet, the school may submit its most recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Together with its quarterly financial statement, the school must submit copies of all other SEC filings made after the close of the fiscal year for which a compliance audit has been submitted to ED. Consider a publicly traded school that is provisionally certified because of a change in ownership that experiences another change of ownership. If any controlling shareholder on the newer change of ownership application was listed on the ownership application for which the provisional approval was granted, the expiration date for the original provisional certification remains unchanged if the newer application is approved. Change in ownership for corporations that are not closely held or registered with the SEC A change in ownership and control of a corporation that is neither closely held nor required to be registered with the SEC occurs when a person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both control of at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and managing control of the corporation.Default management plan after change in ownership or status A school that changes ownership or changes its status as a parent or subordinate institution must adopt the Sample Default Prevention Plan or develop its own default management plan that is approved by the Department. The school must implement the plan for at least two years. A school is exempt from submitting a default management plan if the parent school and the subordinate school both have a cohort default rate of 10% or less, and the new owner of the parent or subordi - nate school does not own, and has not owned, any other school with a cohort default rate over 10%. Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary IN OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND 25% THRESHOLD Ownership or ownership interest means a legal or beneficial interest in a school or its corporate parent or a right to share in the profits derived from the operation of a school or its corporate parent. The school must report any change in ownership interests whenever an owner acquires a total interest of 25% or greater, an owner who held a 25% or greater interest reduces his or her interest to less than 25%, or an owner of a 25% or greater interest increases or reduces his or her interest but remains the holder of at least a 25% owner - ship interest. Because of these reporting requirements, even though transferring ownership interest through death or retirement may be excluded from being considered a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, the resulting change in percentages of ownership interests must be reported to the Department.Ownership interest Ownership or ownership interest does not include an ownership interest held by 1. a mutual fund that is regularly and publicly traded, 2. a U.S. institutional investor as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 3. a profit-sharing plan of the school or its corporate parent (provided that all full-time permanent employees of the school or corporate parent are included in the plan), or 4. an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).Preacquisition review Schools may submit an E-App marked \"preacquisition review\" before a change in ownership takes place. The purpose of this review is to determine whether the school has answered all the questions completely and accurately. A preacquisition review application must be submitted at least 45 days prior to the expected date of the transaction. The SPD will notify the school of the results of the review. However, the school will not be given a decision whether or not its application would be approved as a result of this preacquisition review. Please note that a preacquisition review is not required; it is an option. If the potential owner decides not to purchase the school, he or she must notify the school participation division of the decision to withdraw the application. If the potential owner considering the change in ownership decides to go through with the purchase and wants to participate in the FSA programs, he or she must notify the Department within 10 days of the date the change in ownership actually took place (if this date falls on a weekend or a federal holiday, the notification may be no later than the next business day), and submit the supporting documents required for a materially complete application. (Refer to section \"M\" of the E-App for the list of specific forms to submit.) 25% Threshold 34 CFR February 20192-122A school must report any changes that result in an individual or owner (including a corporation or unincorporated business entity) acquiring the ability to substantially affect the actions of the school. Such a change must be reported within 10 days of the change. A school owned by a publicly traded corporation must report the change within 10 days after the corporation learns of the change. Adherence to these requirements is enforced during the institutional participation approval process, program reviews, and audit process. All schools are bound by these reporting requirements, and substantial penalties may be imposed on schools that fail to comply with them. An individual or corporation has the ability to substantially affect the school's actions when he, she, or it personally holds, or holds in partnership with one or more family members, at least a 25% ownership interest in the school; personally represents (with voting trust, power of attorney, or proxy authority), or represents in partnership with one or more family members, any individual or group holding at least a 25% ownership interest in the school; is the school's general partner, chief executive officer (or other executive officer), chief financial officer, individual designated as the lead program administrator for the FSA programs at the school, or a member of the school's board of directors; or is the chief executive officer (or other officer) for any entity that holds at least a 25% ownership interest in the school or is a member of the board of directors for such an entity. To ensure that its FSA program participation isn't jeopardized, a school must report to the Department an ownership change (including the names of persons involved). On receiving the notification, the Department will investigate and notify the school whether a change in ownership resulting in a change of control has occurred that will require the school to submit a materially complete application.Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-123STEPS TO BE TAKEN DURING A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP Steps to be taken by former owners If a school is changing control, the former owners must notify the Department about the change and the date it occurs, and provide any supporting information the Department requests. This must be at the same time that the owner notifies the school's accrediting agency but no later than 10 days after the change occurs. (If the former owner fails to notify the Department, the prospective owner is responsible for doing so.) The current owner also must notify the state agency that licenses or approves the school. Steps to be taken by prospective owners The prospective owner should ask the former owner for copies of the school's Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR), refund policy, return of FSA funds policy, any required default management plan, program reviews, audited financial statements (for at least the two most recently completed fiscal years), and compliance audits. The prospective owner will need this information to receive approval to participate. Accompanying the application must be audited financial statements for the school's two most recently completed fiscal years (if the school has not yet submitted statements for those years), an audited balance sheet showing the financial condition of the school at the time of the change, and a default management plan (if required). Each participating school must demonstrate financial responsibility independently. If the entity that has acquired the school is an ongoing entity (partnership or corporation), the school must also submit completed audited financial statements of the acquiring entity for the last two consecutive fiscal years. For information on financial responsibility and submitting audited financial statements see Chapter 4 . The school also must submit proof that its accreditation is continued under the new ownership or control, along with a photocopy of its state legal authorization under the new ownership. The school may not award FSA program funds until it receives a new PPA signed on behalf of the Secretary.Audits and closeout procedures Although a separate financial aid compliance audit is not required when there is a change in ownership, structure, or governance, the prospective owner may choose to have the accounts audited before they are closed out. Questions about FSA accounts or closeout procedures should be addressed to the appropriate school participation division.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-124Accepting liabilities and responsibility for return of funds If new owners acquire a school or if a school is the result of the merger of two or more schools that formerly were operating separately, the new owner is liable for any debts that accrued from the former owner's FSA program administration. A new owner accepts liability for any federal funds that were given to the school but that were improperly spent before the date the change in ownership, structure, or governance became effective. A new owner must also abide by the school's refund and the FSA Return of Funds policy for students enrolled before the date the change became effective, and must honor all student enrollment contracts signed before the date of the change. Payments to eligible students Before the change in ownership, structure, or governance takes place, the former owner should make sure that all students receive any FSA payments already due them for the current payment period and that all records are current and comply with federal regulations. If the school needs additional funds for its students for the current payment period, it should request them and disburse them to all eligible students before the change takes place. The school loses its approval to participate in the FSA programs when the change takes place. Generally, a school may use Pell or TEACH Grant or Campus-Based funds that it has received or request additional Pell Grant or Campus-Based funds from the Department to satisfy any unpaid commitment made to a student from the date the school's participation end - ed until the scheduled completion date of the payment period; and credit a student's account with the proceeds of a second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan to satisfy any un - paid commitment made to the student under the Direct Loan Program from the date participation ends until the scheduled completion of that period of enrollment. (The proceeds of the first disbursement of the loan must have been delivered to the student or credited to the student's account prior to the end of the participation.) The school must notify all new students that no federal aid funds can be disbursed until the school's eligibility is established and a new PPA signed by the Department is received. Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-125Beginning on the date that the change becomes effective, the school may no longer award FSA funds. If the school's prospective owners wish the school to participate in one or more of the FSA programs, the school must submit a materially complete application to the Department. The school can apply for preacquisition review (described in the previous section) and temporary provisional approval after the change in ownership (described in the next section). TEMPORARY APPROVAL FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION The Department, at its discretion, may permit a school undergoing a change in ownership that results in a change in control to continue to participate in the FSA programs on a provisional basis if the school meets the following specific requirement. The school must submit a materially complete application that must be received by the Department no later than 10 business days after the change becomes effective. A materially complete application for the purpose of applying for a temporary approval must include a completed application form; a copy of the school's state license or equivalent that was in ef - fect on the day before the change in ownership took place; a copy of the accrediting agency's approval (in effect on the day before the change in ownership) that granted the school ac - creditation status including an approval of the nondegree pro - grams it offers; financial statements of the school's two most recently complet - ed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with the requirements of the generally accepted accounting prin - ciples (GAAP), published by the Financial Accounting Stan - dards Board, and the generally accepted governmental auditing standards (GAGAS) published by the U.S. General Accounting Office (submitted via eZ-Audit at https://ezaudit.ed.gov ); audited financial statements for the school's new owner's two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with GAAP and GAGAS, or acceptable equivalent information for that owner (submitted via eZ-Audit at https://ezaudit.ed.gov ); and a completed signature page, Section L.Temporary approval Temporary approval Sec. 498(i)(4) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.20(g) and (h) Audits February 20192-126If the application is approved, the school participation division will send the school a Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (Temporary PPA). The Temporary PPA extends the terms and conditions of the PPA that were in effect for the school before its change of ownership. The Temporary PPA expires on the earliest of the date that the Department signs a new program participation agreement; date that the Department notifies the school that its application is denied; or last day of the month following the month in which the change of ownership occurred unless the school provides the necessary documents described as follows. The Department can automatically extend the Temporary PPA on a month-to-month extension if, prior to the expiration date, the school submits a same day balance sheet showing the school's financial posi - tion on the day the ownership changed, prepared in accordance with GAAP and audited in accordance with GAGAS; approval of the change of ownership from the school's state agency that legally authorizes postsecondary education in that state (if not already provided); approval of the change of ownership from the school's accredit - ing agency (if not already provided); and a default management plan that follows examples provided by the Department or notification that it is using the Department's plan or is exempt from providing a InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-127REPORTING SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES A school is required to report changes to certain information on its approved application, as listed on the following pages. A school may also wish to expand its FSA eligibility and certification. Some of these changes require the Department's written approval before the school may disburse the FSA program funds; others do not. If a change occurs in an E-App item not listed on the following pages , the school must update the information when it applies for recertification. When the Department is notified of a change, if further action is needed, it will tell the school how to proceed, including what materials and what additional completed sections of the E-App need to be submitted. If a school has questions about changes and procedures, it should contact its school participation division. After receiving the required materials (and depending on the circumstances), the Department will evaluate the changes, approve or deny them, and notify the school. Approval required from accreditor and state agency For a change requiring written approval from the Department (unless otherwise noted) and for some changes that do not require written approval from the Department, a school must obtain approval from the appropriate accrediting agency and state authorizing agency. Notification of school closure or bankruptcy If a school closes or files for bankruptcy, the school must notify the Department within 10 calendar days of either event by sending a letter on the school's letterhead that indicates the date the school closed or plans to close, or the date the school filed for bankruptcy, as appropriate.Update Contact Information So that we can alert a school of important issues in its administration of the Title IV programs, a school should promptly update its information in IPEDS and on the e-App when there is a change to its Chief Financial Officer, Director of Financial Aid, or their contact information.ReminderVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA 20192-128CHANGES TO LOCATION, BRANCH, OR CAMPUS The ECAR that the Department sends to the school lists the educational programs and locations that are eligible. (The eligibility of a school and its programs does not automatically include separate locations and extensions.) If, after receipt of the ECAR, a school wishes to add a location at which at least 50% of an educational program is offered, it must notify the Department. Eligibility of additional locations For purposes of qualifying as an eligible location, an additional location is not required to satisfy the two-year requirement unless the location was a facility of another school that has closed or ceased to provide educational programs for a reason other than a normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly af - fects the school or the school's students; the applicant school acquired, either directly from the school that closed or ceased to provide educational programs, or through an intermediary, the assets at the location; and the school from which the applicant school acquired the assets of the location is not making payments in accordance with an agreement to repay a liability for a violation of FSA program requirements. An additional location that falls into one of the aforementioned categories is not required to satisfy the two-year rule (see Chapter 1 ) if the applicant school agrees to be liable for all improperly expended or unspent FSA funds received by the school that has closed or ceased to provide educational programs, to be liable for all unpaid refunds owed to students who received FSA funds, and for the students who were enrolled before that date of the acquisition of the assets of the additional location, to abide by the refund policy on institutional charges of the school that has closed or ceased to provide educational programs. Each site must be legally authorized. To apply for eligibility for an added location, the school must submit an E-App to the Department with the required application sections completed, a copy of the accrediting agency's notice certifying that the new location is included in the school's accredited status, and a copy of the state legal authorization from the state in which the additional site is physically located.Notifying ED if school exceeds limitations on types of students If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted application (limitations on students who are enrolled without a high school diploma or equivalent, incarcerated students, and correspondence study), the school must notify ED via the E-App. ED will advise the school of its options, including whether the school might be eligible for a waiver. (See Chapter 4 for additional information.)Teach-outs at closed school locations A school that conducts a teach-out at a site of a closed school may apply to have that site approved as an additional location if the closed school ceased operations and the Department has taken a limitation, suspension, termination, or emergency action, regardless of whether the Department took that action before or after the school closed. The teach-out must be approved by the school's accrediting agency. The school that conducts the teach-out may establish a permanent additional location at the closed school without having to satisfy the 2-year requirement and without assuming the liabilities and cohort default rate of the closed institution, provided the schools are not commonly owned or managed. See 34 CFR 600.32(d), as amended on October 29, 2009, for further details. HEOA 2008, \u00a7496 , HEA \u00a7498 Effective 600.20(f)(3) 34 CFR 600.21(d) Electronic submission required Changes to previous applications, including changes in ownership, reporting, expanding eligibility, and certification, must be submitted to the Department through the new location All schools are required to report (using the E-App) to the Department when adding an additional accredited and licensed location where they will be offering 50% or more of an eligible program if the school wants to disburse FSA program funds to students enrolled at that location. Schools must not disburse FSA program funds to students at a new location before the school has reported that location and submitted any required supporting documents to the Department. Once it has reported a new licensed and accredited location, unless it is a school that is required to apply for approval for a new location (see below), a school may disburse FSA program funds to students enrolled at that location. Applying for approval of a new location If a school meets one or more of the following criteria, it must apply for and wait for approval before disbursing FSA funds at an additional location where it will be offering 50% or more of an eligible program: The school is provisionally certified. The school is on the cash monitoring or reimbursement system of payment. The school has acquired the assets of another school that pro - vided educational programs at that location during the preced - ing year, and the other school participated in the FSA programs during that year. The school would be subject to a loss of eligibility under the co - hort default rate regulations if it adds that location. The school was previously notified by the Department that it must apply for approval of an additional location. The Department will review the information and will evaluate the school's financial responsibility, administrative capability, and eligibility. Depending upon the circumstances, the Department may conduct an on-site review. If it approves the additional location, a revised ECAR and Approval Letter will be issued. The location is eligible as of the date of the Department's determination. Liability for disbursements if change not approved If a school does not obtain ED approval for a new location, branch, program, or increase in program offering, the school is liable for all FSA funds it disburses to students enrolled at that location or branch or in that program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-130Changing the status of a campus or branch If a school wishes to seek approval for a branch campus, the school must submit a completed application with the required supplemental documentation (see the following list) on (1) the main campus and (2) the proposed branch campus. A branch campus of an eligible proprietary institution of higher education or postsecondary vocational school must be in existence for at least two years (after it is certified in writing by the Department as a branch campus) before seeking to be designated as a main campus or a freestanding school. CHANGES TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Adding a program\u2014when a school may make eligibility determinations After a school has received an ECAR, the school may add an educational program and determine the program's eligibility unless the school has been provisionally certified, the school is receiving funds under heightened cash manage - ment, progress in the program is measured by direct assessment, the school is subject to the two-year rule, the program is a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program, or the Department has informed the school that it must request approval before adding additional programs. Before the school may determine these programs to be eligible and disburse funds to enrolled students, the school must have received both the required state and accrediting agency approvals. The school must include any \"self-certified\" programs on its next recertification application, and provide copies of the state and accreditor approvals. For new GE programs, the school must update the ECAR within 10 days of the school receiving final approval from its accreditation agency, governing authority, and other oversight bodies to make the change.Effects of closure of branch or additional location A school that is considering adding a branch or an additional location should include in its deliberations the effect that a closure of a branch or additional location might have on the school's financial condition. If a branch or additional location of an institution closes and borrowers who attended the school obtain loan discharges by reason of the closure of the branch or location (or improper loan certifications), the Department will pursue recovery against the larger institution, its affiliates, and its principals. HEA 437(c)(1) Reporting self-determined programs on the E-App Institutions are encouraged to report programs for which they have made a self- determination, at either recertification or sooner. The eligibility of these programs will be reviewed prior to the program being added to the ECAR as an eligible program. 34 CFR 600.20 (c)(3), 600.10 (c) Consequences of erroneous self- determination If the school's self-determination of eligibility for an educational program is found to be incorrect, the school is liable for all FSA program funds received for the program and all FSA program funds received by or for students enrolled in that program.ClarificationChapter 5\u2014Updating Application \"Gainful employment\" refers to certain programs offered at public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions, as defined in Chapter 2 .All other program additions must be reported to the Department and approved before FSA program funds can be awarded. Within 10 days of the school receiving final approval from its accreditation agency, governing authority, and other oversight bodies to add the program, the school must submit an E-App with the appropriate sections completed and copies of the approval of the new program from its accrediting agency and state authorizing agency. The Department will evaluate the new program and the school addition of that program. If the Department approves the school adding the additional program, the Department will issue a revised ECAR and Approval Letter and send them to the school. For more on program eligibility, see Chapter 2 . Updating a program The school must update information about its educational programs when completing its recertification application. This includes updating CIP codes, program names, and program lengths. A school must update its E-App with changes to GE programs within 10 days of making the change. Schools should note that making a significant change to a program may result in the creation of a new program. CIP codes Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes are developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode Limitations for schools subject to \"2-year rule\" For schools subject to the 2-year rule (see Chapter 1 ), during the school's initial period of participation in the FSA programs, the Department will not approve adding programs that would expand the school's eligibility beyond the current ECAR. An exception may be considered if the school can demonstrate that the program was legally authorized and continuously provided for at least two years prior to the date of the request. In addition, a school subject to the 2-year rule may not award FSA funds to a student in a program that is not included in the school's approval documents. ClarificationVolume 2\u2014School FSA HB February 20192-132CHANGES IN ACCREDITATION A school must notify the Department if the school changes its institution-wide accreditation (primary accrediting agency), or decides to seek institution-wide accreditation by an additional agency. Change in institution-wide accreditation If the school decides to change its institution-wide accreditation (primary accrediting agency ), it must notify the Department when it begins the accreditation application process with a different agency. (Note that it must also notify the Department when it completes the process.) As part of the notice, the school must submit materials about its current accreditation and materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing accreditation. If the school fails to notify the Department of the proposed change to its institution-wide accreditation, or if the school does not provide the materials just described, the Department will not recognize the school's existing accreditation. If this happens, or if the school drops its association with its former accreditor before obtaining Department approval of the change, the school would no longer have accredited status and would no longer be eligible to award FSA funds. Therefore, when a school secures new institution-wide accreditation, it must notify the Department using the online electronic application (E-App). At that time, it must advise the Department which accrediting agency will be its accreditor for purposes of FSA gatekeeping. Only after the Department provides written notice that it recognizes the new accreditor as the institution's primary accreditor should the school drop its association with its prior accreditor. Changing accrediting by more than one institution-wide accrediting agency If the school decides to become accredited by more than one institution-wide accrediting agency, it must notify the Department when it begins the process of obtaining additional accreditation. As part of the notice, the school must report (in question 15 of the E-App) its current institution-wide accrediting agency, the prospective institution-wide accrediting agency, and the reason (in question 69 of the E-App) it wishes to be accredited by more than one agency. If the school obtains the additional institution-wide accreditation and fails to notify the Department of the reason for the additional accreditation, the Department will not recognize the school's accredited status with either agency. This means the school would lose its accredited status and its eligibility to award FSA funds. If a school becomes accredited by more than one agency, it must notify its school participation division of which agency's accreditation the school will use for determining its eligibility for the FSA programs. Loss of accreditation If a school loses its primary accreditation, it is ineligible to participate in the FSA programs and must notify the Department within 10 days of the loss of accreditation. (For any dispute involving the termination of accreditation, an accredited or preaccredited school must agree to submit to binding arbitration before initiating any other legal action.) However, if a school's accrediting agency loses its recognition from the Department, the school has up to 18 months in which to obtain accreditation from another recognized agency. Other changes in accreditation may also jeopardize institutional participation. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICERS required to notify the Department of all third-party servicer contracts. If a school has submitted information regarding its third-party servicers as part of applying for certification or recertification, no additional submission is required. The school must promptly notify the Department of any of the following changes to servicer arrangements The school enters into a contract with a new third-party servicer, The school significantly modifies a contract with an existing third-party servicer, The school or one of its third-party servicers terminates a con - tract A third-party servicer ceases to provide contracted services, goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy A school notifies the Department by updating Section J of the E-App within 10 days of the date of the change or action. This notification must include the name and address of the servicer and the nature of the change or action. A school is only required to submit a copy of its contract with a third- party servicer if the Department requests it. A school is not required to submit the contract as part of the recertification process. (See Chapter 3 for more information about contracts third-party Requiring Written Approval From the Department All schools must report and wait for written approval from the U.S. Department of Education before disbursing funds when the following occur : 1. a change in accrediting agency (notify the Department when you begin making any change that deals with your school's institution-wide accreditation); 2. a change in state authorizing agency; 3. a change in institutional structure; 4. an increase in the level of educational programs (e.g. associate degree to baccalaureate degree programs, baccalaureate degree to graduate degree programs, etc.) beyond the scope of current approval; 5. the addition of short-term (300-599 clock-hour) programs ; 6. the addition of direct assessment programs or comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs; 7. changes to the FSA programs (Pell Grants, Direct Loans, etc.) for which the school is approved* (Approvals from your accrediting agency and state authorizing agency are not required for this change.); 8. a change in the type of ownership; 9. a change in ownership; 10. the addition of an accredited and licensed location if the institution would be subject to a loss of eligibility under the cohort default rate regulations (34 CFR 668.188) if it adds that location; 11. the addition of an educational program or a location at which the school offers or will offer 50 percent or more of an educational program if a school a) is provisionally certified; or b) is on the cash monitoring or reimbursement system of payment; or c) has acquired the assets of another school that provided educational programs at that loca - tion during the preceding year, and the other school participated in the FSA programs during that year; or d) has been advised by the Department that the Department must approve any new location or program before the school may begin disbursing FSA funds . When one of the changes that requires the Department's written approval occurs, a school must notify the Department. The school must apply to the Department for approval of the change via the E-App within 10 calendar days of the change (in the case of a change in ownership, 10 business days). As soon as the school has received approvals for the change from its accrediting agency and state authorizing agency, it must send to the Department copies of the approval for the change, any required documentation, and Section L of the E-App containing the original signature of the appropriate person * For TEACH Grants, select \"Add TEACH Grants\" and then use question 69 to explain the eligibility criteria that your school meets for TEACH participation.

When one of these changes occurs, a school must notify the Department by reporting the change and the date of the change to the Department via the E-App within 10 calendar days of the change. In addition, a school must mail to the School Eligibility Service Group (See the address on the second page of this chapter.) any required supporting documentation, and Section L of the E-App containing the original signature of the appropriate person. * For programmatic changes that only require the school to notify the Department, that notification must be provided at least 10 days before the first day the school intends to offer classes in the program.

This is information about: financial aid; the school's campus, facilities, student athletes, and gainful employment programs; as well as campus security and fire safety, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, and programs about them. The chapter also discusses counseling for students receiving FSA loans and disclosures that must be made for private education loans. Additional disclosure requirements that are specific to disbursements of FSA loans are described in Volume 4 .AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION Notice to enrolled students Each year a school must distribute to all enrolled students a notice of the availability of the information it must provide in the following general categories: general disclosures for enrolled or prospective students, annual security report and annual fire safety report, report on athletic program participation rates and financial support data (Equity in Athletics Data or EADA), and FERPA information (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, discussed in Chapter 7) . The notice must list and briefly describe the information and tell students how to obtain it. It must be provided on an individual basis through an appropriate mailing or publication, including direct mailing through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronic mail. Posting on an Internet or intranet website does not constitute a notice.Consumer information HEA Sec. 485(f); 20 USC 1092 staff: 34 CFR 668.44 Sample notice of FERPA rights You can find a sample notification at the Department's FERPA website. https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ferpa-model-notification-postsecondary-officials Assessing your school's compliance To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment module for \"Consumer Information,\" February 20192-140Web dissemination A school may meet the requirements for the general disclosures and the EADA, security, and fire safety reports by posting the information online.

Prospective students or prospective employees \u2014the school may post the information on an Internet website. A school that uses Internet or intranet disclosure for this purpose must include in its annual notice to enrolled students the exact electronic address of the information and a statement that the school will provide a paper copy of the information on request. With Internet or intranet distribution of the security and fire safety reports to current employees, a school must distribute to them by October 1 of each year a notice that includes a statement of the reports' availability, the exact electronic address at which they are posted, a brief description of their contents, and a statement that the school will provide a paper copy of the reports upon request. The same information must be included in a notice to prospective students and employees if a school decides to use the Web to provide annual security or fire safety reports to them. The difference is that there is no annual date for distribution of this notice; also note that the school must use an Internet, rather than an intranet, site.Civil penalty In addition to limiting, suspending, or terminating the participation of any school that fails to comply with the consumer information requirements, the Department may impose civil fines of up to $57,317 for each violation.

If the school designates one person, he shall be available upon reasonable notice to any enrolled or prospective student throughout the normal administrative working hours of the school. If more than one person is designated, their combined work schedules must be arranged so that at least one of them is available upon reasonable notice throughout the normal administrative working hours of the school. The Department may waive this requirement if the school's total enrollment or the portion participating in the FSA programs is too small to necessitate an employee or group of employees being available on a full-time basis. The granting of a waiver does not exempt an institution from designating a specific employee or group of employees to carry out on a part-time basis the information dissemination requirements. The school must request this waiver from the Department. Availability of Employees 34 CFR 668.44Volume 2\u2014School February 20192-142GENERAL STUDENT DISCLOSURES A school must make the following information available to any enrolled or prospective student through appropriate publications, mailings, or electronic media.

Summary of Civil and Criminal Penalties for Violation of Federal Copyright Laws Copyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United States Code). These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file- sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement. Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or \"statutory\" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For \"willful\" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees.

The net price is defined as the cost of attendance minus the average yearly grant and scholarship aid. The calculator provides estimated net price information to current and prospective students and should be based, as much as possible, on their individual circumstances. ED's National Center for Education Statistics has developed a template that schools can use to create their own customized net price calculator, or they can develop their own calculator. If they develop their own, it must include at a minimum the same data elements found in the Department's calculator template. Estimates produced by the net price calculator must be accompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclaimer stating that the estimate may change; that it does not represent a final determination or actual award; and that it is not binding on the Department, the school, or the state. The disclaimer must also include a link to the FAFSA website and state that students must complete the FAFSA to receive an actual Title IV financial aid award. The Financial Aid Shopping Sheet The Shopping Sheet is a resource to help consumers understand their educational costs and the aid available to meet those costs. It is a single page the Department developed that may be used as a stand-alone award letter or as a cover sheet with an institution's existing award letter. The standard format helps consumers easily compare the cost of attendance and aid awards across schools. Use of the Shopping Sheet is voluntary, though we encourage institutions to adopt it for their students. Also, for schools that receive federal funds under the military and veterans educational benefits programs, use of the Shopping Sheet helps meet a disclosure requirement of Executive Order 13607 (see the end of Chapter 3 ).Financial Aid Shopping Sheet See https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/ guid/aid-offer/index.html for more information, including links to guidance and implementation resources, and see DCL GEN-13-26 and the Electronic Announcement of November 14, 2016 (revised January 13, 2017) for templates and specifications.Net Price Calculator HEA Sec. 132(h)(3) and (4) The Net Price Calculator Information Center at https://collegecost.ed.gov/netpricecenter.aspx provides the template as well as FAQs, a zipped file with links to other schools' calculators, and resources for schools to develop their own calculators.

HEA Sec. 485(a)(1)(V)Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-147COMPLETION, GRADUATION, TRANSFER, RETENTION, AND PLACEMENT RATES Each year a school must determine the completion or graduation rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students and report it to the Department via the IPEDS website (see sidebar). If the school's mission includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible school, it must also determine the transfer-out rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students. The annual rates are based on the 12-month period that ended August 31 of the prior year. The rates will track the outcomes for students for whom 150% of the normal time for completion or graduation has elapsed. Normal time is the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically four years for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution, two years for an associate degree in a standard term-based institution, and the various scheduled times for certificate programs. (See the IPEDS instructions for further details on calculating the rate.) A school must make these annual rates available to the public no later than July 1. With requests from prospective students, the information must be made available prior to them enrolling or entering into any financial obligation with the school.Retention rates 34 CFR 668.41c and 45 Reporting rates to IPEDS The graduation, completion, and transfer- out rates are reported through the Department's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) website. The IPEDS survey is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). More information is at www.nces.ed.gov/IPEDS . Survey forms, instructions, FAQs, worksheets, and other information are posted at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/VisIndex.aspx Information can only be reported to this system by the school's designated \"keyholder.\" Schools may change keyholders any time during the year by contacting the IPEDS Help Desk at 1-877-225-2568 or ipedshelp@rti.org or by contacting Tara Lawley 202-245-7081 Team Lead, IPEDS Operations 550 12th St SW Washington, DC 20202 College Navigator site Note that your school's graduation rates are displayed on the IPEDS College Navigator site. http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigatorVolume 2\u2014School 20192-148Retention, placement, and post-graduate study The school must also provide information on its retention rate reported to IPEDS. The information must be made available to prospective students requesting it prior to them enrolling or entering into any financial obligation with the institution. the placement of, and types of employment obtained by, graduates of the school's degree or certificate programs. Placement rate information may be gathered from state data systems, alumni or student satisfaction surveys, the school's placement rate for any program, if it calculates such a rate, or other relevant sources. If the school calculates a placement rate, it must disclose that rate. for any 4-year program at the school, the types of graduate and professional education in which its graduates enroll. This information may be gathered from state data systems, alumni or student satisfaction surveys, or other relevant sources. In the case of placement information and the types of graduate and professional education, the school must identify the source of the information as well as any time frames and methodology associated with it.Optional calculations In addition to calculating the completion or graduation rate as described, a school may, but is not required to 1. calculate a completion or graduation rate for students who transfer into the school; 2. calculate a completion or graduation rate for students who have left school to serve in the armed forces, on official church missions, or with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps, or who are totally and permanently disabled; and 3. calculate a transfer-out rate, even if the school determines that its mission does not include providing substantial preparation for its students to enroll in another eligible school. 34 CFR 668.45(f)Chapter 6\u2014Consumer 20192-149DISCLOSURES AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS A school must disclose certain information about each of its gainful employment programs to prospective students in the format of the GE Disclosure Template. Availability of the template is announced each year through an electronic announcement posted to IFAP. The sidebar provides a link to the Gainful Employment page of IFAP where this electronic announcement, the Quick Start Guide providing instructions for using the GE Disclosure Template, as well the template itself, may be found. An institution that offers a GE program in more than one program length must publish a separate disclosure template for each length of the program. Similarly, an institution that offers a GE program in more than one location or format (e.g., full-time, part-time, accelerated) may publish a separate disclosure template for each location or format if doing so would result in clearer disclosures. Disseminating information about gainful employment programs For each program the school must include the required information in promotional materials it makes available to prospective students, and it must prominently display the information in a simple and meaningful manner on the homepage of the program's website. Any other webpage containing general, academic, or admissions information about the program must have a prominent and direct link to the single webpage that contains all the required information.GE disclosures 34 CFR 668.412 Additional information on IFAP The Gainful Employment page on IFAP includes links to frequently asked questions and resources such as electronic announcements, webinars, and regulatory materials. https://ifap.ed.gov/ GainfulEmploymentInfo/indexV2.html GE Disclosure Template (GEDT) Schools must use the GEDT-produced output code to post disclosure information to their gainful employment program webpages. The GEDT Quick Start Guide takes users through the steps to do that and can also be found at the following site. https://ope.ed.gov/GainfulEmployment/ GEDT_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf 34 CFR 668.412 CIP & SOC codes The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) is a hierarchical (taxonomic) system used for classifying education programs to support the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system was created and is updated annually by the Standard Occupational Classification Policy Committee (SOCPC) in the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-150Updating GE disclosure requirements Schools must use the template provided by the Secretary to disclose information about each of their GE programs to enrolled and prospective students, and they must update the information in the template at least annually. The Department will identify the information that must be included in the template in a notice published in the Federal Register . Program webpages On any webpage containing academic, cost, financial aid, or admissions information about a GE program maintained by or on behalf of a school, the school must provide the disclosure template for that program or a prominent, readily accessible, clear, conspicuous, and direct link to the disclosure template for that program. CAMPUS CRIME AND SAFETY INFORMATION A school must distribute annual campus security reports to its students and employees. If it maintains on-campus student housing, it must also disseminate an annual fire safety report. The reports that are disseminated to the school community must include descriptions of the school's policies, procedures, and programs. These reports must include the campus security and fire safety statistics reported to the Department each year (explained later in this section). Crime log Schools must have policies that encourage complete, timely reporting of all crimes to the campus police and appropriate law enforcement agencies. If they have a campus police or security department, they must keep a written, easily understood, daily crime log. The log must list any crime by the date it was reported to the campus police or security department and that occurred within its Clery geography, as defined under Definitions Related to Crime Reporting in this Chapter . The log must also include the nature, date, time, and general location of each crime and the disposition of the complaint if known. The school must make an entry or an addition to an entry to the log within two business days (Monday-Friday, except days when the school is closed) of the report of the information to the campus police or security department unless that disclosure is prohibited by law or would jeopardize the confidentiality of the victim.Crime and fire data on the Web The campus crime and fire safety statistics for schools are at http://ope.ed.gov/security/ . Crime statistics are also on the College Navigator site http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/ .VAWA tools The Department of Justice website www.changingourcampus.org is an online clearinghouse of resources addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The Department of Education also has an online list of resources that might help schools with their sexual assault training and prevention: https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/ February 20192-151A school may withhold one or more of the required pieces of information if there is clear and convincing evidence that the release of the information would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, or result in the destruction of evidence. However, the school must disclose any information withheld for any of these reasons once the adverse effect is no longer likely to occur. The school must make the crime log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours. The school must make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Crimes to be reported A school must report to the Department and disclose in its annual security report statistics for the three most recent calendar years the number of each of the following crimes that occurred on or within its Clery geography (see Definitions Related to Crime Reporting later in this Chapter) and that are reported to local police agencies or to a campus security authority: 1. Primary crimes, including criminal homicide (murder, non- negligent manslaughter, and negligent manslaughter); sex offenses (rape, fondling, incest, and statutory rape); robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; motor vehicle theft; arson 2. Arrests and referrals for disciplinary actions, including arrests for liquor law violations, drug law violations, and illegal weapons possession and persons not arrested for one of those offenses but who were referred for campus disciplinary action 3. Hate crimes, including the number of each type of primary crime listed above that is determined to be a hate crime and the number of the following that are determined to be hate crimes: larceny-theft, simple assault, intimidation, destruction/damage/ vandalism of property 4. Dating violence, domestic violence, and stalkingCrimes to be reported 34 CFR 688.46(c)(1) Clery/Campus Security Act The full title of the Clery Act is the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. It has been amended several times, most recently by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) enacted March 7, 2013. Among other provisions, VAWA requires institutions to compile statistics for certain crimes that are reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies, including incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These crime statistics must be reported to the Department through the web-based data collection. Schools must also include certain policies, procedures, and programs pertaining to these crimes in their annual security reports. Final regulations to implement these statutory changes to the Clery Act were published on October 20, 2014, and went into effect on July 1, 2015. See DCL GEN-15-15 for a summary of major changes to the Clery Act regulations. HEA Sec. 485(f) 20 U.S.C. February 20192-152Reported crimes must be recorded A school must include in its crime statistics all crimes listed above occurring on or within its Clery geography that are reported to a campus security authority for the purpose of Clery Act reporting. Clery Act reporting does not require initiating an investigation or disclosing personally identifying information about the victim. A school may not withhold or remove a reported crime from its crime statistics based on a decision by a court, coroner, jury, prosecutor, or other similar noncampus official. But a school may withhold or remove a reported crime from its statistics when sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel have fully investigated the reported crime and have made a formal determination that the crime report is false or baseless and therefore unfounded. Only sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel may \"unfound\" a crime report for these purposes. The recovery of stolen property, the low value of stolen property, the refusal of the victim to cooperate with the prosecution, and the failure to make an arrest do not unfound a crime report. A school must report to the Department and disclose in its annual security report statistics the total number of crime reports that were unfounded and subsequently withheld from its crime statistics.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & 20192-153Clery geography \u2014For the purpose of collecting statistics on the crimes described under Crimes to be reported earlier in this chapter , Clery geography includes buildings and property that are part of the institution's campus, the institution's non-campus buildings and property, and public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.

A school must annually submit a copy of the fire safety statistics to the Department and include the fire safety statistics in its annual report to the campus community.Sample Statement of Availability Schools may use the following sample notice to inform students and employees of the availability of its Combined Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report: Giant Capital City University is committed to assisting all members of the GCCU community in providing for their own safety and security. The annual security and fire safety compliance document is available on the GCCU website . If you would like to receive the combined Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which contains this information, you can stop by the University Police Department at 6666 President Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20001 or you can request that a copy be mailed to you by calling (XXX) XXX-XXXX. The website and booklet contain information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. They also contain information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by GCCU ; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. This information is required by law and is provided by GCCU Police Department. Fire safety Fire safety requirements were added by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008. HEA 485(i) 34 February 20192-157Annual submission of campus security and fire safety statistics Each year, the Department sends a letter to the school's president or chief executive officer with information on accessing the Campus Safety and Security Survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/security ), where schools submit statistics for the crimes described under Crimes to be Reported earlier in this Chapter, and for fire safety (see below) for the three most recent calendar years that have available data. The website explains how to tabulate these statistics. The letter contains any changes to the survey, the collection dates for the survey, the name of the person who completed the reporting (the campus safety survey administrator) at the school the previous year, and a new ID and password for completing the survey. Schools with any on-campus student housing facility must submit annual fire safety statistics to the Department. The report must include statistics on the number and causes of fires, as well as fire-related injuries, death, and property damage for each on-campus student housing facility. The fire safety statistics are due at the same time as the crime statistics.Bookstores and safety reporting If a school contracts with an entity to provide bookstore services and the bookstore is located on-campus, or if it is in any off-campus building or property owned or controlled by the school, the school must include the bookstore among the locations for which it reports campus crime and safety information as provided in 34 CFR 668.46. Handbook for Campus Crime Reporting To assist schools in fully complying with the Clery Act, the Department has developed The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting . The handbook defines the categories of crime and procedures for reporting them, as well as the requirements for timely warnings and maintenance of a daily crime log. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting also covers fire safety and the required fire safety log. The handbook is available at https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/attachments/HandbookforCampusSafetyandSecurityReporting.pdfVolume 2\u2014School DCL FSA HB February 20192-158Distributing security and fire safety reports to enrolled students and current employees By October 1 of each year, a school must distribute to all enrolled students and current employees its annual security report and fire safety reports through appropriate publications and mailings including direct mailing to each individual through the U.S. Postal Ser - vice, campus mail, or electronic mail; a publication or publications provided directly to each indi - vidual; or posting on an Internet or intranet website (see conditions for Web distribution at the beginning of this chapter). The two reports can be published together or separately. If published together, the title of the document must clearly state that it contains both the Annual Security Report and the Annual Fire Safety Report. If published separately, each report must contain information on how to directly access the other report. Disseminating reports to prospective students and employees For each of the reports, the school must provide a notice to prospective students and prospective employees that includes a statement of the report's availability, a description of its contents, and an opportunity to request a copy. A school must provide its annual security report and annual fire safety report, upon request, to a prospective student or prospective employee. If the school chooses to provide either its annual security report or annual fire safety report to prospective students and prospective employees by posting the disclosure on an Internet website, the school must follow the procedures for Web dissemination described earlier.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA 20192-159Missing persons procedures A school that provides on-campus student housing must establish a missing student notification policy and include a description of the policy in its annual security report to the campus community. The policy must include a list of titles of the persons or organizations to which students, employees, or other individuals should report that a student has been missing for 24 hours; require that any missing student report be referred immediately to the school's police or campus security department (if the school doesn't have such a department, it must refer the report to the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area); and include an option for each student to identify a contact person or persons whom the school shall notify within 24 hours of a determination (by the school's police or campus security department or the local law enforcement agency) that the student is missing. Students must be advised that their contact information will be registered confidentially, that this information will be accessible only to authorized campus officials, and that it may not be disclosed, except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of a missing person in - vestigation; if they are under 18 years of age and not emancipated, the school must notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any additional contact person designated by the student; and the school will notify the local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing unless the local law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student is missing. When a student who resides in an on-campus student housing facility is determined to have been missing for 24 hours, the school must notify within 24 hours the contact person (if the student has designated one), and the student's custodial parent or guardian (if the student is less than 18 years old and is not emancipated).Missing persons procedures\u2014 private right of action The requirements for a school to establish missing persons procedures do not provide a private right of action to any person to enforce a provision of the subsection or create a cause of action against any institution of higher education or any employee of the institution for any civil liability. HEA section 485(j)Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-160In all cases, the school must inform the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area within 24 hours that the student is missing. Emergency response and evacuation A school must develop emergency response and evacuation procedures and include a description of its procedures in its annual security report to the campus community. A school must develop procedures to immediately notify the campus community upon the confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on the campus. At a minimum, schools must have procedures to confirm that a significant emergency or dangerous situation (as described above) exists; determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community to receive a notification, the content of the notification; and to initiate the notification system; disseminate emergency information to the larger community; and test the emergency response and evacuation procedures on at least an annual basis, including announced or unannounced tests. The school must compile a list of the titles of those persons or organizations responsible for determining whether an emergency or dangerous situation exists and who are authorized to initiate the notification process and include this information in the annual report. In an emergency or a dangerous situation, a school must, without delay and accounting for the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate the notification system unless issuing a notification will, in the judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency.Definition of \"test\" Regularly scheduled drills, exercises, and appropriate follow-through activities designed for assessment and evaluation of emergency plans and capabilities.Publicizing procedures The school must publicize its emergency response and evacuation procedures in conjunction with at least one test per calendar year. The school must document each test with a description of the exercise, stating the date and time, and indicating whether it was announced or unannounced.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-161Timely warning and emergency notification A school must, in a manner that is timely and that withholds as confidential the names and other identifying information of victims , and that will aid in the prevention of similar crimes, report to the campus community on crimes that are included in its campus crime statistics (see the discussion under Crimes to be Reported earlier in this Chapter), or reported to local police agencies or to campus security authorities (as identified under the school's statement of current campus policies), and considered by the school to represent a threat to students and employees. A school is not required to provide a timely warning with respect to crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, a school must follow its emergency notification procedures. A school that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the school must provide adequate follow-up information to the community as needed.Volume 2\u2014School 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-162DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION A school that participates in the FSA programs must provide to its students, faculty, and employees information to prevent drug and alcohol abuse, and it must also have a drug and alcohol prevention program, as discussed later. In addition, a school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must have a drug-free awareness program for its employees that includes a notice to them of unlawful activities and the actions the school will take against an employee who violates these prohibitions. Information to be included in drug prevention materials for students and employees A school must provide the following in its materials: Standards of conduct that clearly prohibit, at a minimum, the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of drugs and alcohol by students and employees on the school's property or as part of the school's activities A description of the sanctions under local, state, and federal law for unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol A description of any drug and alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation programs available to students and employees A description of the health risks associated with the use of il - licit drugs and alcohol A clear statement that the school will impose sanctions on stu - dents and employees for violations of the standards of conduct (consistent with local, state, and federal law) and a description of these sanctions, up to and including expulsion, termination of employment, and referral for prosecution Distribution of materials to all students and employees The school may include this information in publications such as student or employee handbooks, provided that these publications are distributed to each student and employee. Merely making drug prevention materials available to those who wish to take them is not sufficient. The school must use a method that will reach every student and employee, such as the method used to distribute grade reports or paychecks. The school must distribute these materials annually. If new students enroll or new employees are hired after the initial distribution for the year, the school must make sure that they also receive the materials.Drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs These requirements are found in 34 CFR 86\u2014Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention. The regulations published in the Federal Register , August 16, 1990, offer a number of suggestions for developing a drug prevention program. Drug-Free Workplace The FSA requirements are derived from the 1989 Amendments to the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Acts of 1986 and 1988. See Public Law 101-226. Because a school applies for and receives its Campus-Based allocation directly from the Department, the school is considered to be a federal grant recipient and as such is required to make a good faith effort on a continuing basis to maintain a drug-free workplace. 34 CFR Part 84 Also see the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690) Drug and alcohol prevention Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (Public Law 101-226) Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690) 34 CFR 84 Government-Wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace 34 CFR 86 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention 34 CFR 668.14(c) Notice of penalties A school must provide to every student upon enrollment a separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice with information on the penalties associated with drug- related offenses. For students who have lost Title IV eligibility due to drug convictions, the school must provide a separate, clear notice of the loss and how to regain eligibility. See Volume 1 of the Handbook for information about losing and regaining eligibility in these cases. HEA section 485(k)Failure to have a prevention program 34 CFR February 20192-163Drug and alcohol abuse prevention program Every participating school must certify that on the date it signs the Program Participation Agreement it has a drug and alcohol abuse prevention program in operation that is accessible to any officer, employee, or student at the school. The program adopted by the school must include an annual distribution to all students, faculty, and staff of information concerning drug and alcohol abuse and the school's prevention program. A school must review its program once every two years to determine its effectiveness and to ensure that its sanctions are being enforced. As a part of this biennial review, the school must determine the number of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities that occur on a school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities and that are reported to campus officials; and the number and type of sanctions that are imposed by the school as a result of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities on the school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities. The school must make available upon request the results of the review as well as the data and methods supporting its conclusions. If a school does not certify that it has a prevention program or fails to carry out a prevention program, the Department may terminate any or all forms of federal financial aid to the school and may require it to repay any or all federal financial aid that it received while not in compliance. Drug-Free Workplace requirements for Campus-Based schools A school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must take certain steps to provide a drug-free workplace, including establishing a drug-free awareness program to provide infor - mation to employees, distributing a notice to its employees of prohibited unlawful activities and the school's planned actions against an employee who violates these prohibitions, and notifying the Department and taking appropriate action when it learns of an employee's conviction under any criminal drug statute. A school's administrative cost allowance may be used to help defray related expenses, such as the cost of printing informational materials given to employees. The administrative cost allowance is discussed in Volume 6: Campus-Based Programs .Additional sources of information The following resources are available for schools that are developing prevention programs: The Drug-Free Workplace Helpline\u2014 Provides information to private entities about workplace programs and drug testing. Proprietary and private nonprofit schools may call this line (1-800-967-5752). www.samhsa.gov/workplace Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration\u2014SAMHSA (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services) Treatment and Referral Hotline 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357) Publications: http://store.samhsa.gov/home Measuring the effectiveness of prevention programs The effectiveness of a school's prevention program may be measured by tracking the number of drug- and alcohol-related disciplinary actions, treatment referrals, and incidents recorded by campus police or other law enforcement officials. You may also find it useful to track the number of students or employees attending self-help or other counseling groups related to alcohol or drug abuse and to survey student, faculty, and employee attitudes and perceptions about the drug and alcohol problem on campus.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility 20192-164The drug-free workplace requirements apply to all offices and departments of a school that receives Campus-Based funds. Organizations that contract with the school are considered subgrantees not subject to the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act. INFORMATION ABOUT ATHLETICS The EADA Report The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) requires a school that has an intercollegiate athletic program to make prospective students aware of its commitment to providing equitable athletic opportunities for its male and female students. As part of this requirement, each fall schools must make certain information available to students, prospective students, and the public in easily accessible places and must also report the information to the Department. The annual report, officially called The Report on Athletic Program Participation Rates and Financial Support Data and commonly referred to as the EADA Report, must include information on the number of male and female full-time undergraduate stu - dents that attended the school (undergraduate students are those who are consistently designated as such by the school), the total amount and ratio of athletically related student aid awarded to male athletes compared to female athletes, the expenses incurred by the school for men's and women's sports, total annual revenues for men's or women's sports, the annual school salary of non-volunteer head coaches and as - sistant coaches for men's and women's teams, and for each varsity team in intercollegiate competition, the num - ber and gender of participants and coaches, operating expenses, etc. A school must publish its EADA report by October 15 and make it available upon request to students, prospective students, and the public. For example, a school may make hard copies of the report available in intercollegiate athletic offices, admissions offices, or libraries, or by providing a copy to all students in their electronic mailbox. Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) HEA Section 485(e) and (g) 668.41(g) 34 CFR 668.47 EADA data on the Web The Department posts the EADA reports for participating schools on the Web at http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/ . Definitions Undergraduate students\u2014 For purposes of \u00a7668.45 and 668.48 (completion and graduation rates for students and student athletes) only, means students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, an associate degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate. 34 CFR 668.41(a) Certificate or degree-seeking student \u2014a student enrolled in a course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a degree or certificate.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School 20192-165Exception to providing completion/ graduation rates for student athletes A school does not have to provide a report on completion or graduation rates to the prospective student athlete and the athlete's parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor, if the institution is a member of a national collegiate athletic association, the association compiles data on behalf of its member institutions, which the Department determines are substan - tially comparable to those required by \u00a7668.48(a), and the association distributes the compi - lation to all secondary schools in the United States. 34 CFR 668.41(f)A school must provide the report promptly to anyone who requests the information. For example, a school may not refuse to provide a copy of the report to the news media, and the school may not require an individual requesting the information to come to the school to view the report. A school may not charge a fee for the information. A school must submit its equity in athletics report to the Department via the EADA survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/athletics ) annually within 15 days of making it available to students, prospective students, and the public. Note that a password and user ID are required for use of this website. They are sent by the Department to the chief administrator at the school. For help with this site, contact eadahelp@ westat.com . For specific categories and reporting rules, please see the EADA User's Guide for the online survey. Completion and graduation rates for student athletes As part of their EADA disclosures, schools that offer athletically related student aid must produce an annual report that includes the following: The number of students, categorized by race and gender, who attended the school in the year prior to the submission of the report. The number of the students above who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer- out rate of all the entering, certificate- or degree-seeking, full- time, undergraduate students described in 34 CFR \u00a7668.45(a) (1), categorized by race and gender. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer- out rate of the entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1) who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate for the four most recent completing or gradu - ating classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1), (3), and (4), categorized by race and gender. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has.Waiver of completion/graduation data calculation A school does not have to calculate and make available its completion or graduation rate (and, if applicable, transfer-out rate) if it is a member of an athletic association or conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation rate data or has agreed to publish data and the Department has granted a waiver of the requirements to provide these rates to coaches and guidance counselors. To receive a waiver, your school or its athletic association or conference must submit a written application to the Department that explains why it believes the data the athletic association or conference publishes are accurate and substantially comparable to the information required by this section. Even if the waiver is granted, your school must comply with the requirements of \u00a7668.41(d)(3) (upon request, providing its retention rate to a prospective student) and (f) (providing retention rates and completion or graduation rates for prospective student athletes and their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor). 34 CFR 668.45(e)(1)Volume 2\u2014School February 20192-166 The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate of the four most recent completing or graduat - ing classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45 (a)(1) who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has. A school must provide this report to prospective student athletes, their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor (see the sidebar exception). The definition of athletically related student aid used here is the same definition that is also used for the EADA disclosure requirements. The definitions of certificate- or degree-seeking students, first-time undergraduate students, undergraduate students, and normal time are the same as those used for the calculation of completion or graduation and transfer-out rates for a school's general student body DCL 20192-167TEXTBOOK INFORMATION To the maximum extent practicable, a school must post verified textbook pricing information for both required and recommended materials for all classes (i.e., not just the school's online classes) on the schedule that the school has posted online. This pricing information must include the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and retail price for all required and recommended textbooks and supplemental materials for each course listed in the institution's course schedule used for preregistration and registration. If the ISBN is not available, the pricing information must include the publisher and copyright date, as well as the title and author. If the school determines that disclosure of this pricing information is not practicable, it may substitute the designation \"To Be Determined (TBD)\" in lieu of the required pricing information. If applicable, the school must include on its written course schedule a reference to the textbook information available on its Internet schedule and the Internet address for that schedule. Schools are encouraged to provide information on renting textbooks, purchasing used textbooks, textbook buy-back programs, and alternative content delivery programs. A school must provide the following information to its bookstore if the bookstore requests it the school's course schedule for the subsequent academic period; and for each course or class offered, the information it must include on its Internet course schedule for required and recommended textbooks and supplemental material, the number of students enrolled, and the maximum student enrollment.Textbook information The statutory requirement regarding textbook disclosures was described in DCL GEN-08-12. Further guidance was given in GEN-10-09. Also note that the law requires textbook publishers to provide information to faculty about pricing, copyright dates of previous editions, content revisions, alternate formats, etc. HEA section 133Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-168LOAN COUNSELING Entrance counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Loan borrowers. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan to a borrower who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan or Federal Stafford or SLS Loan, you must ensure that he receives entrance counseling. Similarly, you must ensure that a graduate or professional student who is borrowing a Direct PLUS Loan has received entrance counseling, unless he received a prior graduate/professional Direct or Federal PLUS Loan. Entrance loan counseling is recommended but not required for parent PLUS borrowers except as explained in the margin. For information on counseling requirements for the TEACH Grant program, please see the sidebar on TEACH Grant Counseling found next to the discussion under TEACH exit counseling later in this chapter. You may not require that students complete additional counseling. As a condition for receiving a Direct Loan, you may include in your entrance counseling more material and information than that required in the regulations (in the discussion under DL Entrance Counseling\u2014 Required Elements later in this chapter). This extra content can be provided as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods. The added material must be reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to students' borrowing decisions and may not be administered in a way that unreasonably impedes their ability to borrow. So you can require that students take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling, but you cannot establish a passing score that they must get to receive a Direct Loan. You can require first-time student borrowers to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing, but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan. As part of your entrance counseling policy for first-time student borrowers, you may require them to participate in a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity, but the timing and other conditions of the activity must be reasonable so that students are able to receive their loan funds in a timely manner. See DCL GEN-15-06 for more information.Loan counseling and disclosures 34 CFR 674.16(a) See also DCL GEN-16-05 about the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 for Perkins disclosures in addition to those in the regulation cited above. Alternative entrance counseling approaches The DL regulations explain how a school may adopt alternative approaches as a part of its quality assurance plan; see 34 CFR 685.304(a)(8).Loan counseling materials Schools can find counseling materials, such as the entrance and exit counseling guides, in the Financial Aid Toolkit (FinancialAidToolkit.ed.gov/resources). Special PLUS loan counseling Special loan counseling is required for any PLUS Loan applicant, student or parent, who has an adverse credit history but who qualifies for a PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or being reconsidered due to extenuating circumstances. While the counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, the Department offers voluntary counseling for all PLUS borrowers. See 34 CFR 685.200(b)(5) and (c)(2)(viii), and the January 27, 2015 electronic announcement on \"Early Implementation of Changes in Regulations for Adverse Credit History Under the Direct Loan Program.\" Note that the special counseling described above is separate from the entrance counseling that all graduate and professional student PLUS Loan borrowers must complete in accordance with 34 CFR 685.304(a)(2) and the electronic announcement from January 27, & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-169Exit counseling A Perkins Loan borrower or Direct Loan student borrower who is graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment is required to complete exit counseling. If the borrower drops out without notifying your school, you must confirm that he has completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to him at his last known address. It is also acceptable to email the information to his home (not school) email address if you have it. The print or PDF version of the Exit Counseling Guide for Federal Student Loan Borrowers satisfies this requirement for Direct Loan student borrowers. Whatever material you use, you must mail or email it within 30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session. When mailing exit materials to students who have left school, you're not required to use certified mail with a return receipt requested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent. If they fail to provide updated contact information, you are not required to take further action. Providing borrower information at separation Personal information collected for exit counseling provided by the school must be given to students' loan servicer within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to lenders in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete loan exit counseling online at www.studentloans.gov fulfill this requirement; NSLDS provides the completion information to the loan holders. Counseling methods The Direct Loan Program offers both entrance and exit counseling on the Web for students. There is PLUS Loan credit counseling for parents and graduate students as well. Your school may also elect to provide entrance counseling through an in-person session or by providing a separate written form to the student that she signs and returns to the school. If your staff are conducting in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that the student understands the terms and conditions of his loans. Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit counseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the FSA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student's questions.Updating borrower information A Direct Loan school should send updated borrower information obtained during school-provided exit counseling to the federal loan servicer to whom the loan has been assigned. DL Online Counseling Students can take loan entrance and exit counseling at https://studentloans.gov. PLUS Loan Credit counseling for parents and graduate students is also available. Note that PLUS Loan credit counseling is only available at StudentLoans.gov. Your school will receive notification (via SAIG) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. Completed loan counseling can also be viewed on the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov/ . If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department's online counseling, it has satisfied its responsibility for electronic counseling.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-170Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans 34 CFR 685.304(a)(6) Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must: (i) Explain the use of a master promissory note (MPN); (ii Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the student borrower is assuming; (iii) Describe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures under federal law, and litigation; (iv) Emphasize that the student borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even if the student borrower does not complete the program, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services that the student borrower purchased from the school; (v) Inform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on\u2014 (A) A range of student levels of indebtedness of Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers or student borrowers with Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS Loans, depending on the types of loans the borrower has obtained; or (B) The average indebtedness of other borrowers in the same program at the same school as the borrower; (vi) To the extent practicable, explain the effect of accepting the loan to be disbursed on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student financial assistance; (vii) Provide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either the borrower or the Secretary; (viii) Inform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school; (ix) Explain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school, during regular terms and summer school, if applicable, and the consequences of not maintaining half-time enrollment; (x) Explain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws prior to completing the borrower's program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling, including information regarding the borrower's repayment options and loan consolidation; (xi) Provide information on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and how the borrower can access the borrower's records; (xii) Provide the name of and contact information for the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has any questions about the borrower's rights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan; and (xiii) For first-time borrowers, explain the limitation on eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans and possible borrower responsibility for accruing interest, including\u2014DL Entrance Counseling\u2014Required Elements (A) The possible loss of eligibility for additional Direct Subsidized Loans; (B) How a borrower's maximum eligibility period, remaining eligibility period, and subsidized usage period are calculated; (C) The possibility that the borrower could become responsible for accruing interest on previously received Direct Subsidized Loans and the portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Subsidized Loan during in-school status, the grace period, authorized periods of deferment, and certain periods under the Income-Based Repayment and Pay As You Earn Repayment plans; and (D) The impact of borrower responsibility for accruing interest on the borrower's total debt.

TEACH Grant initial and subsequent counseling must be completed on the Department's StudentLoans.gov website. Schools that participate in the TEACH Grant Program must also ensure that, all TEACH Grant recipients receive TEACH Grant exit counseling before they cease enrollment at the school where they received TEACH Grants, at a time determined by the school. Schools may provide TEACH Grant exit counseling themselves, or they may require TEACH Grant recipients to complete the counseling on the Department's NSLDS Student Access site www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA . Your school will receive daily system generated responses from COD when a student has completed TEACH Grant Exit counseling and chosen to notify your school. Your school will also receive a weekly report from COD on all students who have completed TEACH exit counseling and chosen to notify your school. If a student fails to complete exit counseling electronically on StudentLoans.gov, you must ensure that the counseling is provided either in person, through interactive electronic means, or by mailing written counseling materials (such as the PDF version of the exit counseling program available on the StudentLoans.gov website) to the student's last known address. For students who are unofficial withdrawals (see Volume 5, Chapter 1), you must provide exit counseling within 30 days of learning of the withdrawal. Counseling for correspondence and study-abroad students If the student has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a correspondence or distance learning program and has not previously received an FFEL or Direct Loan at that school, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance counseling that meets FSA requirements or provide entrance counseling information by mail before releasing loan money. In the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the borrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that he provide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.TEACH Grant Counseling Students complete TEACH Grant initial and subsequent counseling and agreement to serve (ATS) processes at https://StudentLoans.gov . Students complete TEACH Grant exit counseling on the NSLDS Student Access site at https://StudentLoans.gov . Schools are responsible for TEACH recipients receiving exit counseling when they are no longer enrolled in the program.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-173Providing additional information Your school can take additional steps to counsel students, for example, in developing a budget, estimating need for loans, and planning for repayment. You can reinforce messages to borrowers; with each disbursement you can remind them about the importance of SAP, planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan servicer. More ideas for loan counseling are given in the \"Sample Default Management and Prevention Plan.\" Financial literacy You should provide borrowers with counseling at various stages of enrollment, interactive tools to manage debt, repayment options, school contact information, and information about the income potential of occupations relevant to their course of study. You can give this information through a variety of media such as face-to-face counseling, classes, publications, e-tutorials, e-mailed newsletters, and supplements to award letters. You can offer a financial literacy course on a credit or non- credit basis as long as receiving a loan is not contingent upon taking the course. In addition, you should also refer borrowers to the Department's Financial Awareness Counseling Tool (FACT) available at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/prepare-for-college/budgeting/creating-your-budget At-risk students You should identify and provide special counseling for at-risk students, such as those who withdraw prematurely from their educational programs, who do not meet SAP standards, or both. The most recent sample default plan was an attachment to GEN-05-14 and is also available under \"Default Prevention Resources\" on February 20192-174PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS A private education loan is a non-FSA loan that is made to a borrower expressly for postsecondary education expenses, regardless of whether the loan is provided through the educational institution that the student attends or directly to the borrower from the private educational lender. (See the sidebar definition for exclusions.) Private education loans made by schools include Public Health Service Loans, such as Health Professions Student Loans. However, Federal Perkins Loans are not considered to be private educational loans. If a private education loan is part of a preferred lender arrangement, it is subject to the rules for those arrangements (described later in this section). Disclosures required for private education loans A school or affiliated organization that provides information regarding a private education loan from a lender to a prospective borrower must provide the following disclosures, even if it does not participate in a preferred lender arrangement. The private education loan disclosures must provide the prospective borrower with the information re - quired by 15 U.S.C. 1638(e)(1) [12 CFR 226.47(a) in the Fed - eral Reserve System regulations], and inform the prospective borrower that she may qualify for FSA loans or other assistance from the FSA programs and that the terms and conditions of an FSA loan may be more favorable than the provisions of private education loans. The school or affiliate must ensure that information about private education loans is presented in such a manner as to be distinct from information about FSA loans. The school must, upon the request of the applicant, discuss with her the availability of federal, state, and institutional student financial aid.Private education loans 34 CFR 668.14(b)(28) and (29) Requirements for preferred lender list 34 CFR 601.10 Self-certification form 34 CFR 601.11(d) Information required to complete the self- certification form 34 CFR 668.14(b)(29) Private education loan definition The definition of a private education loan given at the beginning of this section is based on the definition given in the Federal Reserve System regulations, which excludes some forms of credit, including: (1) An extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, a reverse mortgage transaction, a residential mortgage transaction, or any other loan that is secured by real property or a dwelling; or (2) An extension of credit in which the educational institution is the lender if\u2014 (i) The term of the extension of credit is 90 days or less; or (ii) An interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the extension of credit is one year or less, even if the credit is payable in more than four installments. 12 CFR 226.46(b)(5) Authority: 20 USC 1019, lender definition 15 USC 1650(a)(7) (A) a financial institution, as defined in section 1813 of Title 12 that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans; (B) a federal credit union, as defined in section 1752 of Title 12 that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans; and (C) any other person engaged in the business of soliciting, making, or extending private education loans. Definition 34 CFR 601.2 Institution-affiliated organization \u2014one that is directly or indirectly related to a covered institution and that recommends, promotes, or endorses education loans for students attending the covered institution or their families. An institution- affiliated organization may include an alumni organization, athletic organization, foundation, or social, academic, or professional organization of a covered institution and does not include any lender with respect to any education loan secured, made, or extended by such lender.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-175Self-certification form for private education loans A lender must obtain a signed, completed self-certification form from the loan applicant before initiating a private education loan. The applicant may obtain a copy of the self-certification form from the private lender and submit it to your school for completion or confirmation. Your school may also, at its option, provide the information needed to complete the form directly to the lender. If the loan applicant (the student or parent) requests a copy of the self-certification form from your school, you must provide it. He may also request, if the student has been enrolled or admitted to your school, that you complete section 2 before providing him the form. You must do that to the extent that you have the information. Section 2 of the form collects the student's cost of attendance (see Volume 3, Chapter 2 ), the estimated financial assistance (EFA), and the difference between them. The EFA includes, for students who have completed the FAFSA, the amounts of aid that replace the EFC, which you determined according to the rules in Volume 3, Chapter 7 ; it does not include the private education loan(s) that the self-certification form is for. Schools as private lenders Note that if a school solicits, makes, or extends private education loans, it is considered to be a private educational lender that is subject to the Federal Reserve's regulations on private educational lenders. When the school is the private education lender, it must complete and provide the self-certification form to the loan applicant and subsequently obtain the signed form from the applicant before consummating the private education loan. In some cases a school may be making more than one private education loan to an applicant. For example, a school may be providing a loan funded by the school (or from donor-directed contributions) and a Public Health Service loan. In such cases, the school can provide one self- certification form to the applicant.Self-certification form for private education loans Schools must provide the Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification (see DCL GEN-13-15) upon request from the loan applicant. A school may post an exact copy of the self-certification form on its website for applicants to download, or it may provide them a paper copy directly. The self-certification must be printed by the school or lender with black ink on white paper. The typeface, point size, and general presentation of the form may not be changed from the version approved by OMB. The only changes that may be made to the self-certification form are bold type in section headings may be removed, and bold or italic type may be added to the instructions. schools and lenders may use any blank spaces at the top, bottom, or sides of the form for bar coding or other school/ lender-specific information. However, such space may not be used to include the student's or parent's Social Security number. Public health service loans Loans made under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act are considered to be private education loans, including Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) Primary Care Loan (PCL) Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Nursing Student Loan (NSL) These loans are administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (www.hrsa.gov ).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-176Preferred lender lists For any year in which the school has a preferred lender arrangement, it will at least annually compile, maintain, and make available for students attending the school and the families of such students a list in print or other medium of the specific lenders for private education loans that the school recommends, promotes, or endorses in accordance with such preferred lender arrangement. The school's preferred lender list must fully disclose why it participates in a preferred lender arrangement with each lender on the preferred lender list, particularly with respect to terms and conditions or provisions favorable to the borrower; and that the students attending the school (or their families) do not have to borrow from a lender on the preferred lender list; and when available, the information identified on a model disclo - sure form to be developed by the Department for each type of education loan that is offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students or their families. The preferred lender list must also prominently disclose the method and criteria used by the school in selecting lenders to ensure that such lenders are selected on the basis of the best interests of the borrowers, including payment of origination or other fees on behalf of the borrower, highly competitive interest rates or other terms and conditions or provisions of FSA loans or private education loans, high-quality servicing for such loans, or additional benefits beyond the standard terms and conditions or provisions for such loans. The preferred lender list must indicate, for each listed lender, whether the lender is or is not an affiliate of each other lender on the preferred lender list. If a lender is an affiliate of another lender on the preferred lender list, the listing must describe the details of this affiliation.Preferred lenders 34 CFR 601.10 1638(e)(11) As enacted in HEA section 153(a)(2)(A) Truth in Lending Act, section 128(e)(11) Preferred lender arrangement definition 34 CFR 601.2(b) Preferred lender lists The school is required to exercise a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to compile the preferred lender list, without prejudice and for the sole benefit of the school's students and their families; and not deny or otherwise impede the bor - rower's choice of a lender for those borrowers who choose a lender that is not included on the preferred lender list. (This requirement is also included in the school's Code of Conduct; see Chapter 3 ).Chapter 6\u2014Consumer School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-177Preferred lender disclosures For each type of private education loan offered under a preferred lender arrangement, a school (or school-affiliated organization) must disclose the maximum amount of FSA grant and loan aid available to students in an easy-to-understand format, the Truth in Lending information [15 USC 1638(e)(11)] for each type of private education loan offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students and their families, and when available, the information identified on a model disclo - sure form to be developed by the Department for each type of education loan that is offered through a preferred lender ar - rangement to the school's students or their families. The school must disseminate this information on its website and in all informational materials such as publications, mailings, or electronic messages or materials that are distributed to prospective or current students and their families and describe financial aid that is available at an institution of higher education. Use of institution and lender name A school or school-affiliated organization that participates in a preferred lender arrangement regarding private education loans must not agree to the lender's use of its name, emblem, mascot, or logo in the marketing of private education loans to students attending the school in any way that implies that the loan is offered or made by the school or its affiliate instead of the lender. This prohibition also applies to other words, pictures, or symbols readily identified with the school or affiliate. The school or its affiliate must also ensure that the name of the lender is displayed in all information and documentation related to the private education loans described in this section.Truth in Lending Act Truth in Lending Act section 128(e)(1) 15 USC 1638(e)(1) Federal Reserve System Truth in Lending regulations (as published on August 14, 2009) 12 CFR 226.46 through 226.48.Preferred lenders and code of conduct Note that the code of conduct discussed in Chapter 3 prohibits school staff from steering borrowers to particular lenders or delaying loan certifications.

A misleading statement includes any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to mislead. Misrepresentation includes any statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading. A statement may still be misleading, even if it is true on its face. A statement is any communication made in writing, visually, orally, or through other means. This definition applies to statements made by an eligible school, the school's representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or those that provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services. Misrepresentation includes the dissemination of a student endorsement or testimonial that a student gives either under duress or because the school required the student to make such an endorsement or testimonial to participate in a program. A school, one of its representatives, or a related party (see above) engages in substantial misrepresentation when it does so about the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Substantial misrepresentation is defined as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Substantial misrepresentations are prohibited in all forms, including those made in any advertising or promotional materials or in the marketing or sale of courses or programs of instruction offered by the institution. A school is responsible for the harm caused by its misrepresentations, even if such misrepresentations cannot be attributed to institutional intent or knowledge and are the result of inadvertent or innocent mistakes. Sanctions If the Department determines that an eligible institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, it may revoke the eligible institution's program participation agreement if the institu - tion is provisionally certified under 34 CFR 668.13(c); impose limitations on the institution's participation in the FSA programs if the institution is provisionally certified un - der 34 CFR 668.13(c); deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution; or initiate a proceeding against the eligible institution under subpart G of 34 CFR 668.Misrepresentation 34 CFR Subpart F 34 CFR 668.71(c) Misrepresenting educational program CFR 668.72 Misrepresenting financial 34 CFR 668.73 Employability of graduates 34 CFR 668.74 Relationship with CFR 668.72 Nature of educational program Misrepresentation concerning the nature of an eligible institution's educational program includes but is not limited to false, erroneous, or misleading statements concerning\u2014 (a) The particular type(s), specific source(s), nature and extent of its institutional, programmatic, or specialized accreditation; (b)(1) Whether a student may transfer course credits earned at the institution to any other institution; (2) Conditions under which the institution will accept transfer credits earned at another institution; (c) Whether successful completion of a course of instruction qualifies a student\u2014 (1) For acceptance to a labor union or similar organization; or (2) To receive, to apply to take, or to take the examination required to receive, a local, state, or federal license, or a nongovernmental certification required as a precondition for employment, or to perform certain functions in the states in which the educational program is offered, or to meet additional conditions that the institution knows or reasonably should know are generally needed to secure employment in a recognized occupation for which the program is represented to prepare students; (d) The requirements for successfully completing the course of study or program and the circumstances that would constitute grounds for terminating the student's enrollment; (e) Whether its courses are recommended or have been the subject of unsolicited testimonials or endorsements by\u2014 (1) Vocational counselors, high schools, colleges, educational organizations, employment agencies, members of a particular industry, students, former students, or others; or (2) Governmental officials for governmental employment; (f) Its size, location, facilities, or equipment; (g) The availability, frequency, and appropriateness of its courses and programs to the employment objectives that it states its programs are designed to meet; (h) The nature, age, and availability of its training devices or equipment and their appropriateness to the employment objectives that it states its programs and courses are designed to meet; (i) The number, availability, and qualifications, including the training and experience, of its faculty and other personnel; (j) The availability of part-time employment or other forms of financial assistance; (k) The nature and availability of any tutorial or specialized instruction, guidance and counseling, or other supplementary assistance it will provide its students before, during or after the completion of a course; (l) The nature or extent of any prerequisites established for enrollment in any course; (m) The subject matter, content of the course of study, or any other fact related to the degree, diploma, certificate of completion, or any similar document that the student is to be, or is, awarded upon completion of the course of study; (n) Whether the academic, professional, or occupational degree that the institution will confer upon completion of the course of study has been authorized by the appropriate state educational agency. This type of misrepresentation includes, in the case of a degree that has not been authorized by the appropriate state educational agency or that requires specialized accreditation, any failure by an eligible institution to disclose these facts in any advertising or promotional materials that reference such degree; or (o) Any matters required to be disclosed to prospective students under \u00a7\u00a7 668.42 and 668.43 of this part.

(Authority: 20 February 20192-180REPORTING ON FOREIGN SOURCES GIFTS Federal law requires most 2-year and 4-year postsecondary schools (whether or not they are eligible to participate in the FSA programs) to report ownership or control by foreign sources and contracts with or gifts from the same foreign source that, alone or combined, have a value of $250,000 or more for a calendar year. Who must report A school (and each campus of a multi-campus school) must report this information if it is legally authorized to provide a program beyond the second - ary level within a state; provides a program that awards a bachelor's degree or a more advanced degree, or provides at least a two-year program ac - ceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree; is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency; and is extended any federal financial aid (directly or indirectly through another entity or person) or receives support from the extension of any such federal assistance to the school's sub- units. Timing and content of submission A school must report this information by January 31 or July 31 (whichever is sooner) after the date of receipt of the gifts, date of the contract, or date of ownership or control. The January 31 report should cover the period July 1-December 31 of the previous year, and the July 31 report should cover January 1-June 30 of the same year. Information to be reported Using the E-App, you must report the following information in Section K, question 71: For gifts received from or contracts entered into with a for - eign government, the name of the country and the aggregate amount of all gifts and contracts received from each foreign governmentDefinitions A foreign source is a foreign government, including an agency of a foreign government; a legal entity created solely under the laws of a foreign state or states; an individual who is not a citizen or na - tional of the United States; and an agent acting on behalf of a foreign source. A gift is any gift of money or property. A contract is any agreement for the acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter of property or services for the direct benefit or use of either of the parties. Restricted or conditional gift or contract A restricted or conditional gift or contract is any endowment, gift, grant, contract, award, present, or property of any kind that includes provisions regarding the employment, assignment, or termi - nation of faculty; the establishment of departments, cen - ters, research or lecture programs, or new faculty positions; the selection or admission of students; or the award of grants, loans, scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial aid restricted to students of a specified country, religion, sex, ethnic origin, or political opinion.Foreign gifts references Higher Education Act: Sec. 117 Reminder to schools of requirements for reporting foreign gifts. DCL GEN-04-11, Oct. 4, FSA HB February 20192-181Penalties If a school fails to comply with the requirements of this law in a timely manner, the Department is authorized to undertake a civil action in federal district court to ensure compliance. Following a knowing or willful failure to comply, a school must reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the full cost of obtaining compliance.

The school must provide the Department with a statement from the appropriate state official indicating that the school has met the state requirements. If another department, agency, or bureau of the executive branch of the federal government has substantially similar re - quirements for public disclosure of gifts from or contracts with a foreign source, the school may submit a copy of this report to the Department. ANTI-LOBBYING PROVISIONS Prohibition on use of FSA funds FSA funds may not be used to pay any person for trying to influence a member of Congress or an employee of a member of Con - gress, or an officer or employee of Congress or any agency. This prohibition applies to the making of a federal grant or loan, awarding federal contracts, and entering into federal cooperative agreements, as well as to the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. In addition, FSA funds may not be used to hire a registered lobbyist or to pay any person or entity for securing an earmark. Schools receiving FSA funds will have to certify their compliance with these requirements annually.Anti-lobbying certification and disclosure Section 319 of Pub. L. 101-121, enacted October 23, 1989, amended title 31, United States Code, by adding a new section 1352, entitled \"Limitation on Use of Appropriated Funds to Influence Certain Federal Contracting and Financial Transactions,'' commonly known as the Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment. As a result of that legislation, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued interim final common regulations on February 26, 1990, for implementing and complying with the law. See 34 CFR Part 82.Prohibition on use of FSA funds HEOA 2008 section 119 (no corresponding HEA section) Effective date: August 14, 2008Chapter 6\u2014Consumer FSA HB February 20192-183Campus-Based disclosure If a school that receives more than $100,000 in Campus-Based funds has used non-federal funds to pay any person for lobbying activities in connection with the Campus-Based Programs, the school must submit a disclosure form (Standard Form LLL) to the Department. The school must update this disclosure at least annually and when changes occur. The disclosure form must be signed by the chief executive officer (CEO). A school is advised to retain a copy in its files. The school must require that this certification be included in the award documents for all subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans, and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly. VOTER REGISTRATION If a participating school is located in a state that requires voter registration prior to election day and/or does not allow registration at the time of voting, then the school must make a good-faith effort to distribute voter registration forms to its students. This requirement was included in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (also known as the \"NVRA\" or \"motor voter law\"). The Department of Justice identified that the requirements of the NVRA apply to 44 states and the District of Columbia. Six states\u2014Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming\u2014 are exempt from the NVRA. Likewise, the territories are not covered by the NVRA (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa). The school must make the voter registration forms widely available to its students and must individually distribute the forms to its degree- or certificate-seeking (FSA-eligible) students. The school can mail paper copies, or it may send an electronic message to each student with a voter registration form or with an Internet address where the form can be downloaded. The message must be devoted exclusively to voter registration. In applicable states, schools must request voter registration forms from the state 120 days prior to the state's deadline for registering to vote. This provision applies to general and special elections for federal office and to the elections of governors and other chief executives within a state. If a school does not receive the forms within 60 days prior to the deadline for registering to vote in the state, it is not liable for failing to meet the requirement during that election year.ACA may not be used for association membership A school may not use its administrative cost allowance (ACA) to pay for its membership in professional associations (such as the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the National Association of College and University Business Officers, etc.), regardless of whether the association engages in lobbying activities. CHAPTERC 7CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-185 Schools must maintain detailed records to show that FSA funds are disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students. These records must be retained for a certain amount of time and made available to authorized parties in the course of audits, program reviews, or investigations. Personally identifiable information in these records must be safeguarded and may only be released to other parties under certain conditions specified in the regulations. You may wish to share the contents of this chapter with your school's IT office or provider.Record Keeping, Privacy, & Electronic ProcessesREQUIRED RECORDS A school must keep comprehensive, accurate program and fiscal records related to its use of FSA program funds. The importance of main - taining complete, accurate records cannot be overemphasized. Program and fiscal records must demonstrate the school is capable of meeting the administrative and fiscal requirements for participating in the FSA pro - grams. In addition, records must demonstrate proper administration of FSA program funds and must show a clear audit trail for FSA program expenditures. For example, records for each FSA recipient must clearly show that the student was eligible for the funds received and that the funds were disbursed in accordance with program regulations. In addition to the general institutional record keeping requirements discussed here, a school must also comply with all program-specific record keeping requirements contained in the individual FSA regulations. Records related to school eligibility A school must establish and maintain on a current basis any application the school submitted for FSA program funds. Other program records that must be maintained include: program participation agreement, approval letter, and Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR), application portion of the FISAP , accrediting and licensing agency reviews, approvals, and reports, state agency reports, audit and program review reports, self-evaluation reports, and other records, as specified in regulation, that pertain to factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability. Record keeping 34 CFR 668.24FSA Assessment module To assess your compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see Activity 2 under \"Fiscal Management\" at https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/FSAAssessments.jsp Closed school records If a school closes, stops providing educational programs, is terminated or suspended from the FSA programs, or undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control, it must provide for the retention of required records. It must also provide for access to those records for inspection and copying by the Department. A school that formerly participated in the FFEL Program must also provide access for the appropriate guaranty agency.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-186 Records relating to student eligibility A school must keep records that substantiate the eligibility of students for FSA funds, such as: cost of attendance information, documentation of a student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP), documentation of student's program of study and the courses in which the student was enrolled, data used to establish student's admission, enrollment status, and period of enrollment, required student certification statements and supporting documentation, documents used to verify applicant data and resolve conflicting information, documentation of all professional judgment decisions, financial aid history information for transfer students. Fiscal records A school must keep fiscal records to demonstrate its proper use of FSA funds. A school's fiscal records must provide a clear audit trail that shows that funds were received, managed, disbursed, and returned in ac - cordance with federal requirements. The fiscal records a school must maintain include but are not limited to the following: records of all FSA program transactions, bank statements for all accounts containing FSA funds, records of student accounts, including each student's institu - tional charges, cash payments, FSA payments, cash disburse - ments, refunds, returns, and overpayments required for each enrollment period, general ledger (control accounts) and related subsidiary ledgers that identify each FSA program transaction (FSA transactions must be separate from school's other financial transactions), Federal Work-Study payroll records, and FISOP portion of the FISAP .Retaining records for a branch that closes If a school has an additional location or branch that closes, the school should maintain its loan records beyond the end of the three-year record retention requirement to respond to the Department or to refute borrower claims of eligibility for discharge. FWS records See Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs , Chapter 1 , for a detailed discussion of the record keeping requirements for the FWS program.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, HB February 20192-187A school must also maintain records that support data appearing on required reports, such as: Pell Grant statements of accounts, cash requests and quarterly or monthly reports from the G5 payment system, FSA program reconciliation reports, audit reports and school responses, state grant and scholarship award rosters and reports, accrediting and licensing agency reports, and records used to prepare the income grid on the FISAP . Loan program records There are special record keeping requirements in the Direct and FFEL loan programs. A school must maintain A copy of the paper or electronic loan certification or origination record, including the amount of the loan and the period of enroll - ment. The cost of attendance, estimated financial assistance, and expected family contribution used to calculate the loan amount (and any other information that may be required to determine the borrower's eligibility, such as the student's Federal Pell Grant eligibility or ineligibility). The date(s) the school disbursed the loan funds to the student (or to the parent borrower), and the amount(s) disbursed. (For loans delivered to the school by check, the date the school en - dorsed each loan check, if required.) Documentation of the confirmation process for each academic year in which the school uses the multi-year feature of the Master Promissory Note. This may be part of the borrower's file, but acceptable documentation can also include a statement of the confirmation process that was printed in a student handbook or other financial aid publication for that school year. The documentation may be kept in paper or electronic form. There is no retention limit for this documentation; you must keep it indefinitely because it may affect the enforceability of loans. A school must keep records relating to a student or parent borrower's eligibility and participation in the Direct Loan or FFEL program for three years after the end of the award year in which the student last attended the school. A school must keep all other records relating to the school's participation in the Direct Loan or FFEL program for at least three years af - ter the end of the award year in which the records are submitted.Perkins Loan Program records See Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs , Chapter 1 , for a detailed discussion of the record keeping requirements for the Perkins Loan program.Loan program records 34 CFR 668.24, HB February 20192-188RECORD RETENTION PERIODS Schools must retain all required records for a minimum of three years from the end of the award year. However, the starting point for the three- year period is not the same for all records. For example, FFEL/DL reports must be kept for three years after the end of the award year in which they were submitted, while borrower records must be kept for three years from the end of the award year in which the student last attended. Different retention periods are necessary to ensure enforcement and repayment of Perkins loans, which are normally held by the school. Perkins Loan repayment records, including cancellation and deferment records, must be kept for three years from the date that the loan was assigned to the Department, cancelled, or repaid. Perkins original promissory notes and original repayment schedules must be kept until the loan is satisfied or needed to enforce the obligation (for more informa - tion, see Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs ). A school may retain records longer than the minimum period required. Moreover, a school may be required to retain records involved in any loan, claim, or expenditure questioned in any FSA program review, audit, investigation, or other review, for more than three years (see Chapter 8 for information on program reviews and audits). If the three- year retention period expires before the issue in question is resolved, the school must continue to retain all records until resolution is reached. There are also additional record retention requirements that apply to schools granted waivers of the audit submission requirements.Retaining FISAP records Schools participating in the Campus-Based Programs must keep the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) and any records necessary to support th e data used to create it (e.g., the source data for the income grid) for three years from the end of the award year in which the FISAP is submitted. Consider the FISAP submitted during the 2018-2019 award year that ends on June 30, 2019. (That FISAP is based on the records of a school's 2017-2018 activity, and serves as the Application to Participate for the 2019-2020 award year.) A school must retain the data used to create the FISAP the school was required to submit by October 1, 2018 until at least June 30, 2022 ( three years from June 30, 2019).

Program Records A school must establish and maintain, on a current basis, any application for FSA funds and program re - cords that document\u2014 the school's eligibility to participate in the FSA programs, the FSA eligibility of the school's programs of education, the school's administration of the FSA programs, the school's financial responsibility, information included in any application for FSA program funds, and the school's disbursement of FSA program funds. Fiscal records A school must account for the receipt and expenditure of all FSA program funds in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A school must establish and maintain on a current basis\u2014 financial records that reflect each FSA program transaction, and general ledger control accounts and related subsidiary accounts that identify each FSA program transaction and separate those transactions from all other school financial activity. Records for FSA recipients A school must maintain records for each FSA recipient that include but are not limited to\u2014 The Student Aid Report (SAR) or Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) used to determine a student's eligibility for FSA program funds, Application data submitted to the Department, lender, or guaranty agency by the school on behalf of the student or parent, Documentation of each student's or parent borrower's eligibility for FSA program funds (e.g., records that demonstrate that the student has a high school diploma, GED, or the ability to benefit), Documentation relating to each student's or parent borrower's receipt of FSA program funds, including but not limited to: The amount of the grant, loan, or FWS award; its payment period; its loan period, if appropriate; and the calculations used to determine the amount of grant, loan, or FWS award; The date and amount of each disbursement of grant or loan funds, and the date and amount of each payment of FWS wages; The amount, date, and basis of the school's calculation of any refunds/returns or overpayments due to or on behalf of the student; and The payment of any refund/return or overpayment to the FSA program fund, a lender, or the Depart - ment, as appropriate. Documentation of and information collected at any initial or exit loan counseling required by applicable program regulations, Reports and forms used by the school in its participation in an FSA program, and any records needed to verify data that appear in those reports and forms, Documentation supporting the school's calculation of its completion or graduation rates, and transfer-out rates (see Chapter 6 ).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-190Pell and TEACH grants, Campus-Based Program records 3 years from the end of the award year for which the aid was awarded Except: Fiscal Operations Report (FISAP) and supporting records\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the report was submitted Perkins repayment records*\u2014Until the loan is satisfied, or the documents are no longer needed to enforce the obligation Perkins original promissory notes\u20143 years from the date the loan is assigned to ED, canceled, or repaid Direct Loans & FFEL Records related to borrower's eligibility and participation\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the student last attended All other records, including any other reports or forms\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the report was submitted * includes original repayment schedule, though manner of retention remains same as promissory noteMinimum Record Retention PeriodsChapter DCL FSA HB February 20192-191RECORD MAINTENANCE Acceptable formats A school must maintain all required records in a systematically organized manner. Unless a specific format is required, a school may keep required records in: hard copy optical disk microform CD-ROM computer file other media formats Record retention requirements for the Institutional Student Infor - mation Record (ISIR) are discussed here. All other record information, regardless of the format used, must be retrievable in a coherent hard copy format (for example, an easily understandable printout of a computer file) or in a media format acceptable to the Department. Any document that contains a signature, seal, certification, or any other image or mark required to validate the authenticity of its informa - tion must be maintained in its original hard copy or in an imaged media format. This includes tax returns, verification statements, and Student Aid Reports (SARs) used to determine eligibility, and any other document when a signature, seal, etc., contained on it is necessary for the document to be used for the purposes for which it is being retained. A school may maintain a record in an imaged media format only if the format is capable of reproducing an accurate, legible, and complete copy of the original document. When printed, the copy must be approxi - mately the same size as the original document. Please note that promissory notes that are signed electronically must be stored electronically and the promissory note must be retrievable in a coherent format. Because MPNs are stored in COD, this requirement can be satisfied through COD. Special requirements for SARs and ISIRs Special maintenance and availability requirements apply for SARs and ISIRs used to determine eligibility. It is essential that these basic eligibility records be available in a consistent, comprehensive, and verifiable format for program review and audit purposes. Hard copies of SARs that students submit to schools must be main - tained and available in their original format or in an imaged media for - mat. The ISIR, an electronic record, must be maintained and available in its original format (e.g., as it was archived using EDExpress software supplied to the school). A school that uses EDExpress has the ability to preserve the ISIR data that it has maintained during the applicable award year by archiving the data to a disk or other computer format. New media formats The requirement providing for other media formats acceptable to the Department allows for the use of new technology as it is developed. The Department will notify schools of acceptable media formats; schools should not apply for approval of a media format. Requirements for electronic promissory notes 34 CFR 668.24(d)(3)(i) HB February 20192-192EXAMINATION OF RECORDS Location A school must make its records available to the Department at a location of the school designated by the Department. These records must be readily available for review, including any records of transactions between a school and the financial institution where the school deposits any FSA funds. A school is not required to maintain records in any specific location. For example, it may be more appropriate for a school to maintain some records in the financial aid office while maintaining others in the business office, the admissions office, or the office of the registrar. The responsible administrator in the office maintaining the records should be aware of all applicable record retention requirements. Cooperation with agency representatives A school that participates in any FSA program and the school's third- party servicers, if any, must cooperate with the agencies and individuals involved in conducting any audit, program review, investigation, or other review authorized by law (see sidebar). A school must cooperate by providing Timely access to requested records, pertinent books, documents, papers, or computer programs for examination and copying by any of the agents listed above. The records to which timely access must be provided include but are not limited to computerized records and records reflecting transactions with any financial institution with which the school or servicer deposits or has deposited any FSA program funds. Reasonable access to all personnel associated with the school's or servicer's administration of the FSA programs so that any of the agents listed above may obtain relevant information. A school or servicer must allow those personnel to supply all relevant information and allow those personnel to be inter - viewed without the presence of the school's or servicer's management (or tape-recording of the interviews by the school or servicer). If requested by the Department, a school or servicer must provide promptly any information the school or servicer has regarding the last known address, full name, telephone number, enrollment information, employer, and employer address of a recipient of FSA program funds who attends or attended the school. A school must also provide this informa - tion, upon request, to a lender or guaranty agency in the case of a borrower under the FFEL Program.Cooperation with agency representatives Cooperation must be extended to the following individuals and their authorized representatives: an independent auditor, the Secretary of the Department of Education, the Department's Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States. See Chapter 4 for more information on independent audits and Chapter 8 for information on program reviews. A school must also provide this cooperation to any guaranty agency in whose program the school participates and to the school's accrediting agency.Sole possession records Sole possession records are exempted from the definition of \"education record\" and thus are not subject to FERPA. They are kept in the sole possession of the maker of the record and are used as a memory or reference tool, not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record, and maintained by the school official unbeknownst to and not shared with other individuals, except persons acting as a temporary substitute for a school official.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, Privacy, & Electronic ProcessesCFR Glossary February 20192-193PRIVACY OF STUDENT INFORMATION UNDER FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of students' education records. The term \"education records\" means those records that are: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an education agency or postsecondary institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. At the postsecondary level, FERPA affords eligible students with certain rights. FERPA defines an \"eligible student\" as a student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education at any age. With exceptions such as those noted in this section, FERPA affords postsecondary students the right to inspect and review their education records, the right to seek to have their records amend ed and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records. These rules apply to all education records a school keeps, including admissions records (only if the student was admitted), academic records, and any financial aid records pertaining to the student. Therefore, the financial aid office is not usually the office that develops a school's FERPA policy or the notification to students and parents, although it may have some input.FERPA citations 34 CFR 99.7 Notification of FERPA Rights \u00a7 99.8 Law enforcement unit records \u00a7 99.10-12 Right of student to review records \u00a7 99.20-22 Right of student to request amendment to records \u00a7 99.30 Prior consent requirement \u00a799.31 When prior consent is not required to disclose information \u00a7 99.32 Record keeping requirement \u00a7 99.33 Limitations 99.34 Disclosure to other agencies/ institutions \u00a799.35 Disclosure to certain authorities for audit or evaluation of education programs FERPA scope The relevant law is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 . Do not confuse FERPA with the Privacy Act of 1974 that governs the records kept by government agencies, including the application records in the federal processing system. 20 USC 1232g FERPA resources The Department has posted a model notification on the Family Policy Compliance Office website at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ ferpa-model-notification-postsecondary- officials The Guide for Developing High-Quality Emergency Operations Plans for Institutions of Higher Education includes a helpful FERPA section, among other guidance. Third-party housing records A student housing facility owned by a third party that has a contract with a school to provide housing for its students is considered under the control of the school (whether the rent is paid directly by the student or by the school on her behalf). Records maintained by the third party or the school related to students living in that housing are subject to FERPA.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and and parents' rights to review educational records under FERPA A school must provide a student with an opportunity to review his or her education records within 45 days of the receipt of a request. A school is required to provide the student with copies of education records or make other arrangements to provide the student access to the records if a failure to do so would effectively prevent the student from obtaining ac - cess to the records. While the school may not charge a fee for retrieving the records, it may charge a reasonable fee for providing copies of the re - cords, provided that the fee would not prevent access to the records. While the rights under FERPA have transferred from a student's par - ents to the student when the student attends a postsecondary institution, FERPA does permit a school to disclose a student's education records to his or her parents if the student is a dependent student under IRS rules. Note that the IRS definition of a dependent is quite different from that of a dependent student for FSA purposes. For IRS purposes, students are dependent if they are listed as dependents on their parent's income tax returns. (If the student is a dependent as defined by the IRS, disclosure may be made to either parent, regardless of which parent claims the stu - dent as a dependent.) There are several other situations in which a school official may dis - close information about the student to the student's parents, as noted in the sidebar. Prior written consent to disclose the student's records Except under one of the special conditions described in this section, a student must provide written consent before an education agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from the stu - dent's education records. The written consent must state the purpose of the disclosure, specify the records that may be disclosed, identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made, and be signed and dated. If the consent is given electronically, the consent form must identify and authenticate a particular person as the source of the electronic consent and indicate that person's approval of the information con - tained in the electronic consent. The FERPA regulations include a list of exceptions where the school may disclose personally identifiable information from the student's file without prior written consent. Several of these allowable disclosures are of particular interest to the financial aid office, since they are likely to involve the release of financial aid records.Additional FERPA disclosures to parents A school may disclose information from a student's education records to parents in the case of a health or safety emergency that involves the student. A school may let parents of students under the age of 21 know when the student has violated any law or policy concerning the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance. A school official may share with parents information that is based on that official's personal knowledge or observation and that is not based on information contained in an education record. Disclosures via website Subject to certain conditions, disclosure may be made through Internet or intranet sites. CFR 34 668.41(b) & (c)Chapter FSA HB February 20192-195Disclosures to school officials Some of these disclosures may be made to officials at your school or another school under certain conditions. Typically, these might include disclosures of admissions records, grades, or financial aid records. Disclosure may be made to the following individuals: other school officials, including teachers, within the school whom the school has determined to have legitimate educational interests, and officials of another postsecondary school or school system where the student receives services or seeks to enroll. Third-party servicers that your school has contracted with to perform Title IV functions are considered school officials under FERPA when they perform any of the following: perform a school service or function for which your school would otherwise use employees, are under the control of your school with respect to the use and maintenance of education records, and comply with FERPA requirements about the use of personal information from education records. A school official may disclose personal information from student education records to a third-party servicer who meets the above criteria if the official determines that the third-party servicer has a \"legitimate educational interest.\" Your school must include in its annual notification of rights under FERPA the criteria for determining who is a school official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Also, for such servicers to receive disclosures without student consent as though they were school officials, they must not use that personal information to set up a bank account or maintain a credit balance for students. See DCL GEN-12-08. If your school routinely discloses information to other schools where students seek to enroll, it should include this information in its annual privacy notification to students, or, if not, your school must make a reasonable attempt to notify students at their last known address.FERPA and crime records There are two different FERPA provisions concerning the release of records relating to a violent crime. One concerns the release to the victim of any outcome involving an alleged crime of violence [34 CFR 99.31(a) (13)]. A separate provision permits a school to disclose to anyone the final results of any disciplinary hearing against an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence where that student was found in violation of the school's policy on the offense [34 CFR 99.31(a)(14)].Campus security records Records created and maintained by a school's law enforcement unit are exempt from the privacy restrictions of FERPA. A school may disclose information from these \"law enforcement unit records\" to anyone\u2014 including parents or federal, state, or local law enforcement authorities\u2014without the consent of the student pursuant to school policy and/or state law.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-196Disclosures to government agencies Disclosures may be made for audit, evaluation, and enforcement purposes to authorized representatives of the U.S. Department of Education, which include employees of the Department\u2014such as those of the National Center for Education Statistics and the offices of Federal Student Aid, Postsecondary Educatio n, Inspector General and Civil Rights\u2014as well as firms under contract to the Department to perform certain administrative functions or studies. In addition, disclosure may be made if it is in connection with financial aid the student has received or applied for. Such disclosure may only be made if the student information is needed to determine the amount of the aid or the conditions or student's eligibility for the aid or to enforce the terms or conditions of the aid. Schools may, without violating FERPA, release personally identifiable information on nonimmigrant students with an F, J, or M visa to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in compliance with the Student Exchange Visitor Information System program. Disclosures in response to subpoenas or court orders FERPA permits schools to disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records without the student's consent to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena or court order. In most cases the school must make a reasonable effort to notify the student who is the subject of the subpoena or court order before complying so that he may seek protective action. However, the school does not have to notify the student if the court or issuing agency has prohibited such disclosure if certain conditions are met. A school may also disclose information from education records, with - out the consent or knowledge of the student, to representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice in response to an ex parte order issued in connec - tion with the investigation of crimes of terrorism.Health & Safety Emergency TA A technical assistance document issued June 2011 by the Department that provides information on FERPA and HEA legal requirements related to preparing for and addressing situations that threaten the health or safety of the campus community is posted at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ addressing-emergencies-campus Documentation of request not required A school does not have to record instances where the request for access is made by: The parent or eligible student. A school official who has a legitimate educational interest. A party with written consent from the parent or eligible student. A party seeking directory information. Certain court orders or subpoenas. Subpoena citations 20 USC 1232g(b)(1)(J)(i) and (ii), defined in 18 USC FSA HB February 20192-197Documenting the disclosure of information Except as noted in the sidebar earlier in this chapter, a school must keep a record of each request for access and each disclosure of personally identifiable student information to other parties. The record of the request and disclosure must identify the parties who requested the information and their legitimate interest in the information. This record must be maintained in the student's file as long as the educational records them - selves are kept. For instance, if Department officials request student records in the course of a program review, the school must document in each student's file that his or her records were disclosed to representatives of the Depart - ment. An easy way for the school to do this is to photocopy a statement to this effect and include it in each student's file. A statement such as the following would be appropriate for a program review conducted by a Department regional office. These financial aid records were disclosed to representatives of the U.S. Department of Education, School Participation Division, Region __, on (Month/Day/Year) to determine compliance with financial aid require - ments, under 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(4). When redisclosure is anticipated, the additional parties to whom the information will be disclosed must be included in the record of the original disclosure. For instance, to continue the example for an FSA program review, the following statement might be added. The School Participation Division may make further disclosures of this information to the Department's Office of Inspector General and to the U.S. Department of Justice under 34 CFR 99.33(b). Schools should check with the program review staff to find out if any redisclosure is antici - pated.HIPAA and FERPA Joint guidance on HIPAA and FERPA developed jointly by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the Department of Education can be found at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/ joint-guidance-application-ferpa-and- hipaa-student-health-records Other information about HIPAA and postsecondary institutions can be found at the HIPAA and Professionals section of the HHS website at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for- 2\u2014School 20192-198HIPAA (Privacy of Health Records) and FERPA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) sets standards to protect the confidentiality of health information. However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule excludes from its coverage those records that are protected by FERPA at school districts and postsecondary institutions that provide health or medical services to students. This is because Congress specifically addressed how education records should be protected under FERPA. For this reason, records that are pro - tected by FERPA are not subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and may be shared with parents under the circumstances described here. Your school's disability services office normally obtains and maintains health records for each student who applies for services or waivers, so the receipt and maintenance of health records by student services units is well established. Note: In many cases a student receiving a waiver from a school's academic progress policy would also have applied for services from your school's disability services office. Since most financial aid offices are not used to handling medical records, you may find it more practical to have the disability services office maintain the record and to refer - ence that record in your file in the financial aid office. Of course, you will have to ensure that the record maintenance requirements are complied with. For joint guidance on FERPA and HIPAA, see https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/joint-guidance-application-ferpa-and-hipaa-student-health-records For more information on HIPAA, see the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/ HIPAA regulations are published as 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164.A school is required to\u2014 annually notify students of their rights under FERPA; include in that notification the procedure for exercising their rights to inspect and review education records; and maintain a record in a student's file listing to whom personally identifiable information was disclosed and the legitimate interests the parties had in obtaining the information (does not apply to school officials with a legitimate educational interest or to directory information). A student has the right to\u2014 inspect and review any education records pertaining to the student; request an amendment to his/her records; and consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except when FERPA permits disclosure without consent.FERPA Responsibilities and Student RightsChapter Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-199HIGHER EDUCATION ACT DATA USE LIMITATIONS The HEA also provides limitations on the uses of certain types of data. The provisions of the HEA apply differently to information collected on or derived from the FAFSA. This means that the HEA's provisions apply to data on the ISIR (including award and disbursement information) and to data included in NSLDS (including data on the ISIR from NSLDS). The HEA restricts the use of the FAFSA/ISIR data to the application, award, and administration of aid awarded under the Title IV programs, state aid, or aid awarded by eligible institutions. The Department interprets \"administration of aid\" to include audits and program evaluations necessary for the efficient and effective administration of those student aid programs. The HEA also prohibits nongovernmental researchers or policy analysts from accessing PII from NSLDS and prohibits the use of NSLDS data for marketing purposes. It is important to note that these prohibitions are applicable to all NSLDS data, including NSLDS data received by institutions via the ISIR. Guidance on the Use of Financial Aid Information for Program Evaluation and Research The Department of Education's Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) has published Joint Guidance on the Use of Financial Aid Information for Program Evaluation and Research to help schools understand using student financial aid information for program evaluation and research. That guidance is available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/FSA_final_0.pdf The Department established PTAC as a \"one-stop\" resource for education stakeholders to learn about data privacy, confidentiality, and security practices related to student-level longitudinal data systems and other uses of student data. Additional information regarding these matters may be found at PTAC's website. PTAC's resources on disclosure avoidance and de-identification, is available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ If you have questions about the PTAC guidance or other privacy or security matters related to student financial aid information, please contact the PTAC Help Desk by email at PrivacyTA@ed.gov or by phone at 855-249-3072 .TIPFAFSA data restrictions HEA Section 483(a)(3)(E) NSLDS restrictions HEA Section 485B(d)(2) Sharing FAFSA Data An institution of higher education may, with explicit written consent of an applicant who has completed a FAFSA under section 483(a), provide such information collected from the applicant's FAFSA as is necessary to a scholarship-granting organization, including a tribal organization (defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. 5304), or to an organization assisting the applicant in applying for and receiving federal, state, local, or tribal assistance that is designated by the applicant to assist the applicant in applying for and receiving financial assistance for any component of the applicant's cost of attendance (defined in section 472 of the HEA) at that institution. An organization that receives such information is prohibited from selling or otherwise sharing such information. Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and THE E-SIGN ACT AND INFORMATION SECURITY The E-Sign Act permits lenders, guaranty agencies, and schools to use electronic signatures and electronic records in place of traditional signa - tures and records that, under the HEA and underlying regulations, other - wise must be provided or maintained in hard-copy format. The E-Sign Act provides specifically for the creation and retention of electronic records. Therefore, unless a statute or regulation specifically requires a school to provide or maintain a record or document on paper, your school may provide and maintain that record electronically. Simi - larly, unless a statute or regulation specifically requires schools to obtain a pen and paper signature, you may obtain the signature electronically as long as the electronic process complies with the E-Sign Act and all other applicable laws. Obtaining voluntary consent for electronic transactions Before using electronic transactions to communicate with a recipient of FSA funds, the recipient must affirmatively consent to the use of an electronic record. The recipient's consent must be voluntary and based on accurate information about the transactions to be completed. The consent must be obtained in a manner that reasonably demon - strates that the person can access the information to be provided in an electronic form. For example, if you are going to send financial informa - tion by email, you could send a request for consent to the recipient via email, require the recipient to respond in a like manner, and maintain a record of that response.Using electronic processes for notifications and authorizations So long as there are no regulations specifically requiring that a notification or authorization be sent via U.S. mail, a school may provide notices or receive authorizations electronically. You may also use an electronic process to provide required notices and make disclosures by directing students to a secure website that contains the required notifications and disclosures. For additional information on electronic transactions involving student loans, see Section 2 of Standards for Electronic Signatures in Electronic Student Loan Transactions , in GEN-01-06, May 2001.E-Sign Act The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) was enacted on June 30, 2000. The E-Sign Act provides, in part, that a signature, contract, or other record relating to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form or because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation. Voluntary consent required Voluntary consent to participate in electronic transactions is required for all financial information provided or made available to student loan borrowers and for all notices and authorizations to FSA recipients required under 34 CFR 668.165\u2014 Notices and Authorizations. See Volume 4 for more information on notices and authorizations for disbursements.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, FSA HB February 20192-201Safeguarding confidential information in electronic processes Any time a school uses an electronic process to record or transmit confidential information or obtain a student's confirmation, acknowledg - ment, or approval, the school must adopt reasonable safeguards against possible fraud and abuse. Reasonable safeguards a school might take include password protection, password changes at set intervals, access revocation for unsuccessful logins, user identification and entry-point tracking, random audit surveys, and security tests of the code access. If your school uses an electronic process to provide notices, make disclosures, and direct students to a secure website, it must provide notice of this each year to each student, whether via email, campus mail, or the traditional mail of the U.S. Postal Service. The annual individual notice must identify the information required to be disclosed that year , provide the exact Web address for the information, state that persons are entitled to a paper copy upon request, and inform students how to request a paper copy. Establishing and maintaining an information security program The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has ruled that most colleges are subject to the provisions of the Financial Services Act's Security Provi - sions (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act). In the regulation, the commission created a definition of financial institutions that includes most colleges on the basis of the financial relationships they have with students, donors, and others. Consequently, colleges must adopt an information security program and draft detailed policies for handling financial data covered by the law, such as parents' annual income, and take steps to protect the data from falling into the wrong hands. For specific requirements, see the discussion under FTC Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information later in this chapter. While colleges have flexibility in choosing a system that provides for electronic requests for release of personally identifiable information, they must ensure that their systems provide adequate safeguards. Also, the FTC requirements apply to Title IV third-party servicers, so colleges must use servicers that are capable of maintaining such safeguards and must require servicers by contract to implement and maintain those safeguards.Information security requirements Federal Trade Commission regulations: 16 CFR 313.3(n) and 16 CFR 314.1-5 Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLB Act) Pub. L. No. 106-102 Sections 501 and 505(b)(2) 15 USC 6801(b), 6805(b)(2) GEN-16-12, July 1, 2016 See also GEN-15-18 on protecting student information. It gives suggestions and resources for following industry standards and best practices on managing information systems. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-202National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-171 The Department strongly encourages schools to review and understand the standards defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-171, the recognized information security publication for protecting \"Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI),\" a subset of Federal data that includes unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Federal policies. NIST SP 800-171 identifies specific recommended requirements for non-Federal entities that handle CUI. The Department understands the investment and effort required by institutions to meet and maintain the security standards established under NIST SP 800-171. Nonetheless, across the public and private sectors, it is imperative that organizations continue to enhance cybersecurity in order to meet evolving threats to CUI and challenges to the security of such organizations. Therefore, the Department strongly encourages those institutions that fall short of NIST standards to assess their current gaps and immediately begin to design and implement plans in order to close those gaps using the NIST standards as a model.Protecting student information Under their Program Participation Agreement (PPA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102), schools must protect student financial aid information, with particular attention to information provided to institutions by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the administration of the federal student financial aid programs. The GLBA requires institutions to, among other things Develop, implement, and maintain a written information security program; Designate the employee(s) responsible for coordinating the information security program; Identify and assess risks to customer information; Design and implement an information safeguards program; Select appropriate service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards; and Periodically evaluate and update their security program. Presidents and Chief Information Officers of institutions should have, at a minimum, evaluated and documented their current security posture against the requirements of GLBA and have taken immediate action to remediate any identified deficiencies. The Department is incorporating the GLBA security controls into the Annual Audit Guide in order to assess and confirm schools' compliance with the GLBA. The Department will require the examination of evidence of GLBA compliance as part of schools' annual student aid compliance audit.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, ProcessesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-203Reporting Security Breaches to Students and the Department The Department considers any breach in the security of student records and information to be a demonstration of a potential lack of administrative capability. Schools' SAIG Agreements include a provision that schools must immediately notify the Department at CPSSAIG@ed.gov when there is breach of security of student records and information, and ED strongly encourages schools to notify their students of the breach at the same time. In their reports to the Department, schools should include the following: Date of breach (suspected or known) Impact of breach (# of records, etc.) Method of breach (hack, accidental disclosure, etc.) Information Security Program Point of Contact - Email and phone details Remediation Status (complete, in process - with detail) Next steps (as needed) Federal Student Aid has consolidated its cybersecurity compliance information and resources. You can find the FSA Cybersecurity Compliance site at DCL requirements Program Participation Agreement 34 CFR 668.14(b)(30) See Chapter 6 for requirement to disseminate copyright policies. Examples of deterrents Technology-based deterrents include bandwidth shaping, traffic monitoring, accepting and responding to Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices, and commercial products designed to reduce or block illegal file sharing. GEN-10-08PREVENTING COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS A school must implement written plans to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material by users of the school's network without unduly interfering with educational and research use of the network. These plans must include the use of one or more technology-based deterrents and procedures for handling unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material (including disciplinary procedures). No particular technology measures are favored or required for inclusion in the school's plans, and each school retains the authority to determine its own plans, including those that prohibit content monitoring. The school's plans must also include measures to educate its community about appropriate versus inappropriate use of copyrighted material, including the information described under the student consumer information rules in Chapter 6 . These mechanisms may include any additional information and approaches that the school determines will contribute to the effectiveness of the plans. For instance, the school might include pertinent information in student handbooks, honor codes, and codes of conduct in addition to email and/or paper disclosures. The school must have a written plan for the periodic review of the effectiveness of these measures, using relevant assessment criteria. The school must, in consultation with its chief technology officer (or other designated officer), periodically review the legal alternatives for downloading or otherwise acquiring copyrighted material (and disseminate the results, as described in Chapter 6 ) and offer legal alter - natives for downloading or otherwise acquiring copyrighted material (to the extent practicable and as determined by the school). The Department anticipates that individual institutions, national associations, and commercial entities will develop and maintain up-to- date lists that may be referenced for compliance with this provision.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, ProcessesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB February 20192-205FTC Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Colleges participating in the FSA programs are subject to the information security requirements established by the FTC for - financial institutions. Customer information that must be safeguarded These requirements apply to all customer information your school has, regardless of whether it pertains to students, par - ents, or others your school has a customer relationship with or pertains to the customers of other financial institutions that have given such information to you. Customer information is any record containing nonpublic personal information1 about a customer of a financial institu - tion, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is han - dled or maintained by or on behalf of you or your affiliates. Establishing and maintaining an information security program As a financial institution covered under these information security requirements, your school must develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program.2 The information security program must be written in one or more readily accessible parts and contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of the school, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The safeguards shall be reasonably designed to achieve the following objectives: insure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.Required elements of an information security program Designated coordinators. Your school must designate an employee or employees to coordinate its information security program. Risk assessment. Your school must identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer informa - tion that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information and assess the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to control these risks. At a minimum, the school's risk assessment should include consideration of risks in each relevant area of your operations, including employee training and management, information systems, including network and soft- ware design, as well as information processing, storage, transmission, and disposal, and detecting, preventing, and responding to attacks, intrusions, or other system failures. Safeguards and testing/monitoring. Your school must design and implement information safeguards to control the risks you identify through risk assessment, and regularly test or otherwise monitor the effective - ness of the safeguards' key controls, systems, and procedures. Evaluation and adjustment. Your school must evaluate and adjust its information security program in light of the results of the required testing and monitoring, as well as for any material changes to your operations or business arrangements or any other circumstances that it has reason to know may have a material impact on your school's information security program. Overseeing service providers. A service provider is any person or entity that receives, maintains, processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer infor - mation by providing services directly to your school. Your school must take reasonable steps to have service providers that are capable of maintaining ap - propriate safeguards for customer information, and you must require your service providers by contract to implement and maintain such safeguards.

One way we do this is by conducting program reviews to confirm that schools meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. Program reviews identify compliance problems and suggest corrective actions. If a school is cited in a program review for improperly disbursing FSA program funds or other serious violations, it must restore the funds as appropriate. In addition to having to restore the funds it dispersed in error, a school may also be subject to correction actions and sanctions such as fines, emergency action, limitation, suspension, or termination, as discussed later in this chapter. A program review covers many of the same areas as an audit (see Chapter 4 ), including fiscal operations and accounting procedures as well as compliance with the specific program requirements for student eligibility and awards. However, program reviews are not conducted annually at every school; priority is given to schools that meet criteria specified in the law (see the sidebar note on the next page). Department program reviewers will analyze school records and identify weaknesses in the school's procedures for administering FSA funds; determine how those weaknesses may subject FSA funds to potential or actual fraud, waste, and abuse; identify corrective actions that will strengthen the school's future compliance with FSA rules and regulations; quantify the harm from any failings of the school and identify liabilities where noncompliance has lead to loss, misuse, or unnecessary spending of federal funds; and when necessary, refer schools for administrative action to protect the interests of students and taxpayers.FSA assessments To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment module for \"Institutional Eligibility.\" https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/FSAAssessments.jspRelated information Audit requirements\u2014 Chapter 4 Updating the E-App for changes to programs and locations\u2014 Chapter 5Volume and Operations 2018-2019FSA HB February 20192-208CFR Glossary DCL Scope of the review A program review may be either a general assessment review, a focused review, or a compliance assurance review. A general assessment review is the most common type of review and is normally conducted to evaluate the school's overall performance in meeting FSA administrative and financial requirements. A focused review is normally conducted to determine if the school has problems with specific areas of FSA program compliance. A compliance assurance review is a tool that is used to help validate the Department's risk assessment system. For general assessment, compliance assurance, and some focused reviews, the review team will randomly select student files. In general, a sample consists of 15 students from each award year under review. The review team will analyze the academic file, student account ledger, student financial aid file, and admissions file for each student in the sample. Reviewers will also examine school records that are not specific to in - dividual students. These records include required policies and procedures, fiscal records, and consumer information (i.e., the school's website, school catalog[s], pamphlets, etc.). It may be necessary for the reviewer to conduct interviews with school officials, including academic or education personnel or the registrar, admissions personnel, financial aid personnel, fiscal office personnel, placement officer, and/or campus security personnel. In addition, the reviewer may interview students. Location of the review Program reviews are typically conducted at the institution. However, in some circumstances institutions are asked to submit copies of selected records to the Department for review at its offices, and interviews are con - ducted via telephone rather than in person. Notification of the review Most reviews are announced up to 30 days prior to the review by a telephone call to the president and financial aid administrator. The school also receives written notice of the review and is asked to provide relevant materials prior to the start of the review (e.g., policies and procedures, consumer publications, a list of FSA recipients, etc.). The school will also be expected to make other records available on-site at the start of the review. In some cases, notice for the review is given the day before the review (via overnight delivery or fax), the morning of the review (via fax), or at the time the review team arrives at the school. Schools are required to cooperate with the Department in the event of a program review and provide unrestricted access to any and all information requested to conduct the review. Failure to provide this access to the program review team may lead to an adverse administrative action.Program review priority The law specifies that the Department gives priority in program reviews to schools that have a high cohort default rate or dollar volume of default, have a significant fluctuation in Pell Grant awards or FSA loan volume that is not accounted for by changes in the programs, are reported to have deficiencies or financial aid problems by the appropriate state agency or accrediting agency, have high annual dropout rates, or the Department determines may pose a significant risk of failing to comply with the administrative capability or financial responsibility requirements. 20 USC 1099c-1(a)(2) Administrative subpoena authority HEA Sec. 490A The Department has the authority to issue administrative subpoenas to assist in conducting investigations of possible violations of the provisions of FSA programs. In addition, the law authorizes the Department to request the Attorney General to invoke the assistance of any court of the United States for purposes of enforcing a subpoena if necessary.Access to records Access includes the right to copy records (including computer records), to examine computer programs and data, and to interview employees without the presence of management or the presence of the school's or a servicer's tape recorder. Access and examination cite 34 CFR 668.24(f)Chapter Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA HB February 20192-209CFR Glossary DCL The School Participation Divisions conduct pro - gram reviews and review compliance audits, financial statements, and initial eligibility and recertification applications to get a picture of a school's overall compliance. FSA's School Eligibil - ity Service Group (SESG) coordinates the School Participation Divisions, which are staffed by personnel in the regions and in Washington, DC. Each division is assigned a portfolio of schools and is responsible for the oversight functions mentioned above for those schools. The entire division will evaluate information on the school from a variety of sources to identify any compliance issues at the school. The division can then assess potential risk to the FSA pro - grams and determine appropriate action. Once appropriate actions are decided upon, the person assigned to the school ensures that the recom - mended actions are taken. School Participation Divisions will collect and re - view information on a school from many sources, including but not limited to: applications for recertification, financial and compliance audits, state agencies, accrediting agencies and licensing boards, student complaints, and Department databases.A School Participation Division may decide to take actions that include but are not limited to renewing full recertification or awarding only provisional certification; initiating a program review; establishing liabilities; developing a strategy for providing tech - nical assistance; transferring the school to the cash monitoring or reimbursement payment method (see Volume 4: Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds ); requiring a letter of credit; and referring the school for an enforcement action. Actions do not always have to be negative. For example, the School Participation Division can rec - ommend a school for participation in the Experi - mental Sites Program. Such oversight provides the additional benefit of permitting a school to contact one team that will have all information on the school available in one place. For a list of phone numbers for the regional School Participation Divisions, go to the IFAP web - site ( http://ifap.ed.gov ) and click on Help > Con - tact Information > Federal Student Aid Offices.School Participation DivisionVolume and Operations 2018-2019FSA HB February 20192-210CFR Glossary DCL Department obligations For its part in program reviews, the Department is required to establish guidelines designed to ensure uniformity of practice in the conduct of program reviews; make copies of all review guidelines and procedures available to all participating schools; permit schools to correct administrative, accounting, or record keeping errors if the errors are not part of a pattern and there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct; base any civil penalty assessed against a school resulting from a program review or audit on the gravity of the violation, failure, or misrepresentation; inform the appropriate state and accrediting agency whenever it takes action against a school; provide schools an adequate opportunity to review and respond to any program review report and related materials before a final report is issued; and consider a school's response in any final program review report or audit determination and include in that (1) a written statement addressing the school's response, (2) a written statement of the basis for the report or determination; and (3) a copy of the school's response. [20 USC 1099c-1(b)] Entrance and exit/status conference The review team will hold an entrance conference with school officials at the beginning of the review. The purpose of the entrance conference is to provide school officials with information about the review and the program review process and for reviewers to learn how federal student aid is processed at the school. The review team will hold an exit or status conference at the end of a program review. The purpose of the exit conference is to inform school officials about the next steps in the process, summarize preliminary findings, advise school officials of any immediate changes that must be made, and/or provide details of any remaining outstanding items. If the fieldwork is not complete or the data has not been fully analyzed, a status meeting is conducted. A return visit may be necessary or an exit conference may be conducted via telephone after further analysis is com - pleted.Communication with state agencies The HEA requires that each state, through at least one state agency, must furnish the Department, upon request, with information regarding licensing and other authorization for a school to operate in that state; promptly notify the Department of re - vocations of licensure or authorization; and promptly notify the Department of credible evidence that a school has committed fraud in the administration of the FSA programs or has substantially violated a provision of the HEA. Department's recognition of state agencies Sec. 495 of the HEA 20 USC 1087-1(b) 34 CFR 20192-211CFR Glossary DCL Written report The program review team prepares a preliminary written report after completion of the review. In most instances, this report will be sent to the school within 75 days of the review. The school may respond to this report if it wishes to offer additional information to support its position or if it disagrees with any of the report's findings. When the Department has fully considered the school's response and any additional documentation provided by the school, the Department will send a Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter to the school. Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) An FPRD is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school's response, and the Department's final determination. The FPRD may require the school to take further action to resolve one or more of the findings. This action may include making student level adjustments in COD and the G5 payment system, and paying liabilities to the Department, student, or lenders on behalf of the student. Any funds the school owes as a result of the FPRD must be repaid within 45 days of the school's receipt of the FPRD unless the school submits an appeal to the Department or enters into a payment plan with the Department's Financial Management Group. The cover letter of the FPRD provides instructions on how to file an appeal. If payment or an appeal is not received within 45 days, the Department may elect to use administrative offset to collect the funds owed.Appealing audit and program review determinations The law allows for appeals of final audit or program review determinations. Note that only a final determination may be appealed. The letter conveying a final audit determination is clearly identified as a Final Audit Determination Letter and explains the appeals procedures. For a program review, the final determination letter is identified as a Final Program Review Determination Letter. 34 CFR Part 668 Subpart HVolume February 20192-212CFR Glossary DCL The goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by postsecondary educational institutions meets an acceptable level of quality. The Department recognizes agencies that meet es - tablished criteria, and such recognition is a sign that an agency has been determined to be a reliable au - thority on the quality of the institutions or programs the agency accredits. An accrediting agency can be recognized by the De - partment for institutional or programmatic accredi - tation. An institutional accreditation agency accred - its an entire institution. A programmatic accrediting agency accredits specific educational programs, departments, or schools within an institution. An agency must have standards that effectively ad - dress the quality of a school or program in the fol - lowing areas Success with respect to student achieve - ment in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course com - pletion, state licensing examination, and job placement rates Curricula Faculty Facilities, equipment, and supplies Fiscal and administrative capacity as appro - priate to the specific scale of operations Student support services Recruiting and admissions practices, aca - demic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising Measures of program length and the objec - tives of the degrees or credentials offered Record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency Record of compliance with the school's FSA program responsibilities, based on items such as default rate data and the results of compliance audits and program reviews and any other information that the depart - ment may provide to the agency Any additional accreditation standards the accrediting agency deems appropriateAccrediting Agency Role There are many additional statutory requirements a national accrediting agency must meet to qualify for recognition. For example, an accreditation agency must consistently apply and enforce standards for accreditation that ensure that the educa - tion or training offered by an institution or program, including any offered through cor - respondence or distance education, is of suf - ficient quality to achieve its stated objectives for the duration of the school's accreditation period; perform, at regularly established intervals, on-site inspections and reviews of institu - tions of higher education (that may include unannounced site visits), with particular focus on educational quality and program ef - fectiveness; agree to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of ac - creditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action; and if it is an institutional accrediting agency, maintain adequate substantive change poli - cies that ensure that any substantive change to the educational mission, program, or pro - grams of an institution after an agency has accredited or preaccredited the institution do not adversely affect the capacity of the institution to continue meeting the agency's standards. Information and a complete list of agencies recognized by the Department can be found at www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html. Department's recognition of accrediting agencies Sec. 496 of the HEA 20 USC 1099b 34 CFR 20192-213CFR Glossary DCL Regulations on corrective actions and sanctions For details on steps that a school should follow in any of these situations, see Subpart G of the general provisions regulations and Section 600.41 of the institutional eligibility regulations. Criminal penalties HEA Sec. 490CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND SANCTIONS Sanctions Sanctions include emergency actions, fines, limitations, suspensions, and terminations (see descriptions on next page). The Department may initiate actions against any school that violates the law or regulations governing the FSA programs, its Program Participation Agreement, or any agreement made under the law or regulations; or substantially misrepresents the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges, or its graduates' employability. For details on misrepresentation, see Chapter 6 . In addition, the Department has the authority to terminate a school or program that no longer meets the eligibility criteria given in Chapter 1 . Similarly, the Department may also sanction a third-party servicer that performs functions related to the FSA programs. Further, the Department has the authority to sanction a group of schools or servicers if it finds that a person or entity with substantial control over all schools or servicers within the group has violated any of the FSA program requirements or has been suspended or debarred from program participation. See Chapters 1 and 4. Criminal penalties The law provides that any person who knowingly and willfully embezzles; misapplies; steals; obtains by fraud, false statement, or forgery; or fails to refund any funds, assets, or property provided or insured under Title IV of the Higher Education Act; or attempts to commit any of these crimes will be fined up to $20,000 or imprisoned for up to five years, or both. If the amount of funds involved in the crime is $200 or less, the penalties are fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to one year, or both. Any person who knowingly and willfully makes false statements, furnishes false information, or conceals material information in connection with the assignment of an FSA program loan or attempts to do so, will, upon conviction, be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to one year, or both. This penalty also applies to any person who knowingly and willfully makes, or attempts to make, an unlawful payment to an eligible lender of loans as an inducement to make, or to acquire by assignment, a loan insured under such part. destroys or conceals, or attempts to destroy or conceal, any record relating to the provision of FSA program assistance with intent to defraud the United States or to prevent the United States from enforcing any right obtained by subrogation under this part.Actions due to program violations or misrepresentation If a school has violated the FSA program regulations, the Department may (at its sole discretion) allow the school to respond to the problem and indicate how it will correct it. However, if the school has repeatedly violated the law or regulations, or the Department has determined that the violations are egregious, the Department may take an emergency action, fine the school, or initiate a limitation, suspension, or termination of FSA program participation. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019FSA HB February 20192-214CFR Glossary DCL Emergency action The Department may take an emergency action to withhold FSA program funds from a school or its students if the Department receives information, de - termined by a Department official to be reliable, that the school is violating applicable laws, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, or limitations. To take an emergency action, the Department official must determine that the school is misusing federal funds. immediate action is necessary to stop this misuse. the potential loss outweighs the importance of using established procedures for limitation, suspension, and termination. The school is notified by registered mail (or other expeditious means) of the emergency action and the reasons for it. The action becomes effective on the date the notice is mailed. An emergency action suspends the school's partici - pation in all FSA programs and prohibits the school from disbursing FSA program funds or certifying FFEL applications. The action may not last more than 30 days unless a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding is initiated during that period. In that case, the emergency action is extended until the proceed - ing, including any appeal, is concluded. The school is given an opportunity to show cause that the action is unwarranted. Fine The Department may fine a school up to $57,317 for each statutory or regulatory violation. In determining the amount of the fine, the Department considers the gravity of the offense, the nature of the violation, and the school's size. The school is notified by certified mail of the fine action, the amount of the fine, and the basis for the action. A school has 20 days from the date of mailing to submit a written request for a hearing or to submit written material indicating why the fine should not be imposed. Limitation Under a limitation, which lasts for at least 12 months, the Department imposes specific conditions or restrictions upon a school and its administration of Corrective Actions and Sanctions the FSA programs. As a result, the school is allowed to continue participating in those programs. If the school fails to abide by the limitation's conditions, a termination proceeding may be initiated. Suspension A suspension removes a school from participation in the FSA programs for a period not to exceed 60 days (unless a limitation or termination proceeding has been initiated or the Department and the school agree to an extension). A suspension action is used when a school can be expected to correct an FSA program violation in a short time. Corrective action As part of any fine, limitation, or suspension proceeding, the Department may require a school to take corrective action. This may include making payments to eligible students from its own funds or repaying illegally used funds to the Department. In addition, the Department may offset any funds to be repaid against any benefits or claims due the school. Termination A termination ends a school's participation in the FSA programs. A school that has violated the law or regula - tions governing the FSA programs, its PPA, or any other agreement made under FSA regulations and was terminated from participating in the FSA programs generally may not apply to be reinstated for at least 18 months. Possibility of reinstatement A school requesting reinstatement in the FSA programs must submit a fully completed E-App to the Department and demonstrate that it meets the standards in 34 CFR Part 668. As part of the reinstatement process, the school must show that it has corrected the violation(s) on which its termination was based, including repaying all funds (to the Department or to the eligible recipients) that were improperly received, disbursed, caused to be disbursed, or withheld. The Department may approve the request, deny the request, or approve the request subject to limitations (such as granting the school provisional certi - fication). If the Department approves the reinstatement request, the school will receive a new ECAR and enter into a new PPA.Chapter 8\u2014Program Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA requirement 34 CFR 600.40 ... (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, if an institution ceases to satisfy any of the requirements for eligibility under this part\u2014 (1) It must notify the Secretary within 30 days of the date that it ceases to satisfy that requirement; and (2) It becomes ineligible to continue to participate in any HEA program as of the date it ceases to satisfy any of the requirements.CLOSEOUT PROCEDURES (WHEN FSA PARTICIPATION ENDS) A school may stop participating in the FSA programs voluntarily or may be required to leave involuntarily, as described below. In either situation, it must follow the closeout procedures specified in the FSA regulations. Involuntary withdrawal from FSA participation A school's participation ends in the following circumstances: The school closes or stops providing instruction for a reason other than normal vacation periods or as a result of a natural disaster that directly affects the school or its students The school loses its accreditation The school loses its state licensure The school loses its eligibility The school's ppa expires The school's participation is terminated under subpart G The school's provisional certification is revoked by the department The school's cohort default rate exceeds allowable limits The school files a petition for bankruptcy or the school, its owner, or its ceo is responsible for a crime involving FSA funds Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2018-2019FSA HB February 20192-216CFR Glossary DCL Closeout procedures In general, a school that ceases to be eligible must notify its School Participation Division within 30 days of its loss of eligibility to participate in the FSA programs. The school must also do the following: Within 45 days of the effective ending date of participation, submit to the Department all financial reports, performance reports, and other reports, as well as a dated letter of engagement for an audit by an independent certified public accountant of all FSA program funds received. The completed audit report must be submitted to the Department within 45 days after the date of the letter of engagement. Report to the Department on the arrangements for retaining and storing (for the remainder of the appropriate retention period described in Chapter 7 ) all records concerning the school's management of the appropriate FSA programs. Tell the Department how the school will provide for collecting any outstanding federal loans held by the school. Refund students' unearned FSA student assistance. (See Volume 5, Chapter 2 .) Liquidate its Perkins Loan portfolio and fund if it participated in the Perkins Loan program. (See Volume 6, Chapter 5 .) In addition, a school that closes must refund to the federal government or, following written instructions from the Department, otherwise distribute any unexpended FSA funds it has received (minus its administrative cost allowance, if applicable). Unpaid commitments and loss of program eligibility If a school's participation ends during a payment period or if a program loses its eligibility, but the school continues to provide education in the formerly eligible program until the end of the payment or enrollment period, the school may use FSA funds it possesses to satisfy unpaid Pell Grant or Campus-Based Program commitments made to students for that payment period or for previously completed payment periods before the school's participation ended; use the FSA funds in its possession to satisfy unpaid Direct Loan commitments made to students for that period of enroll - ment before participation ended by delivering subsequent Di - rect Loan disbursements to the students or by crediting them to their accounts (if the first disbursement already was delivered or credited to the students' accounts before the school's partici - pation ended). Note: The school may request additional funds from the Department to meet these commitments.Definition of commitment A commitment under the Pell and TEACH grant programs occurs when a student is enrolled and attending the school and has submitted a valid Student Aid Report to the school or when a school has received a valid institutional student information report. A commitment under the Campus-Based Programs occurs when a student is enrolled and attending the school and has received a notice from the school of the amount that he or she can expect to receive and how and when that amount will be paid. 34 CFR 668.26(e)(1) Effect on student eligibility for interest subsidies A student enrolled at a school that loses eligibility or discontinues participation in the Direct Loan program can continue to receive interest subsidies if the student enrolls and remains enrolled at an eligible school.Chapter 8\u2014Program Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA HB February 20192-217CFR Glossary DCL Recovery of loan discharges when branch/location closes If an additional location or branch of an institution closes and borrowers who attended the school obtain loan discharges by reason of the closure of the location or branch (or improper ATB or loan certifications), the Department will pursue recovery against the larger institution, its affiliates, and its principals. 20 USC 1087(c)(1)Teach-out plan 34 CFR 668.14(b)(31) Federal Register October 29, 2009 Also see: Teach-out plan definition 34 CFR 600.2 Eligibility of additional locations for teach- out purposes 34 CFR 600.32(d)Teach-out plan A school must submit a teach-out plan to its accrediting agency if the Department initiates an emergency action or initiates the lim - itation, suspension, or termination of the school's participation in any FSA program; the school's accrediting agency acts to withdraw, terminate, or suspend the accreditation or preaccreditation; the school's state licensing or authorizing agency revokes the institution's license or legal authorization to provide an educational program; the school intends to close a location that provides 100% of at least one program; or the school otherwise intends to cease operations. Closure of a branch or location A separate closeout audit is not required if a school closes an ad - ditional location or a branch campus because the next due compliance audit for the school must report on the use of FSA program funds at the closed location. However, the school must notify the Department of the additional location or branch closure. See Chapter 5 for information on reporting information to the Department. Loss of eligibility or withdrawal from the Direct Loan Program If a school is notified that it has lost its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the school does not intend to appeal the decision, it must immediately inform all current and prospective students of its loss of eligibility. The school must also explain that it can no longer originate Direct Loans for students or parents. If the school appeals its loss of eligibility within the required timeframe, the school may continue originating Direct Loans during the appeal process. Once a final decision on the appeal is made, the school must take the actions described in the Department's final appeal determination letter. If a school plans to withdraw from participation in the Direct Loan Program, it must notify the Department of its decision in writing. Once the effective date of withdrawal has been established, the school is prohibited from disbursing loan funds to the student. However, if your school made a first disbursement to the student before it lost eligibility, it may still be able to make a subsequent disbursement to that student. See the conditions in 34 CFR 668.26(d).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and DCL End of FSA Participation School closes or stops providing instruction If the school closes its main campus or stops providing instruction on its main campus, its loss of eligibility includes all its locations and programs. If a school ceases to provide educational instruction in all FSA-eligible programs, the school should make arrangements for its students to complete their academic programs. If the school chooses to enter into a formal teach-out arrangement, it should contact its school participation division for guidance. School loses eligibility A school loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs when it no longer meets the requirements of 34 CFR Part 600, certain requirements of Part 668, or when the Department terminates the school under Subpart G of the General Provisions. Voluntary withdrawal from FSA participation For many reasons a school may voluntarily withdraw from participating in one or all of the FSA programs. For instance, a school might wish to withdraw from the Direct Loan Program to work on lowering high student loan co - hort default rates. To withdraw from one or all of the FSA programs, the school must notify the Department via the electronic application. The school participation division has more information about this procedure. A school that withdrew voluntarily (for instance, to lower its default rate) can request to participate again without the waiting period required for a school that was terminated from the program involuntarily or withdrew voluntarily while under a show cause or suspension order. Withdrawing from the FSA programs while under a termination order or other sanction \u2014or to avoid being placed under them\u2014is not considered a voluntary withdrawal. School loses primary accreditation When a school loses its institution-wide accreditation, the Department generally may not certify or recertify that school to participate in any FSA program for two years after the school has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause or after a school has voluntarily withdrawn under a show cause or suspension or - der. If a school wishes to be reinstated, it must submit a fully completed E-App to the Department. The Department will not recertify a school that has lost its institution-wide accreditation in the previous two years unless the original accrediting agency rescinds its termination of the school's accreditation. Also, if a school volun - tarily withdrew from accreditation during the last two years under a show cause or suspension order, the Depart - ment will not recertify the school unless the accrediting agency rescinds the original order. Finally, a school may not be recertified on the basis of accreditation granted by a different accrediting agency during the two-year period. There are two exceptions to the two-year rule: 1. If the Department determines that loss of institution-wide accreditation was due to the school's religious mission or affiliation, the school can remain certified for up to 18 months while it obtains alternative ac - creditation. 2. If a school's institution-wide accrediting agency loses its Department recognition, the school has up to 18 months to obtain new accreditation. Note: It is possible for accreditation to be withdrawn from one of the programs at a school without affecting the accreditation (and eligibility) of other programs at the school.i3-1 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Introduction RECENT CHANGES Here are some of the significant changes to Volume 3 for the 2018-19 award year: Chapter 2 Clarified treatment of costs for attending a conference, when a conference is a standard part of a student's program.

If you have any comments or questions regarding the FSA Handbook, please contact Research and Publications via CHAPTER13-3 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL ACADEMIC YEAR REQUIREMENTS Every eligible program, including graduate programs, must have a defined academic year. The academic year is one component used in determining the student's eligibility for Title IV aid. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the definition must be different, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For FSA purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and for undergraduate programs in credit or clock-hours. The program's academic year does not have to coincide with a program's academic calendar. A school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and define different academic years for each version. If your school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, your school must be able to demonstrate in which program the student is actually enrolled. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking the majority of his or her coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all FSA awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other FSA program purposes. Weeks of instructional time in an academic year An academic year for a credit-hour or direct assessment program must be defined as at least 30 weeks of instructional time, and for a clock-hour program, at least 26 weeks of instructional time. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that begins (generally, see below for an exception) on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or examinations. For all FSA programs, a week of instructional time is any period of 7 consecutive days in which at least 1 day of regularly scheduled instruction, Award limits are generally connected to a period of time and to credit or clock-hours attended. For instance, all of the programs except Federal Work-Study (FWS) have a maximum amount that can be awarded for an academic year or award year. Measurement of time is important for another reason\u2014in most cases, awards from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs must be paid in at least two installments. For most programs, the amount and timing of the payments is based on the academic terms or payment periods in the program.

Instructional time does not include periods of orientation, counseling, homework, vacation, or other activity not related to class preparation or examination. Therefore, the weeks of instructional time may be less than the number of calendar weeks that elapse between the first day of classes and the last day of classes or examinations. Weeks of instructional time: Cannot overlap, and a school cannot use a single day of scheduled instruction, exams, or study time to create more than one week of instruction; May begin and end on a day other than Monday, provided that each week of instructional time comprises a seven consecutive day period (for example, a Wednesday through the following Tuesday) which includes at least one day of scheduled instruction, exams, or study time, as required by the regulations; and May begin up to six days prior to the first day of scheduled instruction or exams in a payment period. Credit or clock-hours in an academic year The law and regulations set the following minimum standards for coursework earned by a full-time student in an academic year in an undergraduate educational program (including direct assessment programs): 24 semester or trimester credit-hours or 36 quarter credit-hours for a program measured in credit-hours; or 900 clock-hours for a program measured in clock-hours. There is no minimum hours component to the definition of an academic year for graduate and professional programs. For purposes of Direct Loans , a loan period certified for an academic year in a graduate or professional program would include the weeks of instructional time in the academic year and the hours a full-time student is expected to complete in those weeks. See Chapter 5 for more details on loan limits. Awards are affected when a program does not meet one of the academic year standards The FSA academic year that a school defines for a program has to meet the regulatory minimums for both clock or credit-hours AND weeks of instructional time. In some instances, the academic year may not coincide with the academic calendar of the school. These cases may affect Pell Grants and loan disbursements, and, in Direct Loans, annual loan limits and annual loan limit progression. Citations Award Year: 34 CFR 600.2 instructional time: 34 CFR 668.3(b) Weeks of instructional time are used in the Pell Grant and Direct Loan calculations ( Chapters 3 and 5 of this volume). Note that the Department has not set a regulatory standard for the number of hours of instructional time that make up one day of instruction. This has been left to the reasonable interpretation of schools and their accrediting agencies. Minimum program length Although most programs are at least one academic year in length, some eligible programs are shorter than an academic year. See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for more detail on the requirements for such programs. Weeks of instructional time in distance education and competency-based programs DCL GEN-14-23 Q&A #8 in the DCL applies to both distance education and CBE programs. Reductions in academic year length 34 CFR 668.3(c) HEA Sec. 481(a)(2)(B) Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to ED if they want to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. ED is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis (send requests to your School Participation Divisions ).NEWChapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, & Disbursements 3-5 *Note that this example is not meant to illustrate any specific calendar year.This graphic illustrates how you would count weeks of instructional time in a standard semester term where classes are held Monday through Friday. In this hypothetical term,* August 1st is a Sunday, and classes begin on August 23rd and end December 10th, with examinations held December 13th-17th. The circles indicate the points at which each of the weeks of instructional time begin. There are 17 w eeks of instructional time. There are no classes on Labor Day (September 6th), Veterans Day (November 11th), nor during Thanksgiving break (November 24th-26th) , however, each of these weeks still counts as a week of instructional time (as does the week of exams in December), since each includes at least one day of qualified instruction. If a week in the term has no days of instruction, examination, or (after the last day of classes) study for examination, that week does NOT count as a week of instructional time. For example, a week comprised entirely of vacation days is not a week of instructional time.Counting Weeks of Instructional TimeFor example, awards would be affected if a program is an academic year in length in credit or clock-hours but not in weeks of instructional time. Also, for a program longer than an academic year in length, awards would be affected if the completion of the credit or clock-hours in the program's academic year does not coincide with completing the weeks of instructional time in the academic year.Volume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-6 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Typical length of standard terms For additional information on this topic, see the preamble to the General Provisions regulations (published November 29, 1996 page 60581).ACADEMIC CALENDARS & TERMS Schools offer programs with many kinds of academic calendars that differ from the traditional fall-spring school year. For purposes of the FSA programs, there are three basic types of academic calendars: standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term. Generally, a term is a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit-hours. However, if these periods overlap within a program, they may not be treated as a term-based program for FSA purposes. Term-based programs can have either standard terms or nonstandard terms. If any of the terms in a program contain a class or classes which begin and/or end a total of more than 2 weeks before or after the start of a standard term, the program must be considered a nonstandard term program for Title IV purposes. Standard terms: semesters, trimesters, and quarters Semesters and trimesters are terms that are generally 15 to 17 weeks long. An academic calendar that uses semesters traditionally has two terms, in the fall and spring, and a trimester academic calendar traditionally has three terms, in the fall, spring, and summer. Academic progress is measured in semester credit-hours, and full-time is at least 12 semester credits. Similarly, quarter terms are approximately 10 to 12 weeks in length and the academic calendar includes three quarters in the fall, winter, spring, and often a summer term. Academic progress is measured in quarter credit-hours, and full-time is at least 12 quarter credits. You may combine shorter terms or modules to meet the requirements of a standard term such as a semester. For example: a program is offered in 8 nonstandard terms, each 6 weeks in length, and students earn 6 quarter credits in each term. You may choose to combine each consecutive pair of nonstandard terms and consider the program to be offered in 4 quarters. In certain limited cases for academic programs offered in standard terms, a short nonstandard term may be treated as part of one of the standard terms, and the combined terms may be considered to be a single standard term. For example, a program is offered in a calendar consisting of two 15-week semesters and a 4-week intersession. To consider the program as consisting only of semesters, the intersession may be treated as part of one of the two semesters as long as the same treatment is applied for all FSA purposes to all students enrolled in the program. In addition, hours taken in the intersession must count toward a student's enrollment status for the combined term and costs for the intersession must be appropriately included in the cost of attendance. If you choose not to combine a nonstandard term in this manner, the program must be treated as a non-term program for Direct Loans, and a Formula 3 program for Pell and TEACH Grants. The fact that you did not combine the term does not negate the requirement that a student must be considered for Title IV aid if enrolled and eligible in the term.Credit-hour definition 34 CFR 600.2 DCL GEN-11-06 A credit-hour is now formally defined, for Title IV aid purposes, as an amount of work that reasonably approximates not less than: 1. One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for a semester or trimester hour, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter-hour of credit (or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time); or 2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required in #1 for other academic activities such as laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, or other academic work leading to the award of credit-hours. Note that the classroom/direct faculty instruction time and out-of-class student work requirement in #1 does not mean you must have a certain number of hours of those specific types of instruction every week; it is an average required over the length of the course and may be institutionally established equivalencies that reasonably approximate the minimum standard using different measures of student work. You may set a higher standard that requires more student work per credit-hour, and you may use a measure or metric different from this definition for academic and non-federal aid purposes. If the program in question is using the clock- hour to credit-hour conversion formula, the above guidance does not apply to the definition of a credit-hour. Chapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, & Disbursements 3-7 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Credits and nonstandard terms Remember, just because progress in a program is measured in semester or quarter credits, this does not necessarily mean that the program is offered in semester or quarter terms. Also, even though a school may label a term as a quarter, semester, or trimester, it may be considered a nonstandard term for FSA purposes if it does not conform to the FSA standards for a semester, trimester, or quarter. Combining terms examples See the example at the end of this section for guidance on combining concurrent and consecutive terms. Open entry-term or non-term? If a student whose academic program is term-based is enrolled primarily in non-term coursework (i.e., open-entry/exit courses), you must award and disburse aid to the student using non-term rules, for example: Calculating the student's Pell Grant using a Pell formula appropriate for the student's enrollment; Using a borrower-based academic year (BBAY) when awarding loans to the student; and Withholding a second disbursement until the student has successfully completed the coursework and half of the weeks of instructional time.Periods of clinical work such as medical and education program work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in practicum or clinical experience and its completion is required for graduates to apply for licensure or authorization or practice occupation those students intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or start/end dates of practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies, or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals, etc.); and Credit hours associated with practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if starting and ending dates do not exactly align with term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all of the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered nonterm, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (allopathic, osteopathic, nursing and veterinary), pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. Nonstandard terms Nonstandard terms are terms (where all coursework is expected to begin and end within a set period of time) that are not semester, trimester, or quarter terms. In some cases, the terms may be of unequal length, though it is also possible for programs with terms of equal length to be considered nonstandard. For instance, a school could offer a program with six consecutive 5-week modules, with each module counting as a nonstandard term. Unlike standard terms, the length of the term is not necessarily associated with the type of credit-hours awarded. Some nonstandard terms are the length of a semester (15-17 weeks) but award quarter credits. Others are the length of a quarter (10-12 weeks) but award semester credits. Non-term characteristics If a program measures progress in clock-hours, it is always treated as a non-term program. A program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to be using a non-term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term .Credit to clock-hour conversion 34 CFR 668.8(k) & (l) Credit Hour Q&As For more on credit hour to clock-hour conversion, see Volume 2, Chapter 2 . Volume 3\u2014Calculating & Packaging, 2018-193-8 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Combining concurrent terms Grace University offers a program in both 15-week terms and 8-week terms. Grace University combined two 8-week terms with a 15-week term to make each semester; each semester provides 16 weeks of instructional time.* 15 weeks * 15 weeks * 8 weeks* 8 weeks* 8 weeks* 8 weeks* Term 1 Term 2 Dunston College offers a separate degree program in education with a 4-week* intersession between two 15-week* semesters. The terms don't overlap. Dunston College has defined the academic year for this program as 24 semester hours and 34 weeks of instructional time. Dunston College could combine the intersession with one of the standard terms, and, for purposes of FSA programs, treat the program as being offered in two semesters: Dunston College can also choose not to combine the terms. In this case, the program would have a 4-week nonstandard term and two semesters. For certain FSA program requirements, this may mean you will treat all terms in a nonstandard term manner, or as part of a non-term program. For more details, see discussion on previous pages.15 weeks* 15 weeks* 4 wks* Term 1 (19 weeks) Term 2 (15 weeks)Combining consecutive terms A school may choose to group modules together and treat the entire period as a term. (For example, grouping three five-week* modules together may create a 15-week* semester; or grouping four one- month modules into a 16-week semester would be acceptable.) On the other hand, programs that are offered in modules may sometimes be counted as programs measured in nonstandard terms. For example, in a program that offers six 5-week modules, each module could be treated as a nonstandard term. In addition, a school may choose to consider a program that consists of consecutive modules as a non-term program. Whatever academic calendar your school adopts for a program, you must apply it to all students enrolled in that program and document the program's treatment in your policies and procedures manual.4 wks* 4 4 wks* 5 wks* *Weeks in these examples are weeks of instructional time , as defined earlier in this chapter.Treatment of modules 4 wks* 4 wks* 4 wks* 4 wks*Chapter 1 Academic 3-9 FSA HB 34 CFR 668.4 Two payment period limit in an academic year or program Unless you are using terms as payment periods under FSA rules, there are no more than two payment periods in the lesser of the program, the academic year, or the remainder of the program. You may make multiple disbursements within a single payment period; however, schools should note that making multiple disbursements within a payment period does not create a new or additional payment period. \"Successfully Completes\" 34 CFR 668.4(h)(2) A student \"successfully completes\" credit or clock-hours if your school considers the student to have passed the coursework associated with those hours. \"Substantially Equal in Length\" 34 CFR 668.4(h)(1) For purposes of measuring payment periods in programs offered in nonstandard terms, \"substantially equal\" means that no term in the program is more than 2 weeks of instructional time longer than any other term in that program. \"Not substantially equal in length\" means nonstandard terms that have at least 1 term more than 2 weeks of instructional time longer than another in the same program.PAYMENT PERIODS The definition of a payment period is applicable to all FSA programs except FWS. The common definition is integral to requirements for the administration of FSA funds. For example, FSA program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis. Another example is that a student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) evaluation is required to correspond with the end of a payment period. For clock-hour programs, the payment period is defined not only in clock-hours but also in weeks of instructional time. A student must successfully complete the clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period to progress to the next payment period. For Pell Grants and Direct Loans, the payment period for clock-hour programs and non-term credit-hour programs, are defined in clock or credit- hours and weeks of instructional time (as has been the case for the other FSA programs). This also is the case for nonstandard term Direct Loans programs with terms not substantially equal in length. Previously for such programs, second disbursements in loan periods were based on the calendar midpoint of the academic year. A student must successfully complete the clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period to progress to the next payment period (as has been the case for annual loan limit progression and for grant payment period progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs). For FSA purposes, you will use either \"term-based\" payment periods (the payment period is the term), or payment periods based on the completion of credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time. The payment period you use depends on the kind of academic calendar your school uses, as described here, and the FSA program for which you are disbursing funds. Programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (term-based) For credit-hour programs that use standard terms, or that use nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (see sidebar), the payment period is the term itself. Programs with nonstandard terms not substantially equal in length For purposes of Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, and FSEOGs, if the program uses nonstandard terms, the payment period is the term. This includes terms that are not substantially equal in length. For Direct Loans, if a credit-hour program has nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length, use the non-term payment periods described in the following section, under \"Clock-hour and non-term programs.\" Volume 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Unable to determine completion of hours in payment period 34 CFR 668.4(c)(3) If your school is tracking progress by clock or non-term credit-hours and is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock-hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by the school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or the remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or the remainder of the program.Direct Loan payment periods for graduate/professional students (clock-hour, non-term, etc.) For a graduate or professional student in a clock-hour or non-term program, or a program with terms not substantially equal in length, the Direct Loan payment period is 1/2 of what a full-time student would be expected to complete, in both weeks of instructional time and credit or clock-hours. This policy also relates to annual loan limit progression for graduate or professional students (for more on loan limits, see Chapter 5 of this volume). Clock-hour programs with terms The payment periods for clock-hour programs that use terms are determined in the same way as for non-term clock-hour programs. The student must successfully complete all the clock-hours in the payment period before receiving any more FSA funds. If a student doesn't complete all the hours scheduled for a term, each payment period still contains the number of clock-hours originally scheduled, even if this means that none of the student's succeeding payment periods coincide with the terms.Clock-hour and non-term programs The following types of programs must use payment periods that are based on the time it takes for the student to successfully complete the credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in the payment period: non-term credit-hour programs, clock-hour programs, and for Direct Loan purposes, nonstandard term credit-hour programs with terms not substantially equal in length If you are determining the payment periods for a program for which one of the measures (either clock or credit-hours or length of instructional time) is less than an academic year and the other measurement is not, the program is considered less than an academic year in length, and you follow the payment period rules for a program that is less than an academic year. If the program is one academic year or less, the academic year or program is divided into two payment periods. The first payment period is the period in which the student successfully completes half of the credit or clock-hours AND half of the weeks of instructional time in the program. The second payment period is the period in which the student completes the remainder of the program. If the program is more than one academic year in length: Use the rule for one academic year (above) for each full academic year in the program. For any remaining portion of a program that is half of an academic year or less, the remaining portion is treated as a single payment period. For any remaining portion of a program that is more than half of an academic year but less than a full academic year, the remaining portion is divided into two payment periods and the first payment period is the period in which the student successfully completes half of the credit or clock-hours AND half of the weeks of instructional time in the remaining portion.Chapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, program A student enrolls in a clock -hour program with an academic year (AY) of 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. The pr ogram is 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of instruction al time in length and consists of 6 successive graded courses. Each course has 150 clock hours and is completed over 4 weeks of instructional time. Our student successfully completes all 6 courses except the second course that the student immediately rep eats and passes. In this case the scheduled payment periods are identical for the student's Pell Grant and Direct L oan and are \u00bd of the length of the program in clock hours and weeks of instructional time: 450 clock hours and 12 weeks of instructional ti me. However, the first payment period is extended since the first 450 clock hours attended were not successfully completed. The student does not complete the first payment pe riod until after attending for 600 clock hours and 15 weeks of instructional tim e due to the need to successfully complete the 450 clock hours in the payment period. As a result, the second disbursement date must be rescheduled, and the school will need to report the rescheduled di sbursement date for the second disbursement to COD fo r Pell and Direct Loans.

Note that where 6 semester hours in the first period of enrollment would be considered part of the third payment period for grants/Perkins, for Direct/Direct PLUS , they would be considered as part of the initial BBAY loan period. Thus, for Direct/Direct PLUS , the second loan period is the remaining balance of the program: 18 hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. For the first loan period, the payment periods are 15 hours and 15 weeks of instructional time, i.e., half of the weeks of in structional time and half of the hours the student is expected to complete in the loan period. For the second loan period, the remaining balance of the program is less than an academic year in length based on the hours; however, both hours and weeks of instructional time are greater than \u00bd of the academic year. Therefore, there are two eq ual payment periods of 9 hours and 15 weeks of instructional time.

For this program, the school has defined the academic year as 24 semester credits and 30 weeks of instructional time. Under the regulations, this half-time student would receive second disbursements after completing half of the credit-hours AND half of the weeks of instructional time in the academic year. Because the student in the example is a half-time student, it takes the student 30 weeks of instructional time to successfully complete 12 credit-hours. The student is eligible for a new loan and a new Pell Grant once the student has successfully completed 24 credit-hours and 60 weeks.Example: Disbursement for half-time student in a non-term program First academic year (24 semester hours) 4 1st Pell disbursement 1st loan disbursement4 30 weeks elapsed Student has completed 12 credits 2nd Pell disbursement 2nd loan disbursement Second academic year (24 semester hours) 4 New Pell Grant and loan award begin after student completes 24 semester hours and weeks in first academic year 1st Pell disbursement for 2nd year 1st loan disbursement for 2nd year 430 weeks elapsed in 2nd academic year Student has completed 36 credits 2nd Pell disbursement for 2nd year 2nd loan disbursement for 2nd year 4 60 weeks elapsed 24 credits completed End of first academic year460 weeks elapsed in 2nd year 48 credits completed End of programVolume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & Acronyms Non-term Programs\u2014One Academic Y ear or Less Academic Year = 24 semester hrs & 30 wks of instructional timeIn both of these examples, the school defines the academic year for the program as 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time.

Completion requirements Payment periods: 34 CFR 668.4 Assessment program payment periods 34 CFR 668.10, Dear Colleague Letter GEN-13-10 Because Direct Assessment programs don't use credit or clock-hours as measures of learning, you must establish a method to reasonably equate the Direct Assessment program (or Direct Assessment portion of any program) to credit or clock-hours for the purpose of determining the payment periods in the program. You must provide a reasonable written description that supports your claim that the program or portion of a program is equivalent to a specific number of credit or clock-hours (note that any credits awarded for \"life experience\" are not counted for FSA purposes). Once you have established credit or clock-hour equivalencies, Direct Assessment program payment periods are measured in the same manner as other programs, according to the payment period rules described earlier in this chapter. Excused absences in clock-hour programs In a clock-hour program, you are allowed to count a limited number of excused absences when deciding whether the student has completed the hours in a payment period. An excused absence may only be counted if the student is excused from hours that were actually scheduled, were missed, and do not have to be made up for the student to receive the degree or certificate for the program. For instance, a student in a program that has 450-clock-hour payment periods might miss 20 clock-hours and only have attended 430 clock-hours at the point where other students that did not miss any clock-hours had received 450 clock-hours of instruction. If your school has an excused absences policy, the 20 missed clock-hours are considered excused, and this student could be paid the next disbursement. To be counted for FSA purposes, excused absences must be permitted in your school's written policies. Under FSA regulations, no more than 10% of the clock-hours in a payment period may be considered excused absences. If your school's accrediting agency or the state agency that legally authorizes your school to operate allows fewer hours to be counted as excused absences, you must follow the stricter standard rather than the FSA standard. Progression based on completion of hours and weeks (rather than term- based progression) As described in the previous section, there are two cases where you must use credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time to determine the length of the payment period: Clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs; and For Direct Loans, programs with terms not substantially equal in length. For these programs, each subsequent payment period cannot begin until the student successfully completes the credit or clock-hours and weeks of instruction in the previous payment period. Except for a second or subsequent loan period in Direct Loans, if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, these additional weeks or hours count toward completing the next payment period. For Direct Loans, the first payment period of a second or subsequent loan period includes only the weeks of instructional time and hours that begin on the first calendar day of the new loan period.Volume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-20 Acronyms Direct Loan Disbursements within a single term/payment period Unless it qualifies for the special rule based on low cohort default rates (see below), a school must generally make two disbursements of a Direct Loan that is certified or originated for a single term or a single payment period: For credit-hour programs offered in standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than 9 weeks of instructional time in length (SE9W, see later in this chapter for more on SE9W), the second disbursement may not be paid until the calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days of class in the loan period. For all other programs, including clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, and nonstandard term programs with terms that are not substantially equal or with terms that are substantially equal and less than 9 weeks of instructional time in length, for a remainder of a program equal to or less than \u00bd an academic year ( or the term if the terms are substantially equal) the second disbursement may not be paid until the student successfully completes \u00bd of the weeks of instructional time in the payment period, and half of the clock or credit-hours in the payment period. Special rule: Schools with cohort default rates of less than 15% fo r each of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data are available, may disburse, in a single installment, loans that are made for: 1 semester, 1 trimester, 1 quarter or, for loans made for a 4-month period or less, for one nonstandard or non-term loan period. Note that a program offered in substantially equal terms at least nine weeks in length (SE9W) may not disburse in a single installment for a term if the term is longer than four months. In the case of loans made to students in study abroad programs, the home school's default rate must be less than 5 percent for the most recent fiscal year for which data are available to qualify for this special rule. Pell or TEACH Grant disbursements within a single term If a school uses Formula 3 to calculate a Pell Grant or TEACH Grant, the student's total payment for a payment period may exceed 50 percent of the student's annual award. However, the disbursements of the student's Pell or TEACH Grant in the payment period cannot exceed 50 percent of the student's annual award until the student completes, in the payment period, at least half of the weeks of instructional time in the academic year.1 If a program is offered in a combination of standard and nonstandard terms and the program does not qualify to use a Scheduled Academic Year, or \"SAY\" (see Chapter 5 for details on SAYs and Borrower Based Academic Years\u2014BBAYs), then for Direct Loan purposes, the program is subject to the disbursement requirements that apply to nonstandard programs that are not substantially equal in length. 2 Successful completion means that the student has earned a passing grade or otherwise received credit for the credits or clock-hours in the payment period.Disbursement by Payment Period Required Program Type Direct Loan Pell, TEACH, & FSEOG Credit-hour programs offered in standard terms & nonstandard term programs offered in terms that are substantially equal in length.

For instance, a student could receive a Direct Loan disbursement in the spring term after failing several courses in the fall term, provided that the student was still making satisfactory progress under the school's policy. (However, if the program uses nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length, you must use the non- term-based rules for Direct Loan disbursements, below.) Pell Grants, FSEOG and TEACH Grants in clock-hour or non-term programs For a credit-hour program without terms or a clock-hour program, a school may disburse a Pell Grant, FSEOG or TEACH Grant only after it determines that the student has successfully completed the credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in the prior payment period. Direct Loans in clock-hour, non-term, and certain nonstandard term programs If an educational program does not use terms to measure academic progress for FSA purposes, the school may not make the second loan disbursement until the student successfully completes the weeks of instructional time and the credit or clock-hours in the payment period. These coursework completion requirements apply to clock hour and non-term programs, and programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length.

Disbursement by payment periods The Cash Management regulations specify that a school must disburse all FSA grant and loan funds on a payment period basis. For all types of programs other than FWS, FSA funds are disbursed using the payment period definitions in 34 CFR 668.4. TIMING OF DISBURSEMENTS\u2014GENERAL RULES Except for Federal Work Study (FWS) wages, FSA disbursements are made on a payment period basis. Except for FWS and late Direct Loan disbursements, you must disburse the Title IV funds during the payment period to which they apply. The timing of disbursements is especially important for Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, and Direct Loan funds, because you must report disbursement dates to the Department (through the Common Origination and Disbursement [COD] system). Basic rules for early and delayed disbursements In general, the earliest that a school may disburse FSA funds by crediting the student's account or by paying directly to the student or parent is 10 days before the first day of classes for that payment period. For non-term credit-hour and clock-hour programs, the earliest a school may disburse FSA funds (other than FWS wages) is the later of: 10 days before the first day of classes for that payment period; or The date the student completed the previous payment period for which he or she received FSA funds. This disbursement timing limitation is also applicable to Direct Loan and Direct PLUS Loan disbursements in credit-hour programs with non- standard terms that are not substantially equal in length. In some cases, as we'll discuss, other restrictions apply. If a student is in the first year of undergraduate study and is a first-time borrower, your school may not disburse the first installment of the Direct Loan until 30 calendar day s after the student's program of study begins. You are not required to delay disbursement for such students if you have a cohort default rate of less than 15 percent for each of the three most recent years for which data are available, or if you are a home institution originating a loan to cover the cost of attendance in a study-abroad program and have a cohort default rate of less than 5 percent for the single most recent year for which data are available. If a student is scheduled to begin class in a module of a term-based program that starts after the first day of classes for the semester, you may not make the initial disbursement until 10 days before the start of the first module in which the student is scheduled to begin attendance. Also, if you post a credit to a student's account before the earliest date permitted by regulation, the date the FSA funds are considered to be disbursed is the earliest date permitted by regulation.Chapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, & Disbursements HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Retroactive disbursements for completed periods Your school must pay a student retroactively for any completed payment periods within the award year if the student was eligible for payment in those periods. Thus, in the case of a Pell Grant, if you don't receive a valid SAR/ ISIR for a student until the spring term, but the student was also enrolled and eligible for a disbursement in the previous fall term, that student must be paid retroactively for the fall term. If you are paying a Pell or TEACH G rant for a completed ter m in the same award year in which no disbursement has been made, the grant must be based on the hours completed by the student for that term . If the student had enrolled full time at the beginning of the fall term but dropped to half-time status by the end of the term, the retroactive disbursement must be based on half-time status. At a term school, all completed coursework counts toward enrollment status, including earned F's and incompletes that have not converted to \"F\" grades because the student failed to complete the coursework. For Direct Loans, an eligible student may receive loans for all payment periods within the loan period, unless the student was ineligible for the prior payment period due to failure to meet SAP standards, in which case the student may not receive Direct Loan funds for the prior period(s) in which they did not meet SAP requirements. If one or more payment period have elapsed before you make a loan disbursement, you may include loan proceeds for a completed payment period if the student completed at least a half-time course-load in that period . For instance , you could include the Fall term and its costs when originating a loan for the student in the Spring, if your school's half-time standard is 6 credit-hours and the student received a \"B\" and an incomplete in two 3-hour courses taken that fall. In the case of loans disbursed on a payment period basis, if a student attended the previous payment period but did not maintain eligibility for a Direct Loan, you may not include the previous payment period or its costs in the loan period. A school can make the retroactive disbursements in one lump sum. Retroactive disbursements For more on methods of disbursement to students/parents, see Volume 4 . Prior year charges allowance 34 CFR 668.164(c)(3) You may include up to $200 for prior-year charges in one or more payment periods in the current award year ($200 total, not in each payment period in the current award year). This $200 allowance must only be for tuition, fees, school-provided room & board, and, with the student's or parent's authorization, educationally related goods and services provided by the prior-year school.Volume 3\u2014Calculating CFR Acronyms Multiple loan disbursements within a payment period A school may schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period, as long as the disbursements in a loan period are substantially equal. However, for non-term and clock-hour programs, a school may not elect to have more than two payment periods per loan. Schools that use payment periods as the basis for their Return of Funds calculations should note that making multiple disbursements within a payment period does not create a new or additional payment period. See Volume 5 of the FSA Handbook to see how withdrawal calculations handle multiple disbursements.Multiple disbursements within a payment period FSA regulations generally permit schools to pay FSA funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students' needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. Also bear in mind that FSA funds must be provided to students in a timely manner to best assist them in paying their educational expenses. Consequently, a school may not delay the disbursement of funds until after the 60% point, for example, to avoid performing a Return of Title IV Funds calculation and the requirements that go along with it, or to prevent the student from having to return funds upon withdrawal. TIMING OF FSA GRANT DISBURSEMENTS Disburse ments in credit-hour term-based programs As noted earlier, for a student enrolled in a credit-hour program that uses any type of academic term, for Pell, TEACH, and FSEOG funds, the payment period is the academic term. Under the advance payment met hod, actual disbursement information can be submitted no earlier than 7 calendar days prior to the disbursement date. Disbursements in clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs For clock-hour programs and non-term credit-hour programs, a student can receive the first disbursement of FSA grant funds when the student begins the program or academic year. The student becomes eligible to receive a disbursement of FSA grant funds for the second payment period when the student successfully completes half of the weeks of instructional time AND half of the credit-hours/clock-hours in the academic year or program or the remaining portion of a program that is more than one-half of an academic year but less than a full academic year. Timing of grant disbursements within a payment period You may time the disbursement of Pell and TEACH Grant funds for a payment period to best meet the needs of students at your school. For instance, some schools credit the student accounts for school charges as soon as is permissible, and then pay the credit balance to students when they begin classes. Other schools wait until the end of the add/drop period to disburse funds, or pay students in monthly installments to help meet living expenses throughout the payment period. (If, as opposed to making multiple disbursements within the payment period, your school rations disbursements to students by crediting the entire disbursement for the payment period to the student's account and making periodic disbursements to the student from these funds, you must have the student's voluntary written authorization.) FSEOG disbursements Payment CFR 676.16(a) Uneven costs/uneven payments: 676.16(b)Chapter FSEOG A school that is awarding an FSEOG for a full academic year must disburse a portion of the grant or loan during each payment period. In general, to determine the amount of each disbursement, a school will divide this award amount by the number of payment periods the student will attend. However, if the student incurs uneven costs or receives uneven resources during the year and needs extra funds in a particular payment period, your school may disburse the additional FSEOG amounts to the student in whatever manner best meets the student's needs. Timely Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant reporting With the addition of Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) monitoring, it is important to submit Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant disbursement information in a timely manner. You must submit Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant disbursement information to COD no later than 15 calendar days after making a disbursement or adjustment. To ensure you and other schools have the most accurate information available about students' LEUs, you should submit information to COD as early as possible in the required 15 day time frame. Doing so may help prevent an overaward. Failure to submit the data in the 15 days could result in the Department disallowing the disbursement. Submitting disbursement records A school must submit disbursement records to the COD system no later than 15 days after making a Pell or Direct Loan disbursement. Books and supplies Pell disbursement 34 CFR 668.164(m) You must provide a means by which a Pell recipient can obtain or purchase, by the seventh day of a payment period, books and supplies for the payment period (assuming the student has a credit balance to be disbursed). Timely FSA Grant reporting Federal Register Feb 28. 2013 Electronic Announcement Mar 15, 2013Volume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & CFR Acronyms Disbursements exceeding 50 percent of award If you use Formula 3 to calculate a Pell or TEACH Grant , the student's total payment for a payment period may exceed 50 percent of the student's annual award. However, the disbursements of the student's Pell or TEACH Grant in the payment period cannot exceed 50 percent of the student's annual award until the student completes, in the payment period, at least half of the weeks of instructional time in the academic year. Therefore, you generally must make at least two disbursements to the student in the payment period. You may not withhold funds as an administrative convenience if you wish to make a single disbursement. INTERIM DISBURSEMENTS Under certain limited circumstances, you may make interim disbursements to students. If you have no reason to believe that an applicant's FAFSA information is incorrect, prior to verification , you may do the following: 1. Make one Pell or FSEOG disbursement for the applicant's first payment period; 2. For FWS, employ or allow another entity to employ the applicant, once he or she is an eligible student, for the first 60 consecutive days after the student's enrollment in the award year; or 3. Originate a Direct Subsidized Loan, but not disburse loan funds . If, after verification, and ensuring that you've addressed any corrections (in accordance with the regulation on the consequences of changes in FAFSA data, 34 CFR 668.59), none of the changes to the applicant's FAFSA data will result in a change in the amount he is eligible to receive under any Title IV program, you may take any of the three actions noted above, as well as disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan prior to receiving the corrected valid SAR or ISIR. Timing of correspondence program disbursements for Pell and TEACH Grants Pell: 34 CFR 690.66 TEACH: 34 CFR 686.25 For non-term correspondence programs, you make the first disbursement to a student after the student completes 25 percent of the lessons or otherwise completes 25 percent of the work scheduled for the program or academic year, whichever occurs last. You make the second disbursement to a student after the student completes 75 percent of the lessons or otherwise completes 75 percent of the work scheduled for the program or academic year. For term-based correspondence programs, you make the first disbursement to a student for each payment period after the student completes 50 percent of the lessons or otherwise completes 50 percent of the work scheduled for the term, whichever occurs last.

Nonstandard terms are substantially equal if no term in the loan period is more than 2 weeks of instructional time longer than any other term in that loan period. For more detail on SE9W terms, see Chapter 5 of this volume. Disbursements that include funds for completed payment periods 34 CFR 685.303(b)(4) The regulations allow a school to include in a single disbursement the disbursements for any payment periods that have ended. However, the COD system (except for schools exempted because of low default rates) requires schools to enter at least two anticipated disbursement dates. Therefore, when creating a loan origination record for a Direct Loan when you intend to include disbursements for any payment periods that have ended in a single disbursement, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all disbursements that would be included. For example, consider a school attempting to submit an origination when the data is as follows: Loan period: 9/1/15 - 5/30/16 Number of 2 period 1: 9/1/15 - 12/20/15 Payment period 2: 1/6/16 - 5/30/16 Date school creates origination record: 1/9/16 If you anticipate making the single required disbursement on January 16, you should enter January 16 as the date for both the first and second disbursements when you create the origination record.DIRECT LOAN DISBURSEMENTS Standard terms and substantially equal nonstandard terms at least nine weeks in length (SE9W) If the program uses standard academic terms (semesters, trimesters, or quarters) or it has nonstandard terms of substantially equal length, at least one disbursement must be made in each term in the loan period. A program is considered to have substantially equal terms if no term in the program is more than two weeks of instructional time longer than any other term in the program. If there is more than one term in the loan period , the loan must be disbursed over all terms of the loan period. For example, if a loan period is for an academic year that includes three quarters, the loan must be disbursed in three substantially equal disbursements. If there is only one term in the loan period, the loan generally must be disbursed in two payments. In a credit-hour program that uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or is \"SE9W,\" (see sidebar) the second disbursement may not be made until the student reaches the calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days of class of the loan period. Volume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-28 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Low cohort default rate exemptions Section 428 G (a)(3) and (b)(1) of the HEA, Direct Loans 34 CFR 685.303(d)(6) Single disbursements for study-abroad students 34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(B) If a borrower is enrolled in a study-abroad program approved for credit by the home school and the home school had a cohort default rate less than 5% in the single most recent fiscal year for which data are available, the school may make a single disbursement of the loan proceeds. Also see the Cohort Default Rate Guide on IFAP .Clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and programs with non-standard terms that are not substantially equal If the program is one academic year or shorter, the loan period is usually the length of the program. (For more information on non-term loan periods, see Chapter 5 .) If the program is longer than an academic year, there will usually be another loan period for any subsequent academic year or remaining portion of an academic year. For each loan period in these programs: The loan must be disbursed in at least two substantially equal amounts, with the first disbursement generally disbursed at or near the beginning of the loan period; and For a program less than an academic year in length, the second half of the loan proceeds may not be disbursed until the student has successfully completed half of the coursework and half of the weeks of instructional time in the loan period. For a program of an academic year or greater in length, the second disbursement may be made when half of the hours and weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year are successfully completed. The payment period for the remainder of a program less than or equal to one-half of an academic year is the remainder of the program. When a Direct Loan is made for one payment period, the loan must be disbursed in two installments, and the second installment may not be disbursed until the student has successfully completed half the number of credit or clock-hours and half the weeks of instructional time in the payment period. Exceptions to disbursement rules for schools with low default rates Schools with cohort default rates of less than 15 percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available, including eligible foreign schools, may disburse, in a single installment, loans that are made for one semester, one trimester, one quarter, or a four-month period. Such schools also are not required to delay the delivery or disbursement of a first disbursement of a loan for 30 days for first-time, first-year undergraduate borrowers. You may pay a student in an eligible study-abroad program in one disbursement, regardless of the length of the loan perio d, if your school's most recently calculated cohort default rate is less than 5 percent for the single most recent fiscal year for which data are available. Chapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, & Disbursements 3-29 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms When a school that qualifies for the cohort default rate exemption offers: terms not substantially equal in length; non-term credit-hour programs; or clock-hour programs; the payment period, for purposes of Direct Loan funds, is the portion of the program to which the cohort default rate exemption applies. For example, if the loan period for a non-term credit-hour program is three months in length and the institution meets the cohort default rate exemption, the three- month loan period is the payment period, and only one disbursement of the loan is required for that period. When a student fails to begin attendance or attends less than half-time after receiving a Direct Loan disbursement Although you may be able to make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan before the student begins attending classes (as described above), in order to remain eligible for a Direct Loan, the student must actually begin attendance, on at least a half-time basis, in the period of enrollment (i.e., the loan period) for which the loan was intended. If the student doesn't attend at least half-time, or doesn't begin attendance in any classes, they will lose eligibility for the loan, and you must take some further steps. In either case, you must report the change in the student's enrollment status using NSLDS enrollment reporting. The student's loan servicer will then change the student's loan status from in-school to grace period, or from an in-school deferment to repayment status. If the student fails to begin attendance in any classes in the loan period, you must return any Direct Loan funds that were applied to the student's account, as well as the amount of any payments made for the payment period by the student (or on behalf of the student) to the school, up to the amount of the loan funds disbursed. Submit a downward adjustment to the loan amount through the COD system; you may be able to disburse the funds to another student rather than returning the funds, since Direct Loan funds are not student-specific. If you actually need to return funds, this must be done through G5. You must not return Direct Loan funds to the federal loan servicer in this circumstance. You must also notify the federal loan servicer that the student has not or will not begin attendance. The servicer then will issue a final demand letter to the student for any funds disbursed directly to the student. If the student who has already received Direct Loan funds begins attendance in the loan period, but does so on a less-than-half-time basis, the student becomes ineligible for the loan, and you must not make any further disbursements of the loan, unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis, but neither your school nor the student is required to return any loan proceeds.Failing to begin attendance & Direct Loan eligibility DCL GEN-13-02 34 CFR DCL CFR Acronyms Early disbursement & advance credit to account Aug 25Aug 2 Aug 15 $ $ Dec 21 The earliest a school may disburse funds is 10 calendar days before the first day of class in the semester (August 15 is the example). If you post a credit to a student's account before the earliest date permitted by regulation (August 2nd vs. August 15 in the example), for FSA purposes, the date the aid is considered to be disbursed is the earliest date permitted by regulation: August 15.Aug 15: School disburses funds 10 days before 1st day of classes.Aug 2: School posts credit to student's account. When a student is attending a modular program, but won't attend the first module, the date when classes begin for making disbursements is the starting date of the first module that the student will actually attend. The earliest the school can pay a student who is scheduled to begin attendance in the second of three 5-week modules that make up the payment period is 10 days before the first day of the second module (or 30 days after the second module begins, if the student is a first-time, first-year borrower and the school does not meet the requirements for a waiver in 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5)). Module Example: A 1-year program with no terms awards 24 credit-hours, which are taught in a series of six 4-hour modules. The school groups the modules into two 12-hour payment periods. The first payment period takes 15 weeks to complete. The student cannot progress to the second payment period until the student successfully completes 12 credit-hours and the 15 weeks of instruction have elapsed. If the student fails the first 4-hour module, he or she will still need to successfully complete three modules (for a total of 12 credits) to progress to the next payment period.Disbursement rules for terms made up of modulesChapter 1 \u2014 Academic Calendar, Payment Periods, & Disbursements HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms RETAKING COURSEWORK IN TERM PROGRAMS You may count toward enrollment status and award Title IV funds to a student who is repeating, for the first time only (i.e., one repetition per class), a previously passed course in a term-based program, including when the student is retaking a passed class due to failing other associated coursework. Students enrolled in non-term-based programs may not receive credit for retaking coursework. The regulatory definition for full-time enrollment status has been revised to allow a student to retake (one time only per previously passed course), any previously passed course. For this purpose, passed means any grade higher than an \"F,\" regardless of any school or program policy requiring a higher qualitative grade or measure to have been considered to have passed the course. This retaken class may be counted toward a student's enrollment status and the student may be awarded Title IV aid for the enrollment status based on inclusion of the class. A student may be repeatedly paid for repeatedly failing the same course (normal SAP policy still applies to such cases). If a student withdraws before completing the course that they are being paid Title IV funds for retaking, then that is not counted as their one allowed retake for that course. However, if a student passed a class once and then is repaid for retaking it and fails the second time, that failure counts as their paid retake and the student may not be paid for retaking the class a third time. If your school has a policy that requires students to retake all of the coursework for a term in which a student fails a course, any courses retaken that were previously passed in this case will not be eligible for Title IV aid. If a student who received an incomplete in a course in the prior term is completing the coursework in the subsequent term to erase the incomplete in the prior term, the student is not considered to be enrolled in the course for the subsequent term. Therefore, the hours in the course do not count toward the student's enrollment status for the subsequent term, and the student may not receive FSA funds for completing the course. However, if a student who received an incomplete in a course in the prior term is retaking the entire course for credit in the subsequent term, the hours in the course count toward the student's enrollment status, and the student may receive FSA funds for retaking the course. In any case, remember that retaken classes may count against satisfactory academic progress, and the student's eligibility is still constrained by all the requirements of satisfactory academic progress, as discussed in Chapter 1 of Volume 1 of the FSA Handbook. Also, the one-year academic limitation on noncredit and reduced credit remedial coursework still applies. So, for example, a student repeating a remedial course that exceeds the one-year limitation could not have the class included in his or her enrollment status. Satisfactory progress & repeated coursework For satisfactory academic progress purposes, each time a course is taken counts as an attempt; but only the first time a passing grade is received is it counted as completion.Repeating after program completion Any student who completes an entire non- term credit-hour or clock-hour program, and later re-enrolls to take that same program again or to take another program, may be paid for repeating coursework regardless of the amount of time between completion of the first program and beginning the program or another program again. Enrollment status and retaking coursework provisions and limitations 34 CFR 668.2(b) 34 CFR 668.20(d),(f) Retaking coursework school policy and operations Your school may establish a policy that permits or bars students from retaking previously passed coursework, for example, to improve grade point average. Based on such policies, the applicable guidance in the FSA Handbook and regulations can be used to determine how to award Title IV aid. You may wish to consult with your school's registrar to ensure that your school's class repetition policy is properly coordinated and implemented by both offices, including any changes that need to be made to the registrar's policies and operations for enrolling students or reporting enrollment to NSLDS.Volume 3\u2014Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-32 FSA HB CFR Acronyms TRANSFER, RE-ENTRY, & REPEATING COURSEWORK WHEN PROGRESS IS NOT TRACKED BY TERMS Re-entry within 180 days A student who withdraws from a clock-hour or credit-hour non-term program and then re-enters within 180 days is considered to remain in the same payment period when he or she returns and, subject to conditions imposed by ED, is eligible to receive FSA funds for which he or she was eligible prior to withdrawal, including funds that were returned under the R2T4 rules in Volume 5, Chapter 2 . Re-entry after 180 days and transfer students Generally, you must calculate new payment periods for a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program for: A student who withdraws and then re-enters the same program at the same school after 180 days; or A student who withdraws from a program and enrolls in a new program at your school, or at another school within any time period . For purposes of calculating payment periods ONLY , the length of the program is the number of credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time the student has remaining in the program that he or she re-enters or transfers into. If the remaining hours and weeks constitute half of an academic year or less, the remaining hours constitute one payment period. In this circumstance, the student may be paid for repeating coursework if the student is receiving credit for repeating the course. However, you may consider a student who transfers from one program to another at your school to remain in the same payment period if all of the following conditions apply: The student is continuously enrolled at your school; The coursework in the payment period the student is transferring out of is substantially similar to the coursework the student will be taking in the program into which he/she is transferring; The payment periods are substantially equal in length in weeks of instruction and credit or clock-hours; There are little or no changes in school charges associated with the payment period; and The credits from the payment period the student is transferring out of are accepted for credit in the new program.Pell Grant disbursements for re- entering students For Pell and TEACH Grant disbursements in the award year, if a student enrolled in a clock- hour or non-term credit-hour educational program re-enters the program within 180 days after initially withdrawing and before the deadline for the award year, a school may request administrative relief to disburse the student's grant by the earlier of 15 days after the student re-enrolls or the deadline for the award year published in the Federal Register. Re-entry within and after 180 days 34 CFR 668.4(f),(g)Transfer students 34 CFR 685.301 DCL GEN-12-06, to credit-hour conversion formula 34 CFR 668.8(k),(l) In determining the eligibility for and amount of Title IV aid for a student in a program subject to the clock-hour to credit-hour conversion, you must first apply the conversion formula to determine the number of semester, trimester, or quarter hours required to be considered a Title IV eligible program. You must also apply the conversion formula to each course in the payment period when determining a student's Title IV enrollment status. When applying the conversion formula, any eligible converted credit-hours are used to determine the amount of Title IV funds that a student enrolled in the program is eligible to receive. For a full discussion of credit-hour to clock- hour conversion, including when the conversion must be done, see Volume 2 , Chapter 2 . CHAPTER23-33 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Unlike scholarship programs that may award funds based on academic merit or the student's field of study, \"need-based\" grants, loans, and work- study are based on the family's demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of establishing a student's financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the TEACH Grant, Campus-Based Programs, and Direct/ Direct PLUS Loans, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation. ALLOWABLE COSTS The cost of attendance for a student is an estimate of that student's educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you'll see, you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than actual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time students instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs for different categories of students, such as a cost of attendance for out-of-state students (who have higher tuition) and a lower cost of attendance for in-state students. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each separate enrollment status and award aid to a student on the basis of the average COA. Students must be awarded on the basis of a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload. If a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student's cost or use a standard cost that you've established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost categories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories. There are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students: periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various student cohorts.Cost of Attendance (Budget) Awards for each of the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs are based on some form of financial need, beginning with cost of attendance. This chapter picks up at the point where you have established the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC); see the Application and Verification Guide for more info on EFCs, and Volume 1 for more info on the student's basic eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these cost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that you establish for your students will be used to calculate their FSA award amounts and package their aid. CHAPTER 2 HIGHLIGHTS Allowable Costs Determined by school, taking into account: Tuition and fees Books, supplies, transportation, personal, miscellaneous Room and board Dependent care Study-abroad expenses Disability expenses Employment expenses for co-op study Loan fees Exceptions Less-than-half-time enrollment Correspondence study Incarcerated students Professional judgment Costs met from other sources Tuition and fees not paid by student Free room and board Other cost specified by source Costs for period of enrollment Campus-Based, TEACH Grants, and Direct/Direct PLUS Loans are based on costs for the period of enrollment; for instance, costs for a student attending a single semester in the school year would be limited to the costs for that time period. Pell is always based on the cost of full- time attendance for a full academic year.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-34 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Allowable costs in general The types of costs that may be included are the same for all FSA programs. The cost of attendance, based on the student's enrollment status, for the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct/Direct PLUS Loan programs is a student's cost for the period for which the aid is intended. The cost of attendance used for Pell Grants and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are part-time in a term program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. We'll discuss this at the end of this chapter. A student's cost of attendance is the sum of the following. If a cost is not mentioned in these categories (which are derived from the only source on COA components, Section 472 of the HEA), it is not to be included as COA: The tuition and fees normally assessed for a student carrying the same academic workload. This includes graduation fees, if incurred while the student is still enrolled and when required by the program and paid by all students, and costs of rental or purchase of equipment (including equipment for instruction by telecommunications), materials, or supplies required of all students in the same course of study. An allowance for books and supplies may be included in tuition and fees for a program if you: Have an arrangement with a book publisher or other entity which allows you to make the books and/or supplies available to the stu - dents below competitive market rates; and You provide a way for students to obtain the books & supplies by the seventh day of the payment period. You must also have a policy under which students may opt out of this way of providing books and supplies. OR Y ou document that: The books or supplies, including digital or electronic course mate - rials are not currently available elsewhere or accessible by students enrolled in that program from sources other than those provided or authorized by your school; or There is a compelling health or safety reason for books and sup - plies to be included in the tuition and fees COA component. An allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. This can include a reasonable amount, as determined by your school, for the documented rental or purchase of a personal computer that the student will use for study for the enrollment period. For example, a computer purchased in the Cost of attendance components The cost of attendance (COA) is determined by law (Higher Education Act, Sec. 472) and is not subject to regulation by the Department. The law specifies the types of costs that are included in the cost of attendance, but you must determine the appropriate and reasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for students at your school, based on the criteria described in this chapter. Documentation of exceptional expenses The law doesn't specify what documentation you must collect for expenses such as dependent care or disability-related expenses. You can document these expenses in any reasonable way, such as documenting an interview with the student or obtaining a written statement from the student or other appropriate sources.Less than half-time COA components For students who are less than half-time, COA can include only: Tuition and fees; An allowance for books and supplies; Transportation (but not miscellaneous & personal expenses); An allowance for dependent-care expenses; and Room and board for a limited duration (see less-than-half-time room and board component later in the allowable costs section). Books and supplies timing 34 CFR 668.164(m) For all eligible students who could receive Title IV funds 10 days before the beginning of a payment period, you must, by the seventh day of the payment period, provide a way for eligible students to obtain or purchase the books and supplies applicable to the payment period. For more on the timing of disbursements, see Volume 4 . Books and supplies in tuition & fees 34 CFR 668.164(c)(2) Books & supplies may be counted as a COA component as part of tuition and fees for a program under the conditions described in the body text.Chapter 2 \u2014 Cost of Attendance (Budget) 3-35 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms summer for use in the fall term may be included. This allowance may also include costs for operating and maintaining a vehicle that is used to transport the student to and from school, but not for the purchase of a vehicle. An allowance for room and board. For all students, schools must include in their \"cost of attendance\" an allowance for room and board. For students residing in institutionally owned or operated housing, the allowance should be based on the amount normally assessed most of the school's institutionally-housed residents for room and board. For all other students, the allowance should be based on the expenses reasonably incurred by each type of students for room and board. For a student with dependents, an allowance for costs expected to be incurred for dependent care . This covers care during periods that include but are not limited to class time, study time, field work, internships, and commuting time for the student. The amount of the allowance should be based on the number and age of such dependents and should not exceed reasonable cost in the community for the type of care provided. An allowance for the one-time direct costs of obtaining a first professional license or certificate for students who are enrolled in a program that requires such professional licensure or certification. This allowance may only be provided one time per student per eligible academic program. Examples of allowable costs include fees charged to take a licensing exam, costs of applying for and obtaining the license or certification, and, at the discretion of the school, costs incurred in traveling to a residency interview for a medical student. Under this provision, the costs must be incurred during (not after) a period of enrollment, even if the exam is after the end of the period. Y ou may include costs of attending a required conference, but only if these costs are included in the standard cost of the program for which the conference is required. Including these costs does not require exercising professional judgment, as they will be included as a cost of the program for all students in the program. For study-abroad programs approved for credit by the student's home institution, reasonable costs associated with such study. For example, U.S. citizens may count VISA/passsport costs when studying at a foreign school. For a student with a disability, an allowance for expenses related to the student's disability. These expenses include special services, personal assistance, transportation, equipment, and supplies that are reasonably incurred and not provided by other agencies. For students engaged in a work experience through a cooperative education program, an allowance for reasonable costs associated with such employment. For students receiving loans, the fees required to receive them (for example, the loan fee for a Direct Loan). Y ou may also include the fees required for non-federal student loans (i.e., non-federal loans that must be considered Estimated Financial Assistance [EFA] for the student when packaging aid). In all cases, you can either use the Free room and board/tuition waivers Dawson University saves some of its Resident Assistant jobs for students with exceptional financial need. All Resident Assistants receive a waiver of room and board charges. If the student quits the job, the waiver is removed, and the student has to pay the room and board charges. All the students have the room and board charges in their cost of attendance. For students who are Resident Assistants because of their financial need, Dawson must count the room and board waiver as estimated financial assistance. The waiver would not be counted as untaxed income, but if included in the AGI, such a waiver would be reported as \"grant and scholarship aid reported to the IRS\" and would be excluded from total income in the EFC formula.Checking foreign diplomas If you hire a transcription/diploma evaluation service to aid in the process of determining student eligibility, the cost of evaluating a foreign credential must be incurred as a charge of admission prior to enrollment in an eligible program and thus cannot be included in COA. For more detail on checking foreign diplomas, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 . Student with a disability A student is considered to have a disability if he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as if the student is deaf, has a mental disability, is hard of hearing, has a speech or language impairment, is visually disabled, is seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically impaired, autistic, has a traumatic brain injury, is otherwise health-impaired, or has specific learning disabilities that require special education and related services.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-36 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms exact loan fees charged to the student or an average of fees charged to borrowers of the same type of loan at your school. To be included in the COA, any loan fees for private loans must be charged to the borrower during the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended. For less-than-half-time students, room and board for a limited duration . Schools have the option to include in the COA for a less- than-half-time student an allowance for room and board for up to three semesters (or equivalent), with no more than two of the semesters being consecutive at any one school. Y ou are not required to monitor COA components from other schools attended by the student. For students living in housing located on a military base or housing for which they receive a military housing allowance (Basic Allowance for Housing, or \"BAH\"), the room and board COA component shall include an allowance for board only. This applies to: Independent students who receive, or whose spouses receive, a military housing allowance (BAH) or who live on a military base; and Dependent students who are living with parents who are receiving a military housing allowance (BAH) or who live on a military base. Exceptions to the normal cost allowances The following are the exceptions to the normal cost of attendance allowances: For students who are enrolled less than half-time, only the costs for tuition and fees and allowances for books and supplies, transportation, room and board for a limited duration, and dependent care expenses may be included as part of the cost of attendance (miscellaneous expenses and personal expenses may not be included). Generally, the cost of attendance for correspondence study is restricted to tuition and fees, which often include books and supplies. If the costs of books and supplies are separate, then they may also be counted in the cost of attendance. If the student is fulfilling a required period of residential training, the cost of attendance can also include required books and supplies, an allowance for travel, and room-and- board costs specifically incurred for the period of residential training (as mentioned in Chapter 1 of Volume 1, a student isn't eligible to receive FSA aid for correspondence courses unless the student is enrolled in an associate, bachelor's, or graduate-degree program). The cost of attendance for incarcerated students is limited to tuition and fees and required books and supplies. Remember that an incarcerated student is ineligible for Title IV loans, and if the student is in a federal or state penal institution, the student is ineligible for Pell Grants as well. When a student does not take any classes for a period of time in the Treatment of Estimated Financial Assistance component of COA HEA Sec. 480(j) DCL GEN 06-05 If the source of assistance is a state and is designated by the state to offset a specific component of the student's COA, the amount of that assistance may be excluded from both COA and EFA. You may exclude such assistance on a student-by-student basis, but if it is excluded, it must be excluded for both COA and EFA. If the amount excluded is less than the allowance provided in the student's COA, you must exclude the lesser amount. Changes in Pell Grant COA For more on when changes in Pell COA necessitate a recalculation of a Pell award, see Volume 3, Chapter 3 . COA for intersessions and modules Whether or not you merge an intersession or module with a standard term, you must not include costs in a student's COA for an intersession or module period of enrollment for which the student is not expected to be enrolled. Limitations to tuition and fees COA component HEA Sec 472 COA includes tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload as determined by the institution. 34 CFR 668.14(b)(3) Prohibits requesting or charging any student a fee for processing or handling any application, form, or data required to determine eligibility for, and amount of, Title IV HEA program assistance. 34 CFR 668.14(b)(21) Prohibits imposing a penalty on any student because of a student's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the school as a result of the delayed disbursement of the proceeds of a Title IV loan due to compliance with Title IV requirements.Chapter 2 \u2014 Cost of Attendance (Budget) 3-37 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms middle of a term, for example, by skipping a module in a multi- module term, you may not include in the student's COA costs (if any) for such a period, even if they are studying for tests or coursework related to an eligible program. Note that the costs of such a test itself may be an allowable COA component\u2014see \" An allowance for the one-time direct costs of obtaining a first professional license or certificate... \" section above . The weeks that comprise the non- coursework period may not count toward the weeks of instructional time for the term or program, and any separate credits earned (if any) during such a period do not count towards a student's enrollment status. For more detail on Title IV leaves of absence, see Chapter 1 of Volume 5 of the FSA Handbook. Y ou have the authority to use professional judgment to adjust the cost of attendance on a case-by-case basis to allow for special circumstances. Such adjustments must be documented in the student's file. (See \"Professional Judgment\" in the Application and Verification Guide. ) Limitations to tuition and fees component Tuition discounting: In establishing the tuition and fees component of Title IV applicants, you must use an amount that is required for all students in the same course of study. Therefore, a recipient of Title IV aid cannot be assessed charges that are higher than what is charged to a student not receiving aid under the Title IV programs. Offering a discount to students who pay early is not permitted because Title IV recipients may not be able to, and should not be required to, meet that requirement and would, therefore, in effect be assessed higher amounts than other students. Of course, it would be permissible for you to provide the discount to all Title IV eligible students without regard to when their charges are paid. However, doing so would require an adjustment to such students' cost of attendance. Overtime charges: A school may not use Title IV funds to pay overtime charges for a student who fails to complete his or her academic program within the normal time frame. Section 472 of the HEA defines cost of attendance as the tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload required of all students in the same course of study. Overtime charges are in addition to normal tuition and fees, and since they are not charges normally assessed, they may not be included in a student's cost of attendance for Title IV purposes, and therefore Title IV funds may not be used to pay charges, even if a school obtains a student's (or parent's) authorization to do so. This restriction applies to both clock-hour and credit-hour programs. For example, some clock-hour programs assess \"overtime charges\" for students who don't complete the program within an established timeframe. Some credit-hour programs also charge additional tuition or fees for each course a student takes if the student fails to complete his/her program(s) within an established time-frame. In both cases, such charges may not be counted in the Title IV COA, and Title IV funds may not be used to pay for the additional charges.Cost of attendance for a distance education student The law prohibits you from making a distinction based on the mode of instruction when determining the cost of attendance for a student receiving all or part of the student's instruction through distance education. However, you have the authority to use professional judgment to adjust the cost of attendance on a case-by-case basis to allow for special circumstances. For example, you may exclude transportation costs if you determine that such costs will not be incurred by a student. Such adjustments must be documented in the student's file. (See \"Professional Judgment\" in the Application and Verification Guide .) Costs for programs that become eligible in the middle of a year When awarding aid, you may not count toward the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) any costs incurred in any payment period before the program gained Title IV eligibility, nor any costs incurred in periods that the student has already completed. For more details on how programs gain Title IV eligibility, see Volume 2, Chapter 5 of the FSA Handbook . NCAA Considerations and recent changes The \"Power Five\" conferences* of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) have voted to expand their athletic scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance for athletes. Previously, only the components listed under \"Allowable costs in general\" in this chapter were included in COA. This change only applies to the colleges in the Power Five, but may also be adopted by other Division I participating schools, at their discretion. One exception to the full cost COA is the practice of a school's paying the costs of an athlete's insurance against injury to protect against loss of future income. This expense may not be included in COA (because it is not related to a student's educational program), but it is included as Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) for the student in the aid packaging process. For packaging guidance, see Chapter 7 of this volume. *The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac 12, and SECVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-38 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Pell Grant awards & COA with mixed enrollment status Ryne plans to attend Maddon University for a fall and spring semester. In the fall term, Ryne attends full-time, and has a COA of 5300 and an EFC of 0. Ryne's Scheduled Award is taken from the full-time Pell Grant Payment Schedule for the fall semester, with the calculated amount being $5,350. Maddon disburses the fall semester Pell award of $2,675. In the spring semester, Ryne suffers from a variety of physical ailments, and finds that he can only attend a fraction of the classes he had hoped to, and so his enrollment status drops to less-than-half time. Ryne's COA is also reduced, as less-than-half-time enrollment means that not all of his previously included COA elements may be included in his Spring COA used for Pell calculation. Ryne's EFC remains at 0. Maddon may not include in Ryne's spring COA for Pell calculation miscellaneous personal expenses or room and board if Ryne has exhausted his less-than-half-time room and board allowance (3 semesters or equivalent in total, no more than two of which may be consecutive at any one school). Maddon now consults the less-than-half-time Pell payment and disbursement schedule and finds the amount for an EFC of 0 and the reduced COA, 5000. The result is $1,263, which Maddon divides in half for the spring semester disbursement, resulting in a spring payment to Ryne of $631.50. These awards are also subject to the Pell Lifetime Eligibility Used limits (LEU). See Volume 3, Chapter 3 for information about Pell Grant recalculations and LEU limits.Finance charges: You may not use Title IV funds to pay finance charges or fees that are incurred because a student utilizes a financing method provided by the school to pay for educational expenses over time. Because students or families choose to incur these additional expenses rather than paying the balance due at registration, the additional charges are not considered educational expenses, and may not be included in a student's cost of attendance. Test prep class costs: You may not include in a student's COA the costs for a test prep class which is not part of the student's eligible program. Costs waived or paid by other sources When a specific component of a student's cost of attendance is waived or explicitly paid by another source, special treatment may be necessary. In some situations, the student is assessed the normal tuition and fees charge with an offsetting credit issued. In other situations, the student is never charged tuition and fees at all. Although this section discusses this concept in terms of tuition and fee charges, it applies to any of the components of a student's cost of attendance. In some cases, such as under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs, a student's tuition and fees are paid by another organization or are waived. The student's costs are based on what the school is actually charging the student, based on the agreement between the school and the student.Effects of waivers on COA If your school treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees that have actually been charged to a student, then the waiver is considered Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) and the full amount of the tuition and fees are included in a student's cost of attendance. For more details, see Chapter 7 of this volume. On the other hand, if the student is never assessed the full charges, the waiver is not considered to be financial aid, and only the charges actually assessed the student would be included in the student's cost of attendance. Payment plans Large Midwestern University (LMU) charges full-time students $10,000 per semester in tuition, payable either at registration, or, in a new alternative payment plan, over the course of the semester, in four payments of $2,600 each, for a total of $10,400. LMU may establish the alternate payment plan, but can't use Title IV funds to pay for any amount in excess of what it charges those students not paying via the alternate plan (in this case, $400). Chapter 2 \u2014 Cost of Attendance (Budget) 3-39 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Pell Grant cost of attendance for a consortium program A student receiving a Pell Grant for attendance at two schools through a consortium agreement may have costs from both schools at the same time. The student's cost of attendance is calculated in the same way as for a student taking classes at only one school. The student's charges for tuition and fees and books and supplies at the consortium schools have to be combined into a single charge for a full academic year for purposes of the Pell calculation. The school paying the student may choose to use actual charges for the student, which would simply be the sum of the actual charges at both schools. Of course, if the student isn't attending full-time, your school will have to prorate these tuition & fees and books & supplies charges so that they are the correct amounts for a full-time, full-year student. If the disbursing school uses average charges, then the average full-time charges at each of the schools must be prorated and combined. If the student is taking a full-time load at each school, the full-time tuition and fees charges for an academic year at each school can be averaged to determine the tuition and fee cost. However, if the student is taking an unequal course load, the disbursing school must prorate the charges based on the number of hours the student is taking at each school. If a student has a co-op job for the first term, the tuition and fees for that period can be prorated over the full academic year for the program (which must include at least 24 semester/trimester hours, 36 quarter credit-hours, or 900 clock-hours, as well as 30 weeks of instructional time, or, for clock-hour programs, 26 weeks). This prorated amount is then added to the other cost of attendance components to arrive at the total cost for a full-time student for a full academic year. For the rest of the year, your school can either use the cost of attendance with the projected amount or can recalculate the student's tuition and fees at the end of the first term to determine a new cost of attendance for the remaining payment periods. This decision must be consistent with your school's overall policy on recalculating for changes in a student's costs. (See the discussion of Pell Grant recalculations in Chapter 3 of this volume for more information.) Note that the cost of attendance can also include employment-related expenses. Pell Grant cost of attendance for a co-op program Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-40 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Pell Grant Cost Example 1: Prorating total costs by lesser of two fractions x $4,500 = $6,000You may take the student's entire cost of attendance (tuition and fees, room and board, etc.) and multiply it by the lesser of the two fractions that represent the length of the academic year. If the lesser fraction is one, then you don't prorate the cost of attendance. One fraction is based on credit or clock-hours and the other is based on weeks of instructional time, as shown in this example. Let's use the example of a program that charges $10,500, awards 18 semester credits, and is completed by most full-time students within 20 weeks of instructional time. Credit/clock-hours in academic year definition = 24 Credit/clock-hours awarded = 18 Since the fraction using credit-hours is the lesser fraction, the program cost of $10,500 is multiplied by 24/18 to find the full-year Pell cost. The full-time cost is $14,000. Note: If one of the fractions is equal to one, for instance, if the program awards 24 credit-hours, then the prorated cost is the same as the original cost of attendance. Pell Grant Cost Example 2: Prorating academic costs & living expenses separately As an alternative, you can separately prorate the costs associated with credit or clock-hours (tuition and fees, books and supplies, loan fees) and the costs associated with weeks of instructional time (room and board, miscellaneous expenses, disability expenses, transportation, dependent care, study abroad, reasonable costs associated with employment as part of a cooperative education program). Using our earlier example of a program lasting 20 weeks and awarding 18 credit-hours, and specifying that the student's tuition, books, supplies, etc., come to $4,500 and living expenses amount to $6,000, the calculation would look like this: 24 credit-hours 18 credit-hours 30 weeks 20 weeks In this example, the student's Pell budget is the sum of the two prorated costs, or $15,000.$10,500 x 24/18 = $14,000 Pell Grant Cost Example 3: Prorating costs for a non-term program longer than an academic year Costs must also be prorated if they are charged for a period longer than an academic year. You may use either of the proration methods shown in Examples 1 and 2. We'll use the example of a program awarding 1,000 clock-hours and providing 40 weeks of instructional time. Let's assume that the school uses the regulatory minimums in defining the academic year as 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks. The total costs over the 40 weeks, including tuition and living expenses, are $5,900. If we use the method in Example 1, this amount must be prorated by the lesser of the following two fractions: Credit/clock- hours in academic year definition = 900 Credit/clock-hours awarded = 1,000 The lesser of the two fractions is the one based on weeks (26/40). Multiply the total program cost by this fraction to determine the Pell costs for a full academic year: $5,900 x 26/40 = $3,835. Weeks in academic year definition = 30 Weeks provided = 20 Weeks in academic year definition = 26 Weeks provided = 40ORx $6,000 = $9,000Chapter 2 \u2014 Cost HB 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms WIOA Some WIOA contracts operate on a reimbursement basis; that is, the student must fulfill the terms of the contract before WIOA will reimburse the school for tuition and fee costs. If the student doesn't fulfill the terms of the contract, the school is left with an unpaid tuition and fees charge. The school isn't permitted to hold the student liable for the unpaid tuition and fees. Contracts are established this way to offer schools an incentive to properly train and place students enrolled in the training programs. However, if a tuition and fees charge is included in an FSA aid recipient's budget, the student would be liable for any outstanding charges that are not reimbursed by WIOA. Therefore, schools that enter into reimbursement contracts must remove the tuition and fees component from the FSA budget because, under these contracts, schools are prohibited from holding the student liable for outstanding charges.Alternate example of waived or paid COA component The state in which Montero University was founded charges all full-time students the same tuition charge. However, in-state students receive a voucher to cover the difference between what most states consider in-state versus out-of-state tuition. Montero has two options. The first option would allow Montero to include the same tuition charge in the full-time COA for all students and include the amount of the voucher as estimated financial assistance (EFA) in the respective students' financial aid packages. Alternatively, Montero could exclude the amount of the voucher from both COA and EFA because the voucher must be used to explicitly pay a specific component of the COA. Regardless of the option Montero chooses, it must apply the option consistently.If the student is charged for the tuition and fees, even if the charge is eventually paid by someone other than the student (e.g., a scholarship agency or other source of aid), then that tuition and fee amount is included in the cost of attendance in most circumstances (see sidebar on \"Alternate example of waived or paid COA component\"). The tuition and fees payment would then be counted as estimated financial assistance. The charge is documented in the same way as for any non-WIOA student\u2014for instance, in your school's contract with the student or in the agreement with the WIOA agency. (If your school charges the student for tuition and fees, your school would have to expect the student to pay the charge if the WIOA agency or other source of assistance doesn't pay on the student's behalf.) If the student is never charged for tuition and fees, then the cost of attendance wouldn't include the tuition and fees component. Some WIOA agreements with schools provide that the school can't charge the tuition and fees to the student, even if WIOA doesn't cover the costs. If your school is prohibited under such an agreement from charging tuition and fees to the student, then the tuition and fees aren't included in the student's cost of attendance, and, therefore, that amount would not be included as estimated financial assistance. Even if there's no tuition and fees component, the student's budget still includes the other costs listed previously, such as an allowance for living expenses. The option to either include the cost and aid in both COA and EFA versus excluding both from COA and EFA only applies to non-federal sources of assistance, and only when that assistance is designated to offset specific components of COA (i.e., tuition, room, and board). COSTS FOR PERIODS OTHER THAN NINE MONTHS The cost of attendance used to pa ckage Campus-Based aid and Direct/ Direct PLUS loans and TEACH covers the student's actual period of enrollment. T herefore, if the student will be attending for more than 9 months, you must use a higher cost of attendance that includes living expenses, such as room and board, for the longer period of time. If the student will be attending for less than 9 months, you must use a lower cost of attendance. You can choose to prorate the allowances you use for 9 months, or you can calculate the cost in any other reasonable way. When calculating for periods other than nine months, be sure to use the rules for the corresponding EFC type. There are three types of EFC for periods other than 9 months, each with their own treatment: EFC for dependent students; EFC for independent students without dependents other than a spouse; and EFC for independent students with dependents other than a spouse. For the full discussion of the treatment for these various EFC types, see Chapter 3 of the Application and Verification Guide (AVG) .Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-42 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms *If the student is in a category where costs are limited, such as less-than-half-time enrollment, those costs that are allowable must be based on costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. For instance, the tuition component of the Pell cost of attendance for a less-than-half-time student must be based on the tuition costs that would be incurred by a full-time student attending a full academic year. Costs for non 9 months example For Direct Loans, Campus-Based aid, and TEACH, the COA used for packaging must reflect the student's cost for that period that the student is actually enrolled. For instance, if a student is completing her program of study by taking a 1/2-time course load for the fall semester at your school, and that's the only term that she'll be attending in the award year, you could use the actual tuition and fee charges for the student's costs. If you use average costs for living expenses for a 9-month academic year for students in that program, you may divide your average costs by the number of terms in the academic year to find the cost for this enrollment period (assuming the terms are substantially equal in length). For Pell Grants, the full nine-month EFC must always be used regardless of the actual period of attendance of the student (see GEN-15-02). You could either use an average tuition cost for a full-time, full-year student in the program or prorate the student's actual tuition for the fall term to arrive at a full-year, full-time cost. Costs for living expenses may also be average costs for a full academic year\u2014if a full-year average cost is used, it doesn't have to be prorated for Pell Grant awards. Costs for full program charged at start A school may charge the total tuition cost for a program at the beginning of the first period of enrollment. If the program is longer than an academic year, for Direct/Direct PLUS Loans and Campus-Based aid, the tuition costs apply only to the first period of enrollment. For Pell, you must prorate these charges to reflect the academic year in accordance with the procedures outlined in Chapter 3.Adjusting costs for Pell Grants The types of costs included in the Pell Grant budget are the same as those for the other FSA programs; however, Pell Grant costs are always based on the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year . For Pell, costs for programs or enrollment periods longer or shorter than an academic year must be prorated so that they are the costs for one full academic year. This is true for both parts of the academic year definition: if either the number of weeks or the number of clock/credit-hours differs from the academic year standard, the costs must be prorated to determine the full-time, full-year Pell budget. The need to prorate Pell costs is most likely to occur in these situations: A term-based program that provides fewer weeks of instructional time than the minimum number of weeks of instructional time in an academic year; A non-term program that provides less than 24 semester hours, 36 quarter hours, or 900 clock hours and/or provides fewer weeks of instructional time than the minimum number of weeks of instructional time in an academic year; or A program that is longer than an academic year, where the costs for the entire program are charged at the beginning of the program. There are two ways to prorate Pell costs, as shown in the previous examples. Both of these examples are based on a program that is shorter than an academic year. The third example shows how costs are prorated when they are charged for a program that is longer than an academic year. Note that prorating the cost of attendance usually does not affect the amount of Pell Grant the student receives. However, you're required to report the full- time, full-year Pell budget when reporting disbursements to COD.*CHAPTER33-43 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary-Acronyms CFR DCL Pell Grant awards are based on the 9-month Expected Family Contribution (EFC) on the student's valid SAR or ISIR, the academic year structure (see Chapter 1 of this volume), and the cost of attendance for a full-time student for a full academic year (see Chapter 2 of this volume). The Scheduled Award amounts are specified on the Pell Grant payment schedules released by the Department. For term-based programs, awards for part-time students are also based on enrollment status, using the part-time charts in the Pell Grant payment schedules. In this chapter, we'll show you how to calculate Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant (IASG) payments for your students, using the appropriate formula for the term or non-term calendar.Calculating Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards SCHEDULED AWARD, AWARD YEAR, & ANNUAL AWARD The Scheduled Award is the maximum amount the student can receive during the award year, if he or she attends full-time for a full academic year. The award year begins on July 1 of one year and ends on June 30 of the next year. For example, the 2018-19 award year begins July 1, 2018, and ends June 30, 2019. The student's Scheduled Award is established by the Pell Grant payment schedule that the Department issues prior to the start of each award year. The amount of the Scheduled Award is always taken from the full-time payment schedule, and is based on the student's EFC and Cost of Attendance (COA). The annual award is the maximum amount a student would receive during a full academic year for a given enrollment status, EFC, and COA. Note that for a full-time student, the annual award will be the same as the Scheduled Award. At a term school, a part-time student will have an annual award that is less than the Scheduled Award. If the student attends part-time, the student's annual award is taken from the 3/4-time, 1/2-time, or less-than-1/2-time payment schedules. For instance, if a student's Scheduled Award is $6,095, but the student is enrolled as a 1/2-time student in a term program, the student's annual award would only be $3,047.50.

When rounding for a student expected to be enrolled for more than one payment period in the award year, alternate rounding up and down. The amount used to round (whether it be a dollar or penny) is usually carried forward to the next payment and applied before the rounding calculation is performed for that payment period, unless a different Pell award amount is calculated for the following term, for example, when a student's enrollment status, changes, in which case you may round up for two consecutive terms. Your policy on rounding must be applied equally to all students. Important: These rounding rules do not apply if the amount disbursed would exceed the student's Scheduled Award or place the student's LEU over 600%. For more on LEU for Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants, see \"Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU\" later in this chapter.Fractions When using fractions, be careful to multiply first, and then divide to avoid an incorrect result. For example, here's the correct way to prorate a $2,150 Scheduled Award for a payment period that is a nonstandard term of 10 weeks of instructional time, for a program that has 30 weeks of instructional time. $2,150 x is multiplied as = 716.67 In this case, if you divide the fraction to get a decimal (.333333...) and then round the decimal either down (.33) or up (.34), your calculation will result in a number that's too low (709.50) or too high (731).Ground rules for Pell Grants 2,150 x 10 30 10 30Minimum Pell Grant and LEU for 2018-19 HEOA Section 401(b)(4) DCL-GEN-18-04 The HEOA eliminated the $400 minimum award and instead set a new minimum award at 10 percent of the maximum award appropriated each year. Because midpoints are used for the EFC and COA columns in constructing the Pell payment schedules, the minimum Pell award for a full-time student is actually slightly higher than 10 percent of the maximum Pell award. Students who are eligible for less than $650 are not Pell eligible for 2018-19, unless the reason for their low Pell eligibility was truncation due to Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) limitations (for more on LEU, see the \"Pell & IASG LEU\" section later in this chapter). There is no de minimus award amount for purposes of determining a student's award because of the 600% LEU limitation. As such, even a student with a very small remaining LEU is eligible to receive the calculated amount of the Pell Grant, as long as the LEU is not exceeded. For example, a student with an EFC of 3750 and an LEU of 599.500% would be eligible for the remaining 0.500% which is $10.85, rounded to $11 (if your school only disburses in whole dollars, this amount must be rounded down to $10, because $11 would exceed the student's maximum LEU).Pell Grant payment schedules https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/wst.jsp DCL GEN-18-04 (Revised Pell Payment Schedules for 2018-19) E-Announcement May 10, 2018 (COD & CPS implementation of revised Pell Payment Schedules)Scheduled Award limit 34 CFR 690.63(g)NEW Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act HEA Sec 473, 42 U.S.C. 3796b E-Announcement November 19, 2018 Beginning with the 2018-19 award year, an otherwise Pell-eligible student whose parent or guardian died as a result of active service in the line of duty as a Public Safety Officer (defined under 42 U.S.C. 3796b, or a fire police officer) may receive the maximum Pell Grant and increased amounts of other federal student aid if the student was less than 24 years old when the parent or guardian died, or was enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of the parent or guardian's death. A school must use an EFC of 0 to package all federal student aid if the student meeting the above criteria has a Pell-eligible EFC. Note that the zero EFC is only used for packaging purposes; you do not actually change the student's calculated EFC. See Electronic Announcement, November 19, 2018 for more details on eligibility and treatment of the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship.Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-45 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR for Children of Soldiers: Zero EFC treatment or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant An otherwise Pell-eligible student whose parent or guardian died as a result of U.S. military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, may receive increased amounts of federal student aid if the student was less than 24 years old when the par - ent or guardian died, or was enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of the parent or guardian's death. There are two different provisions for eligible children of soldiers, depending on whether the student has an EFC that falls within the range for Pell Grant eligibility or not. Identification of eligible students and notification by ED: The Department will notify the student when a student appears to meet the criteria for Zero EFC treatment for children of soldiers or the Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, based on a match with a Department of Defense (DoD) file of eligible dependents. The match will be performed when a student submits a FAFSA or FAFSA correction (and periodically thereafter). When an eligible student is identified, ED will generate a Central Pro - cessing System (CPS) transaction for the student, and the resulting ISIR will include a \"DoD Match Flag, \" associated comment code 298, and the parent or guardian's date of death. Note that Zero EFC treatment under this provision will not force an auto-0 EFC; the EFC will be calculated based on the student's financial situation, but you must use the flag and date of the parent or guardian's death, along with the student's calculated EFC, to determine if the student is eligible for Zero EFC treatment for children of soldiers, or an award under the Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant program. ED will also send a letter to each matched student that informs the student of his or her possible increase in eligibility for FSA funds. The letter advises the student to contact his or her financial aid administrator for more information. Zero EFC treatment for children of soldiers A school must use an EFC of 0 to package all federal student aid if the student meeting the above criteria has a Pell-eligible EFC. (Note that the zero EFC is only used for packaging purposes; you do not actually change the student's calculated EFC.) When submit - ting an origination to COD for a student of this type, you must include the CPS transaction containing the Department of Defense Match Flag set to \"Y, \" or the award will not be accepted. A student with an EFC that is not Pell eligible is potentially eligible to receive an award under the Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant program (see Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant below). Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant To receive the Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, the student must have an EFC that is not Pell eligible. (The student must meet the other criteria for Pell eligibil - ity.) Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants are made under the same terms and conditions as Pell, and disburse - ments for each payment period are calculated in the same manner as described in this chapter for Pell. Due to the sequester, all Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant award amounts first disbursed on or after Oc -HEA Sec. 420R, Nov 6, 2009 E-Ann, DCL GEN-15-07 tober 1, 2017 and before October 1, 2018 must be reduced by 6.6%. For example, a student otherwise eligible for a Grant of $5,920 (the maximum Sched - uled Award for 2018-19) would have the grant re - duced by $408.48, resulting in a grant of $5,511.52. When submitting an origination to COD for a stu - dent receiving an Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, you must include the CPS transaction containing the DoD Match Flag set to \"Y, \" or the award will not be accepted. The award may not exceed the student's cost of attendance. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are not considered Estimated Finan - cial Assistance for packaging purposes. For more detail on packaging awards, see Chapter 7 of this volume. Note that children of public safety officers (Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act) are not eligible for Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants. The Year-Round Pell provision also applies to Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants.

Term-based programs can have either standard terms or nonstandard terms. Pell Grants are usually calculated differently for the two types of terms. Standard term programs may be treated similarly to nonstandard term programs if the program does not conform to a traditional academic calendar or meet certain other conditions. When calculating Pell Grants, you must use the same formula for all years in a student's program. Standard terms Standard terms are semesters, trimesters, or quarters, as these words are traditionally used. In traditional usage, an individual semester or trimester provides about 14 to 17 weeks of instructional time and full-time is defined as at least 12 semester or trimester hours. The program's academic calendar generally consists of three terms, one each in fall, spring, and summer. In traditional usage of the term \"quarter,\" an individual quarter provides about 10 to 12 weeks of instructional time, and full-time is defined as at least 12 quarter hours. The program's academic calendar generally includes three quarters in the fall, winter, and spring, and often a summer quarter as well. Nonstandard terms Any term that isn't one of the standard terms described above is a nonstandard term. Sometimes schools refer to terms by standard names when they are, in fact, nonstandard terms. For example, a program may be made up of terms called quarters, but progress is measured in semester hours. If a student's program contains any nonstandard terms, it cannot be considered a standard term program. Non-term programs Non-term programs may be measured in either clock-hours or credit- hours. If a student's program contains coursework not offered for comple - tion within set beginning and end dates, the program cannot be considered a term-based program.Full-time enrollment status for students with intellectual disabilities enrolled in comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs 34 CFR 668.230-233 HEA Sec. 484(s) Students enrolled in certain programs for students with intellectual disabilities may qualify to receive aid as a full-time student by meeting the full-time enrollment status criteria using alternative credit \"equivalencies.\" These equivalent credits, earned from audited courses and other normally non-credit activities undertaken as part of a program for students with disabilities may be awarded for purposes of determining enrollment status. For more detail, see Chapter 1 of Volume 1 of the FSA Handbook . Pell Grant Administrative Cost Allowance 34 CFR 690.10 HEA Sec. 489(a) For each student that receives a Pell Grant at your school each award year, your school is paid $5 to help pay the associated administrative costs. This money must be used solely to pay for the costs of administering the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and FSEOG programs. Second Pell Grant Scheduled Award repeal and crossover payment periods 34 CFR 690.64 To conform with the removal of second Pell Grant Scheduled Award availability, you are no longer required to assign a crossover payment period to the award year in which the student would receive the greater Pell award, but are free to assign crossover payment periods to the award year that best meets the needs of your students and maximizes a student's eligibility over the two award years in which the crossover payment period occurs (you must source Pell funds from the award year to which the payment period is assigned), provided that you never make a payment that will result in the student receiving more than his or her Scheduled Award for an award year. For more detail on crossover payment periods, see the section on crossover payment periods later in this chapter.Prohibition on concurrent enrollment and Pell Grant 20 USC Sec.1070a(c)(3) 34 CFR 690.11 A student may not receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one school, nor from the Secretary and a school.Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-47 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Academic calendar and enrollment status changes Because the academic calendar for a program determines which Pell formula you use, you need to review the conditions for the use of each formula if the calendar for the program changes. This is particularly true if you are using Formulas 1 and 2, since they have the most restrictive conditions. If a student's enrollment status changes during the year, your school may have to recalculate the student's Pell Grant payment based on the new enrollment status. At the end of this chapter we'll discuss when a school is required to recalculate due to a change in enrollment status. 34 CFR 690.63 34 CFR 690.80(b) Enrollment status for cooperative education In a cooperative education program, your school assesses the work to be performed by the student and determines the equivalent academic course load. The student's enrollment status is based on the equivalent academic course load.Enrollment status under consortium agreement The enrollment status of a student attending more than one school under a consortium agreement is based on all the courses taken that apply to the degree or certificate at the home institution. The disbursing school may have to make some adjustments if the coursework at the other school is measured in different units. CREDIT-HOUR TERM-BASED PROGRAMS Annual award based on enrollment status In a term-based program, academic progress is always measured in credit-hours, and the student's annual award depends on his or her enroll - ment status. Your school's standards for enrollment status must meet the minimum regulatory requirements, which are discussed in further detail in Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook . For standard terms, the minimum enrollment standards are: Full-time: 12 semester hours per semester/trimester 12 quarter hours per quarter 3/4-time: 9 semester hours per semester/trimester 9 quarter hours per quarter 1/2-time: 6 semester hours per semester/trimester 6 quarter hours per quarter Less-than-1/2-time: less than half of the workload of the minimum full-time requirement. If the student is enrolled full-time, then the annual award is the Scheduled Award, which is based on the full-time payment schedule. If the student is attending part-time, you must use the 3/4- time, 1/2-time, or less than 1/2-time payment schedules, depending on the number of credit-hours in which the student enrolls. If the student is enrolled less-than-half-time, it will also affect the cost components that are used in the student's Budget (see Chapter 2 of this volume). Schools do not have the discretion to refuse to pay an eligible part-time student, including during a summer term or intersession. On the appropriate full-time or part-time payment schedules, use the student's Cost of Attendance and EFC to look up the Pell annual award for the year at that enrollment status. Most student aid software programs, such as EDExpress, will do this for you automatically, but you can also refer to the Pell Grant payment schedules online at the IFAP website. Pell Grant payments by term Pell Grants must be paid in installments over the course of a program of study to help meet the student's cost in each payment period. The payment period affects when Pell funds are disbursed and the exact amount to be disbursed. For credit-hour term programs, the payment period is the term. If the student doesn't enroll in one of the terms, he or she won't receive a portion of the award for that payment period. If the student's enrollment status changes in the next term, his or her annual award will be different for that term. (See discussion of terms and payment methods.)NEW SAR Comment Code 298 If you received an ISIR containing the DoD Match Flag \"Y\", with the parent's date of death and SSN, the student could potentially be eligible for additional Title IV aid. A SAR comment code is not always printed. When a student matches with the DoD file, the ISIR always shows a \"Y\" in the DOD Match Flag field and the parent's date of death is populated. But SAR comment code 298 is only generated when the CPS DOD Table is updated after the student filed his FAFSA (a system generated transaction occurs and generates the comment).Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19 3-48 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Variations in enrollment status standards If any program uses standard terms, the enrollment status standards in the program don't have to be proportional\u2014for instance, a program could have a 15-hour standard for full-time enrollment, but set a 9-hour minimum for 3/4-time status and a 6-hour minimum for 1/2-time status. In addition, your school's academic standard may differ from the enroll - ment standard used by the financial aid office for FSA purposes. For example, your school may define full-time as six hours during the summer; however, the financial aid office uses 12 hours as full-time for all terms, including the summer term. Your school must apply its FSA full-time enrollment stan - dards consistently to all students enrolled in the same program of study for all FSA purposes. For more on enrollment status, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 . Enrollment status for students taking regular and correspondence courses If a student is enrolled in a non-correspondence study program, but correspondence coursework is combined with regular coursework, the cor - respondence courses must meet the following criteria to be included in the student's enrollment status: The courses must apply toward the student's degree or certificate or must be remedial work to help the student in his or her course of study. The courses must be completed during the period required for the student's regular coursework, e.g., a term. The amount of correspondence work counted can't be more than the number of credit-hours of regular coursework in which the student is enrolled (although a student taking at least a half-time load of corre - spondence courses must be paid as at least a half-time student, regard - less of the credit-hours of regular coursework). A student will be paid as a less-than-half-time student for any combina - tion of regular and correspondence work that is less than 6 credit-hours or the appropriate equivalent of half-time. This chart assumes that the school defines full-time enrollment as 12 credit-hours per term, and half-time enrollment as 6 credit-hours per term. As you can see in the second and third examples, the number of correspondence hours counted in the total course load was adjusted so that the correspondence hours never exceeded the regular hours taken. Note that in the last example, the student is eligible for payment based on half-time enrollment in correspondence courses, because not all of the correspondence work can be counted toward enrollment status.

To determine his enrollment status, Aroldis needs to convert the hours at Coghlan into semester hours. Because a quarter-hour is about two-thirds of a semester hour, Aroldis multiplies the number of quarter- hours by two-thirds: 9 quarter hours X 2/3 = 6 semester hours. Then the hours taken at both schools can be added together: 6 semester hrs. at Aroldis + 6 semester hrs. at Coghlan 12 semester hours Linda is also taking 6 semester hours at Aroldis University and 9 quarter-hours at Coghlan Technical Institute, but her home institution is Coghlan Technical Institute. Because Coghlan is paying her, it needs to convert the semester hours taken at Aroldis into quarter hours: 6 semester hours X 3/2 = 9 quarter-hours. Then, the hours taken at both schools can be added together: 9 quarter hours at Coghlan + 9 quarter hours at Aroldis 18 quarter hours Half-time Half-time Half-time Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-49 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Standard term composed of shorter terms or modules Remember that you can combine shorter terms or modules into a standard term that meets the requirements for Formula 1.

For a program with a traditional academic calendar, the program: must have an academic calendar that consists, in the fall through spring, of two semesters or trimesters, or three quarters (note that summer may not be a standard term); must have at least 30 weeks of instructional time in fall through spring terms; must not have overlapping terms; and must define full-time enrollment for each term in the award year as at least 12 credit-hours and must measure progress in credit-hours. Other programs offered in standard terms may use Formula 1 if they start the terms for different cohorts of students on a periodic basis (for ex - ample, monthly). These programs: must have an academic calendar that consists exclusively of semesters, trimesters, or quarters; must have at least 30 weeks of instructional time in any two semesters or trimesters or any three quarters; must start the terms for different cohorts of students on a periodic ba - sis (for example, monthly); must not allow students to be enrolled in overlapping terms and must stay with the cohort in which they start unless they withdraw from a term (or skip a term) and re-enroll in a subsequent term; and must define full-time enrollment for each term in the award year as at least 12 credit-hours and must measure progress in credit-hours. For Formula 1, the term is the payment period, and you divide the stu - dent's award by the number of terms in the program's FSA academic year.Alternate calculation If you're working with a standard-term program that meets the rules for Formula 1 or Formula 2, you may divide the annual award by the number of all the terms (including the summer term) in the award year. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19 3-50 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Formula Calculation = $1,016.66 disbursement for each payment period= $1,525 disbursement for a semesterIn Formula 1, the annual award is simply divided by the number of terms in the fall through spring at a school with a traditional academic calendar. Take the case of Jake, who is enrolled full-time in a program that has an academic year of 30 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester hours. The program has fall and spring semesters that provide a total of 30 weeks of instruction and a 12-week summer nonstandard term with 12 semester hours as full-time. Jake has a Scheduled Award of $3,050, and because he is enrolled full-time, that is also his annual award. Because the fall through spring has standard terms, it doesn't matter that the summer term is nonstandard; you still calculate summer payment based on Formula 1. $3,050 2 The same formula would be used if Jake enrolled in a program that has fall, winter, and spring quarters that provide at least 30 weeks of instruction and has a summer term with 12 quarter hours as full-time. The only difference is that Jake's annual award of $3,050 is divided by 3. $3,050 3 Note that Jake is receiving a full Scheduled Award because he is attending for two semesters or three quarters as a full-time student. If Jake enrolls at least half-time for a term in the summer, he may be eligible to receive further Pell funds from the Year-Round Pell provision, see the Year Round Pell & IASG section later in this chapter.

A new cohort of students starts a quarter on the first workday of each month, and a student is not allowed to take courses in overlapping terms outside that student's cohort. Any three quarters of the program provide at least 36 weeks of instructional time since each quarter is 12 weeks of instructional time in length. To be full-time, a student must be enrolled in at least 12 quarter hours for a quarter. Majel has a Scheduled Award of $3,000, and because she is enrolled full-time, that is also her annual award. Because any three quarters are at least 30 weeks of instructional time and the academic year encompasses three quarters, Majel's payment for each payment period is calculated by dividing the annual award by 3: $3,000 3 Note that Majel is receiving a full Scheduled Award because she is attending for three terms as a full-time student and may be eligible for further Pell funds for the subsequent payment period if she satisfies the requirements for a Year-Round Pell award; for more details, see the Year-Round Pell & IASG section later in this chapter.

He has a cost of $10,000 and EFC of 100, so his Scheduled Award, taken from the full-time payment schedule, is $5,750. Since he's attending full-time, this is also his annual award. If WCCC defines its academic year as 30 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester hours, Jose's annual award is divided by 2 to arrive at the disbursement for the fall semester. $5,750 2 Jose decides that a full-time schedule is too ambitious, so he enrolls in the spring term as a 3/4-time student. His EFC is the same, and even though his tuition is slightly less, the Pell award is still based on full-time costs. However, his annual award is now based on the 3/4-time payment schedule, so his spring payment will be less than his fall payment. $4,238 2 Note that Jose's Scheduled Award is still $5,750, and he has only received $4,994. This means that he is still eligible for up to $756 Pell funds from his first Scheduled Award if he attends a summer term assigned to the same award year (if this will not put him over his Pell Grant LEU limit). Jose may also be eligible for a Year-Round Pell award if he continues to be enrolled at least half-time. A student may receive funds from the initial Pell award and from the Year-Round Pell award in the same payment period.

Like Formula 1, it simplifies the calculation payments by providing for the same calculation for all payment periods in the award year. Only a small number of schools use Formula 2; therefore, it is covered in Appendix A of this chapter. PELL FORMULA 3: GENERAL FORMULA FOR ANY TERM- BASED PROGRAM Any term-based program may use this formula for Pell calculations, but you must use this formula for a term-based program that does not qualify for Formulas 1 or 2 (for instance, a program that uses only nonstandard terms). To calculate the payment for the term, you must prorate the annual award that you looked up on the appropriate Pell Grant payment schedule. Unlike the term calculation in Formula 1, the annual award can't simply be divided evenly among the terms. Instead, you must multiply the annual award by a fraction that represents the weeks of instructional time in the term divided by the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year. weeks* in term weeks* in academic year (at least 30) If the resulting amount is more than 50 percent of the annual award, your school generally (see exception in sidebar) must make the payment in at least two disbursements in that payment period regardless of whether the term is a standard term or a nonstandard term. A single disbursement for a payment period can generally not be for more than 50 percent of the annual award. You may disburse more than 50 percent of the annual award once the student has completed half of the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year definition. Enrollment status standards for nonstandard terms If you are using Formula 3 for a program that contains standard terms, the minimum enrollment standards previously discussed would still apply for the standard terms. However, if a program has nonstandard terms, the enrollment standard must be calculated for the nonstandard terms. The full- time enrollment status is determined for a nonstandard term based on the length of the term in relation to the academic year.** Disbursing more than 1/2 the annual award and the 50% Requirement 34 CFR 690.63(f) If the disbursement for the payment period results in more than 1/2 of the annual award and occurs after half of the weeks of instructional time of the academic year have passed during the payment period, you can make a disbursement of the full payment for the payment period. For example, your school has a program that must use Formula 3. The program has 3 terms with 17, 14, and 6 weeks of instructional time and defines its academic year as 30 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester hours. Debbie is attending half-time for all three terms. Her payments for each payment period are 17/30, 14/30, and 6/30 of her half-time annual award. For the first term, you may disburse 15/30 of her award at the beginning of the term and the final 2/30 only after the 15th week of instructional time in the term. However, if Debbie establishes eligibility in the 16th week of the term, you can make a disbursement of 17/30 of the annual award at that time. Her award for the 2nd and 3rd terms may be disbursed in a single disbursement. When to use Formula 3 If a term program uses only nonstandard terms, or if a term program has standard terms but does not qualify for Formulas 1 or 2, you must use Formula 3 for Pell calculations. Any term program can opt to use Formula 3. However, standard term programs that qualify for Formula 1 or 2 generally prefer to use Formula 1 or 2.

Credit-hours in academic yearweeks* in nonstandard term weeks* in academic year (at least 30) X ** If the resulting number isn't a whole number, it is rounded up to the next whole number. For example, 3.3 is rounded up to 4 if the program's coursework is offered in whole credits. If the program's coursework is offered in fractions, the full-time enrollment status need not be rounded. For example, 3.3 would remain 3.3 as full-time, and a student taking 3.4 credits in the term would be full-time.*These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 of this volume, which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year.

If both semesters are 14 weeks in length, the Pell payment for a full-time student with a Scheduled Award of $4,550 would be calculated as follows: 14 weeks* in term 30 weeks* in academic yearx $4,550 = $2,123.33 Formula 3: Payments for nonstandard terms of equal length Just a few miles down the road from Montgomery College, Edwards University has a program that consists of four 8-week terms. Edwards University defines the academic year as 40 quarter hours and 32 weeks of instructional time. Because this program does not use standard terms (semesters, trimesters, or quarters), Edwards University must use Formula 3 to calculate Pell disbursements for students in the program. Let's use the example of a student who attends all four terms for 10 quarter- hours each term in the award year, and has a Scheduled Award of $3,750. Because the program has nonstandard terms, Edwards University must determine the number of credit-hours required for full-time enrollment in each term, as follows: 8 weeks* in term 32 weeks* in academic year A student enrolled for 7 hours could be paid as a half-time student (7/10 = .7, which is less than 3/4 [.75] but greater than 1/2 [.5] ). Because the student in our example will be enrolled for 10 hours each term, she is a full-time student and her annual award is the same as her Scheduled Award. This is a term-based, credit-hour program, so the payment period is the term. To determine the student's payment for each payment period, multiply her annual award by the length of the nonstandard term compared to the length of the academic year: 8 weeks* in term 32 weeks* in academic yearx 40 quarter hours = 10 quarter hours *These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 of this volume, which will not necessarily be the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year. x $3,750 = $937.50Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-55 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Formula 3: Payments for nonstandard terms of unequal length Ryne is enrolled in a semester-hour program at Hendricks University that has a 10-week nonstandard term between two 12-week nonstandard terms. The terms do not overlap. The academic year for the program is defined as 34 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester hours. Courses are offered in whole credits. Hendricks must use Formula 3 to calculate Pell Grant payments for students in this program. He enrolls for 6 semester hours in each of the three terms. Because the program has nonstandard terms, Hendricks must determine the number of credit- hours required for full-time enrollment in each term, as follows. For the first and third term: 12 weeks* in term 34 weeks* in academic year For the second term: 10 weeks* in term 34 weeks* in academic year A student must enroll in 9 semester hours (rounded up from 8.47) in the first and third terms, and 8 semester hours (rounded up from 7.06) in the second term, to be full-time. Ryne is enrolled half-time in the first and third terms (6 semester hours/9 semester hours = .67). He is enrolled three-quarter time in the second term (6 semester hours/8 semester hours = .75). The cost of attendance does not need to be prorated because the fall through spring terms provide the same number of weeks of instructional time as in the academic year definition. Further, the school has determined the costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. The half-time payment schedule shows that Ryne is eligible for an annual award of $2,075. Because this is a term-based credit-hour program, the payment period is the term. To calculate Ryne's payment for the first and third terms, the school uses the fraction 12/34: 12 weeks* in term 34 weeks* in academic year Ryne's payment for each of the first and third terms will be $732.35. Because Ryne's enrollment status for the middle term is three-quarter time, the payment for that term is based on a three-quarter-time annual award of $3,075. To calculate the payment for the middle term, the school uses the fraction 10/34: 10 weeks* in term 34 weeks* in academic year Ryne's payment for the middle term (the second payment period) is $904.41. *These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 of this volume, which will not necessarily be the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year. x 24 semester hours = 8.47 (round up to 9) x 24 semester hours = 7.06 (round up to 8) x $2,075 = $732.35 x $3,075 = $904.41Volume 3 \u2014 FSA Dec AND NON-TERM CREDIT- HOUR PROGRAMS Checking 1/2-time enrollment status For clock-hour programs and for non-term credit-hour programs, enrollment status only makes a difference if the student is attending less- than-half-time. If that's the case, only certain components of the cost of attendance are used. (See discussion in Chapter 2 .) The annual award for a student in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program is taken from the full-time payment schedule, even if the student is attending less than full-time. Calculating payment amounts Pell Grants must be paid in installments over the course of the academic year or program of study to help meet the student's cost in each payment period. The payment period determines when Pell funds are disbursed and the exact amount to be disbursed. You must use the rules discussed in Chapter 1 to determine the payment periods for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term programs, the student's Pell award is not reduced for part- time enrollment unless the student is enrolled less than half-time in which case the student's cost of attendance must be adjusted. However, if the program is less than an academic year (in either clock/credit-hours or weeks of instructional time), students enrolled in that program won't receive a full Scheduled Award. As in the case of the other formulas, you must perform comparable prorations of the award for each payment period in the student's program. The calculation for the payment period prorates a student's Scheduled Award based on the number of credit or clock-hours in the payment period as they compare to the credit or clock-hours in the defined academic year or the number of weeks of instructional time in the payment period as they compare to the weeks of instructional time in the academic year. To deter - mine the payment for a payment period, multiply the student's Scheduled Award by the lesser of: Number of credit/clock-hours in the payment period Number of credit/clock-hours in the program's academic year or Weeks* in the payment period Weeks* in the program's academic year (at least 30 for credit-hour, at least 26 for clock-hour)Enrollment status standards for clock- hour and other non-term programs For non-term programs, the enrollment minimums are: Full-time in credit-hours: 24 semester hours, 24 trimester hours, or 36 quarter hours per academic year. Less than 1/2-time status is defined as less than half of the workload of the minimum full-time requirement. Full-time in clock-hours: at least 24 clock-hours per calendar week. *These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 of this volume, which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year.Formula 4 requirements 34 CFR 690.63(a) and (e). All clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs must use Formula 4. Coursework completion requirement & withdrawal/re-entry Students in non-term programs must successfully complete a payment period to receive subsequent payments. We'll discuss the effect of withdrawal and re-entry into a program in Volume 5 . Receiving less than the Scheduled Award due to crossover A student may also receive less than a Scheduled Award in an award year, if the program crosses award years and the student's Pell Grant award in one of the award years is for a portion of the program that is less than a full academic year.Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-57 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms program (Formula 4) Payments for clock-hour program (Formula 4)Chance is enrolled at Strasburg Technical Institute (STI) and has a Scheduled Award of $4,250. His program is 24 quarter hours and 20 weeks of instructional time in length. The academic year for the program is defined as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. STI has established two payment periods of 12 quarter hours and 10 weeks* each for Chance's program. To determine the disbursement for the payment period, STI must multiply the Scheduled Award by the lesser of: the fraction comparing the hours in the payment period to the hours in the academic year, or the fraction comparing the weeks in the payment period to the weeks in the academic year. The two possible calculations would be as follows: 1) 12 quarter-hours in payment period 36 quarter-hours in academic year Since the two resulting fractions (12/36 and 10/30) are the same, there technically is no \"lesser\" fraction and you can use either to get $1,416.66. Thus, Chance's payment for the first payment period will be $1,416.66. Chance can receive this payment when he begins the program. STI can make the payments of $1,416.66 for the second payment period after STI has determined that Chance has successfully completed 12 quarter hours and 10 weeks of instructional time of the program. Chance is enrolled in a program 900 clock-hours and 22 weeks of instructional time in length at Evers Technical Institute (ETI) and is eligible for a Scheduled Award of $2,650. ETI defines the academic year for the program based on the regulatory minimums: 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. To calculate Chance's payment, ETI calculates the payment for each payment period as follows: It multiplies the Scheduled Award ($2,650) by the lesser of: the fraction comparing the hours in the payment period to the hours in the academic year, or the fraction comparing the weeks in the payment period to the weeks in the academic year. The two possible calculations would be as follows: 1) 450 clock-hours in the payment period 900 clock-hours in the academic year 2) 11 weeks* in the payment period 26 weeks* in the program's academic year Chance's payment for the first payment period will be $1,121.15. He can get this payment when he begins the program. He can receive his second payment of $1,121.15 after he successfully completes the 450 clock-hours in the first payment period. x $4,250 = $1,416.66; or *The fractions in these examples use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 , which will not necessarily be the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year.2) 10 weeks* in payment period 30 weeks* in program's academic year x $4,250 = $1,416.66 = $ 1,121.15x $2,650 = $ 1,325; HB Dec 2018Glossary & OTHER \"CROSSOVER PAYMENT PERIODS\" Payment periods don't always fall neatly into one award year or another. When a payment period falls into two award years\u2014that is, it begins before July 1 and ends on July 1 or later\u2014it's called a \"crossover payment period.\" The formula for calculating the payment for a crossover payment period is the same as that for any other payment period in the award year. Crossover payment from the proper award year For Pell purposes, you must consider a crossover payment period to occur entirely within one award year and calculate the student's Pell award and disburse Pell funds from the award year selected (if you only have a valid SAR/ISIR from one award year, you must rely on that record and the award year to which the valid SAR/ISIR pertains). Besides these considerations, the decision about which award year to use is based on the student's remaining eligibility in the earlier award year. This assessment is made according to your school's payment period policy, which for crossover Pell may apply to: an individual student; all students or a category of students without exception; or all students or a category of students with allowance for an exception for an individual student. Although you may, within the limitations described below, assign the crossover payment period to either of the relevant award years, you must make the assignment as you determine will be most beneficial to students. You may assign the Pell Grant award to a different award year than the rest of the student's Title IV aid. You can make a payment for a crossover payment period out of either award year, if the student has a valid SAR/ ISIR for the award year selected. You may assign two consecutive cross - over payment periods to the same award year. For example, you could treat summer 2018 and summer 2019 as both being in the 2018-19 award year. You may also source the Pell funds from different award years for different students, as their eligibility allows, depending on their remaining eligibility and financial need. You may not make a payment which will result in the student receiving more than his or her Scheduled Award for an award year, unless the student is enrolled at least half-time and is eligible for a Year-Round Pell award (see Year-Round Pell & IASG section later in this chapter), in which case the student may be eligible to receive up to 150% of their Scheduled Award for the award year. Crossover Pell and withdrawal For details on how to perform Return of Title IV Funds calculations in a crossover Pell situation, see Volume 5, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook .Formula 5: Correspondence Study Formulas 5A & 5B are formulas that must be used for correspondence students. Because there are only a small number of Pell Grants made to correspondence students, the formulas for correspondence study programs are covered in Appendix B of this chapter. NEW Crossover payment periods 34 CFR 690.64 GEN-17-06 You are free to assign crossover payment periods to the award year that best meets the needs of your students and maximizes a student's eligibility over the two award years in which the crossover payment period occurs (you must source Pell funds from the award year to which the payment period is assigned), provided that you never make a payment that will result in the student receiving more than his or her Scheduled Award for an award year. Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-59 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Term schools: Using the formula for summer session If your school offers a summer term in addition to fall through spring terms that qualify for Formula 1 or 2, you will calculate the student's payment for the summer term using the same formula that you used to calculate payments for the other terms in the award year to which the summer term is assigned. If you use Formula 3 for Pell Grant calculations in any of the terms in an award year, then you must use Formula 3 for all terms in that program that occur in that award year, including the fall through spring terms. (Note that if your program is a standard-term program in the fall through spring and does not define full-time enrollment in the summer as at least 12 credit-hours, you must use Formula 3 for Pell calculations for all terms in the award year.) With regard to enrollment status, your school must apply its definition of full-time status for the summer term consis - tently for all FSA program purposes. COA for summer terms Costs for summer terms are figured in the same way as for any other payment period; that is, the costs are based on a full-time student for a full academic year. If your school has fall and spring semesters that comprise an academic year, you can't add the costs for the summer term to the costs for the fall and spring semesters. The award for the summer term is still based on the costs for one academic year. However, if the academic year defini - tion includes the summer term, then the costs for the summer term must be included in the cost for a full academic year. If the student was previously enrolled in the award year, you may be able to use the same cost of attendance for the summer term that you used for the immediately preceding term that the student attended. However, this isn't possible if the costs are different from the fall through spring such as a different tuition charge per credit-hour or if you are required to recalculate the cost of attendance. See the end of this chapter for information on when recalculations are required. If it's necessary to base the student's cost of atten - dance on the summer term, you must prorate the summer costs to the length of an academic year to establish the cost for a full academic year. See Chapter 2 on prorating costs in the Pell Grant program. If the summer session is the first term in the award year for that student (for example, your school is paying a student for the summer 2018 term from the 2018-19 award year), you must establish the student's full-year cost based on the costs for the summer term. If the student enrolls in another term in that award year, you may have to recalculate the student's costs for the later term.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards Packaging, 2018-19 a term-based school offers a series of minisessions that overlap two award years (by \"crossing over\" the June 30 end date for one award year), these minisessions may be combined and treated as one term. However, schools are not required to combine these minisessions unless they overlap each other. When you combine minisessions into a single term (i.e., payment period), the weeks of instructional time in the combined term are the weeks of instructional time from the beginning of the first minisession to the date the last minisession ends. The student's enrollment status for the entire payment period must be calculated based on the total number of credits the student is projected to take for all sessions. You must project the enrollment status for a student on the basis of the credits the student has: Pre-registered or registered to take for all sessions; Committed to take for all sessions in an academic plan or enrollment contract; or Committed to take for all sessions in some other document. When you combine the minisessions into a single term, a student cannot be paid more than the amount for one payment period for completing any combination of the minisessions. If the minisessions are not combined into a single payment period, you must treat each minisession as a separate nonstandard term and generally must use Formula 3 to calculate Pell Grant payments for the program. If, for each minisession, you define full-time as at least 12 credit-hours, you may be able to use Formula 1 or 2 if the program otherwise qualifies for one of these formulas. If a combined minisession term crosses over the June 30-July 1 date, the combined term must be treated as a crossover payment period, regardless of what classes students attend. If your program has 2 summer sessions and only 1 of the sessions crosses over the award year date boundary and you do not combine the sessions into a larger term, then only the term that actually spans the award year boundary is considered a crossover payment period. If the minisessions are combined in a single term and a student does not begin attendance in all of the minisessions that he or she was expected to attend, recalculation of prior disbursements is required based on the resulting changed enrollment status as discussed later in this chapter. Note that if you do not combine the minisession/intersession(s) to create a standard term and the intersession/minisession overlaps with the term to which it is attached, this creates overlapping terms, and the program must be considered a nonterm program.Minisession enrollment status example Billy is enrolled in a summer session with three-week minisessions that his school, Williams University, has combined into 1 term. Williams U. is using Formula 1 to calculate Billy's combined term, and knows it must define full-time enrollment as at least 12 credit- hours, even though the individual component minisessions may have originally considered full-time to be something less than 12 credit- hours. Billy is enrolled for 6 credits during the combined summer minisession term. Billy's enrollment status is equal to the proportion of his credits to the school's definition of full-time for the combined term. Therefore, Billy should be credited with half- time enrollment status for the combined summer term. Formula 3 minisessions and other nonstandard terms If you use Formula 3 for any of the summer minisessions, or any other nonstandard term (e.g., a winter intersession), remember that you must also use it for all other terms in the award year, including fall through spring.Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-61 FSA HB at Santo University, which defines its academic year as 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. In addition to fall and spring semesters, Santo offers three summer minisessions. Each minisession provides 4 weeks of instructional time. Santo can either combine the minisessions into a single nonstandard term, or treat each session as a separate nonstandard term. The school chooses to combine the sessions into a single payment period providing 12 weeks of instructional time with full-time enrollment in this period defined as 12 semester hours. If Santo meets the conditions for use of Formula 1 in its fall and spring semesters, it can use Formula 1 to calculate Pell Grant payments for this summer session. Ron enrolls for 3 semester hours in each of the minisessions, so he's enrolled three-quarter time (9 hours total in the combined term). His applicable Scheduled Award is $3,550 and his annual award (from the 3/4-time payment schedule) is $2,663. To calculate Ron's payment, Santo simply divides the annual award by 2, the number of terms in the fall through spring: $2,663 /2 = $1,331.50.Combined minisessions into one term didn't combine these minisessions. If it defined full-time enrollment for each 4-week minisession as less than 12 semester hours, it would have to calculate all Pell payments for the program using Formula 3. Because these are nonstandard terms, Santo would have to determine Ron's enrollment status for each minisession by prorating the standard for full-time enrollment in a full academic year (24 semester hours): For each of the 4-week terms, a full-time student must enroll in 4 semester hours, and based on that standard, the 3 semester hours that Ron is attending in each minisession count as 3/4 time enrollment status. Note that Santo would use the Pell cost of attendance for a full-time student attending a full academic year. Santo would determine his payment for each minisession (assuming his Scheduled Award remains unchanged across both award years): 4 weeks* in term 30 weeks* in academic year Ron would receive $355.06 for each of the minisessions, for a total of $1,065.18 for the summer. Again, these payments for one or more minisessions that are in the prior award year may need to be reduced if Ron had previously received payments for the fall and spring semesters in the same award year. Also, Santo must use Formula 3 for the fall through spring terms.Minisessions treated as nonstandard terms = 3.2 semester hours (round up to 4**) x $2,663 = $355.06Summer Term (12 weeks,* 12 hours full-time) 24 semester hours x 4 weeks* in term 30 weeks* in academic year *These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 , which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year .(4 weeks*)Session 1 (4 weeks*)Session 2 (4 weeks*)Session 3 ** Since Santo only offers courses in whole creditsVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, Consolidated Act of 2017 GEN-17-06 COD Technical Reference (posted 11/21/17) October 4, 2017 E-Announcement: COD 16.2 Implementation Year-Round Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants are calculated and disbursed in the same manner as Year-Round Pell Grant awards. Note that students eligible for Year-Round Pell awards are still subject to the normal Pell Grant duration of eligibility and LEU limits (see DCL GEN-17-06 and Sec. 401(c)(5) of the HEA). Year-Round Pell & IASG Students may be eligible to receive up to 150 percent of their Sched - uled Award for an award year. This provision is called Year-Round Pell (or Year-Round IASG), or additional Pell (or additional IASG). It's called \"Year- Round\" because it allows students to receive additional Pell/IASG funds, of - ten in summer terms which are treated as either a header or trailer, whereas without the provision for Year-Round Pell/IASG, a student's remaining Pell eligibility would often be truncated for a summer term treated as a trailer when the student had already exhausted their Scheduled Award for an award year, or prematurely exhaust the student's Pell eligibility for an award year if the summer term was treated as a header. A student's additional aid eligibil - ity is denoted by the \"Additional Eligibility Indicator\" or AEI, in COD. To be eligible to receive Pell funds in excess of 100% of their Scheduled Award during a single award year, students must be enrolled at least half- time. For Year-Round Pell (& Year-Round IASG), students do not receive more Pell/IASG funds in each payment period for the same enrollment status, Cost of Attendance, and EFC. Instead, the student receives the same amount as is normally calculated for a payment period, but a student who is enrolled at least half-time and is in all other ways Pell or IASG-eligible may receive Pell or IASG funds for an award year up to 150 percent of their cal - culated Scheduled Award (a student may receive funds from the initial Pell/ IASG) award and from the Year-Round award in the same payment period). For example, Bob has a Scheduled Award of $5,000 for 2018-19. He at - tends fall and spring semesters, during which he receives awards of $2,500 for each semester. He begins attendance in the summer 2019 term (which his school treats as a trailer) as a half-time student, and without Year-Round Pell, his Pell eligibility would be exhausted, but through Year-Round Pell, he'll receive his calculated award, up to $2,500 in additional Pell funds for the summer term. Eugene enrolls in Springfield University for an 1125 clock-hour program (over 32.5 weeks, see graphic below). His program occurs entirely within the 2018-19 award year, and has an Academic Year of 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. Eugene has a Scheduled Award of $5550. Springfield awards Eugene $2775 in Pell after he completes each of the first two segments of 450 clock-hours and 13 weeks of instructional time. For the remaining 225 hours and 6.5 weeks of instructional time in the program, Springfield calculates that Eugene would be eligible to receive $1,387.50 in Pell, if his Scheduled Award would allow it. Prior to Year-Round Pell, Eugene would be out of luck, as his Scheduled Award has been expended by the $5550 he's already received for 2018-19, but with Year-Round Pell, if he is enrolled at least half-time and remains in all other ways Pell-eligible, Eugene is eligible to receive up to an additional 50% of his $5550 Scheduled Award, for a maximum total of $8325. Adding $1387.50 to the $5550 Eugene has already received, Springfield sees that he will be awarded a total of $6937.50 for 2018-19, which is within his $8325 Year-Round Pell maximum. Note that Springfield does not increase his final award for the award year to match his Year-Round Pell maximum; Eugene's awards for each term are calculated according to the normal Pell rules.

His enrollment begins in the summer, which Green treats as a header to the 2018-19 award year. Gaston is enrolled three-quarter-time in the summer term, and has a Scheduled Award for 2018-19 of $5,370, and an EFC of 550, with a COA of $10,590. Based on these figures, Gaston's three-quarter-time summer award is $2,014, which is 37.5046% of his Scheduled Award ($5,370). After the summer term, Gaston continues in the fall and now has time to enroll full-time in Green's fall semester. His fall Pell award is $2685 (Green disburses 50% of a Scheduled Award for the fall semester). After receiving his fall Pell award, Gaston has received a total of 87.50% of his Scheduled Award for 2018-19. Continuing with his program in the spring semester, Gaston again enrolls full-time. Under normal Pell rules, Gaston only has 12.5% of his Scheduled Award remaining, which would leave him only a maximum Pell award amount of $671. However, since he is enrolled at least half-time and meets all of the other standard Pell eligibility criteria, Gaston is eligible for an additional Year-Round Pell award amount of up to 50% of his Scheduled Award. This would mean that he could receive a total of up to $8055 for the award year (though each term's payment would be calculated per the normal Pell rules, and he may receive less than this). Since Green normally awards a student 50% of their annual award for a standard spring semester, and knows that their normal award calculation for the term is calculated for Year-Round Pell under the same method as for a student's initial Scheduled Award, they look at these numbers to see if they would fit within Gaston's expanded Year-Round Pell 150% Scheduled Award. To do this, they add $2685 for the proposed spring award to the $4699 Gaston has already received for the award year. This totals $7384, which is within Gaston's 150% Scheduled Award for 2018-19 of $8,055 (it is 137.5%, below the 150% maximum), so Green is clear to award the spring Pell award of $2685 as calculated.* *Note that although Gaston has a Year-Round maximum Pell Scheduled Award of $8055, Green does not adjust his spring term Pell award upwards to meet this\u2014the school must calculate and award Gaston's spring Pell as normal for the term. This also will leave Gaston some remaining Pell eligibility for the remainder of the award year, for example, if he decides to attend during a summer 2019 term. **The Year-Round Pell Grant award cannot exceed 50% of a student's Pell grant Scheduled Award. In this example, the 50% is made up of 12.4954% ($671) remaining from the initial Pell Grant Scheduled Award and 37.5046% ($2,014) from the Year- Round Pell Grant award. The student has 12.4954% ($671) remaining from the Year-Round Pell Grant award for the 2017-18 award year. If the student had used up 100% of his Pell Grant Scheduled Award for Summer 2017 and Fall 2017, the entire Spring 2018 award amount would be from the Year-Round Pell Grant award.

That is, you must calculate payments for each payment period following the rules given in this chapter. However, a transfer student's remaining Pell eligibility at your school is reduced if the student received Pell funds for the same award year at any prior schools. You can identify the student's prior Pell disbursements when you review his or her Financial Aid History in NSLDS (see sidebar). Calculating remaining eligibility Once you've identified the Pell amounts that a transfer student has already received for the ongoing award year, you must calculate the percentage of the Scheduled Award that has been used. This percentage is calculated by dividing the amount disbursed at the previous school by the student's Scheduled Award at that school (COD calculates this and you can refer to COD to see what the percentage of remaining eligibility will be for a student). Then subtract this percentage from 100 percent (or 150 percent, if the student is enrolled and eligible for a Year-Round award). The result is the maximum percentage of the Scheduled Award that the student may receive at your school. Note that a transfer student receives the same payments as any other student until the limit (up to 150 percent of a Scheduled Award, see Year-Round Pell & IASG section, previously in this chapter) is reached. You give the student the full amount for each payment period, rather than trying to ration the remaining amount by splitting it evenly across the remaining terms. A transfer student must repay any amount received in an award year that exceeds his or her Scheduled Award (or in excess of 150% of his or her Scheduled Award, if enrolled and eligible for Year-Round Pell or IASG), unless the school that disbursed the award was at fault by failure to follow the administrative requirements in 34 CFR 668. Payment period for a transfer student at a non-term school When a student transfers into a non-term credit-hour or clock-hour program at a new school, that student is starting a new payment period. For non-term programs, you must use the payment period rules described in Chapter 1 to determine the payment periods for the remainder of the student's program. However, for a transfer student, the length of the program is the number of clock or credit-hours and the number of weeks of instructional time that the student will be required to complete in the new program. If the remaining clock or credit-hours or weeks of instructional time are half an academic year or less, then the remaining hours and weeks of instructional time constitute one payment period.= % of Scheduled Award used Pell disbursed at prior school Scheduled Award at prior schoolTransfer student 34 CFR 690.65 CFR 690.65(d) NSLDS financial aid history and transfer monitoring Before disbursing FSA funds to a transfer student, you must obtain a financial aid history for the student and you must inform NSLDS about the transfer student so that you can receive updates through the Transfer Student Monitoring Process. The financial aid history will not only identify Pell Grant disbursements that the student received at other schools, but also tell you if the student is ineligible for any FSA aid due to default or overpayment, if the student has reached or exceeded the annual or aggregate loan limits, or if the student has reached the Pell Lifetime Eligibility Used limit (LEU). There are several ways for you to get a student's financial aid history from NSLDS. You can: Use the NSLDS Financial Aid History section of the ISIR; Log on to the NSLDS Professional Access website and access the data online for a student; For multiple students, use the FAT 001 Web report, which you submit from the Reports tab on the NSLDS site (you retrieve the results through SAIG); or Send a batch TSM/FAH Inform file to request aid history data for several students, which will be returned in either extract or report format through SAIG. The TSM/FAH processes and batch file layouts are posted on the IFAP website at the NSLDS reference materials link under Processing Resources. Why percentages are used The reason for using percentages when calculating remaining eligibility is that a student may have different Scheduled Awards at different schools/programs. For example, the costs of attendance at the two schools may be different. The percentages are also used to compare the portions of a student's total eligibility that have been used at both schools. (If the student's Scheduled Award is the same at both schools, the financial aid administrator can find the amount of the student's remaining eligibility simply by subtracting the amount received at the first school from the Scheduled Award.)Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-65 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Transfer students and remaining eligibility Consider a student who is eligible for Federal Pell Grant funds and who transfers from one school (school A) to another school (school B) within the same award year. Before paying any Pell funds to the student, school B must determine the percentage of eligibility remaining for the student. After transferring, a student's remaining Pell Grant eligibility for a Pell Sched - uled Award during an award year is equal to the percentage of the student's Scheduled Award that remains unused, multiplied by the student's Scheduled Award at the new school. School B may pay the student a Pell Grant only for that portion of an academic year in which the student is enrolled and in attendance at school B. The grant must be adjusted, as necessary, to ensure that the funds received by the student for the award year do not exceed the student's Scheduled Award for that award year or the student's maximum Lifetime Eligibility Used (600% LEU in COD). The award for each payment period is calculated using the (full) Scheduled Award. The student receives a full award until the student has received 100 percent of the student's remaining eligibility for a Scheduled Award (or 150 percent, if the student is enrolled at least half-time and otherwise eligible for a Year-Round award) or 600% LEU (i.e., 6 Scheduled Awards over the course of the student's academic career; see LEU section later in this chapter). This avoids a school having to ration the remaining amount by splitting it evenly across the remaining terms. To calculate a transfer student's remaining eligibility for a Scheduled Award, school B must first determine what percentage of the Scheduled Award the student used at school A. On the student's current ISIR, on the Financial Aid History Page, in a section headed Pell Payment Data, school B will find an entry for \" % Sch. Used.\" School B subtracts the percentage listed under \" % Sch. Used\" from 100% (or from 150 percent, if the student is enrolled at least half-time and otherwise eligible for a Year-Round award). The remainder is the unused percentage of the student's Scheduled Award \u2014the percentage the student may receive at school B. (Use percent - ages rather than dollars because a transfer student may have different Scheduled Awards at the two schools; using percentages rather than dollars adjusts for this possible difference.) School B then multiplies the percent of eligibility remaining times the Scheduled Award at the new school. The result is the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grant funds the student may receive for his or her first Scheduled Award (see sidebar) at school B during the balance of the award year. Avoiding Pell Grant overawards 34 CFR 690.79 A Pell Grant overaward can be caused by a school making an error in reading the (correct) Pell payment schedule, for example, using the wrong EFC or COA. A Pell Grant overaward can also be caused by a school using the wrong payment schedule, as when it uses the full-time schedule to determine the award for a student who is not registered as a full-time student, or who reduced his/her enrollment schedule to less than full time before beginning attendance in all classes. A Pell Grant overaward can also result if an applicant enters incorrect data on a FAFSA and the EFC derived from the incorrect data is smaller than it should be (for more detail about the FAFSA and EFC data, see the Application and Verification Guide ). A Pell overaward also exists if the student scheduled to receive it fails to begin class or is otherwise determined to be ineligible for FSA assistance (for example, having exceeded the Lifetime Eligibility Used [LEU]) in COD. Finally, an overaward exists whenever a student is scheduled to or is receiving a Pell Grant for attendance at two or more schools concurrently. All of these Pell Grant overawards must be corrected (for more detail on the requirements and methods of resolving overawards, see Volume 5, Chapter 1 ). In addition to avoiding these mistakes, schools should also be sure to submit timely Pell actual disbursement records to COD, according to the Annual Deadline Date Notice Rules as published on IFAP.NEWTransfers and remaining eligibility 34 CFR 690.65 Note : Following the appropriate procedures relative to the figure reported in % Sch. Used will ensure that a transfer student does not receive more than 100 percent (or 150%, if enrolled and eligible for a Year-Round award) of the student's Scheduled Award. Therefore, school B may ignore the actual grant and overpayment amounts from school A in school B's calculations. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19 3-66 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL 1, 2018, Ernie enrolled at Maddux Hair Academy. After completing 400 of the 900 clock-hours in his program, Ernie had to relocate, and he withdrew from school. On February 1, 2019, having settled into his new home, Ernie enrolled at Bryant Esthetics Institute (BEI) as a transfer student. Ernie was awarded 400 clock-hours of transfer credit in BEI's 1,000 clock- hour program (the program definition of an academic year is 900 clock-hours and 30 weeks of instructional time). Ernie's program is 600 clock-hours and 20 weeks of instructional time. When the financial aid administrator (FAA) at BEI examined Ernie's 2018-2019 ISIR, he Of: 01/28/2019 Pell Verification EFC: 0 The FAA subtracted the 50% used previously from 100% and found that the percentage of Ernie's Scheduled Award that remained unused was 50%*. Therefore, Ernie was eligible to receive 50% of his scheduled Pell award of $4,850 during the balance of the award year. In addition, the FAA used the 600 hours and 20 weeks of instructional time remaining in Ernie's program to establish the appropriate two payment periods (per 34 CFR 668.4(b)), each of 300 clock-hours and 10 weeks of instructional time. The aid administrator performed the required multiplication and determined that Ernie could receive as much as $ 2,425 (.50 x $4,850 = $2,425) if he remained enrolled at BEI for the balance of the year. During the first payment period, Ernie received $1,617 ($4,850 x 300 hours in the period \u00f7 900 hours in the academic year) in Pell funds. However, in the second payment period, Ernie could only receive funds until his total Pell at BEI reached $2,425 (his total for the year reached $4,850). Therefore, for the second payment period at BEI, Ernie could only receive $808 ($2,425 - $1,617 = $808). It's important to remember that if Ernie received a Direct Loan at Maddux and now wishes to borrow a Direct Loan at BEI, there may be overlapping academic years between the two schools. When there are overlapping academic years, a student's eligibility for Direct Loan funds will usually be impacted. The method for determining the remaining eligibility for Direct Loan funds is calculated in a very different manner than how we calculated Ernie' remaining Pell Grant eligibility. Please refer to Chapter 5 of this volume for a complete discussion of this issue. Also note that when you have a transfer student with overlapping academic years who borrows Direct Loan funds at the second school, that student will have payment periods for most Federal Student Aid Programs (Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH, Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, that do not align with the loan periods/payment periods in the Direct Loan Program. * This assumes Ernie was not eligible for a Year-Round Pell or IASG. If Ernie was enrolled and eligible for a Year- Round Pell or IASG, he would be eligible to receive up to 150% of his Scheduled Award, in total. For more details, see the Year-Round Pell & IASG section earlier in this chapter. Transfer Student Remaining Eligibility ExampleChapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-67 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Pell Grant and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) Per the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 (CAA), a student's maximum duration of Pell eligibility is 6 Scheduled Awards, as measured by the percentage of \"Lifetime Eligibility Used\" (LEU) field in COD (one Sched - uled Award equals 100% LEU). A separate maximum of 600% LEU also ap - plies to Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant awards, however, since there are so few of these awards, they are not maintained in COD at this time. A student is ineligible to receive further Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant funds if they have reached or exceeded the 600% limit for the applicable program (i.e., Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant). For Pell, this limitation is not limited to students who received their first Pell Grant on or after July 1, 2008, as was the previous limit of 9 Scheduled Awards. Instead, it is tracked to the beginning of the program (1973-74). The LEU levels for Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants are separate and are tracked independently. For example, a student might have 400% Pell LEU and 300% Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU and still be potentially eligible for either program, or 600% Pell LEU and 400% Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU and be potentially eligible for only an Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant award. Rounding rules do not apply if the amount disbursed would place the student's LEU over 600%. The Department provides weekly Pell LEU reports through the SAIG Mailbox under Message Class PGLEXXOP (where XX = the year) for your Pell-eligible applicants (and students who listed your school code on their FAFSA) who have a Pell LEU greater than or equal to 450%. The COD web - site will show the current Pell LEU level for all aid recipients (updated as transactions are processed). COD also provides the LEU for the Pell Multiple Reporting Record (MRR), Pell Reconciliation Report, and Pell Year-to-Date file. Students will fall into one of the following categories, which will have various effects: Student not on report (Code \"N\" on the student's ISIR under Life - time Limit Flag) Students in this category have LEU of less than 400%. These students' Pell awards will be awarded as normal, since even if they receive a full Scheduled Award, they will not go over the 600% LEU maximum. LEU greater than 400% but less than or equal to 500% (Code \"H\" on the student's ISIR under Lifetime Limit Flag) Students in this category will likely have Scheduled Award eligibility for 2018-19. However, a student's 2018-19 Pell eligibility may be reduced if, for example, another Pell disbursement is reported after a report has been created, putting the student's 2018-19 baseline LEU over 500%. LEU greater than 500% but less than 600% (Code \"C\" on the stu - dent's ISIR under Lifetime Limit Flag) These students will not have full Pell eligibility for 2018-19, since their baseline LEU has less than 100% remaining. Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants LEU Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 HEA Section 401(c) https://ifap.ed.gov/isirguide/1819ISIRGuide.html Due to the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 (CAA), a student may receive a total of 6 Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Scheduled Awards, measured by percentage of Scheduled Award(s) disbursed (Lifetime Eligibility Used, or \"LEU\" field in COD up to 600 percent). This limitation is not limited to students who received their first grant on or after July 1, 2008, as was the previous limit of 9 Scheduled Awards. NEW NSLDS Reporting requirements DCL GEN-14-07, E-Announcement February 11, 2015 For details on NSLDS reporting requirements for Pell, including reporting of additional data, reporting at the academic program level, and more frequent reporting, see DCLs GEN-14-07 and GEN-14-17.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating \"E\" on the student's ISIR under Lifetime Limit Flag) These students will have no Pell eligibility remaining, as they have already exceeded the maximum lifetime eligibility used amount as defined in the CAA. To aid in identifying students who are approaching their LEU limits, COD has been updated to return warning code 177 or 178 when a student's Pell LEU is near or exceeds 600%. Also, you will be able to see this data in the Common Record Response, and the Central Processing System (CPS) reports Pell Grant LEU limit flags and percentages on SARs and ISIRs. Students' Pell LEU status is also visible in the NSLDS system. COD calculates a student's LEU to 3 decimal places, and you may round awards as described earlier under \"Ground rules for Pell,\" however, you may not round up if that would cause the student to exceed either their Scheduled Award or 600% LEU. Currently, Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU levels are tracked manually by the Department and are not automatically populated in COD or on the students' ISIR. COD has implemented a hard reject (Edit 201) for Pell actual disbursements for Pell recipients with a Pell LEU greater than 600%. To calculate an award for a student whose LEU level will reduce their eligibility (i.e., an LEU greater than 400% but less than 600%, either code H or C on the Lifetime Limit Flag on the ISIR), first subtract their LEU % from 600%, then multiply the student's Scheduled Award by the resulting percent - age. For example, Jack has 534% LEU on his SAR. His school subtracts 534% from 600%, leaving him with 66% of a Scheduled Award remaining. His Scheduled Award for 2018-19 is $5,650, so his school multiplies $5,650 by .66, which equals $3,729, which is then disbursed per the normal Pell formula and payment period rules. For students whose eligibility is less than a full Scheduled Award, you award the student a Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant as you would for a transfer student who received Pell at another school during the same award year. That is, you determine the student's remaining Pell eligibility, as a % of LEU, and then award each payment until that eligibility is used (see the earlier section in this chapter entitled \"transfer students\").Pell Grant LEU Disputes E-Announcement June 27, 2013 E-Announcement April 18, 2014 A school or student may dispute the accuracy of a student's Pell Grant data which resulted in the student's LEU level in COD. It is the responsibility of the student's current school to coordinate the resolution of the dispute. You may create, view, and edit Pell LEU disputes (including uploading documentation) using the COD Web Portal. Note that Pell Grant and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU levels are independent of one another and are tracked separately (for example, a student may be at 650% Pell LEU, but only 400% IASG LEU). Declining and/or returning Pell funds DCL GEN-12-18 A student may decline or return all or part of a disbursement of Pell Grant funds that they are otherwise eligible to receive or have received (returns may only be made in the same award year as the funds were received). This should be a rare action on the part of students and need not be advertised as a possibility by your school. For more detail on the requirements of declining or returning Pell funds, see DCL GEN-12-18. Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-69 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Restoring Pell eligibility for students that attended closed schools There is a limited circumstance in which Pell eligibility may be restored to certain students who attended schools which are now closed. Note that Total Eligibility Used (TEU) is capped at 100% (or 150% in the case of Year- Round Pell) and is the maximum Pell a student may receive during a single Award Year, whereas LEU is the student's sum total of all Pell eligibility used, across all award years. A closed school may be considered for the Pell restora - tion process if all of the following are true: The school is officially closed with the Department The school closed after 1994 (i.e., 1995 to present) All final disbursements have been submitted to the COD system and accepted by the Department All final enrollment data has been submitted to NSLDS so that the Department may determine if students are eligible for restoration The school has completed the close-out process with the Department A student may be eligible for Pell eligibility restoration if all the following are true: Received a Pell Grant disbursement at an eligible closed school, Did not complete their program at the closed school, AND Had a valid enrollment status within two years of the school's closure. Students who are potentially eligible for additional Pell because some or all of their Pell eligibility has been restored are sent a targeted email. Schools are notified of Pell eligibility restorations for students associated with their school through a variety of sources, including: COD Warning Edit #221; targeted email with instructions to download a list of affected stu - dents from the COD web; updated LEU within response file; and details of the LEU adjustment(s) display on the Pell LEU History screen. COD sends the updated LEU to NSLDS. For more detail on how this is handled in COD, please refer to the E-Announcement October 4th, 2017.NEW Pell Total Eligibility Used (TEU) & Restoring Pell Eligibility for students who attended a closed school December 21, 2016 E-Announcement April 3, 2017 E-Announcement October 4, 2017 E-Announcement The Department is working to update TEU/LEU data for eligible students who attended closed schools. You may receive Pell POP notifications for such students, and should review these reports carefully. The COD system will have the most current Pell LEU data, and you should look for Pell Restoration targeted emails, and review the weekly Pell LEU reports, especially for Pell recipients who have a Pell LEU of 450% or higher.NEWVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms charges and recalculation If the school recalculates a student's Pell Grant due to a change in enrollment status, continuing to charge tuition and fees for credit- hours no longer included in the student's enrollment status for Pell Grant purposes does not affect the requirement to recalculate the student's Pell Grant. For example, Jayson enrolls as a full-time student at Wilson University with 12 credits, but never starts attendance in a 3-credit class that starts after the college's \"add/drop\" date. Jayson's award must be recalculated as three-quarter-time even though the college charges tuition for any classes dropped after the \"add/drop\" date and continues to charge Jayson for 12 credits.Changes in LEU A student's LEU changes whenever he or she receives a Pell or IASG disbursement (up or down), and may change any time a student's Scheduled Award is adjusted. It may also change through an LEU adjustment made based on an LEU Dispute, Closed School Restoration, or other adjustment type deemed necessary by the Department. A student's Pell or IASG LEU can limit the student's Pell or IASG eligi - bility for an award year. For example, since the maximum LEU is 600%, if a student's Pell or IASG award originally was calculated based on an LEU of 550%, then that student's award would be limited to 50% of the Scheduled Award. A change to a disbursement in the current or previous award year may alter a student's LEU. For details on LEU limitations, see the Pell Grant and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used guidance ear - lier in this chapter. When a school becomes aware that a student's LEU has been adjusted (after being notified by the student, or the Department through a pushed ISIR or a warning edit in COD, or through LEU Dispute communication), it should determine whether the adjustment affects the student's eligibility for Pell or IASG in the current or most recently completed award year. If the student becomes eligible for additional Pell or IASG funds as a result of a change to the student's LEU, the school must make a correction to the student's award and make any disbursements of Pell or IASG funds for which the student is now eligible and that the school is permitted to make under the late and retroactive disbursement requirements (for more detail on disbursement requirements and timing, see Volume 4, Chapter 2, Disbursing FSA Funds ). Note that, as with any retroactive or late disbursement of Pell Grant funds, the school should base its calculation of such disbursements on only the classes that the student completed for the earlier period. PELL RECALCULATIONS Change in the EFC If the student's EFC changes due to corrections, updating, or an adjust - ment, and the EFC change would change the amount of the Pell award, you must recalculate the Pell award for the entire award year. If, as a result of the recalculation, the student has received more than his or her award amount, then the student has received an overpayment. In some cases, you may be able to adjust an award) by reducing or canceling later payments to the student (see Volume 4, Chapter 3, Overawards and Overpayments, for more information). A student selected for verification can be paid based on the corrected output document that you receive during the \"verification extension\" (120 days after the student's last day of enrollment, not to extend beyond the deadline date established by a Federal Register notice). For example, if you receive a reprocessed ISIR reflecting the results of the student's verification during the extension period and the ISIR has a lower EFC than the previous ISIR (increasing the student's eligibility), you calculate the student's Pell Grant based on the valid ISIR. Enrollment change recalculation example Sammy registers for a full-time course load (15 credit-hours), and Danbury College makes a first-term disbursement on that basis 10 days before the term starts. When the term starts, Sammy only begins attendance in three classes (9 credit-hours). Danbury must recalculate Sammy's Pell award based on the lower enrollment status. Any difference between the amount Sammy received and his new recalculated award is an overpayment. See Volume 4, Chapter 3, Overawards & Overpayments, for more detail on overpayments.Pell Recalculations 34 CFR 690.80 Changes to the EFC There are three ways that a student's EFC can change: 1. Corrections. The student may have to correct a mistake that was reported on the original FAFSA or SAR/ISIR. This frequently occurs as a result of verification, but it may also be a result of the student's own review of the SAR/ISIR. 2. Updating. In some cases, a student is required to update changes to dependency status, household size, and the number in college (see Volume I, Student Eligibility for details). 3. Professional Judgment. You may, on a case-by-case basis, adjust one or more of the data elements used to calculate the EFC. In some cases, you might make an adjustment during the award year to reflect a student's changed circumstances. For example, if a wage- earning parent dies after the student's first semester, you could adjust the adjusted gross income in the EFC formula to reflect the loss of income. You may also determine that a dependent student should be considered independent. If the student has already been paid based on the original EFC, the award will have to be recalculated. NEWChapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-71 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Change in enrollment status If the student doesn't begin attendance in all of his or her classes, resulting in a change in the student's enrollment status, you must recalcu - late the student's award based on the lower enrollment status. A student is considered to have begun attendance in all of his or her classes if the student attends at least one day of class for each course in which that student's enroll - ment status was determined for Federal Pell Grant eligibility. Note that clock-hour and nonterm programs are always based on full-time enrollment status for Pell. Your school must have a procedure in place to know whether a student has begun attendance in all classes for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program. The Department does not dictate the method a school uses to document that a student has begun attendance, however, a student is considered not to have begun attendance in any class in which the school is unable to document that attendance. If you recalculate a Pell award because the student's enrollment status has changed, you must also take into account any changes in the student's costs at that time. For example, if a student enrolls full-time for the first semester and then drops to less than half time during that semester, the student's costs will change, because only certain cost components are allowed for less-than- half-time students. You must use the cost for a less-than-half-time student for a full year to calculate the student's less-than-half-time award. You must not combine the two costs or average them. The regulations don't require any recalculation for changes in enroll - ment status after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes . However, your school may have a policy of recalculating an award if a student's enrollment status changes within a term. If such a policy is estab - lished, it must take into account any changes in the student's COA, and must be applied consistently to all students in a program. If your school chooses to recalculate for a student whose enrollment status increases from half-time to full-time, it must also recalculate for a student whose enrollment status decreases. If your school establishes a policy allowing optional recalculations for an educational program, this policy must be in writing. Your school's policy may set a date after which Pell Grants will not be recalculated for enrollment status changes. For example, you could establish a policy that you will recalculate Pell awards only for enrollment changes that occur up to the \"add/drop\" date of a term. This policy is true regardless of whether there is compressed coursework. The initial calculation of a student's Pell Grant may occur subsequent to the \"add/drop\" date of the term, including terms with compressed coursework. If that is the case, you must use the student's effective enrollment status on the date of the initial calcula - tion, and there would be no recalculations of the student's Pell Grant for the term due to a subsequent change in enrollment status, assuming the student began attendance in each class. If the student's payment for the term is being disbursed in a subsequent payment period, you may pay the student only for the coursework completed in the term. SAR/ISIR with different EFC If you receive a SAR or ISIR with an EFC different from the one you used for the payment calculation, you must first decide which document is valid. If the new information is the correct information, the new SAR or ISIR is the valid record. In most cases, you must recalculate the student's Pell award for the entire award year based on the new EFC. For more information on SARs, ISIRs, and EFC, see the Application and Verification Guide. Enrollment change within payment period Johnathan registers for a full-time course load at Coulton College, and Coulton initially calculates a full-time award for him. He begins attending all of his classes but subsequently drops to half-time. Depending on Coulton's recalculation policy, Johnathan may still be paid based on full-time enrollment as long as he's otherwise eligible for payment. On the other hand, if Coulton did not receive Johnathan's first processed valid SAR or ISIR with an official EFC until after he dropped to half-time enrollment, the Pell initial calculation would be based on his enrollment status at the time the output document was received (half-time).NSLDS reporting requirement You must report changes to a student's enrollment status to NSLDS in a timely manner. Any change requiring a recalculation of award may also require an update to the student's enrollment status.Initial calculation An initial calculation is the first calculation that is made on or after the date the school has received an ED-produced EFC,* such as the student's initial SAR or ISIR with an official EFC, and uses the enrollment status at the time of the initial calculation. If you've estimated the student's eligibility prior to receiving a SAR or ISIR for the student, you must confirm prior estimated eligibility or determine the student's eligibility at the time the SAR or ISIR is received. You should document the date that you initially calculate a student's Pell Grant. The earliest date is the date of receipt of an ED-produced EFC*, such as on a SAR or ISIR (assuming the school has a documented or projected enrollment status for the student). If you fail to document the date of the initial calculation, you must use the later of (a) the date that the SAR or ISIR is first received and the student's enrollment status as of that date, or (b) the date the student enrolls. Your school is considered to have received the ISIR on the date it was processed. This date is labeled \"Processed Date\" on the ISIR. In the case of a SAR, your school is considered to have received it on the date processed unless you document a later date. The processing date on a SAR is the date above the EFC and, on a SAR Acknowledgment, the \"Transaction Processed Date.\" *Note: An ED-produced EFC may be an EFC from a SAR/ISIR, FAA Access, or FAFSA.gov.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards 2018-19 3-72 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms If you don't establish a policy for recalculation within a term, a student who begins attendance in all classes would be paid based on the initial calcu - lation, even if his or her enrollment status changes before the disbursement is made. If the student withdraws from all of his or her classes (or doesn't begin attending any classes), you must follow the procedures discussed in Volume 5. In a term program that uses credit-hours, you must calculate a student's payment for each term based on the enrollment status for that term. If a student attended full-time for the first term and then enrolled half-time in the second term, you must use the half-time enrollment status to calculate the student's payment for the second term. In the case of programs offered with compressed coursework or modules within the terms, your school may adopt a policy of setting the date based on the add/drop date of the last class in which the student enrolls, or is expected to enroll, for the term. In this circumstance, your school must take into account all adjustments to the enrollment status, both increases and decreases, up to the add/drop date of the student's last class. Change in cost of attendance When a student's COA changes during the award year, and his or her enrollment status remains the same, you may (but are not required to) estab - lish a policy under which you recalculate the student's Pell Grant award. If you choose to establish a policy under which you recalculate Pell for changes in costs, you must consistently apply that recalculation policy to all students in the program. Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-73 FSA HB A\u2014 PELL FORMULA 2: CALCULATIONS FOR STANDARD-TERM PROGRAMS WITH LESS THAN 30 WEEKS IN FALL THROUGH SPRING APPENDIX B\u2014PELL FORMULA 5: CALCULATIONS FOR CORRESPONDENCE STUDY PROGRAMS APPENDIX C\u2014 PELL FORMULA SUMMARIESVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating 3-74 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Formula 2: Calculation for standard terms with fall through spring terms less than 30 weeks The regulations offer an alternative formula for standard-term programs with fall through spring standard terms that provide less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The significant effect of this formula is to allow you to pay the same Pell amount for the summer term as you would for one of your traditional fall through spring terms. To use this formula, the program must have two semesters or trimesters (in the fall through the following spring) or three quarters (in the fall, winter, and spring), with no overlapping terms, and define full-time enrollment for each term in the award year as at least 12 credit-hours. Let's take the example of Javier, who is attending Heyward College, which has fall and spring semesters of 14 and 15 weeks, and a summer term of 10 weeks. Heyward defines the academic year of Javier's program as 24 semester hours and 30 weeks.* His Scheduled Award is $3,390, and he is attending as a full-time student. Because the fall and spring terms provide less than the minimum 30 weeks of instructional time for an academic year, Javier's full-time award is prorated as follows: 29 weeks* in term** 30 weeks* in academic year This prorated amount is then divided by the number of terms: Javier will receive $3,335 for his attendance in both semesters. Note that this is less than his Scheduled Award; he may be able to receive the remainder of his Scheduled Award, plus up to an additional 50% of his Scheduled Award, if he enrolls at least-half time during the summer; see the Year-Round Pell & IASG section earlier in this chapter. The difference between Formula 2 and Formula 3 lies in whether you must make a separate calculation for each term. Under Formula 2, you do not have to perform a separate calculation based on the length of each term. Javier's Pell eligibility as a full-time student would be $1,667.50 under Formula 2. If Heyward College used Formula 3, the annual award would be prorated based on the length of each term: 14 weeks (14/30), 15 weeks (15/30), and 10 weeks (10/30), and Javier's payments for the payment periods would be $1,556.33, $1,667.50, and $1,111.66, respectively. Javier has remaining Pell eligibility for the summer term under both formulas. Javier may have additional eligibility for summer if he is enrolled at least half-time and eligible for Year-Round Pell or IASG; for more details, see the Year-Round Pell & IASG section earlier in this chapter. x $3,450 = $3,335 = $1,667.50$3,335 2 *These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 , which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year. **Fall through spring.APPENDIX A PELL FORMULA 2: CALCULATIONS FOR STANDARD-TERM PROGRAMS WITH LESS THAN 30 WEEKS IN FALL THROUGH SPRING The regulations provide an option for standard-term programs whose fall through spring terms provide less than 30 weeks of instructional time. Formula 2 may be advantageous for your summer term calculations. You may use Formula 2 if the program: has an academic calendar that consists of two semesters or trimesters (in the fall through the following spring) or three quarters (in the fall, winter, and spring); does not have overlapping terms; and measures progress in credit-hours and defines full-time enrollment for each term in the award year as at least 12 credit-hours.Formula 2 Alternate calculation Under Formula 2, you can perform the same alternate calculation as performed under Formula 1 if the weeks of instructional time in the defined academic year are the same as the total number of weeks of instructional time in all the terms in the award year. See the example for alternate calculation under the discussion of Formula 1 earlier in this chapter.Using Formula 2 34 CFR 690.63(a)(2), 690.63(c)Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Service Grant Awards3-75 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms APPENDIX B PELL FORMULA 5: CALCULATIONS FOR CORRESPONDENCE STUDY PROGRAMS Students enrolled in correspondence courses are eligible for aid under FSA programs only if the courses are part of a program leading to an associ - ate's, a bachelor's, or a graduate degree. Also, to be eligible, a correspondence program must meet the criteria for an eligible program (see Volume 2 of the FSA Handbook: Institutional Eligibility and Participation ). Pell Cost of Attendance (Correspondence) The cost of attendance for correspondence programs is limited to tuition and fees, and in certain cases, books and supplies. Traditionally, books and supplies have been included as part of the correspondence program's tuition. If books and supplies are not included in the program's tuition, they may be counted as costs, for either a residential or nonresidential period of enroll - ment. As always, the cost of attendance must be based on the costs for a full- time student for a full academic year for the relevant component (for corre - spondence COA, there would be no room and board, etc.). If the student's program or period of enrollment, as measured in credit-hours, is longer or shorter than an academic year as measured in credit-hours, the tuition and fees for the program or enrollment period must be prorated. Because the correspondence study cost of attendance for the nonresidential component only includes costs associated with credit-hours, your school always uses the credit-hour-related fraction to prorate the cost of attendance as follows (because there are no costs associated with weeks of instructional time in the correspondence cost of attendance, your school has to prorate the cost only if the number of hours in the program is shorter or longer than in an academic year): Credit-hours in program's definition of an academic year Credit-hours to which the costs apply The resulting amount is the full-time, full-academic-year cost used for calculating Pell Grant eligibility. When there is a residential portion in a correspondence student's program, Formula 3 or 4 (whichever applies) is used to calculate the student's payment for a payment period for a resi - dential portion. Refer to Formula 3 or 4 guidelines, including cost of atten - dance determinations, for this circumstance. Correspondence program highlights Pell cost of attendance limited to tuition and fees (and in some cases, books and supplies) The enrollment status for correspondence students can never be more than 1/2-time The enrollment status for a student who is taking both correspondence and regular coursework may be greater than 1/2-time Timing of payments within payment periods is different for correspondence students Formula 5A or 5B used to calculate awards for correspondence students Enrollment status cites for correspondence Term classes \u2014 34 CFR 690.66(c)(2) Combined with regular study \u2014 34 CFR 690.8 Academic coursework The term academic coursework does not necessarily refer to credits. If a student does not earn any credits until the end of the program, it may refer to the lessons or other measures of learning within a course or a program. For instance, if a course or program is made up of 40 equal lessons, the student reaches the halfway point as follows: If the student successfully completes the first 20 lessons before the calendar midpoint of the academic year, the second payment period does not begin until the calendar midpoint. If the student completes the first half of the academic year before successfully completing the first 20 lessons, the second payment period does not begin until the student successfully completes the first 20 lessons. Annual award The annual award for a student in a non-term correspondence program is always taken from the half-time payment schedule because a correspondence student can't receive more than half of a Scheduled Award. For a student in a term correspondence program, the annual award is determined from the half-time payment schedule or the less-than-half-time payment schedule, as appropriate. 34 CFR 690.66(a)(1) and (2)Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Pell Enrollment Status (Correspondence) Students enrolled in programs of correspondence study are consid - ered to be no more than half-time students, even if they're enrolled in enough coursework to be full-time. However, if the correspondence study is combined with regular coursework, the student's enrollment status might be more than half-time. A student enrolled only in a non-term correspondence program always has his or her award calculated based on the half-time payment schedule. For a student enrolled in a term-based correspondence program, your school must determine whether the student is enrolled half-time (6 or more credit- hours in a term) or less-than-half-time (less than 6 credit-hours in a term). Special rules are used to determine the student's enrollment status when the student is enrolled in a combination of regular and correspondence coursework. Pell Correspondence Payment periods & timing of payments For a non-term correspondence program, there must be two equal payment periods in each academic year. Each payment period is the lesser of half the academic year or half the program (measured in credit-hours). In addition, you can't disburse a Pell payment for the first payment period until the student has completed 25 percent of the work in the academic year or the program, whichever is shorter. You can't make the second payment until the student has completed 75 percent of the work in the academic year or program. For a term-based correspondence program, as for other term-based programs, the payment period is the term. However, you can't disburse the Pell for a payment period until the student has completed 50 percent of the lessons or completes 50 percent of the work for the term, whichever is later. If the correspondence program has a required period of residential training, you must treat the residential training as an additional payment period and determine the payment for that payment period using either Formula 3 or Formula 4. Note that the correspondence portion of the program is still treated as a separate portion of the program that's divided into two equal payment periods. Pell Calculations in Correspondence Programs Formula 5 is used for students enrolled only in correspondence courses (not including residential components of correspondence programs). There are two versions of Formula 5: Formula 5A (which is similar to Formula 4) is used for non-term programs, and Formula 5B (which is similar to Formula 3) is used for term-based programs. For a residential component of a corre - spondence program, your school must use either Formula 3 or Formula 4. If the residential component is a term, your school uses Formula 3; otherwise, it uses Formula 4. For non-term correspondence programs, this step of the calculation is similar to the step under Formula 4. For term correspondence programs, this step is the same as under Formula 3.Correspondence payment periods Non-term \u2014 34 CFR 690.66(b) Term \u2014 34 CFR 690.66(c)(3),(c)(4) Correspondence multiple formulas exception If a correspondence student has one or more payment periods in an award year that contain only correspondence study and one or more payment periods in the same award year that contain a residential portion, your school would use two different formulas for determining a student's payment for each payment period. This instance is the only one in which a school would use two different Pell formulas within the same award year for students in the same program.Chapter 3 \u2014 Calculating Pell & Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Awards3-77 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms For the Pell calculation, you are required to determine the number of weeks of instructional time in the program by preparing a written schedule for the lessons that the student will submit. A non-term correspondence program must require at least 12 hours of preparation per week. A term- based correspondence program must require at least 30 hours of preparation per semester hour or at least 20 hours of preparation per quarter-hour during the term. Non-term correspondence program\u2014Formula 5A You first multiply the annual award (taken from the half-time payment schedule) by the lesser of: Number of credit-hours in the payment period Credit-hours in program's academic year definition or Weeks* in the payment period Weeks* in program's academic year definition Term correspondence program\u2014Formula 5B You multiply the annual award (taken from the half-time or less-than- half-time payment schedule) by the weeks of instructional time in the term divided by the weeks in the academic year: Weeks* in term Weeks* in program's academic year definition A single disbursement for a payment period can never be more than 50 percent of the annual award. If the resulting amount is more than 50 percent of the annual award, your school must make the payment in at least two disbursements in that payment period. You may not disburse an amount that exceeds 50 percent of the annual award until the student has completed the period of time in the payment period that equals 50 percent of the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year definition. *Note: These fractions use weeks of instructional time as defined in Chapter 1 of this volume, which are not necessarily the same number as the calendar weeks in an academic year .Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19 3-78 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL FORMULA SUMMARIES If the student's enrollment status is full-time, the annual award is taken from the full-time payment schedule (Scheduled Award).

All disbursements of TEACH awards made during the federal fiscal year 2018 (on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2018) must be reduced by 6.6% from the award amount the student would otherwise be eligible to receive. Watch IFAP for news of sequester reductions in FY 19 (beginning on October 1, 2018).NEW *For more information on \"low-income\" school eligibility and the Teacher Cancellation Low Income program, see the E-Announcement of August 12, 2016, this chapter, we will illustrate the amounts a student may receive under the TEACH Grant program and show how to determine the correct grant award for each payment period. For more detail on TEACH Grant criteria and eligibility, see Volume 1 , Student Eligibility. For more on payment periods, see Chapter 1 of this volume, and for cost of attendance, see Chapter 2 of this volume. TEACH GRANT BASICS The TEACH Grant program is a non-need-based grant program that provides up to $4,000 per year to students who are enrolled in an eligible program and who agree to teach in a high-need field, at a low-income elementary or secondary school* as a highly qualified teacher, for at least four years within eight years of completing the program for which the TEACH Grant is awarded. The student must sign a service agreement to this effect and complete all required counseling prior to receiving a TEACH Grant. If the student subsequently fails to meet the requirements of the service agreement, the TEACH Grant will be treated as a Direct Unsubsidized loan, and the student must repay the TEACH Grant funds, with interest accrued from the date of disbursement, through the Department's TEACH Grant Servicer. For more details on the TEACH Grant service agreement, eligibility, and conversion from a grant to a loan, see Volume 1 . With respect to enrollment status, the program must require an undergraduate student to enroll for at least 12 credit-hours in each term in the award year to qualify as full-time. For a graduate student, each term in the award year must meet the minimum full-time enrollment status established by your school for a semester, trimester, or quarter. TEACH Grant regulations 34 CFR 686Calculating TEACH GrantsVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms TEACH Grant Scheduled, Annual, and Aggregate Awards The TEACH Grant award amounts are similar to Pell awards in that there is a Scheduled Award, which is the maximum that a full-time student would earn for a year, and an Annual Award, which is the amount a student would receive by enrolling for a year in an enrollment status (e.g., full-time, three-quarter-time, half-time, or less-than-half-time). The Scheduled Award for TEACH receive up to $16,000 in TEACH Grants for undergraduate and post-baccalaureate study, and up to $8,000 for a TEACH- eligible master's degree program. CALCULATING TEACH GRANT PAYMENTS FOR PAYMENT PERIODS As for other FSA programs, for purposes of calculating a TEACH Grant for a payment period, the definition of an academic year must include, for undergraduate programs of study (including those post-baccalaureate programs that are TEACH Grant eligible), both the required credit or clock- hours and weeks of instructional time (see Chapter 1 ). The formula you will use to calculate the amount of a student's TEACH Grant that will be awarded for a payment period depends on the academic calendar used by the student's program. These formulas are the same as for Pell Grants, with the exception of master's degree programs. For details on these payment formulas, see Chapter 3 of this volume. For master's degree programs, a TEACH Grant eligible program's academic year must be defined as at least the required number of weeks of instructional time and the minimum number of credit or clock-hours that a full-time student would be expected to complete in the weeks of instructional time. Note that no payment for a payment period may be less than $25. Crossover payment periods In the same way as for Pell Grants, if a student enrolls in a payment period that is scheduled to occur in two award years, the entire payment period must be considered to occur within one of those award years, and the school must pay the student for that payment period with funds from that award year. There is no requirement for a TEACH Grant crossover payment period to be placed in the same award year as Pell.TEACH Grant regulations Calculating TEACH for a payment period 34 CFR 686.22 Timing of payments & Lump sum payments 34 CFR 686.33 TEACH Grant Academic Year 34 CFR 686.22(h) Crossover periods 34 CFR 686.23 Transfer students 34 CFR 686.24 Payment for a payment period from two Scheduled Awards 34 CFR 686.22(i) When a student's payment period spans two different Scheduled Awards, the student's payment for the payment period is calcu - lated based on the total credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in the pay - ment period, and is the remaining amount of the Scheduled Award being completed plus an amount from the next Scheduled Award, (if available) up to the payment for the pay - ment period.

However, if more than six months of a payment period is scheduled to occur within one award year, you must place that payment period in that award year. Payment within payment period & retroactive payment Within each payment period, you may pay the student at such times and in such installments as you determine will best meet the student's needs. You may pay a student TEACH Grant funds in one lump sum for all prior payment periods for which the student was eligible within the award year, as long as the student has signed the agreement to serve prior to disbursement of the TEACH Grant (for more details on the agreement to serve and TEACH Grant eligibility, see Volume 1 ). Transfer students A student who receives a TEACH Grant at one institution and subsequently enrolls at a second institution may receive a TEACH Grant at the second institution if the second institution obtains the student's valid SAR or ISIR with an official EFC. The second institution may pay a TEACH Grant only for that period in which a student is enrolled in a TEACH Grant-eligible program at that institution. The second institution must calculate the student's award using the appropriate formula, unless the remaining balance of the Scheduled Award at the second institution is the balance of the student's last Scheduled Award and is less than the amount the student would normally receive for that payment period. A transfer student must repay any amount received in an award year that exceeds the amount which he or she was eligible to receive. A student may not receive TEACH Grant payments concurrently from more than one school.Required TEACH Grant counseling 34 CFR 686.32 Before receiving a TEACH Grant, a student must, among other requirements, complete initial and subsequent counseling on the TEACH website. You must ensure that exit counseling is conducted with each TEACH Grant recipient when that student ceases to attend the school at a time determined by the school. The exit counseling must be in person, by audio-visual presentation, or by interactive electronic means (such as the TEACH Grant website ). In each case, you must ensure that an indi - vidual with expertise in the FSA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the grant recipient's questions. (In the case of a grant recipient enrolled in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved for credit at the home school, the grant recipient may be provided with written counseling materials within 30 days after he or she completes the program.) It is the school's responsibility to see that TEACH recipients receive exit counseling when the student is no longer enrolled in the program. You will receive reports from the Department on all students who have completed counseling. If the student doesn't complete the exit counseling session on the TEACH website, you must ensure that exit counseling is provided either in person, through interactive electronic means, or by mailing written counseling materials (such as the PDF version of the exit counseling program on the TEACH website) to the grant recipient's last known address. In the case of unannounced withdrawals, you must provide this counseling within 30 days of learning that a grant recipient has withdrawn from school (or from a TEACH Grant-eligible program).Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-88 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms TEACH GRANT FORMULAS The requirements for calculating a TEACH Grant payment for a payment period are exactly the same as Federal Pell Grant program requirements and use the same formulas as the Pell Grant program. TEACH Grant formulas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are identical to the corresponding Pell formulas. The school disburses a TEACH Grant, like Pell, over the hours and weeks of instruction in an eligible program's academic year, as defined by the school. As with Pell Grants, TEACH Grant Scheduled Awards are divided into at least two payments based on the payment periods in a year. The calculation formula you use depends on the academic calendar of a student's eligible program and would be the same formula used to calculate payments of Pell Grants for that academic program. For students ineligible for Pell Grants, such as master's degree students, you must use the calculation formula that corresponds to the academic calendar of the eligible student's program. Refer to Chapter 3 of this volume on Pell Grants for a more detailed explanation of these formulas. A student's payment for a payment period is calculated based on the coursework in the student's TEACH Grant-eligible program. For a TEACH Grant, the school must ensure that the student's courses are necessary for the student to complete the student's TEACH Grant-eligible program.TEACH Grant Formula 2 34 CFR 686.22(a)(2),(c) TEACH Grant Formula 3 34 CFR 686.22(a)(3),(d)TEACH Grant Formula 1 34 CFR 686.22(a)(1),(b) TEACH Grant Formula 4 34 CFR 686.22(a)(4),(e) TEACH Grant Formula 5 34 CFR 686.25Chapter TEACH Grants3-89 FSA CFR Acronyms TEACH recalculations 34 CFR 686.35RECALCULATING TEACH GRANTS Recalculating for changes in enrollment status If a student's enrollment status changes from one term to another within the same award year, you must recalculate the TEACH Grant award for the new payment period, taking into account any changes in the cost of attendance. If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, you may (but are not required to) establish a policy under which you recalculate such a student's TEACH Grant award. Any such recalculations must take into account any changes in the cost of attendance. In the case of an undergraduate or post-baccalaureate program of study, if such a policy is established, it must match your Pell Grant recalculation policy, and you must apply the policy to all students in the TEACH-eligible program. If a student's enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, you must recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which he or she actually began attendance. Recalculating for changes in cost of attendance If a student's cost of attendance changes during the award year and his or her enrollment status remains the same, your school may , but is not required to, establish a policy under which you recalculate the student's TEACH Grant award. If you establish such a policy, you must apply it to all students in the program.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, request Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for a student, a school must certify that the borrower is eligible for the loan award, and must provide specific amounts and dates for each disbursement of the loan award. A borrower's eligibility for a Direct Loan is calculated differently than for a Pell Grant. There are no fixed tables such as the Pell Grant Payment and Disbursement Schedules that determine award amounts. Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all students at a given grade level and dependency status. In general, you may not originate a loan for more than the: amount the borrower requests; borrower's cost of attendance (see Chapter 2 ); borrower's annual or aggregate limit, as described in this chapter); or borrower's unmet financial need (as determined using the rules in Chapter 7 of this volume). In Direct Loans, the loan certification is part of the loan origination record sent electronically to the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system. You must provide this certification each time you make a loan under a Master Promissory Note (MPN). The school's origination includes the borrower's grade level, loan period, anticipated disbursement dates, the amounts of the disbursements (using the rules described in this chapter), and other information. Direct Loan Periods and Amounts The rules for awarding Direct Loans are different than for Pell Grants and other FSA programs. For Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans, there are annual loan limits that vary by grade level, and there are aggregate limits on the total (cumulative) loan amount that may be outstanding at one time. The loan period, payment period, and disbursements within that period may not always correspond to the payment periods you use for Pell Grants. The requirement to prorate Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan limits under certain circumstances is different than the requirements for calculating Pell Grants.

This discussion assumes that your school has already established its academic measurements. If you have not already done so, see Chapter 1 of this volume for a discussion of eligible programs, academic years, payment periods, and conversion of clock-hours/credit-hours. With the passage of the subsidized loan eligibility time limit (commonly referred to as the 150% subsidized loan limit), it is more important than ever that you accurately report academic year dates and loan period dates for all types of Direct Loans to COD. You must also update a loan's previously reported loan period dates or academic year dates if the borrower's actual attendance is different from the anticipated dates that were the basis for an initial reporting to COD. Some examples of when you must update loan data in COD include: If the borrower requests that a loan, or a disbursement of a loan be cancelled; When the borrower does not begin attendance, or does not begin attendance on at least a half-time basis, in a payment period that was included in the originally reported loan period and you did not make any disbursements for that payment period; When you determine that the borrower is not eligible to receive a Direct Loan for a payment period that was part of the originally reported loan period (for example, failure to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress standards, the borrower has an overpayment, or a change in circumstances makes the borrower ineligible for a subsidized loan); When the borrower withdraws during a payment period that was included in the originally reported loan period, and as a result, the entire amount of the loan that was intended for that payment period is returned under the Return of Title IV Aid (R2T4) calculation; For clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and certain types of nonstandard term credit-hour program, the borrower fails to progress to the next payment period or academic year as scheduled. For more detail on the requirements of the 150% subsidized loan limit, see the Subsidized Loan Eligibility Time Limitation section later in this chapter. For details on submitting date and academic year data to COD, see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-13-13 and the 150% FAQs on the topic, available on IFAP.Minimum and maximum loan periods 34 CFR 685.301(a)(10) Maximum: Generally the school's academic year. Greater than an academic year if the loan is for the length of a program that is longer than an academic year, and you apply the annual loan limit to that longer period. Minimum in standard-term programs and SE9W programs: one academic term. Minimum in all other programs; i.e., clock- hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term: Except for certain transfer students, the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if less than full program remaining) or the academic year. For transfer students whose period of enrollment overlaps a period of enrollment for which the student received a loan at a prior school, the remaining portion of the program or academic year. Period of enrollment (loan period) 34 CFR 685.102(b) The period of enrollment for which a Direct Loan is intended must coincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g., semester, trimester, quarter, length of the student's program, or academic year). The period of enrollment is also referred to as the loan period. FSA Assessments For a guide to reviewing and evaluating your procedures regarding Direct Loans, see the Direct Loans module of FSA Assessments: http://ifap.ed.gov/qahome/fsaassessment.html .Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms A credit-hour program uses standard terms (semesters, trimesters, or quarters), or has nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length, with each term at least 9 weeks in length (see \"Nonstandard SE9W terms\" sidebar later in this chapter). The minimum loan period is a single academic term (e.g., a semester). As an example, if a student will be enrolled in the fall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan for that term alone. (Remember, however, that the loan amount must be based on the reduced costs and EFC for that term, rather than for the full academic year.) For all other programs, including clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, the minimum loan period is the lesser of: the academic year as defined by the school (see Chapter 1 ); the length of the student's program (if the program is shorter than an academic year); or the remaining portion of the program (if the remaining portion of the student's program is less than an academic year). For these other programs, there are exceptions to the minimum loan period rule describe above, if: a student transfers into the school, and the prior school originated a loan for an academic year that overlaps the academic year at the new school; or a student completes a program at a school, where the student's last loan to complete that program had been for less than an academic year, and the student then begins a new program at the same school. In these circumstances, you may originate an initial loan for a loan period that ends on the ending date of the academic year at the first school from which the student transferred, or on the ending date of the academic year associated with the prior program completed at your school. In either of these cases, the loan amount must not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the loan level associated with the new program. For all programs, the maximum loan period for annual loan limits is generally the school's academic year. However, the loan period may exceed the school's academic year if the annual loan limit is applied to a longer period of time (e.g., if the academic year is defined as 900 clock-hour, but a school applies the annual loan limit to the entire length of an 1100 clock- hour program).Direct Loans at multiple schools Unlike Pell Grants, it is possible for a student who is separately enrolled and eligible at multiple schools to get a Direct Subsidized/ Unsubsidized Loan (and for a graduate/ professional student or parent to receive a Direct PLUS Loan) at more than one school for the same period. The schools that the student is attending are responsible for coordinating to make sure that the total amount of the loans the student receives does not exceed the applicable annual loan limit. In addition, the schools must ensure that there is no duplication of non-institutional costs when determining the student's cost of attendance. (Note that in this case, which is different than the consortium arrangements discussed in Volume 2 , loan funds awarded at one school are not to be included as estimated financial assistance by any other school the student is attending when determining the student's loan eligibility for the same period.)Requirement to offer both subsidized and unsubsidized loans DCL GEN-11-07 Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program. A school may not choose to make only Direct Subsidized Loans or only Direct Unsubsidized Loans available to its eligible students.

The school, not the Department, determines the borrower's eligibility for a Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans for ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan limits or the borrowers' need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as well as liabilities such as repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans. A school may not originate a loan for a period that includes hours in an academic year in which the student is no longer enrolled (regardless of whether a student has ceased attendance or advanced to the next academic year). Similarly, you may not condition the disbursement of a loan on anything other than the eligibility criteria.Originating a loan For all Direct Loans, you must document the student's cost of attendance, expected family contribution (EFC), and estimated financial assistance (EFA) in the student's file. This information must be made available to the Department upon request. HEA Sec. 479(A)(c), 34 CFR 685.301(a)(8), DCL GEN-11-07 On a case-by-case basis, you may refuse to originate the loan for an individual borrower, or you may originate a loan for an amount less than the borrower's maximum eligibility. If you choose to exercise this discretion, you must ensure that your decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and do not constitute a pattern or practice that denies access to borrowers because of race, sex, color, income, religion, national origin, age, or handicapped status. When you make a decision not to originate a loan or to reduce the amount of the loan, you must document the reasons and provide the explanation to the student in writing. Also note that your school may not have a policy of limiting Direct Loan borrowing on an across-the-board or categorical basis. For example, you may not have a policy of limiting borrowing to the amount needed to cover the school charges, or not allowing otherwise eligible students to receive the \"additional\" Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts that are available under the annual loan limits. Refusing to originate a loan or originating for less than maximum eligibility For parents receiving a Direct PLUS Loan, ensure the student has completed a FAFSA (review student's SAR/ISIR); Determine that the student is enrolled at least half-time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1 ); Review the NSLDS information on the ISIR to ensure that the student is not in default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1 ), and will not exceed the annual or aggregate loan limits (as described in this chapter); Ensure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student's financial need (see Chapter 7 of this volume); and Ensure that the loan disbursement dates meet cash management and disbursement requirements.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-95 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms ANNUAL LOAN LIMITS Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans have annual loan limits, based on the student's dependency status and grade level. There are higher Direct Unsubsidized annual loan limits for borrowers enrolled in certain health professions programs, and special loan limits for certain students who are not enrolled in a degree or certificate program. In some cases, for undergraduate students, the annual loan limits must be prorated (reduced). The annual loan limits are the maximum amounts that a student may receive for an academic year. The actual loan amount that a borrower is eligible to receive may be less than the annual loan limit. Depending on the academic calendar of the program, a student who has reached the annual loan limit cannot receive another Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan until he or she either begins another academic year, or, in some cases, progresses within an academic year to a grade level with a higher annual loan limit. Annual loan limits Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans have annual loan limits. There is an overall annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, of which not more than a specified amount may be comprised of subsidized loans. An undergraduate student who is ineligible for Direct Subsidized Loans may receive up to the total subsidized/ unsubsidized annual loan limit in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The Direct Subsidized Loan annual loan limits are the same for both dependent and independent undergraduates. Dependent students have lower total subsidized/ unsubsidized annual loan limits than independent students; if a dependent student's parent(s) cannot borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, the student becomes eligible for the higher total subsidized/unsubsidized annual loan limits that apply to an independent student, allowing the dependent student to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. The annual loan limits apply to the academic year (that is, the annual loan limit is the maximum loan amount that a student may receive for one academic year). The student's maximum annual loan limit increases as the student progresses to higher grade levels. For undergraduate students, the loan limit must be prorated if the student is attending a program (or remaining portion of a program) that is less than an academic year. Graduate/professional students are no longer eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans.Annual loan limit progression: SAY/BBAY For Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS Loans, a school must use either a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) or a Borrower- Based Academic Year (BBAY) to determine when a student is eligible for a new annual loan limit. An SAY generally begins/ends at the same time each year; a BBAY \"floats\" with the student's enrollment. A traditional calendar program or an SE9W program with a comparable calendar may use an SAY. A clock-hour or non-term program, or a program that does not have an SAY, must use a BBAY. In a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, or a program with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W, the borrower must successfully complete the credit/clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in the Title IV academic year before the borrower is eligible for a new annual loan limit. In a standard-term or SE9W program, it is possible for a student to advance a grade level and become eligible for a higher loan amount within an academic year.Annual loan limits: Basic principles Direct Loan limits Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA) (Dear Colleague Letter GEN-08-08) HEA Sec. 425(a)(1)(A) HEA Sec. 428(b)(1)(A) HEA Sec. 428H(d) 34 CFR 685.203 Minimum Direct Loan amount When originating Direct Loans in the COD system, there is no minimum loan amount.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-96 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan limits for a dependent undergraduate student Dependent undergraduate students (excluding dependent undergraduates whose parents are unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans) are eligible for an additional $2,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds each academic year. For these students, the annual loan limits are: $3,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $2,000 additional Direct Unsubsidized for dependent first- year undergraduates; $4,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $2,000 additional Direct Unsubsidized for dependent second- year undergraduates; and $5,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $2,000 additional Direct Unsubsidized for dependent third-, fourth-, or fifth-year undergraduates. These loan limits represent the total of all Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans a dependent undergraduate student may borrow at each level of study for a single academic year. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate may receive up to $5,500 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be subsidized. A dependent first-year undergraduate who has no subsidized loan eligibility could receive up to the full $5,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Increased Direct Unsubsidized limits for independent undergraduate students and dependent undergraduate students whose parents can't get Direct PLUS Loans There are higher additional unsubsidized annual loan limits for independent undergraduate students. These higher additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits also apply to dependent undergraduate students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other documented exceptional circumstances. $3,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $6,000 additional Direct Unsubsidized for independent first- year undergraduates; $4,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $6,000 additional Direct Unsubsidized for independent second-year undergraduates; and $5,500 combined Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized plus $7,000 additional unsubsidized for independent third-, fourth-, or fifth-year undergraduates.Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loans DCL GEN 12-01 The federal government does not charge interest on a Direct Subsidized student loan during: in-school status, deferment periods, and (except for Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014) the grace period. The student is responsible for paying the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized student loan during all periods. Increasing the loan amount when student changes dependency status during the academic year For any type of educational program (whether term-based or non-term, credit- hour or clock-hour), a dependent student who has already borrowed up to the annual loan limit within an academic year may be eligible to receive additional loan funds if his or her dependency status changes to independent during that same academic year.Increased Direct Unsubsidized limits for independent undergraduate students and dependent undergraduate students whose parents can't get Direct PLUS Loans 34 CFR 685.203(c)(1)(ii) DCL GEN 11-07 Direct Loans for students whose parents have ended financial support and refuse to file a FAFSA Schools may offer a dependent student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if the student's parents have ended financial support and refuse to file a FAFSA. For more detail, see Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide and DCL GEN-08-12. Using school's definition of academic year if longer than the Title IV minimum A school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If so, then it's the school's standard - not the statutory minimum - that applies when determining whether a program or a final period of study is shorter than an academic year.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-97 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms As with the loan limits for dependent undergraduates, these loan limits represent the total of all Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans that an independent undergraduate student (or a dependent undergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan) may borrow at each level of study, for a single academic year. For example, an independent, first-year undergraduate may receive up to $9,500 in Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans for a single academic year, but no more than $3,500 of this amount may be subsidized. Note that a dependent undergraduate whose parent is unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan is not eligible to receive both the $2,000 in additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds described here, and the additional $6,000 or $7,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds that are available to independent undergraduates and dependent undergraduates whose parents are unable to obtain Direct PLUS Loans. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits for graduate and professional students The annual loan limit for graduate or professional students is $20,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans per academic year. The regulations define a graduate/professional student as a student who is enrolled in a program or course above the baccalaureate level or in a professional program and has completed the equivalent of 3 academic years of full-time study either prior to entering the program or as part of the program itself . Also, a student who is receiving Title IV aid as an undergraduate student can't be considered a graduate/professional student for that same period of enrollment. To satisfy the requirement that a graduate student has completed 3 academic years of full-time study, a student must have completed a minimum of at least 72 credit/semester hours, or the equivalent number of quarter hours (at least 108). You may also assign a higher number of credits required to satisfy the credit requirement component to be considered a graduate student at your school, for example, 90 credit/semester hours (which may match your school's grade level progression standard for Direct Loans). Note that these three academic year's worth of credits may be taken over a longer or shorter period of time than three calendar years in the program. Note that a student in an undergraduate program can't get the graduate loan limits based on taking graduate coursework as a part of the undergraduate program. In contrast, a graduate student who is taking some undergraduate coursework is eligible for the graduate loan limits if the student is enrolled at least half-time in courses (either graduate or undergraduate) that can be applied to the graduate program requirements. However, the student must already be admitted into the graduate program. A borrower with a bachelor's degree who is taking preparatory work for graduate school (or whose full admission to the graduate program is contingent upon completion of certain undergraduate courses) is not eligible for graduate loan limits.Example: Additional Unsubsidized for independent undergraduate Dottie is a first-year independent undergraduate student at Russell's Institute. Her COA is $14,500, her EFC is 1800, and she is receiving a $2,981 Pell Grant. Dottie qualifies for a Direct Subsidized Loan of $3,500. She may also receive the maximum additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount of $6,000 to cover most of her unmet need. Her total loan amount in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans is $9,500. (Note that Dottie's loan eligibility would be the same if she were a dependent undergraduate whose parent was unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan.)

The $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit shown here for graduate and professional students includes subsidized loans received before subsidized loan eligibility was eliminated for those students and prior subsidized loans received for undergraduate study.Annual Limits for Sub/Unsub Loans Note: All undergraduate annual loan amounts are subject to proration. ....................... $ 138,500*Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Direct PLUS Loan amounts for parents & graduate/professional students There are no fixed annual or aggregate loan limits for Direct PLUS Loans. A graduate or professional student may be awarded a Direct PLUS Loan for up to the student's COA minus other EFA (see Chapter 7 for packaging rules). Therefore, a graduate/professional student may have additional PLUS eligibility beyond the maximum unsubsidized loan limits. Similarly, the total Direct PLUS Loan amount borrowed by one parent or borrowed separately by more than one parent on behalf of a dependent student (including a non-custodial parent) may not exceed the student's estimated cost of attendance minus other financial aid awarded for the period of enrollment. This is the only borrowing limit for Direct PLUS Loans. For more on borrower eligibility, see Volume 1 , Chapter 6 . Increased unsubsidized eligibility for health professions students Certain health professions students may borrow increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts. Schools may award the increased unsubsidized amounts to students who are enrolled at least half-time in certain health professions programs. The program must be accredited by specific accrediting agencies (see chart). The increased unsubsidized amounts that an eligible health professions student may receive are in addition to the regular annual loan limits. The disciplines that are eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts and the approved accrediting agencies for these disciplines are shown in the loan limit chart for the increased unsubsidized amounts at the end of this section. A chart at the end of this section shows the annual loan limits for the increased unsubsidized loan amounts, which vary by discipline and academic year length. The combined subsidized/unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students who are eligible to receive the increased unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans, for those students who may have received subsidized loans for graduate/professional study prior to July 1, 2012, or for undergraduate study. If a student receives the additional Direct Loan amounts on the basis of study in a health profession program but then leaves that program and enters a program in a different non-health professions field, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Loan limits. However, the additional loan amounts received on the basis of health professions study are not counted toward the normal aggregate loan limit for that student. Requirement to offer Direct PLUS Loans to both parent and student borrowers DCL GEN-11-07 If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan Program and has both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available to both the parents of your dependent undergraduate students and to your graduate/professional students.

See Chapter 3 of this volume for more detail on standard terms. A standard-term program may use an SAY if it has a traditional academic calendar (i.e., has terms that start at about the same time each year, where, for example, the fall and spring semesters or the fall, winter, and spring quarters normally make up the academic year). Nonstandard \"SE9W\" terms If a credit-hour program has nonstandard terms, the terms are substantially equal in length, and each term is at least 9 weeks of instructional time in length, then the terms, for annual loan limit progression purposes, are referred to throughout this chapter as \"SE9W.\" The length of terms is measured in weeks of instructional time, as defined in Chapter 1. Nonstandard terms are substantially equal if no term in the loan period is more than 2 weeks of instructional time longer than any other term in that loan period. A nonstandard program with SE9W terms may use an SAY if all of the following requirements are met: it has a fixed academic calendar comparable to a traditional academic calendar (i.e., terms that start at about the same time each year, where 2 or more nonstandard terms normally make up the academic year in the fall through spring); all of the nonstandard terms, including any summer term, are SE9W; and the number of credit hours and weeks of instructional time in the comparable fall-spring academic calendar meet the regulatory requirements for an academic year. Academic Year See Volume 3, Chapter 1 for a discussion of academic year requirements.ANNUAL LOAN LIMIT PROGRESSION Academic Year & Loan Limits The academic year is used as the basis for the student's annual loan limits. (The award year concept for Pell and the Campus-Based Programs is not a factor for Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans.) The loan period is often equivalent to an academic year, but there are also many situations where this is not the case. In this section, we'll discuss how you can match the student's loan periods to his/her enrollment and your school's academic calendar. (If you are not familiar with the definition of an academic year, see Chapter 1 of this volume.) Two types of academic years for monitoring annual loan limits: Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) and Borrower Based Academic Year (BBAY) There are two types of academic years that may be used to monitor annual loan limits for Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans: a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) or a Borrower-Based Academic Year (BBAY). (Note that although there is no annual loan limit for Direct PLUS Loans, Direct PLUS Loans are awarded for the same SAY or BBAY period that is used for Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans.) An SAY corresponds to a traditional academic year calendar that is published in a school's catalogue or other materials, and is a fixed period of time that begins and ends at the same time each year. Examples of SAYs for a standard term program are fall and spring semesters, or fall, winter, and spring quarters. For a nonstandard SE9W program, an SAY could consist of two or more SE9W nonstandard terms running from fall through spring. For both standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, the number of credit hours and weeks of instructional time in the fall through spring SAY period must meet the regulatory requirements for an academic year. A BBAY does not have fixed beginning and ending dates. Instead, it \"floats\" with a student's (or group of students') attendance and progression in a program of study. There are 3 types of BBAY, described below. If a program is offered in an SAY calendar, you have the option of using either an SAY or BBAY 1 to monitor the annual loan limits for students in that program. You must use a Borrower Based Academic Year (BBAY) to monitor the annual loan limits for any academic program that does not meet the definition of a program allowed to use an SAY. However, there are significant differences between the different types of BBAY: BBAY 1, for credit-hour programs using an SAY with standard terms or nonstandard SE9W terms. BBAY 2, for credit-hour programs not using an SAY , with standard terms or nonstandard SE9W terms. BBAY 3, for clock-hour programs, non-term programs, programs with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W , or programs with standard and nonstandard terms not described above.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-102 FSA HB 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms SE9W SAY Example Baez Business College has programs with an academic calendar using semester hours with three quarters, each 12 weeks of instructional time in length, offered over the fall through spring (comparable to a traditional academic year calendar) and a 10 week term offered in the summer. Baez defines its academic year as 36 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester hours. As \"quarters\" using semester hours, the terms are nonstandard terms. Because these terms are nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine weeks of instructional time in length (SE9W), and are offered in a fixed schedule that encompasses the Title IV academic year (plus the summer term), with an academic calendar comparable to a traditional calendar, Baez may use an SAY (with the summer term treated as a trailer or header) or BBAY 1 (consisting of any three consecutive terms) for these programs.We will describe the differences between the SAY, BBAY 1, BBAY 2, and BBAY 3 in more detail in the following pages. Credit-hour programs with traditional calendar using standard terms or nonstandard SE9W terms with a comparable calendar: may use SAY As noted previously, an SAY corresponds to a traditional academic year calendar, and usually begins and ends at the same time each calendar year (for example, beginning on the first day of the fall semester and ending on the last day of the spring semester). An SAY must meet the FSA requirements for an academic year (as defined in Chapter 1 ). An SAY may include one or more terms that a student does not attend. Summer terms are generally not considered to be part of the SAY, but for loan limit purposes they may be treated as a \"trailer\" to the preceding SAY or as a \"header\" to the following SAY. Your school has the option to establish a policy that designates its summer term as either a trailer or header to the SAY for all students. You can also choose to make different designations for different educational programs, or for different students, as long as you ensure that there is no overlap in academic years. Note that a fixed designation of the summer term can limit a student's eligibility. For instance, if you always treat your summer term as a trailer to a preceding fall- spring SAY, a student who receives the full annual loan limit for fall-spring would have no remaining loan eligibility for summer. The annual loan limit applies to the SAY, plus the summer trailer or header. Once the calendar period associated with all of the terms in the SAY and the summer header or trailer (if any) has elapsed, a student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit. Credit-hour programs with an SAY: may use BBAY 1 If a program is offered in a SAY, you have the option of using a BBAY as an alternative to the SAY for monitoring annual loan limit progression. Unlike an SAY, a BBAY is not a fixed period that begins and ends at the same time each year. Instead, a BBAY's beginning and ending dates depend on the individual student's enrollment. For programs with an SAY, a BBAY must include the same number of terms as the SAY that would otherwise be used (not including any summer \"trailer\" or \"header\"). For example, if the SAY includes three quarters (fall, winter, spring), a BBAY would consist of any three consecutive terms. A BBAY may include terms the student does not attend if the student could have enrolled at least half-time in those terms, but (unlike an SAY) it must begin with a term in which the student is actually enrolled (even though the student may be enrolled less-than-half-time for the first term and not eligible for a loan for that term). Also, any minisessions (summer or otherwise) that run consecutively within a term must be combined and treated as a single term. Like an SAY, a BBAY must meet the minimum FSA requirements for an academic year. However, a BBAY that includes a summer term may include fewer than 30 weeks of instructional time or fewer credit hours than the minimum number required for an SAY. This is because a summer term may be shorter than a standard term in an SAY, but is recognized as academically Treatment of summer minisessions Summer minisessions must be grouped together as a single trailer or header term if the program is to have a BBAY, or they can be treated separately and assigned to different SAYs. If the summer minisessions are grouped and treated as a single term, the summer COA cannot include costs for a minisession for which the student is not expected to be enrolled.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-103 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms equivalent to a standard term when used as one of the terms in a BBAY. (Note: This exception applies only to a BBAY used as an alternative for a program with an SAY.) You may use BBAYs for all students, only for students in certain programs, or on a student-by-student basis. For example, you could use a BBAY for students enrolled in a program that begins in a term other than the first term of the SAY. You can even alternate BBAYs and SAYs for a student, provided the academic years don't overlap. This treatment may allow a student to receive another loan sooner than would be allowed under an SAY standard. As with an SAY, the annual loan limit applies to the BBAY. Once the calendar period associated with all of the terms in the BBAY has elapsed, a student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit. Standard-term programs and nonstandard term SE9W programs without an SAY: BBAY 2 If a program with standard terms or nonstandard SE9W terms is not offered in a traditional academic year calendar (SAY), a BBAY must be used. If the program uses semesters or trimesters, a BBAY generally consists of any two consecutive terms (similarly, with quarters, any three consecutive terms). If the program uses SE9W nonstandard terms, a BBAY consists of the number of consecutive terms that coincide with the weeks of instructional time in the program's academic year. As with the optional BBAY that may be used for programs with an SAY, the BBAY may include terms that a student does not attend (as long as the student could have enrolled at least half-time in those terms), but it must Soler Academy also has a program that measures academic progress in credit-hours and uses 15- week semesters, but is not offered in a traditional academic year calendar (SAY). New students begin the program each month, and a 15-week semester begins at that time for that cohort of students. The school must use a BBAY to monitor annual loan limits. A BBAY consists of any two consecutive semesters, beginning with a semester in which a student is enrolled:Standard term, credit-hour programs not using a traditional academic year calendar: BBAY 2 Year 1: BBAY Year 2: Semester #6Alternating SAY/BBAY 1 This treatment may allow a student to receive another loan sooner than would be allowed under an SAY standard. For instance, if you normally use an SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters with a summer trailer, a student who received the maximum annual loan limit for fall-spring could not receive another loan until the start of a new SAY in the fall. If the student enrolls for summer and wants a loan, you could choose to switch the student to a BBAY consisting of the summer and fall terms. The student could then receive a loan for the summer term, since summer would be the start of a new academic year. A school that has these choices for academic year standards must have a written policy that explains how it applies these options when calculating loan eligibility. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-104 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms begin with a term in which the student is actually enrolled (even though the student may be enrolled less-than-full-time for the first term and not eligible for a loan for that term). Unlike the optional BBAY for programs offered in an SAY, there is no exception to the minimum requirements for a BBAY that includes a summer term: the BBAY for standard-term programs that are not offered in a traditional academic calendar, or a comparable calendar if SE9W nonstandard terms, must always include enough terms to meet the minimum Title IV academic year requirements for weeks of instructional time. The annual loan limit applies to the BBAY. Once the calendar period associated with all of the terms in the BBAY has elapsed, a student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit. Clock-hour, non-term credit-hour, and nonstandard-term programs that All clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and nonstandard-term programs with terms that are not SE9W must use a BBAY that meets the minimum requirements for an academic year. That is, the BBAY must contain at least 30 (or, for clock-hour programs, 26) weeks of instructional time and at least the minimum number of credit or clock-hours: for undergraduate programs, 24 semester or trimester hours, 36 quarter-hours, or 900 clock-hours; for graduate programs, the number of hours a student would complete under the school's full-time standard in the weeks of the Title IV academic year, which must be a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time, or, for clock-hour programs, at least 26 weeks of instructional time. This requirement also applies to a program that consists of both standard and nonstandard terms and that does not qualify to use an SAY. The BBAY begins when a student enrolls and does not end until the later of the date the student successfully completes the hours in the academic year or the number of weeks of instructional time in the academic year. Because a student must successfully complete the minimum number of hours or weeks of instructional time in an academic year (whichever comes later) before a new BBAY begins, a student's enrollment status may affect how soon the student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit. For example, a student who is attending part-time will take longer to complete a BBAY than a full-time student. (In contrast, an SAY or BBAY for a standard-term program, or a nonstandard SE9W program, ends when the calendar period associated with the terms in the SAY or BBAY has elapsed, regardless of how many credit-hours or weeks of instruction the student completed during the SAY or BBAY.) Individual academic progress in BBAY 3 In many clock-hour, non-term, and nonstandard-term programs, students are allowed to progress at an individual pace. For example, a school that defines its academic year as 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks of instructional time offers a 900 clock-hour program that most students complete in 26 weeks. However, one student might complete 900 clock-hours in 22 weeks, and another in 30 weeks. You do not have to prorate the loan limit for the occasional student who completes the program in less than 26 weeks. (Note that this policy applies only to programs that are exactly one academic year in length. If a program is longer than an academic year, proration may be required for a loan covering the remaining portion of the program if a student completes more than the minimum number of hours during the first 26 weeks of instructional time. See loan limit proration example 3 later in this chapter). BBAY 3 and programs with standard terms If a program has standard terms and nonstandard terms and does not qualify to use an SAY, the program must use BBAY 3. One common example is a program with a 4-1-4 calendar (2 semesters of 4 months each, with a 1 month winter intersession in between) where the winter intersession is not combined with either the fall or spring semester. It is not permissible to ignore a student's enrollment in a winter intersession. Another common example is a degree- completion program with 20-week nonstandard terms where students must also attend regular semesters to complete their degree.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-105 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR with an SAY or BBAY Credit-hour programs offered in a Scheduled Academic Y ear (SAY)An SAY uses 1) a traditional academic calendar with at least two semesters or trimesters or three quarters in the fall through spring, or 2) a comparable academic calendar with nonstandard SE9W terms, if a) all of the nonstandard terms, including the summer term, are SE9W , and b) the number of hours/weeks in the comparable fall-spring academic calendar meets the regulatory requirements for an academic year.Credit-hour programs not offered in a Scheduled Academic Y ear, but with 1) standard terms, or 2) nonstandard SE9W termsClock-hour programs, non-term programs, and programs with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W1) An SAY generally begins/ends at same time each year.2) The student does not have to be enrolled in the first term of the SAY. 3) An SAY for a program must at least meet the program's Title IV academic year in weeks/hours.4) Total of all loans received within SAY (including summer trailer/header) may not exceed annual loan limit5) Student becomes eligible for new annual loan limit after SAY calendar period has elapsed. 6) After original loan, student may receive additional loans during same SAY if: Student did not receive maximum annual loan amount and has remaining eligibility; Student progresses to grade level with higher annual loan limit; or Student changes from dependent to independent.7) Summer term may be \"trailer\" or \"header\" per: Strict policy; By program; or Case by case, by student.

Modules may use standard, non- standard, or non-term academic calendars. Modules and the courses offered as modules may overlap terms, and enrollment may begin at the beginning of any module. You award loans for modules based on courses for which the student is enrolled. If a student doesn't remain enrolled at least half-time, their subsequent loan disbursements are cancelled. For Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules, however, COA for such a period of enrollment may not include costs for a period in which the student is not expected to be enrolled. For modules, the loan period includes the entire term (which may be comprised of several combined modules, or modules combined with other full-term length courses). A student's payment period for a module begins with the module in which they first attend (you may not schedule a disbursement during a period of non-attendance. The structure of a modular term can transform a standard term into a non-standard term if the begin/end dates are not within 2 weeks of a standard term. Direct Loans and intersessions When offering an intersession between two standard terms (for example, 3 weeks of instructional time between two 15-week semesters), or a shorter summer term (for example, 12 weeks of instructional time with a 12-semester hour full-time standard), you must offer aid to eligible students. You may either combine intersessions with standard terms, or treat them as a separate term. When awarding aid for intersessions, you must apply the same awarding and packaging treatment to all students enrolled in the program, and if merged, you must merge the same term in the same manner for all students in the program (and whether merged or not, you must not include costs in a student's COA for a period of non-attendance during a period of intersessions for which the student is not expected to be enrolled).COA for intersessions and modules Whether or not you merge an intersession or module with a standard term, you must not include costs in a student's COA for an intersession or module period of enrollment for which the student is not expected to be enrolled.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-107 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Intersessions a standard term: You may combine an intersession with a standard term. This may allow an otherwise ineligible term to support potential Direct Loan eligibility (by supporting half-time or greater enrollment status, for example). Combining an intersession with a standard term may cause the earliest disbursement date (in spring, for example), to change. When combined with a standard term, for Direct Loans, you have a choice of using either a SAY with summer as the header or trailer, as a standard term BBAY, or as a term with one loan. The loan period, payment periods, disbursement, and loan limit progression is based on standard term, traditional calendar treatment, with a higher limit gained after completion of the SAY or standard term BBAY, and one disbursement made per term. Intersessions treated as a separate term: If an intersession is treated as a separate term (i.e., not merged with a preceding or following standard term), the program is treated the same as a non-term or non-standard term non-SE9W program, and Direct Loans are to be awarded and disbursed based on BBAY 3 only. For Direct Loans, this means that the following rules apply: Loan period: minimum is the lesser of the academic year, the length of the program, or the remaining balance of the academic year. Payment periods: The first payment period is the period of time during which the student successfully completes half the number or credit/clock-hours and half the number of weeks of instructional time in the academic year; the second payment period is the period of time in which the student successfully completes the academic year. Annual loan limit progression: A student progresses to the next annual loan limit when he/she successfully completes both the weeks of instructional time and the hours/credits in the academic year.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-108 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Combined undergraduate/graduate programs Some programs combine undergraduate and graduate study, where the first years of the program are undergraduate study and the final years of the program are graduate study. For instance, in a 5-year program leading to a graduate or professional degree, the school may define the first 3 or 4 years of study as being at the undergraduate level, but after year 4, it must be treated as graduate level. Students returning for second baccalaureate degree If a student with a baccalaureate degree enrolls in another baccalaureate program, his/her grade level for loan limit purposes would be based on the amount of work that the school counts toward satisfying the requirements of the new program. For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student's work in a previous baccalaureate program toward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year level, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see below for the loan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associates or baccalaureate degree as condition for being admitted to an undergraduate program). Transfer from graduate to undergraduate program during an academic year If a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the undergraduate annual loan limit for the student's grade level applies, but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate level within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit. However, the total amount awarded for the academic year may not exceed the higher (grad/professional) annual loan limit. Baccalaureate or associate degree required for admission to an undergraduate program A student who has an associate or baccalaureate degree that is required for admission into a program, but is not a graduate or professional student, may borrow up to the highest undergraduate annual loan limit ($5,500 for a dependent student; additional $7,000 in Direct Unsubsidized for an independent student or a dependent student whose parent is not eligible for PLUS), subject to the undergraduate aggregate loan limits. Undergraduate student with graduate degree In some cases, a student who previously received undergraduate and graduate degrees returns to school to complete a second undergraduate program. Only the loans that the student received for the first undergraduate program are included in determining the student's remaining eligibility for loans for the second undergraduate program, up to the undergraduate aggregate limits. Although loans received for graduate study are not counted toward a student's undergraduate aggregate loan limit, the combined loan amounts received for undergraduate and graduate programs may not exceed the total allowable aggregate loan limits. (See example below.) Graduate vs. Undergraduate limits: Special cases The student has now enrolled in a second undergraduate program. Only the loans received for the first undergraduate program are counted toward the student's undergraduate aggregate loan limit. Because the total amount received for the first undergraduate program ($30,500) does not exceed the aggregate loan limit for an independent undergraduate ($57,500, maximum $23,000 subsidized), the student has remaining loan eligibility for the second undergraduate program. However, the loans received for the graduate program must still be considered to ensure that the student does not exceed the total aggregate loan limits. In this case, the total subsidized amount already received ($65,500) is the maximum subsidized amount that a student may receive for undergraduate and graduate study combined. Therefore, the student may receive only unsubsidized loans for the second undergraduate program. The student may not exceed the combined undergraduate/graduate aggregate loan limit of $138,500. This means that the student's remaining loan eligibility for the second undergraduate program is $23,000 in unsubsidized loans ($138,500 minus $115,500 already received for the first undergraduate program and the graduate program). *This example assumes that the student received the $45,000 in subsidized loans for graduate study for periods of enrollment that began before July 1, 2012.An independent student has received the following loan amounts for a first undergraduate program and a graduate program: returning to undergraduate programChapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-109 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Standard using a traditional academic year calendar: BBAY 1 1c.

BBAY where SAY contains 2 semesters Examples 1a through 1c illustrate the optional use of a BBAY for a program that is offered in an SAY consisting of two semesters, fall and spring, each 15 weeks of instructional time in length. (Note that in each example, the first BBAY is the same as the SAY.) In example 1a, the initial fall and spring terms could be considered either an SAY or BBAY. If the student attends the summer session at the school, the aid administrator can elect to treat the summer term and the next fall as a BBAY for the student. In that case, the following spring and summer would also constitute a BBAY. The maximum loan limit for an academic year applies to each BBAY. If these were the first three years of study for a dependent student and the student progressed a grade level each academic year, he/she would be eligible for up to the applicable annual loan limits for the respective academic years. A student doesn't have to attend all of the terms in a BBAY, but the BBAY cannot begin with a term that the student doesn't attend. In example 1b, the student is not enrolled in the second term (fall) of year 2. In example 1c, if the student does not attend a term that otherwise would have been the beginning of a BBAY (in this case, spring), then the student's next BBAY cannot begin until the next term that the student attends. As with example 1a, the annual loan limit applies to each BBAY. 2. BBAY where SAY contains 3 quarters The same concepts apply to quarter-term programs.

If the student and the academic coursework meet the conditions described in that volume, the annual loan limits are: Preparatory coursework (not to exceed 12 consecutive months) For undergraduate degree/certificate coursework: Direct Subsidized & Unsubsidized Loans $2,625** Additional unsubsidized for independent students and dependent undergraduates whose parents can't get Direct PLUS $6,000** For graduate or professional coursework: Direct Subsidized & Unsubsidized Loans $5,500** Additional Direct Unsubsidized for independent students and dependent undergraduates whose parents can't get Direct PLUS $7,000** State-required teacher certification coursework Direct Subsidized & Unsubsidized Loans $5,500** Additional Direct Unsubsidized Loans for independent students and dependent undergraduates whose parents can't get Direct PLUS $7,000** No additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount is available to dependent undergraduate students who are enrolled in preparatory coursework or teacher certification coursework (except for dependent undergraduates whose parents can't get Direct PLUS). ** Loan limit is not prorated if the coursework lasts less than an academic year. See Volume 1, Chapter 6 , FSA Handbook for more information on Title IV eligibility for this coursework.Direct Loan limits for preparatory coursework & teacher certificationChapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-111 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Dependent students whose parents are unable to borrow Direct PLUS Loans due to adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds up to the same amount that is available to independent undergraduate students. The increased loan amounts may not substitute entirely for the amount a parent may borrow under the PLUS program, which may be up to the difference between COA and EFA. As a result, you should determine whether the parents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan using an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history before originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before originating a loan for increased loan amounts, you must document the basis of the dependent student's eligibility. Some basic guidelines for making this determination include: None of the following, by themselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional unsubsidized loans: the parent's unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, a school's decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program, or the aid administrator's belief that a parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan. If only one of a student's two parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may award additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other denied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts. The dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and then later denied a Direct PLUS Loan based on a subsequent application. Under these circumstances, any previous Direct PLUS Loan funds received during the same period of enrollment are treated as estimated financial assistance in determining the student's remaining eligibility for additional unsubsidized loan amounts. In addition to cases in which a parent has been denied a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit, a dependent undergraduate student may also be eligible for increased unsubsidized loan amounts if you determine and document that other exceptional circumstances exist that will prevent a parent from borrowing a Direct PLUS Loan. Examples of such exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited, to the following: The parent is incarcerated. The parent's whereabouts are unknown. The parent has filed for bankruptcy and has provided a letter from the bankruptcy court stating that as a condition of the bankruptcy filing, the parent may not incur any additional debt. The parent's income is limited to public assistance or disability benefits, and you have documented that the parent would not be able to repay the Direct PLUS Loan. You have examined the family financial information and documented the parent's likely inability to repay the Direct PLUS Loan due to an existing debt burden or the parent's expected income-to-debt ratio. The parent of a dependent student is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or is not able to provide evidence from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service that he or she is in the United States for other than a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident. Before originating a loan for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts based on a parent's ineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances, you must document the basis of the dependent student's eligibility. A determination that a parent is ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan in one academic year based on adverse credit or other exceptional circumstances does not automatically support the dependent student's additional unsubsidized loan eligibility in subsequent years. If a dependent student is determined to be eligible for additional unsubsidized loan amounts in one academic year, you must re-examine and document that the basis for the student's eligibility continues to exist before originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent in a subsequent year.Criteria for additional Direct Unsubsidized LoansVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-112 FSA HB 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Example 1: Non-term credit-hour program A school offers a 48 semester hour, 60 weeks of instructional time program with a defined academic year of 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. A student could receive two loans for this program. The period of enrollment for the first loan would be the time needed for a student to successfully complete the first 24 hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. The period of enrollment for the second loan would be the time needed to complete the remaining hours and weeks of instructional time of the program. A student does not become eligible for the second loan until the later of the date that he/she successfully completes (passes) both 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. Example 2: Nonstandard term, credit-hour program, terms not substantially equal in length A school offers a 72 quarter-hour program with 60 weeks of instructional time and a defined academic year of 36 quarter-hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. Courses are offered in 2-week and 5-week terms. A student could receive two loans, one for the period in which the student successfully completes the first 36 hours and 30 weeks, and another for the remaining hours and weeks of the program. Although this program uses terms and measures academic progress in credit hours, the terms are nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. A student does not become eligible for the second loan until he or she has completed 36 quarter hours or 30 weeks of instructional time, whichever comes later, regardless of the number of terms that have elapsed. For instance, a student who successfully completes (passes) 33 quarter hours in the first 30 weeks of instructional time must complete an additional three quarter hours before receiving the second loan. Generally, a school would originate a loan through the term in which the student is expected to complete the hours and weeks of instructional time of the academic year. Example 3: Clock-hour program Soler Academy has an 1,800 clock-hour program with 52 weeks of instructional time, and defines its academic year as 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. The initial BBAY always begins with the student's actual enrollment date. An enrolling student may receive two Direct Loans during the program (provided all eligibility criteria are met) because the program exceeds one academic year. The period of enrollment for the first loan would be the time it will take the student to successfully complete (pass) either 900 clock-hours or 26 weeks of instructional time, whichever comes later. The period for the second loan would be the time it takes to successfully complete the final 900 hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. Note that the student cannot receive the second loan until he/she has successfully completed the first 900 hours of the program or 26 weeks of instruction, whichever comes later. A student who completes the first 900 hours in less than 26 weeks must still complete 26 weeks of instructional time before a new BBAY begins and the student becomes eligible to receive another loan. In this case, the second loan period would be for the clock-hours remaining and the weeks of instructional time to complete those hours. Similarly, a student who has completed fewer than 900 clock-hours after 26 weeks of instructional time must successfully complete 900 hours before receiving another loan. Clock-hour, non-term, and nonstandard-term programs (other than SE9W programs): HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms GRADE LEVEL PROGRESSION The annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans increases as a student progresses in his/her studies. Generally, a student's grade level for loan limit purposes is set according to the school's academic standards. Progression to a higher grade level does not always coincide with the beginning of a new academic year. For example, a student in a standard term program (or a borrower in a program using nonstandard, substantially equal-terms of 9 or more weeks [SE9W]) who completes only 12 semester hours during the first academic year could receive another loan when the calendar period associated with that academic year has elapsed. However, the borrower would still be classified as a first-year undergraduate at the start of the second academic year. Grade level progression within the same academic year In standard term programs or nonstandard SE9W programs, a student who has already borrowed up to the annual limit within an academic year can receive additional loan funds if the student progresses to a grade level with a higher annual loan limit during that same academic year. For instance, if a dependent student was classified as a 2nd-year undergraduate in the fall, he/she might have received a first disbursement of up to $3,250 in Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan funds for the fall- spring loan. If the student achieved 3rd-year academic status based on the coursework completed in the fall semester, the student would now be eligible for the $7,500 Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized annual limit that applies to 3rd year and beyond dependent undergraduates. If the student had sufficient financial need, you could disburse the difference between the amount the student already received and the new annual limit in the spring term ($7,500 minus $3,250 = $4,250). In all cases, the borrower may borrow the difference between the amount already borrowed within the academic year and the student's new loan limit. Usually, the increase in the loan amount can be made as an adjustment to the student's existing loan rather than making a new loan. For a clock-hour program, non-term program, or nonstandard-term program that is not SE9W, the borrower will never progress to a higher grade level within an academic year. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or nonstandard-term program that is not SE9W that is longer than an academic year, the borrower moves to a higher grade level only when he or she completes the credit or clock-hours and weeks of instructional time in the BBAY. Grade level progression: clock-hour, non-term credit-hour, and other non-term programs In contrast, progression to a higher grade level and the beginning of a new academic year for loan limit purposes always happens at the same time for a student in a clock-hour program, non-term program, or nonstandard- term program in which the terms are not substantially equal in length or one or more terms have less than nine weeks of instructional time. In order to advance to the next grade level in such a program, for annual loan limit purposes, a student must successfully complete both the weeks and hours in the program's Title IV academic year; that is, at least 30 weeks Grade level progression While the law defines minimum coursework for an academic year, it doesn't define how much coursework a student must complete to progress from one grade level to another. Unless a student's program of study or a school's academic standards clearly specify when this grade-level progression takes place, a reasonable approach would be to base grade levels on the number of credits required for the program, divided by the number of academic years it takes a typical student to earn that number of credits. For instance, if your school has a baccalaureate program that requires 120 semester hours of work and is typically completed in four academic years, then you might use a standard of 30 hours completed at each grade level. Remedial work & grade level Remedial coursework can be counted towards the student's grade level progression, but only if the school's written and officially approved academic grade level progression policy specifies that remedial coursework can be counted for this purpose. Example: A school requires that the student complete 30 semester hours to progress to second- year grade level, and specifies that up to 10 of the hours may be in the form of remedial coursework.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-114 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms of instructional time (or, for clock-hour programs, at least 26 weeks) and the credit or clock-hours in the academic year, whichever comes later. For instance, a first-year student in a 2-year non-term program who earns 36 quarter-credits over 24 weeks of instructional time cannot progress to the next grade level until another 6 weeks of instructional time are completed (the point at which the loan period for that academic year will be completed). If a program can normally be completed in one year of full-time study, a student in that program can never receive more than the 1st-year annual loan limit in any given year, no matter how long it takes the student to finish. (Similarly, a student in a two-year program can never receive more than the 2nd-year annual loan limit for an academic year.) New annual amount for same grade level For both standard-term programs and SE9W programs, if a student is enrolled at the same grade level after a full academic year has elapsed, the student may be eligible for a new annual maximum amount. For instance, if the student maintains satisfactory academic progress, he or she could conceivably receive two Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans at the maximum annual loan limit for a first-year undergraduate while completing the first year of the program. If the student is maintaining satisfactory academic progress, your school is not permitted to have a general policy that limits the number of times the student can receive the maximum annual loan limit at one grade level. A school may refuse to originate a loan or may originate a loan for an amount less than the borrower's maximum eligibility only on a case-by-base basis. Transfers & grade level If you're awarding a Direct Loan to a student who is transferring from a program at another school to a program at your school that is greater than one academic year in length, you may use the loan limits for a student in the 2nd-year or higher level of study if your school classifies the student at that level based on the number of academic credits it accepts from the prior school, or based on the granting of advance standing in the new program. Note, however, that if an associate or bachelor's degree is required for entry into a program at your school, you must use the 3rd-year loan limits for a student who transfers to that program. The \"Eligibility and Certification Approval Report\" (ECAR) lists \"one-year\" as the highest educational program offered by the school if its longest program is one year or more, but less than two years in length. Students in programs longer than one year can be paid as 2nd-year students even though the ECAR lists the school's highest offering as \"one-year.\" For instance, if a student is enrolled in a 1,500 clock-hour program, he/she would be eligible for the 2nd-year loan limits after completing 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. However, the loan limit would have to be prorated for the remaining hours of the student's program (see next section). Loan limits and work in a prior certificate program A school may not link two stand-alone 1-year programs by making one a prerequisite for admission to the other so that students beginning the second 1-year program could be classified as second-year students for loan limit purposes. However, hours or credits earned in a prior certificate program could be used to classify a transfer student at a grade level higher than grade level 1, if the student transfers into a program that is greater than one academic year in length and the new school accepts a year's worth of credits/hours from the prior program. For instance, if a school admits a transfer student from a certificate program and accepts 900 clock-hours that the student earned toward its 1,500-hour program, the student could be eligible for the 2nd-year loan limits if other students in the program are eligible for 2nd- year loan limits after completing the first 900 hours of the program.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-115 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms PRORATING ANNUAL LOAN LIMITS FOR DIRECT SUBSIDIZED/UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS (UNDERGRADUATE ONLY) The annual maximum loan amount an undergraduate student may receive must be prorated when the borrower is: enrolled in a program that is shorter than a full academic year; or enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but is in a remaining period of study that is shorter than a full academic year. Bear in mind that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow for a program or remaining balance of a program, not the loan amount that the student actually receives. In some cases, the actual loan amount that a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, EFC, and other aid) may be less than the prorated loan limit. Prorating loan limits for programs of study shorter than a full academic year If an academic program is shorter than a full academic year in length, you must multiply the applicable loan limit(s) by the lesser of \u2014 Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours in academic year or Weeks enrolled in program Weeks in the academic year The result is the prorated annual loan limit for that program. (You may express these fractions as decimals to see more easily which is less or to calculate the prorated limit.) Prorating loan limits for remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year You must also prorate loan limits for students enrolled in remaining periods of study shorter than an academic year. This circumstance can occur when a student is enrolled in a program that is one academic year or more in length, but the remaining period of study needed to complete the program will be shorter than an academic year. Proration is required only when it is known in advance that a student will be enrolled for a final period of study that is shorter than an academic year. If a student originally enrolls for a final period of study that is a full academic year in length, but completes the program early in less than a full academic year, it is not necessary to retroactively prorate the annual loan limit.When and when not to prorate You must prorate Direct Subsidized/ Unsubsidized Loans for an undergraduate program borrower if: the academic program is shorter than an academic year; or the student's remaining period of study is shorter than an academic year. Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans are prorated only in these two situations. Loan limits are not prorated based on a student's enrollment status, such as when a student is enrolled less than full-time or is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a remaining period of study. In addition, Direct Loan limits are not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level programs. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to loans made to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework necessary for teacher certification. The annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled in a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. For purposes of awarding Title IV aid, students taking preparatory coursework or coursework needed for teacher certification are not considered to be enrolled in a program.Loan proration Direct Loans: 34 CFR 685.203(a),(b),(c) Note on fractions and decimals for prorating Direct Loans It is acceptable to convert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a requirement. You may still choose to multiply the annual loan limit by the original fraction. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations sometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits. The decimal method will generally result in an amount that is equal to or slightly higher than the amount calculated using the original fraction.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-116 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms In a standard term program, or a credit-hour program using nonstandard SE9W terms, a remaining period of study is considered shorter than an academic year if the remaining period contains fewer terms than the number of terms covered by the school's Title IV academic year. For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year, the number of terms covered in the school's Title IV academic year usually does not include any summer \"header\" or \"trailer\" term. In a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W, a remaining period of study is considered less than an academic year for this purpose if the remaining period consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program's defined Title IV academic year. For all types of programs, where there is a remaining portion less than an academic year, the annual loan limit for the student's grade level is multiplied by the following fraction to determine the prorated loan limit: Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours in academic year Unlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours. Only the credit or clock-hours that the student is scheduled to attend or is actually attending at the time of origination are used in the calculation. Prorating loan limits for additional unsubsidized amounts For students in a program of study of at least one academic year but less than 2 academic years in length, the additional $2,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility is multiplied by the following ratio: Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours in academic year For students in a program of study of less than an academic year in length, the additional $2,000 is multiplied by the lesser of the following 2 ratios: Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours enrolled in program Semester, trimester, quarter, or clock-hours in academic year or Weeks in program Weeks in academic yearProrating annual loan limits for borrowers in remaining portions of term-based programs A student who is enrolled in a 4-year program that is offered in a Scheduled Academic Year consisting of three quarters plus a summer \"trailer\" has completed four academic years of study and received four Direct Loans. The student needs to attend an additional quarter term to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term would fall in a new academic year, and thus the annual loan limit would have to be prorated, because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year. A student who is enrolled in a 2-year program without a Scheduled Academic Year where the Title IV academic year covers two 15-week semesters has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to complete the program requirements. Again, the loan limit would have to be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-117 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms REMAINING LOAN ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS WHO TRANSFER OR CHANGE PROGRAMS The annual loan limits are based on an academic year. If a student transfers from one school to another school or changes to a different program at the same school and there is an overlap of academic years, this overlap may affect the amount that the student is eligible to borrow at the new school or for the new program. An overlap in academic years exists at the new school if the academic year at the new school (or the academic year for the new program at the same school) begins before the calendar end date of the academic year at the prior school or program. In the case of a transfer student from another school, you may obtain documentation from the prior school of the specific beginning and ending dates for the prior academic year or look for the academic year dates of Direct Loans originated by the prior school on the \"award detail information page\" in the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) Web interface.* The same principles for students who transfer from one school to another school would apply in the case of students who change programs within the same school. For programs with standard terms or nonstandard SE9W terms (use SAY, BBAY 1, or BBAY 2) If a student enrolls in a program with standard terms (or nonstandard SE9W terms) after already having taken out a loan at another school with an overlapping academic year, the student initially may not receive more than the annual loan limit minus the amount received at the prior school. However, the student may borrow again for a subsequent term within the same academic year at the new school if the term begins after the end of the academic year at the prior school. For a subsequent term that begins after the end of the prior school's academic year, but within the initial academic year at the new school, the student may borrow up to the difference between the applicable annual loan limit and the amount already received for the new school's academic year, if the student's COA supports that amount. For clock-hour and non-term programs, and programs with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W (use BBAY 3) Transfers between schools: If a student who enrolls in a clock-hour or non-term program (or a program with nonstandard terms that are not SE9W) after already having taken out a loan at another school with a period of enrollment that overlaps the period of enrollment at the second school, then the student is restricted to the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit until the completion of the academic year, which had begun at the first school and continues at the new school. The new school may originate an initial loan for the remaining portion of the program or academic year that began at the prior school. For more information, see the discussion under \"Direct Loan periods when student transfers to a new school\" later in this chapter.* Note: Prior guidance permitted schools, when information about the prior school's academic year was unavailable, to assume the academic year of the prior school was the beginning date of the loan period of the prior loan through 30 calendar weeks after the beginning date of the loan period. Because the academic year dates for Direct Loans are readily available in COD, a school may no longer make this assumption regarding academic year dates.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-118 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Transfers between programs at the same school For a transfer between programs at the same school, you would look to the requirements for payment periods. There would be a new loan period with new payment periods or, if you choose to consider the student to be in the same payment period, there would be no new loan period. Same payment period and same loan period\u2014 At your option, you can consider a transferring student to be in the same payment period if: The student is continuously enrolled at the school; The coursework in the payment period the student is transferring out of is substantially similar to the coursework the student will be taking when he or she first transfers in the new program; The payment periods are substantially equal in length in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock-hours, as applicable; There are little or no changes in school charges associated with the payment period to the student; and The credits or clock-hours from the payment period the student is transferring out of are accepted toward the new program. If the student is kept in the same payment period, the original loan period should remain the same. However, you should take into account any changes as to when the student would complete the hours and weeks of instructional time of the academic year and make adjustments such as the ending date of the loan period or the date of the second (or any subsequent) disbursement(s). Any adjustments that have a direct effect or influence on 150% subsidized loan limits must also be updated/reported to COD. New payment period and new loan period If a transferring student is placed, or must be placed, in a new payment period, you would perform a Return of Title IV calculation for his or her withdrawal from the payment period in the old program (assuming that the student did not complete that payment period without starting a new one before transferring into the new program if the return of Title IV funds is done on a payment period basis, or assuming the student did not complete the loan period if the R2T4 is done on a period of enrollment basis). That calculation would close out the original loan period. Then the student would start over with a new loan period for his new program that uses the remaining annual loan limit eligibility from the prior loan period. The new loan period would be for an academic year using the remaining annual loan limit eligibility if the student's new program is at least an academic year in length. If the new program is less than an academic year, the student's annual loan limit is the lesser of the remaining annual loan limit eligibility or the prorated annual loan limit based on hours to be completed in the new program. For guidance on loan periods for transfer students, see the minimum/maximum loan period sidebar earlier in this chapter.Direct Loan transfer loan periods 34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(ii),(iii)Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-119 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Student completes a program and starts another at the same school If a student completes a program at your school and then begins a new program at your school, and the student's last loan for the completed program is for less than an academic year, you may originate an initial loan for the new program with an abbreviated loan that ends on the calendar period ending date of the academic year associated with the prior program. For more detailed information, see the discussion under \"Loan periods for a student starting a new program at the same school in the same academic year\" later in this chapter. There are two options for increasing the amount of an existing loan when a student's grade level changes during an academic year: 1. Originate a new loan at the new grade level for the applicable amount (the difference between the new loan limit and the amount of the first loan). The loan period for the new loan must correspond to the term(s) during which the student qualifies for the higher loan limit. You could also choose to cancel any pending disbursements of the first loan and originate a new loan for an amount equal to the canceled disbursements of the first loan plus the additional amount for which the student is eligible due to the grade level change. 2. Adjust the amount of the current loan. Change the grade level in the loan record and increase the a mount of the existing loan to the new amount. With either option, the student's remaining loan eligibility must be calculated using only the costs and estimated financial assistance for the term(s) during which the student qualifies for the higher loan limit. As a reminder, a student can progress to a higher grade level during an academic year only in a program with standa rd terms or non-standard terms that are SE9W.Increasing the loan when grade level changes during academic yearVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-120 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms If a student transfers into a program at a new school, and the program is not offered in either standard or \"SE9W\" terms, the new school may originate an initial loan for a loan period that covers the remaining portion of the academic year that began at the prior school, if the academic year for the loan at the first school overlaps the period of enrollment at the new school. The loan period for this initial loan is often called an \"abbreviated loan period,\" because it is shorter than the loan period that would otherwise be required under the normal minimum loan period requirements. The new school may originate a loan for an abbreviated loan period regardless of whether or not the new school accepts transfer hours from the prior school. The abbreviated loan period begins with the date of the student's enrollment at the new school, and ends on the calendar period ending date of the academic year that began at the prior school, without regard to the number of credit/clock-hours or weeks of instructional time that the student has completed during the abbreviated loan period. After the abbreviated loan period is completed, the student would progress to a new loan period and academic year, and a new annual loan limit. If the new school accepts credits/hours from the prior school, this may give the student advance standing that reduces the length of time it will take to complete the program at the new school. If the remaining portion of the program at the new school following the completion of the abbreviated loan period is shorter than an academic year, the annual loan limit for the next loan must be prorated. Generally, the loan amount for the abbreviated loan period at the new school may not exceed the remaining balance of the full annual loan limit applicable to the student at the new school, minus the loan amount the student received at the first school for the same academic year. However, if the program at the new school is less than a full academic year in length, or is a remaining portion of a program that is less than an academic year in length, the total loan amount that the student may receive for the program at the new school, for the abbreviated loan period and any subsequent loan period combined, may not exceed the applicable prorated annual loan limit for the program or remaining portion of the program. When an abbreviated loan period is created where there is an overlap of academic years: 1. The abbreviated loan period starts when the student starts at the new school. 2. The abbreviated loan period ends when the academic year would have ended at the old school and it does not matter how many hours or weeks of instructional time the student has completed at the new school. 3. The maximum loan amount that can be borrowed in the abbreviated loan period is the difference between the full annual loan limit applicable to the student at the new school and the loan amount that was disbursed at the old school during the overlapping academic year. 4. The first disbursement of the loan for the abbreviated loan period at the new school will be made at the beginning of the abbreviated loan period. Unless the school qualifies based on its cohort default rate for the exemption from the multiple disbursement requirement, the loan must be multiply disbursed in at least two disbursements over the abbreviated loan period, with the second disbursement made at the calendar midpoint of the abbreviated loan period regardless of how many clock/credit-hours or weeks of instructional time have been completed. The normal payment period disbursement rules do not apply in this situation. 5. The next loan period at the new school would begin the day after the last day of the abbreviated loan period. 6.

Direct Loan periods when student transfers to a new schoolChapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-121 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Transfer student with overlapping academic years James transfers on September 15 into Hammett Technical College, entering a 3-year program that has an academic year of 26 weeks and 900 clock-hours. James received a Direct Loan at the prior school. The financial aid administrator at Hammett determines that the academic year for the most recent loan James received at his previous school began July 15 and was scheduled to end January 15. The aid administrator at Hammett may originate a loan for the period during which James would have completed the academic year at the prior school, which was scheduled to end on January 15th. The dates for the abbreviated loan period will be September 15 to January 15. During this period, James will be eligible to receive up to the difference between his annual loan limit at Hammet and the loan amount he received at the prior school for the overlapping academic year period. Unless Hammett qualifies for the exemption from the multiple disbursement requirement based on its cohort default rate, the loan must be multiply disbursed in at least two disbursements over the abbreviated loan period, with the second disbursement made at the calendar midpoint of the abbreviated loan period, regardless of how many clock-hours or weeks of instructional time James has completed. The next loan period at Hammett would begin the day after the last day of the abbreviated loan period. On January 16th, James will be able to start a new BBAY and loan period at Hammett with a new annual loan limit. Note that the payment periods for the new BBAY will be 450 clock-hours and 13 weeks of instructional time.Direct Loan periods when student transfers to a new school (continued) Loan periods for a student starting a new program at the same school in the same academic year: When a student completes a program, and the student's last loan to complete that program was for coursework less than an academic year in length, and the student then begins a new program at the same school that is not offered in either standard or \"SE9W\" terms, the school may originate an initial loan for the new program with an abbreviated loan period that ends on the calendar period ending date of the academic year associated with the prior program. Note that this exception to the normal minimum loan period rule that allows for an initial abbreviated loan period applies only if the student completed the first program before beginning the new program. Generally, the maximum loan amount that the student may receive for the abbreviated loan period may not exceed the full annual loan limit applicable to the student for the new program, minus the loan amount the student received during the same academic year for the prior program. However, if the new program is less than a full academic year in length, or is a remaining portion of a program that is less than an academic year in length, the total loan amount that the student may receive for the new program, for the abbreviated loan period and any subsequent loan period combined, may not exceed the applicable prorated annual loan limit for the new program or remaining portion of the program. The first disbursement of the loan for the abbreviated loan period associated with the new program will be made at the beginning of the abbreviated loan period. Unless the school qualifies based on its cohort default rate for the exemption from the multiple disbursement requirement, the loan must be multiply disbursed in at least two disbursements over the abbreviated loan period, with the second disbursement made at the calendar midpoint of the abbreviated loan period regardless of how many clock/credit-hours or weeks of instructional time have been completed.

ECC defines the academic year for this program as 900 clock-hours providing 26 weeks of instructional time. Measured in clock-hours, Jill's program is 400 clock-hours long. To determine the maximum loan amount she can borrow, convert the fractions based on weeks (12/26 = .46) and hours (400/900 = .44) to decimals. Multiply the smaller decimal (.44) by the first-year annual loan limits for a dependent undergraduate: $3,500 combined subsidized/unsubsidized and $2,000 additional unsubsidized. $3,500 x = $1,540 combined subsidized/unsubsidized $2,000 x .44 = $880 additional unsubsidized The maximum combined Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan amount Jill can borrow for the program is $2,420, but no more than $1,540 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.Academic year = 900 clock hrs, 26 weeks of instructional time Morgan is an independent student enrolled in a program at Epstein Career College that provides 24 quarter-hours and 20 weeks of instructional time. ECC defines the academic year for this program as 36 quarter-hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. To determine the maximum loan amount she can borrow, convert the fractions based on weeks (20/30 = .67) and quarter-hours (24/36 = .67) to decimals. Multiply the smaller decimal (in this case, both are .67) by the first-year annual loan limits for an independent undergraduate. $3,500 x .67 = $2,345 total Direct Loan $6,000 x .67 = $4,020 subsidized The maximum combined Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan amount Morgan can borrow for the program is $6,365, with the subsidized loan amount limited to $2,345.

Sally, a dependent undergraduate student, successfully completes the first 900 clock-hours of the program in 22 weeks of instructional time. However, she must complete an additional four weeks of instructional time before she may receive a second loan. After 26 weeks of instructional time have elapsed, Sally has successfully completed 1040 clock-hours. She may then receive a second loan, but the loan limit must be prorated based on the number of clock-hours remaining in her program at this point. To determine the prorated loan limit for Sally's second loan, convert the fraction based on the number of clock- hours remaining to a decimal (760/900 = .84). Multiply this decimal by the second-year dependent undergraduate annual loan limits: $4,500 x .84 = $3,780 combined subsidized/unsubsidized, 2,000 x .84 = $1,680 additional unsubsidized The total prorated loan limit for the remaining period of study is $5,460, not more than $3,780 of which may be subsidized.Proration examples for remaining period of study shorter than an academic year Chuck has attended 6 quarters in a 2-year program at Hartlieb Community College (HCC), but to finish the program, he needs to attend an additional quarter as a half-time student (6 quarter hours). Chuck is a dependent undergraduate student, and HCC defines its academic year (covering three quarters) as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. To determine the prorated Direct Loan limit for Chuck's remaining period of study, convert the fraction based on the hours that Chuck is expected to attend and the hours in the academic year to a decimal (6/36 = .17). Multiply this decimal by the second-year dependent undergraduate annual loan limits: $4,500 (subsidized) x .17 = $765 combined subsidized/ unsubsidized; $2,000 (unsubsidized) x .17 = 340 additional unsubsidized. Total prorated Direct Loan limit $1,105, of which $765 may be subsidized.Chuck transfers to a BA program at Reiff College. By taking 18 hours a semester, he will be able to graduate in the Fall term of his second year. Chuck is a dependent undergraduate student, and Reiff defines its academic year (covering two semesters) as 24 credit hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. To determine the prorated Direct Loan limit for the remaining period of study, convert the fraction based on credit hours to a decimal (18/24 = .75). Multiply this decimal by the fourth- year dependent undergraduate annual loan limits: $5,500 (subsidized) x .75 = $4,125 combined Direct Sub/ Unsub; $2,000 additional unsubsidized x .75 = $1,500. Total prorated Direct Loan limit $5,625, of which $4,125 may be subsidized. McNutt Institute has an academic year that covers three quarters: fall, winter, and spring. Bob will be enrolling in the fall and spring quarters, but not the winter quarter, and will graduate at the end of the spring quarter. Because the fall quarter is in the same academic year as Bob's final quarter, it is part of the final period of study, even though there is a term between the final quarter and the fall quarter in which he will not enroll. McNutt Institute must award Bob separate loans for fall and spring. The annual loan limit must be prorated (because Bob's final period of study, two terms, is shorter than an academic year). If Bob decided to enroll for the winter quarter on a less-than-half-time basis, his remaining period of study (three terms) would be equal to a full academic year and proration would not be required, even though he would have no loan eligibility for the winter quarter.Example 1: Academic year contains 3 quarters Remaining period = 1 quarterExample 2: Academic year contains 2 semesters Remaining period = 1 semester Fall Winter Spring Fall Winter Spring Fall Winter Spring Example 4: Remaining period of study with scheduled period of non-enrollmentExample 3: Academic year contains 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks. Program = 1,800 clock-hoursFall Spring Fall Winter Spring Turner College has an academic year that covers three quarters: fall, winter, and spring. Linda, a dependent fourth-year undergraduate, will be enrolling in the fall and winter quarters, but not the spring quarter, and will graduate at the end of the winter term. Linda will be enrolled for 12 quarter hours (full-time) during the fall quarter, but will be enrolled for only 3 hours (less than half-time) in the winter quarter. Turner defines its academic year as 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. Linda's final period of study (two terms) is shorter than an academic year, so the annual loan limit must be prorated. However, because Linda will be enrolled less than half-time during the winter quarter (and therefore ineligible to receive Direct Loan funds for that term), the loan period will cover the fall quarter only, and only the 12 quarter hours for the fall term are used to determine the prorated annual loan limit. To determine the prorated loan limit for Linda's final period of study, convert the fraction based on the hours that Linda is expected to attend in the fall quarter and the hours in the academic year to a decimal (12/36 = .33). Multiply this decimal by the fourth-year dependent undergraduate annual loan limit: $5,500 x .33 = $1,815 combined subsidized/unsubsidized prorated annual loan limit, plus $2,000 x .33 = $660 prorated additional unsubsidized annual loan limit, for a total prorated annual loan limit of $2,475, not more than $1,815 of which may be subsidized.

Fall Winter Spring (not enrolled)Fall SpringVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Standard-term program A student receives a $2,000 Direct Subsidized Loan at School A for a loan period from May 1 to August 31. The student, a dependent undergraduate, transfers to a program at School B in September and is admitted at grade level 2. The student requests a loan for the fall and spring semesters (September-May). School B checks COD to find the ending-date of the academic year began at the prior school, which is November 27. Because the academic year at School B begins before the end of the academic year at School A, the student may initially receive only up to a maximum of $4,500 for the fall semester at School B, not more than $2,500 of which may be subsidized. This amount represents the difference between the annual loan limit of $6,500 (maximum $4,500 subsidized), and the amount received at School A ($2,000 subsidized) for the overlapping academic year period. The initial loan period at School B corresponds with the fall term. Assuming that the student receives the maximum of $4,500 for the fall semester, at the start of the spring semester in January, the student may borrow up to an additional $2,000 (the difference between the 2nd year dependent undergraduate annual loan limit and the amount already borrowed for the fall- spring academic year at School B). If the student received the maximum $2,500 in subsidized loan funds for the fall term, the additional $2,000 would be limited to unsubsidized. As an alternative, School B could choose to place the student on a BBAY schedule beginning with the Spring semester. The student would then be eligible to borrow up to the full annual loan limit for a spring--summer BBAY. Clock-hour program Example 1 A student receives the first disbursement ($2,750) of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan at School A. The loan period and academic year dates are April 1 to December 31. For purposes of this example, assume that the student has no financial need for a Direct Subsidized Loan; all loan amounts here represent Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The student, a dependent Remaining loan eligibility on transfer/program change undergraduate, leaves School A June 18 and transfers to an 1,800 clock-hour program at School B, and begins attendance at School B on June 25th . The student's first loan period at School B will be from June 25th through December 31st (the beginning of attendance at School B through the date the academic year would have ended at School A). The student could be begin the next loan period and receive a full annual loan limit beginning on January 1. For the initial loan period, School B may originate a loan for the difference between the student's annual loan limit and the loan already received at School A for the overlapping loan period. This is $2,750. After this loan period is completed, the student would progress to a new annual loan limit. Example 2 A first-year dependent undergraduate student receives the first disbursements ($2,750) of a Direct Subsidized Loan ($1,750) and Direct Unsubsidized Loan ($1,000) at School A. The loan period and academic year dates are January 26 to July 31. The student leaves School A and transfers into a 300 clock-hour/12-week program at School B on June 15. School B defines its Title IV academic year as containing 900 clock-hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. The prorated annual loan limits for the 300-hour program at School B are $1,167 subsidized and $667 additional unsubsidized. For the abbreviated loan period at School B (June 15 to July 31), a transfer student would normally be eligible to receive the difference between the full first-year annual loan limit and the loan amount received at School A (that is, $1,750 subsidized and $1,000 additional unsubsidized). In this example, however, the student may not receive those amounts, because they would exceed the prorated annual loan limits for the 300 clock-hour program. Therefore, the maximum loan amounts the student may receive for the abbreviated loan period at School B are $1,167 subsidized and $667 unsubsidized (the prorated loan limits for the program). Because the student has received the maximum prorated loan limit for the program, there is no remaining loan eligibility for the program following the completion of the abbreviated loan period. Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-125 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms AGGREGATE LOAN LIMITS A borrower who has reached his or her aggregate borrowing limit may not receive additional loans. Once the loans are repaid, in full or in part, the borrower may apply for additional loans. The maximum outstanding total subsidized and unsubsidized loan debt, excluding capitalized interest, is: $31,000 for a dependent undergraduate student (no more than $23,000 of this amount may be in the form of subsidized loans). $57,500 for an independent undergraduate student (or a dependent undergraduate student whose parents do not qualify for Direct PLUS Loans). No more than $23,000 of this aggregate amount may be in the form of subsidized loans. $138,500 for a graduate or professional student (including loans for undergraduate study). No more than $65,500 of this aggregate amount may be in the form of subsidized loans. The loan amounts counted towards these maximums include any outstanding amounts borrowed in the form of Direct Subsidized/ Unsubsidized Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans previously borrowed under the FFEL program. In the case of a Direct Consolidation Loan (or FFEL Consolidation Loan made prior to July 1, 2010), the outstanding amount of the Consolidation Loan representing any underlying Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans that were paid off by the Consolidation Loan is counted toward the aggregate Stafford Loan limits. Subsidized Loan Eligibility Time Limitation (150% rule/SULA) In addition to the aggregate loan limit, which limits loan eligibility based on the amount of funds received over a student's academic lifetime, there is also a loan eligibility limitation based on the passage of time. First-time borrowers (those who have no principal or interest balance on any Direct or FFEL Loan on the date they receive a Direct Loan on or after July 1, 2013) may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for a period that exceeds 150% of the published length of the academic program in which they are currently enrolled (including all past subsidized loans the student has received; see \"subsidized usage periods \" below). This length of time is also known as the \" maximum eligibility period. \" For example, a first-time borrower in a 4-year program would have six years of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility, and a borrower in a one-year program would have 1.5 years of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility. COD will edit and reject awards that would exceed 150% subsidized usage for a student (Reject Edit 206). This is also known as a \"Subsidized Usage Limit Applies\" situation, or SULA flag, in COD . There are two exceptions to the maximum eligibility period: First, for bachelor's degree completion programs, the maximum eligibility period is 6 years. For purposes of the subsidized loan time limitation (also known as the 150% rule), bachelor's degree completion programs are defined as a 2-year program that required an associate degree or the successful completion of at least two years of postsecondary coursework as a prerequisite for admission Aggregate loan limits DL: 34 CFR 685.203(d), (e) DCL GEN-08-08 NSLDS on the Web You can review the complete student loan history for your students and generate reports on the NSLDS Professional Access website: https://www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/ NSLDS guides & help center Guides for Enrollment Reporting, Transfer Student Monitoring and other user documentation are currently posted on IFAP under \"Processing Resources, NSLDS Reference Materials.\" Also see NSLDS Newsletter #6, 9, 11, 17 and 23 on IFAP for more specific information on how the OPB and Agg OPB are calculated and displayed on NSLDS.

For such programs, schools will report a program length of 4 years (even though the real length of the program is 2 years) and a \"Special Program Indicator\" of \"B\" in COD and NSLDS. Secondly, for special admission associate degree programs, the maximum eligibility period is 6 years. For these purposes, a special admission associate degree program is an associate degree program that: Requires an associate degree, or the successful completion of at least two years of postsecondary coursework as a prerequisite for completion; Admits only a selected number of applicants based on additional competitive criteria, which may include entrance exam scores, class rank, grade point average, written essays, or recommendation letters; and Provides the academic qualifications necessary for a profession that requires licensure or certification by the State in which the coursework is offered. For such programs, schools will report a program length of 4 years (even though the real length of the program is 2 years) and a \"Special Program Indicator\" of \"A\" in COD and NSLDS. Subsidized Usage Periods (SUP) A first-time borrower's progress toward expending his or her maximum eligibility period is measured in \"subsidized usage periods\" (SUP). Subsidized usage periods are calculated by the following formula, the result of which is rounded up or down to the nearest tenth of a year (for example, a SUP of .44 would be rounded to .40, and a SUP of .45 would be rounded to .5): Number of days in the borrower's loan period for a Direct Subsidized Loan Number of days in the academic year for which the borrower receives the Direct Subsidized Loan The academic year referenced above is the scheduled academic year (SAY) or borrower-based academic year (BBAY) dates to which the annual loan limit applies. There are two exceptions to this calculation : 1. Annual loan limit: When a first-time borrower receives a Direct Subsidized Loan equal to the annual loan limit for a loan period that is less than a full academic year in length, the borrower's subsidized usage period is one year; and 2. Enrollment status proration: For a first-time borrower who is enrolled for three-quarter or one-half-time, the calculated subsidized usage period is prorated by .75 or .5, respectively.Exceptions for borrowers who are enrolled in teacher certification programs There are special rules for borrowers who are enrolled in teacher certification programs where the school awards no academic credential and where the program leads to a teaching certification from the state that is required by the state before the borrower may teach elementary or secondary education in the state. Direct Subsidized Loans received for enrollment in such a teacher certification program only count against a borrower's maximum eligibility period for enrollment in other teacher certification programs. When a borrower enrolls in an undergraduate program, the Direct Subsidized Loans received for enrollment in the teacher certification program will not count against the borrower's maximum eligibility period for enrollment in the undergrad program. In addition, enrollment in a teacher certification program will never result in the loss of interest subsidy\u2014either on Direct Subsidized Loans received for prior undergraduate enrollment or on Direct Subsidized Loans received for enrollment in a teacher certification program. NSLDS Reporting requirements DCLs GEN-14-07, GEN-14-17 For details on NSLDS reporting requirements for loans, including reporting of additional data, reporting at the academic program level, and more frequent reporting, see DCLs GEN- 14-07 and GEN-14-17 and the FSA Handbook, Volume 2, Chapter 3 .Reporting Academic Year and Loan period to COD GEN-13-13 DLOps@ed.gov codsupport@ed.gov The academic year dates that you report to COD should correspond to the period to which the annual loan limit applies. For a term-based program, the annual loan limit will never apply to a single term. Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-127 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Note that if a borrower meets the criteria for both exceptions described above, the annual loan limit exception will be applied, and then the enrollment exception will be applied. A loan disbursement which is returned within 120 days of the disbursement date, for example, when the school adjusts that disbursement down to zero, returns the funds, and removes the corresponding term from the loan period, will no longer be included in that term/payment period for purposes of calculating SUP. On the other hand, a loan that has been paid off does NOT remove that loan's portion of SUP. A borrower's Remaining Eligibility Period (REP) is calculated by subtracting the sum of all prior subsidized usage periods (include ALL subsidized loans received over the student's entire history of higher education,) from the borrower's current maximum eligibility period. For example, Bob currently has a subsidized usage period of two years, then transfers to a four-year program. Because the remaining eligibility period is calculated as the difference between the borrower's current maximum eligibility period and the sum of all subsidized usage periods, Bob has a remaining eligibility period of four-years (a 6-year maximum eligibility period for the new program, minus the existing subsidized usage period of 2 years). Subsidized usage periods for teacher-certification programs do not count against maximum eligibility periods for non-teacher-certification programs, and subsidized usage periods from non-teacher certification programs do not count against the maximum eligibility period for teacher certification programs. Loss of subsidized loan subsidy For borrowers who have a remaining eligibility period that is less than an academic year, the borrower can only receive a Direct Subsidized Loan if the school can properly originate a Direct Subsidized Loan that creates a subsidized usage period (see \"SUP\" description and formula, above) that is equal to or less than the borrower's remaining eligibility period (REP). In COD, there will be a \"SULA\" flag indicating the student's status . For example, if a borrower has a remaining eligibility period of .2 years, and is enrolled full-time in a semester-based credit-hour program with a need that supports receiving $4,000 in Direct Subsidized Loans, the minimum period for which the school could originate a loan is a term. Because the number of terms in a semester-based program's academic year is generally two semesters, the subsidized usage period for the shortest loan that the school could award would be 0.5 years, which is greater than the student's remaining eligibility period. Therefore, the student is not eligible for the subsidized loan. If a first-time borrower exhausts his or her maximum eligibility period (has a remaining eligibility period of zero or less), or has a remaining eligibility period that is so short than the school cannot originate another Direct Subsidized Loan to the student, the borrower may not receive a Direct Subsidized Loan, but may receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an amount Different rules for borrowers enrolled in preparatory coursework 34 CFR 685.200(f)(6) The regulations provide varying treatment for borrowers who are enrolled in preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in an undergraduate program or a graduate/ professional program.Exception for borrowers who graduate before losing subsidy Borrowers who graduate before losing the interest subsidy on their Direct Subsidized Loans will never lose the interest subsidy on the loans that were outstanding at the time that they graduated from their program of study.When to update loan periods and academic years? It's very important to update loan periods and academic years in the following situations: Student requests the loan/disbursement be cancelled; Disbursement was not made for a term/ payment period included in the loan at origination; An actual disbursement was made but later zeroed out; Student enrolled in a non-term or clock- hour program and has failed to progress from one payment period to another as originally scheduled; Summer is not a required term and student attends the summer term and requests a loan for summer. 150% rule FAQ E-Announcement May 11, 2016 This FAQ provides answers to some common 150% rule calculation and reporting questions. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-128 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 150 Percent Rule: Calculation, reporting, loss of subsidy example Kirk is enrolled in a 4 year semester-based bachelor's degree program at McCaffrey University. Since his program is 4 years, under the 150% rule, Kirk has a \"maximum eligibility period\" of 6 years. McCaffrey measures Kirk's progress towards expending his maximum eligibility period by adding up all of Kirk's \"subsidized usage periods, \" or SUPs. Kirk is in his third year of study, so McCaffrey looks at the SUPs that COD has previously calculated for Kirk, and finds that his Sum Actual Subsidized Usage Period is 2 years. Kirk has 6 years of eligibility for his 4 year program under the 150% rule, and so his remaining eligibility period is 4 years. Because his remaining eligibility period is at least 1 year, McCaffrey awards a Direct Subsidized Loan to Kirk like it normally would. After McCaffrey submits records to COD indicating that Kirk is in a 4-year program, it receives a response from COD stating Kirk's SUP for the loan McCaffrey just submitted, the sum of all of Kirk's SUPs, and Kirk's remaining eligibility period (REP). Once McCaffrey disburses the new Direct Subsidized Loan to Kirk, his remaining eligibility period will be 3 years. Between his third and fourth year, Kirk decides to change to a new (also semester-based) program. His new program is a 2.5 year program, so his 150% limit is now 3.75 years. Even though he is studying in a different program, Kirk's existing SUPs are taken into account when measuring his 150% progress. Since Kirk already has 3 SUPs, his remaining eligibility period is now just .75 years. Since Kirk will need to attend for 2.5 years to complete his new program, the final 1.75 years of his program will be cut off from subsidized loan eligibility. So, when exactly does Kirk get cut off from subsidized loans? Kirk can only receive Direct Subsidized Loans if McCaffrey can properly originate a loan that creates a SUP that is equal to or less than Kirk's remaining eligibility period (REP). In this case, McCaffrey can originate a Direct Subsidized Loan for Kirk's first fall semester, which consists of .5 SUP , but cannot include his spring semester if Kirk attends full-time, as Kirk only has .25 SUP remaining, and the spring semester is .5 SUP . McCaffrey must originate only unsubsidized loans for Kirk beginning with the spring semester. COD will send a response to its records listing Kirk's remaining eligibility when McCaffrey originates a loan. that is equal to the amount that the borrower always could have received in Direct Unsubsidized Loans, plus the amount the borrower otherwise could have received in Direct Subsidized Loans. A borrower loses the interest subsidy on any outstanding Direct Subsidized Loans (including a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Subsidized Loan) if the borrower attends any undergraduate program (or preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in an undergraduate program) on at least a half-time basis, at a school that participates in the Title IV programs, while having a remaining eligibility period of zero or less. When interest subsidy is lost it is not retroactive. Rather, the borrower is only charged interest from the date the borrower loses the interest subsidy (by exceeding the 150% limit). Loans received for programs other than teacher certification programs do not lose subsidy upon enrollment in a teacher certification program, and loans received for teacher certification programs do not lose subsidy, even upon enrollment in a regular undergraduate program.

The Department is working with closed schools to make award and disbursement adjustments to update student's REP status. Pending disbursements of a Direct Loan awarded at the closed school with disbursement dates after the school's closure date will not be made. You can ignore any pending disbursments when awarding the student Direct Loan funds at your school, and you don't need to wait for pending disbursements to be reduced to zero before submitting a Direct Loan origination to COD.Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-129 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Common reporting E-Announcement April 20, 2015 E-Announcement May 13, 2016 *These programs must define their academic years as at least 900 clock-hours and 26 or 30 weeks of instructional time (see Chapter 1 of this Volume for requirements when defining the academic year), even when the program is shorter than this. When the program is shorter than the academic year, the student is considered to have a loan period equal to the length of time needed to complete the credit/ clock-hours in the program and an academic year equal to the school's Title IV Academic year, which must adhere at least to the minimum standard (24 semester hours or 900 clock-hours and 26/30 weeks of instructional time).Reporting and tracking the 150% limit The Department will track, calculate, and inform borrowers and schools of borrower eligibility for subsidized loans and loss of subsidy benefits based on program length information that schools report to COD and NSLDS. It is essential that any changes in enrollment or program be reported to NSLDS in a timely manner to ensure correct calculation of subsidy periods. For each loan origination record, COD will send a disclosure statement which will include the SUP for that loan, the sum of the student's SUPs, and the REP. There are several common mistakes in tracking and reporting students' progress towards the 150% limit: For standard term (and non-standard SE9W term) programs, reporting academic year dates that are the length of a single term \u2014All BBAY & SAY academic years for these terms consist of more than one term; For non-term, non-standard-term SE9W, and clock-hour programs, reporting academic year dates that result in periods shorter than what is permitted ;* (see common reporting issues sidebar) Reporting \"weeks\" or \"months\" instead of years\u2014 Y ears is the measure. Report 1.5 for one year and 6 months, for example. Accidentally reporting inappropriately short program lengths \u2014 Program length is a 6 digit field in NSLDS, with an implied decimal point in between the third and fourth digits. A four-year program is reported as \"004000. \" Reporting \"000400\" is a program length of just .4 years! Reporting too high a loan amount. A loan which is at the student's annual loan limit ($3,500, $4,500, or $5,500) triggers a full year of SUP to be reported, but the correct SUP for the loan may be shorter. You should reduce the loan amount to the total of actual disbursements (and zero out any related pending disbursements). Reporting too much SUP for a loan period which contains terms/ payment periods in which a disbursement wasn't made (or was made but later zeroed out). The SUP calculation takes all terms into account, so for SUP calculation & reporting purposes, remove from the loan period any terms/payment periods where a disbursement isn't made/retained. Reporting dates of terms/payment periods which don't coincide with the dates of the loan period . Either the entire term is in the loan period or none of it is. The loan period end date should not be shortened to the last date of attendance. If the loan can't be re- configured correctly, the remaining eligibility simply can't be used. If this happens, the student can only be awarded unsubsidized loans. Academic year reported as single term, so the excessively short academic year causes SUP to be too high. Report your school's defined academic year (regulatory minimum is 26 or 30 weeks of instructional time; see Chapter 1 of this volume for weeks of I.T. requirements).Financial aid history requirement & NSLDS To ensure that a student doesn't exceed the annual and aggregate loan limits, the student's FAFSA data is matched with the National Student Loan Data System and the student's loan history is included in the ISIR. If a student transfers to your school, you must inform NSLDS so that it can begin the Transfer Student Monitoring process. More detailed information on how this requirement applies to all of the FSA programs can be found in Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook .NSLDS reporting May 13, 2016 E-Announcement New COD SULA edit codes Edit 046: Academic year less than 26 weeks Edit 219: Loan amount is greater than sum of disbursements Edit 220 if $0 disbursement has a payment period start date (PPSD) within the loan periodNEWNEWVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-130 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Checking loan amounts on NSLDS If a student at your school has Title IV loans that were received at other schools, you may need to check the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) website to make sure the student still has remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the financial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as the NSLDS website) and the Transfer Student Monitoring process to tell you if a student is about to exceed the aggregate loan limits. (The NSLDS financial aid history may affect eligibility for other FSA programs, so it is discussed in more detail in Volume 1 , Chapter 3 .) The aggregate loan limits do not include accrued or capitalized interest or other charges. To avoid counting interest and other charges when determining a student's remaining loan eligibility using NSLDS, use the aggregate outstanding principal balance (Agg. OPB) shown in NSLDS for each of the student's outstanding loans. For instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in interest accrues and is capitalized. The total outstanding balance on the loan will be $5,200, and the aggregate outstanding principal balance will be $5,000. It is the last figure, the aggregate outstanding principal balance- as displayed in the student's NSLDS Loan Detail-that you should use to determine remaining loan eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. For Consolidation Loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Consolidation Loans made under the FFEL program), which may include Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and subsidized/unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, NSLDS will now show separate totals for the Subsidized Agg OPB and Unsubsidized Agg OPB . In addition, NSLDS will show a total for \"Unallocated\" loan amounts for loans that cannot be identified. You are not responsible for reviewing these unallocated loans to determine their origin. Effect of change in student status on aggregate loan limits In some cases, a student may qualify for higher loan limits, but then lose the eligibility for the higher limits. This situation could occur because a dependent student's parent received a Direct PLUS Loan after having been denied in previous years, and the student therefore could no longer borrow at the independent student loan levels, or because a student with a graduate degree entered an undergraduate degree program. In these cases, you only count the loan amounts that the student would have received under his or her current eligibility as an undergraduate or dependent student against the applicable undergraduate aggregate loan limit. The NSLDS website displays undergraduate and graduate aggregate amounts in the Aggregate Loan Information section for subsidized, unsubsidized, combined, and unallocated portions of consolidated loans. The undergraduate aggregate section will display only if the student has undergraduate loans and the graduate aggregate section will display only if the student has graduate loans. Also on the NSLDS website, the Exceeds Loan Limits warning symbols provide automatic filters to display the Loan Summary list on the Loan History web page to show those loans that were attributed to the applicable loan limit overage. These website tools will assist with separating undergraduate, graduate, and overall loan totals, and will aid in eligibility determinations. Resolving conflicting information in NSLDS GEN-96-13, Q&A 37 If you can document that the student is eligible for FSA funds despite the information shown on NSLDS, you may award and disburse aid. An example would be if the NSLDS Financial Aid History page of the SAR or ISIR shows that the student has a defaulted loan, but you have obtained documentation from the holder of the loan that the borrower had made \"satisfactory arrangements to repay.\"Handling unallocated amounts in NSLDS You do not have to review unallocated amounts in NSLDS. NSLDS does not add the amount of unallocated loans when triggering the \"close to or exceeds aggregate limits\" flags. See NSLDS Newsletter 11 , February 2006.Revised formula for calculating unsubsidized aggregate loan amounts NSLDS now utilizes a revised formula to calculate aggregate loan limit amounts. NSLDS no longer includes Direct PLUS Loan amounts that can be attributed to having been consolidated into a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan when calculating a borrower's unsubsidized aggregate loan amount and combined loan limit amount. This change will be reflected in the NSLDS Professional Access website as well as on ISIRs. For more details on this change, see the E-Announcement of August 13th, 2012.Treatment of consolidated Perkins Loans A consolidated Perkins Loan is not counted toward the aggregate Direct Loan limits. Chapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-131 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 150 Percent Rule: Remaining eligibility period of less than one year An eligible student can receive a Direct Subsidized Loan when their Remaining Eligibility Period (REP) is less than one year. In this case, the student can receive a Direct Loan if the school can originate a Direct Loan in compliance with all of the requirements in 34 CFR 685.301 (pay particular attention to minimum loan period, which varies by program type), and the loan's loan period, academic year, enrollment status, and loan amount result in a Subsidized Usage Period (SUP) that is equal to or less than the student's REP . For example, Kris attends a credit-hour, semester-based program at Sandburg College, has a REP of .5 years, and is full-time. Kris will be able to receive a single-term subsidized loan if he's otherwise eligible, because the minimum loan period for his circumstance is a semester, and the academic year will be at least two semesters. This loan for one semester (with a two-semester academic year) would create a .5 SUP , and will expend his .5 REP . But consider if Kris was enrolled in a clock-hour program which is 1 year in length and had a REP of .5 years. Kris would not be able to receive another Direct Subsidized Loan because the minimum loan period must be, per the regulations, one year and since the academic year would also be one year, the SUP would be one year, which is greater than Kris's REP of .5 years. As noted in the main body text section on the 150% limit, SUPs are prorated for enrollment status\u2014multiply by .75 or .5 for three-quarter time or half-time. As such, even when a borrower has only a small remaining SUP , it may still be possible for them to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan if they are enrolled less than full-time. ********************************************** The following three scenarios present three different loan awarding scenarios that Sandburg College faces with its various students. Sandburg wonders if each loan will be accepted or rejected by COD due to the limitations related to the 150% limit. For each case, we give the loan period, academic year, and SUP , as measured in days. Will COD accept or reject each loan award? Award Scenario 1 Remaining Eligibility Period .8 years Loan Period: 9/10/16- 5/10/17 (244 days) Academic Year: 9/10/16-5/10/17 (244 days) SUP: 244/244 = 1 year COD rejects the loan, because the SUP is 1 year, exceeding the student's REP of .8 years. Award Scenario 2 Remaining Eligibility Period .8 years Loan Period: 9/10/16- 12/20/16 (102 days) Academic Year: 9/10/16-5/10/17 (244 days) SUP: 102/244 = .4 years (.418 to be precise, but this is rounded to the nearest tenth\u2014see the rounding guidance in the body text section on SUP calculation) COD accepts the loan, because the SUP is .4 years, which is less than the student's REP of .8 years. Award Scenario 3 Remaining Eligibility Period .8 years Loan Period: 9/10/16- 5/10/17 (244 days) Academic Year: 9/10/16-5/10/17 244/244 = 1 year Enrollment status: half-time COD accepts the loan, because the SUP is 1 year, multiplied by .5 for half-time enrollment status, resulting in .5 SUP, which is less than the student's REP of .8 years. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-132 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms A dependent student is treated as an independent student for loan limit purposes and receives additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (up to the additional amounts available to independent undergraduates) for the first 3 years at your school because a parent was denied a Direct PLUS Loan for each of those years, but a parent was eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan for the student's fourth year. The student would be eligible for the following Direct Loan amounts: 1st year (independent student loan limit) = $9,500 (maximum $3,500 subsidized) 2nd year (independent student loan limit) = $10,500 (maximum $4,500 subsidized) 3rd year (independent student loan limit) = $12,500 (maximum $5,500 subsidized) For each of the first three years, the student receives the maximum subsidized amount and the maximum additional unsubsidized amount. In the 4th year, the parent is eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, so the student is then subject to the annual and aggregate loan limits for a dependent undergraduate. Although it might appear that the student would have no remaining loan eligibility for year 4 because the total amount received for years 1-3 exceeds the $31,000 dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount that the student received as a result of the parent Direct PLUS Loan denials in the first three years of the undergraduate program does not count against the $31,000 dependent aggregate limit. The student received a total of $19,000 in additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for the first three years ($6,000 each in years 1 and 2, and $7,000 in year 3). Of this total additional unsubsidized amount, the student would have been eligible to receive $6,000 ($2,000 each year) as a dependent undergraduate if the student's parent had qualified for a Direct PLUS Loan. The extra $13,000 in unsubsidized funds that the student received as a result of the parent being unable to obtain a Direct PLUS Loan for the first three years ($4,000 in years 1 and 2, and $5,000 in year 3) is not counted against the $31,000 dependent undergraduate aggregate when determining the student's loan eligibility for year 4. Excluding this amount, only $19,500 of the total $32,500 the student received for the first three years counts against the $31,000 dependent undergraduate aggregate loan limit. This means that for year 4, the student is eligible to receive up to the full annual loan limit for a dependent undergraduate: 4th year (dependent student loan limit) = $7,500Example: Aggregate loan limits with additional Direct Unsubsidized when parents are denied Direct PLUS LoansChapter 5 \u2014 Direct Loan Periods and Amounts3-133 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms RECALCULATION AND DIRECT LOANS A change in enrollment status to less than half time as a result of the failure to begin attendance in all scheduled classes would not affect the student's eligibility for any Direct Loan funds previously disbursed because at the time the previous disbursements were made, the student was still scheduled to attend on at least a half-time basis. However, a student who is no longer enrolled at least half time may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan. Moreover, Title IV program funds are disbursed to a student on the presumption that he or she will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of Title IV program funds until a student has begun attendance in enough hours to qualify for the enrollment status for which the funds were awarded. However, if a school is recalculating a student's eligibility because a student has dropped classes and the student has not begun attendance in enough courses to establish a half-time enrollment status, the presumption that the student will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded is no longer valid. Therefore, a school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to a student who never began attendance in enough courses to establish a half-time enrollment status . Likewise, if a school is recalculating aid for a student who was enrolled in a series of modules and who dropped all future classes before beginning attendance in enough classes for half-time enrollment status, the school may not disburse the Direct Loan for the payment period because the school knows the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis (34 CFR 685.303(b)(3)(i) and (iv)). If the student resumes enrollment on a half-time basis during the payment period or period of enrollment, the school may make the disbursement if the school documents (1) the student's revised COA, and (2) that the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of the loan, despite any reduction in the student's cost of attendance caused by the student's temporary cessation of enrollment on at least a half-time basis. (HEA Sec. 471, Part F) (34 CFR 685.303(b)(3)(iv)(A) through (C)).Section 34 668.164(j)(3)(iii), which permits a school to make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred to a student who did not withdraw but ceased to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, does not apply to a student who dropped all future classes or modules because the student never really began classes as a half- time student. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-134 FSA HB Dec 2018 Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms EFFECT OF OVERBORROWING THEN REGAINING ELIGIBILITY A student who has inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits is ineligible to receive any FSA funds until the overborrowing is resolved. The student can regain eligibility for aid by repaying the amount that exceeded the annual or aggregate loan limits, or by making satisfactory arrangements with the loan servicer to repay the excess amount. The loan servicer will allow a borrower to \"reaffirm\" that he or she will repay the excess according to the terms and timing of the original promissory note. For more details on the various steps involved in reaffirmation, see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-13-02. If the inadvertent overborrowing occurred at your school, you should work with the student and the loan holder to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to restore the student's eligibility. Overborrowing is not considered inadvertent if there is any evidence that the overborrowing was the result of deliberate action on the part of the school that determined the borrower's eligibility for the loan, or on the part of the borrower who received the loan. If you determine that the overborrowing was the result of deliberate action on the part of another school or the borrower, you must notify your FSA School Participation Team and provide evidence. Once you have documented that the student has either repaid the excess loan amount or has made satisfactory arrangements with the loan holder to repay the excess amount, you may award additional aid. However, the student may or may not be eligible to receive additional loan funds, depending on the circumstances. For example, a dependent undergraduate who inadvertently exceeded the $23,000 (subsidized) aggregate limit could not receive any additional Direct Subsidized Loan funds as a dependent undergraduate unless the outstanding debt was paid down below the $23,000 limit. However, the student could potentially receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds, up to the $31,000 aggregate loan limit, or non-loan aid. An independent undergraduate who inadvertently exceeded the $23,000 subsidized limit (but who has not reached the $57,500 combined aggregate loan limit for independent undergraduates) could borrow additional Direct Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds once he or she makes satisfactory arrangements to repay the subsidized amount that exceeds $23,000. For more on overborrowing and overawards, see Volume 5 . The effective date when a student regains eligibility for the Pell Grant, Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant programs begins with the payment period in which the overborrowing was resolved, and for Direct Loans, eligibility is retroactive to the beginning of the academic year in which the overborrowing was resolved. Consolidation of loan amounts that exceed the annual or aggregate loan limit If a borrower who inadvertently received more than the annual or aggregate loan limits has consolidated the loan(s) that caused the borrower to exceed the loan limit, the consolidation loan is considered to be a satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount that restores the borrower's eligibility for FSA aid. (Note, however, that consolidation of an amount that exceeded the aggregate Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan limits does not automatically make a student eligible for additional Direct Loan funds.) Regaining Title IV Eligibility after exceeding loan limits 34 CFR 668.35(d) DCL GEN-13-02Chapter 5 \u2014 HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms The process for completing the Master Promissory Note (MPN) for a Direct Loan and making the initial loan includes the following elements, though some school procedures may be in a slightly different order. In completing several of these steps, the website www. studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action may be helpful. 1. Student applies for aid. The student fills out the FAFSA (or a renewal FAFSA). 2. School determines eligibility and loan amount. The school confirms the student's eligibility for federal student aid, determines the loan period and loan amount, and packages the loan(s) requested. 3. Origination. The school originates the loan. k In the Direct Loan Program, the school submits an origination record to COD and receives an acknowledgment from COD. 4. Student completes MPN. The student fills out an MPN for the initial loan. k The Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities Statement is included in the MPN. 5. Disclosure & entrance counseling. First-time Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan and Direct Grad PLUS borrowers must complete entrance counseling before a disbursement can be made. (See Volume 2, Chapter 6 .) The borrower must be given a disclosure statement (usually provided by the Department) with specific information about the types of loans the borrower is getting, anticipated disbursement amounts, anticipated disbursement dates, and instructions on how to cancel the loans. This statement must be given either: prior to disbursement (up to 30 days prior to the first disbursement); or at the time of the first disbursement (and no later than 7 days after disbursement/crediting the student's account, if you don't obtain the borrower's There are two methods of MPN processing: regular mail and overnight/express mail. Send express and overnight mail to: Send regular mail submissions to: U.S. Department of Education U.S. Department of Education 2429 Military Road P .O. Box 9002 Suite 200 Niagra Falls, NY 14302 Niagra Falls, NY 14304affirmation/authorization for the loan); or no later than 30 days after disbursement/ crediting the student's account if you do obtain the borrower's affirmation/ authorization for the loan). 6. Disbursement to the borrower. The school (after checking that the borrower is still eligible) disburses the loan funds to the student's account or directly to the borrower, and notifies the borrower of each disbursement. 7. Making subsequent loans. If the MPN is used as a multi-year note, a new MPN is not required for subsequent loans. However, your school must use a confirmation process (either active or passive) for subsequent loans, and the borrower must receive a Plain Language Disclosure, at or prior to the disbursement of any subsequent loans provided under an existing MPN. (The Plain Language Disclosure is usually sent to the borrower by the Department.) If the MPN is not used as a multi-year note, a borrower completes a new MPN for each subsequent loan period. Note that one common reason a multi-year MPN may be changed to a single- year note is the case of a Direct PLUS Loan that has an endorser. For your reference, refer to the Electronic Announcement of December 15, 2016. Sample copies of the MPN and related materials are available online .Review of the Direct Loan processVolume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, RULES Selecting independent & part-time students If any part of a school's FSEOG or FWS allocation is directly or indi - rectly based on the financial need of independent students or students who are attending part-time, then you must offer a reasonable proportion of the FSEOG allocation and the FWS allocation to such students. This require - ment includes part-time students at eligible additional locations, as well as part-time students on the main campus. A policy that excludes part-time or independent students is not acceptable. \"Part-time students\" also includes correspondence students. To be considered enrolled in a program of correspondence study, the student must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program and must have completed and submitted the first lesson. Uneven costs/unequal disbursements If the student incurs uneven costs or receives uneven resources during the year and needs extra funds in a particular payment period, you may make unequal disbursements of FSEOG. There is no explicit provision for unequal disbursements in FWS. However, because FWS wages are disbursed as work is performed, usually on a weekly or biweekly schedule, total disbursement amounts are likely to be different from one payment period to the next. In addition, as we'll discuss in the FWS section, a student may be paid for work performed during certain periods of nonattendance. Summer school and special sessions A student who enrolls as a regular student in an eligible program during summer school or a special session may receive Campus-Based aid if he or she meets the same general eligibility requirements that apply to a student enrolled in a regular session. If a student is not enrolled during the summer or special session, the student is not eligible to receive Campus-Based aid during the period of nonattendance , except in the case of an FWS job. (See FWS discussion in this chapter.) Awarding Campus-Based Aid Your school has some latitude in selecting recipients of its Campus-Based funds. This chapter discusses the criteria that you must consider when selecting Campus-Based recipients and the amounts that you may award to them. In addition, the student must meet the general eligibility criteria discussed in Volume 1, and your Campus-Based awards may not exceed the student's financial need, as described in Chapter 7 of Volume 3 . Chapter 6 Highlights FSEOG: Undergraduate only \u2014 see Volume 1 for rules. Maximum $4,000, Minimum $100. Priority order for FSEOG recipients is based on Pell Grant eligibility and lowest EFCs. FWS : Undergraduate/graduate eligibility. Awards based on academic workloads & other factors, packaged based on net earnings, after taxes and job-related costs are subtracted. Student may be employed during certain periods of nonattendance. Related Information: See Chapter 7 of this volume for a discussion of packaging Campus-Based aid with other assistance so as not to exceed the student's financial need. See Volume 1 for rules on undergraduate vs. graduate status. See Volume 4 for rules governing timing of disbursements & general FSA funds management. See Volume 6 for information on operating an FWS program, including allowable types of employment, JLD and Work College Selecting independent and part- time students 34 CFR 674.10(b), 675.10(c), 34 CFR Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms AWARDING FSEOG Award amounts The maximum Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) for a full academic year is usually $4,000. However, you may award as much as $4,400 to a student participating in a study-abroad program that is approved for credit by the home school. The min imum FSEOG amount is $100, but you may prorate this amount if the student is enrolled for less than an academic year. The FSEOG maximum award for a student applies to both the federal share and the required non-federal share. However, when your school has a waiver of the non-federal share, the FSEOG maximum applies to just the FSEOG federal funds. When there is no waiver, the FSEOG federal dollars awarded to a student are considered to be 75 percent of that student's total FSEOG award, and the school must account for the remaining 25 percent non-federal share, regardless of the type of school resources used and the method used to match. For more detail on the requirements of federal and non-federal shares, see Volume 6, Chapter 1 . Selecting FSEOG recipients When awarding FSEOG funds for an award year, you must first select students with the lowest Expected Family Contribution (EFC) who will also receive Pell Grants in that award year. This group is known as the FSEOG first selection group. A student who will receive a Pell Grant in the award year is a student who has demonstrated Pell Grant eligibility for the same award year based upon an EFC that you have calculated for the student or the EFC on the student's valid SAR or ISIR. A student who receives a Pell Grant at any time in the award year may be awarded an FSEOG for that award year; the student does not have to receive a Pell Grant in the same payment period as the FSEOG. For example, in the case of a student who receives a Pell Grant for the fall semester only due to reaching his lifetime eligibility used (LEU), the student may be awarded an FSEOG for both the fall semester and subsequent spring semester. If you have remaining FSEOG funds after making awards to all Pell Grant recipients for that award year, you must next select students with the lowest EFCs who are not receiving Pell Grants. This group of students is known as the FSEOG second selection group. This group also includes students who have exceeded their LEU. LEU is covered fully in Chapter 3 of this volume. You must keep documentation of the eligible EFC that was calculated for the student, and you must confirm Pell Grant eligibility prior to disburse - ment of the FSEOG. If the FSEOG recipient does not actually receive a Pell Grant during the award year, but the documentation shows that the FSEOG award and disbursement was made in good faith, you are not required to recover the FSEOG funds. If the student loses Pell Grant eligibility prior to disbursement of the FSEOG, you must cancel the FSEOG award.FSEOG citations Selection Procedures 34 CFR 676.10 Frequency of disbursements 34 CFR 676.16(a) and (e) Minimum and maximum awards 34 CFR 676.20 Award year & payment period \"Award year\" is defined as \"the period of time from July 1 of one year through June 30 of the following year.\" Institutional Eligibility regulations, 34 CFR 600.2 As discussed in Chapter 1 of this volume, the payment period for a program that uses standard academic terms is a semester, trimester, or quarter. See Chapter 1 for a description of payment periods in programs not using terms or not using standard terms. Payment period defined: 34 CFR 668.4 FSA Assessments To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment modules: Awarding & Disbursement, FSEOG and the Programs\" category, at: http://ifap.ed.gov/qahome/fsaassessment.html .FSEOG & Pell Grant LEU Students who have reached or exceeded 600% of their Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU may still be eligible to receive FSEOG, however, they are in the second selection group.Chapter 6 Awarding period Certain flexibilities exist when determining whether a student is consid - ered to be in the FSEOG first selection group during a payment period that falls into two award years (a payment period that begins before July 1 and ends on or after July 1, commonly referred to as a \"crossover payment period\"). If a student will also receive a Pell Grant during a payment period that occurs in two award years and the student is among those students with the lowest EFCs, the student satisfies the FSEOG first selection group require - ments for the same crossover period regardless of which award year the Pell Grant funds are attributed . In order to be considered part of the FSEOG first selection group, a student does not necessarily have to receive a Pell Grant in the same cross - over payment period. A student can also be awarded FSEOG funds under the FSEOG first selection group requirements during a crossover payment period, from either award year's allocation, as long as the student will also receive a Pell Grant in the award year to which the crossover payment period is attributed for Pell Grant purposes. Establishing categories of students Your selection procedures may specify categories of students to ensure that the students in each category have an opportunity to be awarded FSEOG funds. Categories may be based on class standing, enrollment status, program, date of application, or a combination of factors. You may choose to assign a percentage or dollar amount of FSEOG funds to each category; there is no requirement to make the percentage or dollar amount proportional to the need of students in a particular category or even to the number of students in the category. However, categorization may not be used to exclude certain students or groups of students from consideration. If you know that your school's funds are so limited as to effectively exclude year after year categories that come later in the sequence, your school may not be in compli - ance with the \"reasonably available\" provision. Your school's written selection procedures must ensure that FSEOG recipients are selected on the basis of the lowest EFC and Pell Grant priority requirements over the entire award year. If your school enrolls students as of - ten as monthly or weekly, FSEOG funds can be reserved for use throughout that award year (on the basis of your school's experiences from previous pe - riods), and selection practices can be applied in a manner that would assure a reasonable consistency over the entire award year. When you use categories to package FSEOG, within each category you must first award the assigned FSEOG funds to students with the lowest EFCs who will also receive a Pell Grant. If FSEOG funds assigned for that category still remain, you must next award FSEOG funds to students in the category with the lowest EFCs who will not receive a Pell Grant. Frequency & amount of FSEOG disbursements If you're awarding an FSEOG for a full academic year, you must pay a portion of the grant during each payment period, even if the student's program doesn't use standard academic terms. (See Chapter 1 of this volume for an explanation of payment periods.)Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-193-140 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms To determine the amount of each disbursement, you would usually divide the total FSEOG award by the number of payment periods the student will attend. However, you are allowed to pay an FSEOG in unequal amounts if the student has costs or resources that are different for different payment periods. You may make payments within a payment period in whatever installments will best meet the student's needs. AWARDING FEDERAL WORK-STUDY (FWS) Unlike the other two Campus-Based Programs, the FWS Program does not require that priority be given to students who have exceptional financial need. However, you must make FWS jobs reasonably available, to the extent of available funds, to all eligible students. Your selection procedures must be in writing, uniformly applied, and kept in your school's files. There are no specific award limits for FWS earnings, other than the requirement that the amount of the FWS award not exceed the student's financial need. For a full discussion of packaging FWS with other aid, see Chapter 7 in this volume. When deciding on an appropriate FWS award for a student, you should consider the student's academic work load and any other factors that might affect the hours that a student could work each week. Basing FWS awards on net work earnings The gross amount of the award is based on the total number of hours to be worked multiplied by the anticipated wage rate. For awarding and packaging purposes, you should use the student's net FWS earnings, which exclude taxes and job-related expenses. To determine the student's net FWS earnings, you should subtract any job-related costs and non-refundable taxes from the student's gross FWS earnings. If you are certain that the student's federal or state taxes paid will be refunded, you should not subtract those taxes paid from the student's gross earnings. Job-related costs are costs the student incurs because of his or her job. Examples of job-related costs include uniforms, the cost of meals at work, and transportation to and from work. For work during vacation periods, job- related costs can include room and board as long as the FWS student incurs these costs only because of the FWS employment. For example, room and board during the summer cannot be included in job-related costs if the FWS student also takes summer courses.Graduate/undergraduate status in teacher certification program A student enrolled in a teacher certification program may be considered either an undergraduate or a graduate student. Perkins Loans DCL GEN-17-10NEW Underuse of funds 34 CFR 674.3(d)(3) If your school does not use all of its Campus-Based funds annual authorization, this is called \"underutilization.\" Schools with an underutilization of over 10% of their annual authorization will have their annual authorization for the following year reduced by the dollar amount of the underutilization. Chapter 6 \u2014 Awarding Campus-Based Aid3-141 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Earnings for the next period of enrollment Many FWS students must pay the bulk of their education costs in the beginning of each period of enrollment, before they have had a chance to earn FWS wages. Therefore, you may allow a student to earn FWS wages to cover educational expenses in the next period of enrollment that your school offers. The student must be planning to enroll in that next period of enroll - ment and must demonstrate financial need for that period of enrollment. The next period of enrollment is usually the next term, including a summer period, or in the case of summer earnings, the next full academic year. A student may earn FWS funds for the next period of enrollment during any period of enrollment, including a period of enrollment that is comprised, in whole or in part, of minisessions. A student may also earn FWS wages toward the next period of enrollment during a period of nonattendance, as discussed below. Working during periods of nonattendance A student may be employed under FWS during a period of nonatten - dance, such as a summer term, an equivalent vacation period, the full-time work period of a cooperative education program, or an unattended fall or spring semester. To be eligible for this employment, a student must be plan - ning to enroll for the next period of enrollment and must have demonstrated financial need for that period of enrollment. The student's net earnings (earn - ings minus taxes and job-related costs) during this period of nonattendance must be used to cover expenses associated with his or her financial need for the next period of enrollment. When a student who had an FWS job in a period of nonattendance fails to enroll in the next academic period, you must be able to demonstrate that the student was eligible for employment and that, at the time the FWS was awarded, you had reason to believe the student intended to enroll in the next period. At a minimum, you must keep a written record in your files showing that the student had accepted the school's offer of admittance for the next period of enrollment. If, during the period of nonattendance, you learn that the student will no longer enroll in the next period of enrollment, the student must immediately stop working under FWS.Calculating Maximum Gross Earnings example Kris has unmet financial need of $1,000 at Grace University. Because Kris has a Social Security tax of 7.65% (that will not be refunded) and $108 in job-related costs, the school may allow Kris to earn an FWS award amount that is higher than his $1,000 unmet financial need in order for him to earn the allowable $1,000 net FWS earnings. To calculate the FWS award amount to reflect the maximum gross FWS earnings that Kris may earn without the net FWS earnings exceeding the student's $1,000 financial need, the school must do the following: 1. Add the amount of job-related costs to the amount of his unmet need ($108 + $1,000 = $1,108) for a total of $1,108. 2. Account for the Social Security tax by determining that his net FWS earnings are 92.35% of his gross earnings (100% - 7.65% = 92.35%) or (.9235). 3. Divide the total in step 1 by the ratio in step 2 ($1,108/.9235 = $1,199.78) for a result of $1,199.78 ($1,200 after rounding). Grace University may give Kris a $1,200 FWS award and his net FWS earnings will not exceed his $1,000 unmet financial need. Certain FWS students exempt from FICA taxes Under certain IRS specified conditions, FWS student wages for students employed by the school may be exempt from FICA taxes (for more detail, see http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non- Profits/Student-Exception-to-FICA-Tax ). FWS community service requirement 34 CFR & Packaging, 2018-193-142 FSA HB Dec 2018Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms Community service requirement, penalty, waivers A school must spend at least seven percent of its total FWS federal au - thorization to pay students employed in community service activities. In meeting this requirement, at least one or more of the school's FWS students must be employed as a reading tutor for children in a reading tutoring project or performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project. A school is still expected to pay the institutional share of a student's FWS wages. If you fail to meet one or both of these requirements, you may be re - quired to return FWS federal funds in an amount that represents the differ - ence between the amount a school should have spent for community service and the amount you actually spent. Your school may also be subject to a Limitation, Suspension, and Termination proceeding, through which your school could be denied future participation in the FWS Program, and possi - bly other Title IV programs. Your school may also be subject to a substantial fine. If enforcing the requirement(s) would cause a hardship for the students at the school (not a hardship for the school), the Department of Education may waive one or both of the community service requirements. The fact that it may be difficult for the school to comply with the requirement(s) is not in and of itself a basis for granting a waiver. To submit a waiver request, go to the eCampus-Based website and navigate to the \"Community Service Waiver\" link at the top of the \"Setup- Change Years/Schools\" page. Your waiver request must specify whether your school is requesting a waiver of the seven percent community service require - ment, the reading tutor or child/family literacy project requirement, or both. You must also include detailed information to demonstrate that complying with the requirement(s) would cause hardship for the school's students. Some commonly denied reasons for a waiver include: The school was unable to generate sufficient FWS positions to utilize the funds; The school had difficulty making necessary FWS awards to stu - dents; Awarded students did not return the second semester; New financial aid administrator(s); Staff did not realize the funds had not been expended until too late. Examples of acceptable waiver reasons include: School has an FWS annual authorization insufficient to meet the requirement(s); School is in a rural/low-population location; Students are in specialized program of study.Work during nonattendance For further information about working during vacation periods or periods of nonattendance, see the discussion of enrollment requirements in Volume 1.Taxes and job-related costs cite 34 CFR 675.25(a) FWS for period preceding study abroad A student in an eligible study-abroad program may be employed during a period of nonattendance preceding the study abroad if he or she will be continuously enrolled in his or her American school while abroad and if the student's study is part of the American school's own program. In such a case, a student may be employed in a qualified position in the United States, at the American school's branch campus in a foreign country, or at a U.S. government facility abroad. Minisession example Lutz University has a summer term made up of three minisessions. Robert enrolls in classes for the June and August minisessions but does not enroll in any classes for the July minisession. Robert has a financial need of $500 for his attendance in two of the summer minisessions. Robert also plans to enroll in the following fall semester and has a remaining need of $250 for that semester. Robert is given a $750 FWS award in the summer ($500 for the two summer minisessions and $250 for the fall semester). Robert knows his June minisession courses will be very demanding and he will not have time to work. So, Robert earns $500 during the July minisession when he has no classes. Robert has classes again in August, but his academic workload is lighter. In August, Robert earns $250 toward his education costs in the upcoming fall semester.FWS and minisessions If your school combines a series of minisessions or modules into one term (e.g., three summer minisessions into one summer semester), an FWS student attending any of the minisessions may earn FWS wages at any time throughout that term. You may apply those earnings towards the student's financial need for the minisession(s) attended and/or the next period of enrollment. You must base the student's financial need for attending the summer term on the period when the student is actually enrolled in the minisessions. The amount of FWS wages a student may earn at any given point in the term does not depend on whether or not the student is enrolled in a minisession at that time. You have some flexibility in deciding with the student how to distribute the hours worked throughout the summer term. (See the example in the sidebar below.)CHAPTER73-143 FSA HB Dec student's FAFSA information (including EFC) and calculated the student's aid eligibility, you can package the student's aid. The general rule in packaging is that the student's total financial aid and other Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) must not exceed the student's financial need. If you discover that the student has other EFA that causes the aid package to exceed the student's need, you must attempt to adjust the aid package to eliminate the overaward. If the overaward can't be eliminated, you must follow the overaward procedures in Volume 5. In earlier chapters of this volume, we described how to calculate student awards, based on costs, period of enrollment, and statutory award maximums. Except for Pell Grants, Title IV award amounts are also constrained by the other aid that a student receives, known as Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA). The general rule is that the student's total aid may not exceed the student's financial need. (Need = Cost of Attendance minus EFC.) The cost of attendance for the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct/Direct PLUS Loan programs is based on the student's enrollment status and costs for the period for which the aid is intended. The Cost of Attendance (COA) used for Pell Grants and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are part-time in a term program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. The process of awarding aid without exceeding the student's financial need is traditionally called packaging. Packaging is a process that varies from school to school, depending on the types of scholarship and other aid available at the school, and the characteristics of the student population. Schools may have different packaging philosophies, but they generally try to find the best combination of aid to meet the financial need of the students they serve. To help you package federal student aid with your other aid awards, we provide a packaging module in EDExpress. You can enter information about your school's student aid programs and set up factors to be considered in packaging, and then use the software to automate the packaging process. Most schools use some form of packaging software, whether EDExpress or software from a commercial vendor. You are not required to use EDExpress to package Title IV awards, and you do not have to report the student's aid package to the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) CHAPTER 7 HIGHLIGHTS: Related software: EDExpress Packaging Module Available at https://fsadownload.ed.gov Packaging principles Pell Grants packaged first; not reduced for other aid.

PELL GRANTS AS FIRST SOURCE OF AID Pell Grants are considered to be the first source of aid to the student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with Pell eligibility. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. Therefore, if a student's aid package exceeds his/her need, you must attempt to eliminate the overaward by reducing other aid your school controls. The Department issues Pell payment schedules that base the award solely on the student's cost of attendance, EFC, and enrollment status. As we'll see, aid from the other Title IV programs must be awarded to ensure that the student's need is not exceeded, unless certain types of aid are used to replace the EFC, as permitted. Traditional financial aid practice suggests that you would also adjust non-federal aid awards, if necessary, to ensure that the student's financial need is not exceeded. But it's possible that the student will receive a scholarship or other aid that you can't adjust and is large enough (in combination with the Pell Grant) to exceed the student's need. In this case, the student is still eligible for a Pell Grant based on the payment schedule. However, you can't award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's rules for athletic aid sometimes permit a school to award athletic aid that exceeds the student's need. You must still pay the full Pell Grant to the student, but you may not pay other Title IV funds to the student, because his/her financial need has already been met. PACKAGING RULES FOR CAMPUS-BASED AID AND DIRECT LOANS You should consider a number of things when developing a packaging policy. For instance, some schools give more grant assistance to beginning students, who may have more difficulty adjusting to campus life, increasing the proportion of loans and work-study in subsequent years. For the Campus-Based Programs and other programs where the available funds may not be sufficient to meet every eligible student's need, some schools decide to give a higher proportion of aid to the neediest students. Other schools award funds as an equal proportion of each student's need. Many schools use software, such as the Packaging module in EDExpress, that can be configured to implement the school's packaging philosophy. For instance, in EDExpress, you can specify the order in which aid sources are to be applied to the student's unmet need, and set overall percentage limits on the amount of gift (grants/scholarships) and self-help aid that will be included in the aid package. For students who have a Pell-eligible EFC, you must not award any Some key points from Chapter 5 (Direct/Direct PLUS Loan Periods and Amounts) Before you originate a loan, you must determine the student's eligibility for a Pell Grant. You may originate a Direct Subsidized Loan only for the amount of the student's financial need\u2014the student's costs minus the student's EFC and estimated cost minus financial assistance. A student may qualify for a combination of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. If they meet program requirements, the parents of a dependent student can take out a PLUS Loan to pay for the student's cost of attendance. There is no fixed loan limit for PLUS Loans. If the student is independent, or his/her parents can't borrow a PLUS, the student is eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized amounts. Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans (as well as TEACH Grant funds) can be used to replace the EFC, as well as to cover the student's unmet need. Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students. Graduate/professional students may not receive Direct Subsidized loans for loan periods that start on or after July 1, 2012. Pell can't be used to pay a loan If the student's aid package includes a loan and the package must be adjusted to prevent an overaward, the Pell Grant funds can't be used to pay back the loan\u2014a loan repayment isn't an educational expense. Prohibition on originating Direct Loans for school charges only HEA Sec. 479(A)(c) 34 CFR 685.301(a)(8) DCL GEN-11-07 Your school cannot originate Direct Loans only in the amount needed to cover the school charges, nor limit Direct Unsubsidized borrowing by independent students. See Chapter 5 of this volume for further information on originating loan amounts. Requirements for arrangements with private lenders 34 CFR 601 For more detail on the school's responsibilities with respect to education loans from private lenders, see the participation and student consumer information requirements in Volume 2 of the FSA Handbook.Chapter 7 \u2014 Packaging reached their 600% Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) until after awarding all students who are still Pell-eligible. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (EFA) In contrast to Pell & Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, you must take other aid into account when awarding TEACH Grant funds, Campus- Based aid, or Title IV Loans. As noted earlier, the other aid that must be considered is called \"estimated financial assistance\" (EFA). \"EFA\" is used in the same way for the Title IV Loan programs purposes as for TEACH and the Campus-Based Programs. However, there are differences in the treatment of AmeriCorps and Chapter 30 GI benefits (discussed later in this chapter). In general, EFA, as defined for the Campus-Based Programs and TEACH grants, refers to aid from the Title IV programs, as well as grants, scholarships, loans, and need-based employment that you can reasonably anticipate at the time you award aid to the student, whether the assistance is awarded by the school or by an individual or organization outside the school. If aid is excluded from either EFA or COA, that amount must be excluded from both EFA and COA. The regulations specify that \"estimated financial assistance\" is aid that the student will receive for the same period of enrollment as the loan. As noted in Chapter 1 , it's usually best to originate a loan for a period that matches the academic year or other period that you're using to award funds from other Title IV programs. The amount of a private education loan which exceeds the EFC when substituting for the EFC is considered EFA. When classifying non-FSA sources of aid, if a student receives the award because of postsecondary enrollment (for example, a scholarship from a local social club that requires a student to be attending a postsecondary school), it counts as EFA if it is not considered wages for employment according to federal or state rules, or if it is considered wages and is based on need. Any amount that appears as income on the tax return will also be included on the appropriate line of item 44 or 93 on the FAFSA. If the award is considered Estimated Financial Assistance Any educational benefits paid because of enrollment in postsecondary education, such as: The student's Pell Grant eligibility; Direct Unsubsidized and Subsidized Loans; PLUS Loans; Long-term loans made by the school, including Federal Perkins Loans (short-term emergency loans are not considered to be Estimated Financial Assistance); Grants, including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOGs) and state grants; Scholarships, including athletic scholarships and scholarships that require future employment but are given in the current year; Examples of Estimated Financial Assistance Employer reimbursement of employee's tuition Waivers of tuition and fees; Fellowships or assistantships; Income from insurance programs that pay for the student's education; Need-based employment such as FWS; Net income from need-based employment; AmeriCorps funds (except when packaging Direct Subsidized Loans); McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program; and TEACH Grant funds. Private education loans are not considered EFA UNLESS the loan substitutes for the EFC and exceeds it, in which case the loan funds which exceed the EFC are considered EFA.Estimated Financial Assistance CFR 685.102(b) Note: The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is not considered EFA. Estimated Financial Assistance provided by a state HEA Sec. 480(j) If the assistance provided by a state is not considered Title IV assistance (such as a LEAP Grant), and is designated by the state to offset a specific component of the student's COA, the amount of that assistance may be excluded from both COA and Estimated Financial Assistance. You may exclude such assistance on a student-by-student basis, but if it is excluded, it must be excluded for both COA and Estimated Financial Assistance. If the amount excluded is less than the allowance provided in the student's COA, you must exclude the lesser amount. Prepaid tuition plans GEN-06-05, HEA Sec. 480(f) & (j) Prepaid tuition plans are not considered EFA; instead, they are treated the same as Coverdell education and 529 savings accounts. Their value is considered an asset of the owner of the account, unless the owner of the account is a dependent student. When the owner is a dependent student, the value of the account is reported as an asset of the parents on the FAFSA. For more detail, see Volume 1, Chapter 2, under the heading \"Qualified Education Benefits.\" Not EFA The Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant is NOT considered EFA. Veterans education benefits are not considered EFA (see Appendix A at the end of this chapter). When awarding Campus-Based funds, you may exclude from EFA: funds up to the amount of any Direct Subsidized Loan that you award to the student when the student received AmeriCorps or Chapter 30 benefits. When determining eligibility for subsidized Direct Loans, you must exclude the entire amount of AmeriCorps benefits.

PACKAGING AID FOR CHILDREN OF IRAQ & AFGHANISTAN SOLDIERS As described in Chapter 3 , a student whose parent or guardian died as a result of U.S. military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, may receive increased amounts of Title IV aid, if, at the time of the parent or guardian's death, the student was 1) 23 years of age or younger, or 2) enrolled at an institution of higher education. The aid award and the method of packaging depends upon whether a student who meets the above criteria has a Pell-eligible EFC: If the student has a Pell-eligible EFC, you must award all Title IV aid based on an EFC of zero and must package all aid based on an EFC of zero, without regard to the student's calculated EFC (you don't actually change the student's EFC). If the student has an EFC that is too high to qualify for a Pell Grant, he or she is potentially eligible to receive an Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant. Packaging Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants The amount of the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is determined by enrollment status only (see Chapter 3 ). For students receiving Grants, you include the student's normally calculated EFC when packaging other Title IV aid. The Grant is not based on need and is not considered EFA (for purposes of awarding aid from other Title IV programs). COA is only taken into account if the student's COA is less than the maximum Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant. For more detail on the Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, including calculating an award for a payment period, see Chapter 3 of this volume. An Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant is not adjusted to take into account other forms of aid, so if a student's aid package includes a grant and the total package exceeds the student's need or cost of attendance, you must reduce other aid to eliminate the overaward. If a student's total grant payments, by themselves, excluding other aid, will exceed his or her FSA cost of attendance for a period of enrollment, the total amount of the grant paid to the student must be reduced to the cost of attendance for the period of enrollment (reduce each payment for each payment period by an equal amount).Packaging Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants July 30, 2010 E-Announcement February 11, 2011 E-Announcement An Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant awarded to an ineligible student is an overaward, as is a grant based on a Pell Grant Payment Schedule for an enrollment status different than that for which a student is enrolled. Finally, an Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant that by itself exceeds the student's cost of attendance is an overaward. All of these Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant overawards must be corrected (for more detail on how to resolve overawards, see Volume 5 of the FSA Handbook ). Packaging Graduate/Professional PLUS A Direct PLUS Loan does not count against a graduate/professional student's Direct Unsubsidized annual or aggregate loan limits. Use net FWS earnings when packaging To determine the net amount of a student's FWS earnings that will be available to help pay for the student's costs, you must subtract estimated taxes and job-related costs from the student's gross FWS earnings (see Chapter 6 of this volume).Pell and Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used You must check the COD common records and the ISIR / NSLDS records to make sure students close to the 600% lifetime limit on a Pell Grant are not packaged in such a way as to go over 600% of the LEU for either program; to do so would be to overaward the student. The Department will also provide weekly reports in the SAIG mailbox (message class PGLEXXOP, where XX=year) for your school's Pell-eligible applicants that have a Pell LEU greater than or equal to 450%. See Chapter 3 for more detail on the effects of various levels of Pell/Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU. Chapter 7 \u2014 Packaging Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 3-147 FSA HB Dec 2018PACKAGING TEACH GRANTS If you choose not to use the TEACH Grant to finance the EFC (see the \"Substituting for the EFC\" section below), all of the TEACH Grant is considered EFA for all other Title IV programs. Beginning with any unsubsidized loans, you should first reduce a student's level of borrowing. Once a student's loans have been reduced, or if the student has no loans, it may be necessary to reduce the student's TEACH Grant or other aid. If your school fails to follow required procedures, your school must repay any Title IV overpayment. If your school followed the required procedures and the Title IV overpayment is $25 or more, the student must repay the overpayment. When a student has no need-based aid: TEACH Grants are not considered to be need-based aid. However, a student's TEACH Grant, in combination with the student's other estimated non-need-based financial assistance (a component of EFA), may not exceed the student's cost of attendance. If a student is not receiving need-based financial assistance, the EFC is not included in determining whether a student is in an overaward status. If you discover a situation where, for a student who is not receiving any need-based financial assistance, the TEACH Grant in combination with other non-need-based EFA exceeds the student's cost of attendance, the TEACH Grant must be reduced. When a student is receiving need-based aid: For a student who is receiving need-based student aid, the student's EFC plus TEACH Grant, plus other EFA may not exceed the student's cost of attendance. As with Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and nonfederal education loans, TEACH Grants may be used to replace a student's EFC. If the TEACH Grant exceeds a student's EFC, the excess TEACH Grant is considered EFA for other Title IV programs. If a student's EFC plus TEACH Grant, plus EFA exceeds the cost of attendance, you should first apply the TEACH Grant to finance the EFC (remember, any TEACH Grant above the EFC is considered EFA for other Title IV programs). If the EFC, plus any remaining TEACH Grant, plus any other EFA still exceeds the student's cost of attendance, the student is in an overaward status, and you must resolve it (for more detail on how to resolve overawards, see Volume 4, Chapter 3 ). Before reducing a student's need-based aid, you should reevaluate the student's cost of attendance to determine whether the student has increased costs that were not anticipated when the school initially awarded aid to the student. If the student's costs have increased, and if the total aid package does not exceed the revised cost of attendance, you are not required to take further action. If you determine that the student's aid package still exceeds the student's cost of attendance, you must resolve the overpayment (for more detail on how to resolve overawards, see Volume 4, Chapter 3 ).Awarding when programs gain Title IV eligibility in the middle of a term When you have a program that gains Title IV eligibility in the middle of an award year, term, or payment period, for students already enrolled in the program, you may award Title IV aid for all non-loan programs beginning with the payment period in which the programs gain Title IV eligibility, if the student has not completed that payment period, and for loans, retroactive to the beginning of the period of enrollment (usually the academic year) assuming the student, program, and school are Title IV eligible. When a student regains Title IV eligibility after a loan default is resolved, the borrower regains Title IV grant eligibility beginning with the payment period in which the default was resolved and regains Direct Loan eligibility beginning with the period of enrollment in which the default was resolved. NCAA Considerations and recent changes The \"Power Five\" conferences of the NCAA (the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac 10, and SEC) have voted to expand their athletic scholarship to cover an athlete's full cost of attendance. Previously, only the components listed under \"Allowable costs in general\" in Chapter 2 of this volume were included in COA. This change only applies to the colleges in the Power Five, but may also be adopted by other Division I participating schools, at their discretion. One important exception to the full cost COA is the practice of a school's paying the costs of an athlete's insurance against injury to protect against loss of future income. This expense may not be included in COA because it is not related to a student's educational program, but is included as EFA for the student in the aid packaging process. Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 3-148 FSA HB Dec 2018Packaging when choosing not to borrow Direct Loans If a graduate PLUS borrower does not request the maximum Direct Loan amount for which he/she is eligible, you must notify the borrower of his/her maximum Direct Loan eligibility, the loan interest rate for Direct Loans and Direct PLUS, the grace periods and repayment time frame of Direct and Direct PLUS, a nd give the borrower the opportunity to request the maximum Direct Loan at the lowest interest rate for which the borrower is eligible. If the student for whom a parent is borrowing a Direct PLUS Loan chooses not to apply for a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan, the Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan amount that the student would have been eligible to receive is not counted as estimated financial assistance when determining the amount of the Direct PLUS Loan. The same principle applies when a graduate/professional student is eligible for Direct Unsubsidized but chooses to borrow only Direct PLUS. Requirement to consider grants and subsidized loans first 34 CFR 685.200(a)(iii)CONSIDERING GRANTS AND SUBSIDIZED LOANS FIRST The law requires aid administrators to find out whether the student is eligible for certain other Title IV programs that would reduce the need for borrowing. If your school participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program, you must include the student's estimated Pell Grant eligibility as Estimated Financial Assistance when making Campus-Based awards, whether or not the student has received the Pell Grant at the time you make your Campus- Based award. Similarly, you must determine an undergraduate student's Pell Grant eligibility before originating a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan for that student. In addition, a student may not receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan unless the student has received a Direct Subsidized Loan for the maximum amount for which the student is eligible. (The difference between Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans is explained in Chapter 5 of this volume.) However, if the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan would be $200 or less and the amount can be included as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you are not required to originate a separate subsidized loan. For a dependent student, you may originate a Parent PLUS and disburse Parent PLUS funds without determining the student's Pell Grant and Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility. Determining Pell eligibility is not relevant for Graduate PLUS, but (unlike Parent PLUS) your school must determine a graduate/professional student's maximum Direct Unsubsidized eligibility before the student applies for PLUS. FSEOG & PELL GRANT LEU A student who receives a Pell Grant at any time in the award year may be awarded an FSEOG for that award year; the student does not have to receive a Pell Grant in the same payment period as the FSEOG. For example, in the case of a student who receives a Pell Grant for the fall semester only due to reaching his lifetime eligibility used (LEU), the student may be awarded an FSEOG for both the fall semester and subsequent spring semester. Students who have reached or exceeded 600% of their Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant LEU may still be eligible to receive FSEOG, however, they must be considered in the second selection group. You must keep documentation of the eligible EFC that was calculated for the student, and you must confirm Pell Grant eligibility prior to disbursement of the FSEOG. For more details on Pell Grant LEU, see Chapter 3 of this volume.Chapter 7 \u2014 Packaging Glossary DCL HB Dec 2018SUBSTITUTING FOR THE EFC A school may substitute certain types of aid (Title IV aid funds from programs for which eligibility is not based on the EFC) for the student's EFC. Forms of aid that may replace the student's EFC include Direct Unsubsidized Loans, TEACH Grant funds, PLUS Loans, state loans, private education loans, any other non-need-based loans. Note that all annual loan limits still apply (PLUS Loans count towards neither annual nor aggregate limits), and if any of these are used to substitute for EFC, amounts that exceed the EFC are counted as estimated financial assistance. You must package Campus-Based funds and Direct Subsidized Loans before unsubsidized loans; as such, treatment of unsubsidized loans only becomes a factor when awarding Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS Loans. When awarding Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized and Direct PLUS Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts are only counted in estimated financial assistance if they exceed the EFC. RECALCULATION Any time a student begins attendance in at least one course but does not begin attendance in all the courses he or she was scheduled to attend and on which his or her eligibility for Title IV Aid was based, the school must recalculate the student's eligibility for Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, and TEACH, based on a revised enrollment status and cost of attendance. For the Campus-Based programs, the school may need to recalculate the student's eligibility based on a revised cost of attendance. A school may adopt a recalculation policy that is more strict than the regulations require, e.g., a policy that requires recalculation up to a census date or anytime within a term or period of enrollment. If a school adopts a policy of recalculating Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, and TEACH Grants if a student's enrollment status changes within a term or period of enrollment, the policy must be applied consistently to all students. Therefore, if your school chooses to recalculate Pell, Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grants and TEACH Grants for a student whose enrollment status in a program increases (e.g., from half-time to full-time), it must also recalculate for a student whose enrollment status decreases. Once the school has completed recalculating the student's eligibility, Title IV funds in excess of the amount the student is eligible to receive must be returned or reawarded, as applicable, by the school within three days (or, for up to one percent of a school's total amount of funds drawn down in the prior award year, up to seven days, as described in the excess cash requirements in 34 CFR 668.166(b)). Substituting for the 34 CFR 668.52 Recalculation and Direct Loans If a school is recalculating aid for a student who was enrolled in a series of classes or modules and who dropped all future classes before beginning attendance in enough classes to qualify for half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of the loan because the the student never began attendance on at least a half-time basis (34 CFR 685.303(b)(3)(i) and (iv)). However, if the school had already made a disbursement and the student be - gan attendance, no action is necessary. For more detail on recalculating Direct Loans, see Chapter 5 of this volume. Recalculation and Pell Grants Since Pell Grants are always based on the full- time cost of attendance, recalculation means that you are looking at the student's revised enrollment status and using the Pell Payment Schedule appropriate for the student's revised enrollment status. For more detail on recalculating Pell Grants, see Chapter 3 of this volume.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, 2018-19Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 3-150 FSA HB Dec 2018Recalculating Cost of Attendance (COA) When performing a recalculation a school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. In addition, in determining a student's COA a school may not include any costs for a period when the student was not enrolled in and attending any Title IV eligible classes (other than costs for a brief period of time between regularly scheduled terms or semesters). Note that some components of COA are not included if a student is enrolled less than half time (see Chapter 2 of this volume). A school that performs a Return of Title IV Funds calculation on a period of enrollment basis for a student enrolled in a program offered in modules may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with a future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days. COA changes between payment periods A school may have a policy of recalculating awards when the cost of attendance changes from one payment period to the next\u2014for example, because of changes to the student's tuition and fee costs, or because a student's living situation changes (such as when a student moves off campus). Schools also have the option to establish a policy to recalculate financial aid awards when a student's costs change within an award year, as long as the recalculation policy is carried out for all students whose costs change. COA changes within a payment period You may establish a policy of recalculating for cost changes from one payment period to the next, and at the same time, have a policy not to recalculate for cost changes within a payment period. You also have the option to establish a policy to recalculate financial aid awards when a student's costs change within a payment period. For instance, if a student with no dependents moves from a dormitory to off-campus housing at midterm, the school may wish to recalculate the student's award for that payment period. For Pell purposes, such a policy is acceptable if it's carried out for all students whose costs change within the payment period. You may not recalculate the payment for a payment period that took place before the cost change. For instance, in the example, if the student lives in the dormitory during the first quarter and then moves off campus for the second and third quarters, the recalculation would only affect the payments for the second and third quarters.Chapter 7 \u2014 Packaging Aid Glossary DCL HB Dec 2018Basic packaging example Ricki is a dependent student, returning as a sophomore to Dwight College. For academic purposes, Dwight College considers him to be a 2nd-year student. His cost of attendance is $12,500, and his EFC for the current year is 2,500; therefore, the packaging process begins with $10,000 in unmet need. The aid administrator at Dwight College begins by awarding Pell Grants and applying an outside scholarship before awarding Campus-Based aid. Ricki's Estimated Financial Assistance is a $1,600 Pell and an $1,400 outside scholarship. Ricki has sufficient need for the maximum awards that the aid administrator can make under Dwight's policy for Campus-Based funds: $800 employment, totaling $2,600 in non-loan funds. The aid administrator at Dwight College finishes the packaging process by awarding FSA loans available to meet Ricki's need. As a 2nd-year student, Ricki's Direct Subsidized Loan limit is $4,500. Because his remaining need is $4,400, he can receive that amount as a Direct Subsidized Loan. $12,500 Cost - 2,500 EFC $10,000 Need $12,500 Cost - 2,500 EFC - 1,600 Pell Grant - 1,400 Scholarship $ 7,000 Remaining Need $12,500 Cost - 2,500 EFC - 1,600 Pell Grant - 1,400 Scholarship - 800 FSEOG - 1,800 FWS $ 4,400 Remaining Needunmet needCost=$12,5 00 EFC $2,500Pell Cost - 2,500 EFC - 1,600 Pell Grant - 1,400 Scholarship - 800 FSEOG - 1,800 FWS - 4,400 Direct Sub.

Kent has already been awarded a graduate scholarship of $5,000. Kent is a graduate student, so his annual loan limit is $20,500. Due to the passage of the Budget Control Act, as a graduate student, Kent is not eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan. McCausland awards Kent a $20,500 Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Kent now has $5,500 in remaining need. Kent can receive a Direct PLUS Loan for $5,500 to satisfy his remaining need, partially replacing the EFC (minus the scholarship and Direct Unsubsidized Loans, which count as EFA). Cost of Attendance $31,000Scholarship $5,000 EFC $15,500 Grad/Prof HB Dec 2018Allen enrolls in Aims College of Engineering and Animal Husbandry as a 1st-year independent student with an $8,500 cost of attendance, and Aims has received an ISIR for him with an EFC of 2,050. He is eligible for a $2,260 Pell Grant, and Aims also awards him a $1,000 FSEOG. His remaining need is $3,190, so he can receive that amount in a Direct Subsidized Loan (the Direct Subsidized Loan limit for a 1st-year student is $3,500). Since Allen is an independent student, he can take out an additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan to replace the EFC and as \"self-help\" to meet the EFC. Thus, Aims is able to award Allen an additional $2,050 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. Nichelle is a first-year dependent student at Ricketts Community College. Her cost of attendance is $5,800 and her ISIR shows that she has an EFC of 4,200, so her financial need is $1,600. Nichelle's EFC makes her ineligible for a Pell Grant, and Ricketts does not participate in the Campus-Based Programs. The Direct annual loan limit for a first-year dependent student is $3,500. Nichelle qualifies for a $1,600 Direct Subsidized Loan and has no remaining need. Since a Direct Unsubsidized Loan can replace the EFC and Nichelle hasn't reached the annual loan limit, she can borrow an additional $1,900 in the form of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan to cover part of the EFC ($3,500 annual loan limit - $1,600 Direct Subsidized Loan = $1,900 Direct Unsubsidized loan eligibility). Nichelle could borrow a $1,900 Direct Unsubsidized Loan to partially cover the EFC. Her parents could then borrow $2,300 in PLUS to cover the remaining EFC. Alternately, her parents could borrow up to $4,200 in the form of a PLUS Loan. $ 5,800 Cost - 4,200 EFC $ 1,600 Need $ 5,800 Cost - 1,600 Direct Sub - 1,900 Direct Unsub - 2,300 PLUS $ 0 NeedReplaces EFC Using Loan Funds to Replace the EFC: Independent example $ 8,500 Cost - 2,050 EFC $ 6,450 Need $ 8,500 Cost - 2,260 Pell Grant - 1,000 FSEOG - 3,190 Direct Subsidized - 2,050 Direct Unsubsidized $ 0 NeedUnmet Need + EFCUsing Loan Funds to Replace the Sub $4,200Direct Sub $1,600 PLUS = $4,200Cost=$5,8 3 3-154 FSA HB Dec 2018Pell crossover You are no longer required to assign a crossover period to the award year in which the student would receive the greatest Pell award, but are free to assign crossover payment periods to the award year that best meets the needs of your students and maximizes a student's eligibility over the two award years in which the crossover payment period occurs. You may assign the Pell award to a different award year than the rest of the student's Title IV aid. For more detail on calculating Pell awards in crossover, summer, minisession, and transfer situations, see Chapter 3 of this volume. EFCs for periods other than 9 months For information on EFCs for periods other than 9 months, see the Application and Verification Guide, Chapter 3 .Crossover period EFCs and Title IV aid In a crossover payment period, when using Pell from a different award year from other Title IV aid, you must use the same EFC, COA, and need for all programs except Pell. For Pell, you use the EFC, COA, and need for the award year from which the student will be paid, and apply the amount of Pell received against the need when packaging aid from other Title IV programs. Prior year charges and Title IV aid 34 CFR 668.164(d)(2) DCL GEN-09-11 Generally, Title IV aid may only be used for current year charges. Recent regulatory amendments have allowed some limited use of current year funds to pay for prior year charges; see Volume 4 for more detail on the circumstances and limitations of this provision.COUNTING NEED-BASED EARNINGS AS ESTIMATED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE The treatment of earnings from a job sometimes presents a problem\u2014 should the earnings be reported as income in need analysis or should they be counted as a form of student aid in the packaging process? Net earnings from need-based employment are considered to be student aid. \"Need-based employment\" means employment that is awarded by the school itself or by another organization to a student on the basis of financial need to meet educational expenses for the award year. Only income from need-based employment may be considered as student aid. A Federal Work-Study job is clearly a form of need-based student aid. Employment with a state is considered to be student aid if that employment is based on the student's financial need for assistance to pay for educational expenses. Non-need-based earnings are not to be considered as EFA for the current award year because they will be reported as income on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the subsequent award year and will be used in calculating the future EFC. An example of non-need-based employment would be a job a student locates on her own with a private employer such as a local grocery store. Another example would be a job cleaning the labs in the chemistry department on campus, if the chemistry department hired the student using non-need-based criteria and funds. CROSSOVER PERIODS Crossover periods are payment, award, or loan periods that overlap two award years. In general, you may choose which award year EFC to use for a student, with one exception: When awarding FWS to a student not attending classes, the EFC for the next period of enrollment must be used. The following chart summarizes the key flexibilities and options in handling crossover payment periods in the major Title IV programs. Note that for the award year selected, the student must have an official EFC calculated by the CPS, and for a Pell Grant the CPS must also have processed a valid SAR or ISIR. For crossover payment periods, you must use the same EFC, COA, and need for all programs except Pell; for Pell, use the EFC for the award year from which the student will be paid.Chapter 7 \u2014 Packaging Aid HB Dec IV Title IV ProgramApplicable crossover periodChoice of award year EFC?Use same award year EFC for all students in crossover period?Use same award year, EFC, COA, and need to award a student other TIV aid?Use funds from the same award year as EFC?Choice of academic year for annual loan limit regardless of award year EFC used?

You can ask the student to provide the specific program or benefit under which they are receiving their veterans benefits. As in the past, veterans benefits are also not to be counted as income, and therefore are not reported as income on the FAFSA. For a full list of federal veterans education benefits, see Appendix A at the end of this chapter. No AmeriCorps benefits are included in the EFA when determining eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans. Note that this packaging exclusion does not affect any Campus-Based or TEACH Grant awards made to the student, because you may exclude the Direct Subsidized Loan from the EFA, up to the amount of the student's AmeriCorps benefits, for those programs. All AmeriCorps benefits are included as EFA when determining eligibility for Direct Unsubsidized Loans. For example, a 2nd-year student has a COA of $10,000 and is receiving $4,000 in Pell and $3,000 in AmeriCorps benefits. You package her with $1,000 in FSEOG. You may award this student another $3,500 in Direct Subsidized because the EFA for Direct Subsidized would not include the AmeriCorps benefits. Because there is a complementary exclusion Direct Loan that is equal to or less than AmeriCorps, this does not necessitate a recalculation of the Campus-Based awards. Note that the income earned from the Veterans Affairs Student Work- Study Allowance Program (VASWSAP) is not treated as a veterans education benefit, and is not considered estimated financial assistance. It should be reported as untaxed income (not income earned from work) on the FAFSA. Noneducational veterans benefits are not counted as estimated financial assistance. Noneducational veterans benefits include Death Pension and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits, and income from the VASWSAP. The student must report these noneducational benefits as nontaxable income on the FAFSA. Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP or Chapter 1607) A veterans education benefit program referred to as REAP or Chapter 1607 was signed into law on October 28, 2004. It is for reservists who serve on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, under Title 10 U.S.C., for a contingency operation and who serve at least 90 consecutive days or more. National Guard members also are eligible if their active duty is under section 502(f), Title 32 U.S.C., and they serve for 90 consecutive days when authorized by the President or Secretary of Defense for a national emergency and that active duty is supported by federal funds. Disabled members who are injured or have an illness or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty and who are released from active duty before completing 90 consecutive days are also eligible. The U.S. Department of Defense will identify contingency operations that qualify for benefits under Chapter 1607.Veterans benefits no longer EFA IFAP E-Announcement July 2, 2009 IFAP E-Announcement August 13, 2009 HEA 480(c) Federal veterans benefits are excluded from the definition of estimated financial assistance as of July 1, 2009.

Yellow Ribbon Packaging August 13, 2009 Packaging Aid Glossary DCL CFR Acronyms 3-157 FSA HB Dec 2018Vocational rehabilitation funds If you have a student who qualifies for both Title IV funds and for vocational rehabilitation assistance funds, you should determine the student's package exclusive of both the costs related to the student's disability and anticipated vocational rehabilitation assistance. In this way, the student with disabilities will be offered the same aid package as a student who is in the same financial situation but who doesn't have disabilities; the student with disabilities will also receive the maximum amount of vocational rehabilitation aid to which he or she is entitled. If the vocational rehabilitation agency doesn't fully meet the student's disability costs, you may wish to include the unmet disability expenses in the student's cost of attendance, and increase his or her aid award. Although the vocational rehabilitation funds shouldn't be considered estimated financial assistance when you initially package aid for the student, you must coordinate funds available from the vocational rehabilitation agency and from institutional, state, and federal student financial assistance programs to prevent an overaward. The amount of assistance from the vocational rehabilitation agency must be documented in the student's file. Coordination with Bureau of Indian Affairs grants When packaging Campus-Based aid for a student who is or may be eligible for a Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) grant, you must first develop a financial aid package without considering any BIA funds. If the total aid package\u2014after BIA funds are added\u2014does not exceed the student's need, no adjustment may be made to the aid package. If the total package plus the BIA grant does exceed need, you must eliminate the excess in the following sequence: loans, work-study awards, and grants other than Pell Grants. (You may not reduce a Pell Grant or BIA grant.) You may alter this sequence of reductions upon the student's request if you believe it would benefit the student. We encourage you to consult with area officials in charge of BIA postsecondary financial aid when packaging Title IV funds with BIA grants.Bureau of Indian Affairs Grants 34 CFR 673.6 Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP/Chapter 1607) DCL GEN-05-16 As with all veterans benefits, Chapter 1607 benefits are not taxable and will not be used in the EFC calculation. In addition, Chapter 1607 benefits are not considered EFA under the Campus-Based regulations (34 CFR 673.5) nor under the Direct Loan Program regulations (34 CFR 685.102). Vocational rehabilitation packaging Lee has $4,000 in vocational rehabilitation aid for the 2014-15 academic year. At Smith College, Lee has a COA of $5,000. He is eligible for a $5,000 Perkins Loan. Although Smith coordinates funding with the vocational rehabilitation agency to prevent an overaward, the vocational rehabilitation funds themselves are not considered EFA because they cover costs that are not components in Lee's COA, and Lee's vocational rehabilitation costs are also not included in his COA. Lee has $2,000 of disability costs that are not met by his vocational rehabilitation award, so $2,000 may be added to his COA. Smith decides to award Lee a $2,000 Direct Loan to cover his COA. This is not an overaward, since Lee's original $5,000 COA was increased by the $2,000 in unmet disability costs not included in his COA.Vocational rehabilitation agreements with state agencies Some state vocational rehabilitation agencies have established agreements with schools that specify how vocational rehabilitation assistance will be coordinated with other forms of financial aid. Check with your school's vocational rehabilitation coordinator to see if it has such an agreement.Volume 3 \u2014 Calculating Awards & Packaging, reduced if the overaward doesn't exceed $300, which is the overaward threshold for all Campus- Based programs. Note that the $300 threshold is allowed only if an overaward occurs after Campus-Based aid has been packaged and the school was unaware the student would receive additional funds. The threshold does not allow a school to deliberately award Campus-Based aid that, in combination with other resources, exceeds the student's financial need. (see Volume 5 - Overawards, Overpayments, & Withdrawal Calculations .) TREATMENT OF OVERAWARDS If, at any time during the award period , the student receives additional Estimated Financial Assistance that was not considered in calculating the student's eligibility for Campus-Based aid, and if the estimated financial assistance combined with the expected financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need is considered an overaward. The treatment of overawards in the Direct/Direct PLUS programs depends on whether the loans have been fully disbursed\u2014if you discover that there's going to be an overaward before Direct/Direct PLUS funds are disbursed, you must eliminate the overaward through the packaging process by canceling the loan or by making a downward adjustment to a Direct Loan, or by reducing/canceling aid over which you have direct institutional control. If the overaward situation occurs after Direct Loan funds have been disbursed to the borrower, there is no Direct Loan overaward that needs to be addressed; however, you might need to adjust the student's aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds (see sidebar). See Volume 5 of the FSA Handbook for a full discussion of overawards for all programs. There is a $300 overaward tolerance for the Campus-Based Programs. If the student's package is overawarded by $300 or less (as a result of a late outside award, not the school's awarding methodology) and Campus- Based funds are part of the package, you can consider the student to not be overawarded.

We added and corrected text on pages 29 and 30 to clarify that charges for books and supplies must be included in institutional costs if students do not have a real and reasonable opportunity to buy those items from a source other than the school, and, as institutional costs, they must also be prorated if they are assessed for the whole program at its start. On pages 32 and 33 we removed two of the options for apportioning charges for a program whose entire cost is incurred at the beginning. That cost must be divided proportionately according to what fraction of the credit or clock hours in the program occur in a given payment period. We noted in the margin of page 36 why schools on the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 and reimbursement payment methods cannot make interim disbursements (those made before verification is completed). In the middle of page 40, we added a sentence noting that schools have latitude in how they offer students and parents the choice to receive regular (non-post-withdrawal) late disbursements. On pages 40 and 41 we clarified the late disbursement guidance on what schools' obligations are when students withdraw, complete the pay - ment period or period of enrollment, or do not withdraw but cease to be enrolled half time. On page 46 we added a margin note about schools on the Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM) 1 payment method paying credit balances by the normal deadline. On page 48 we added a margin note about schools on the HCM and reimbursement payment methods having a way for students to get books and supplies in the normal time frame. We moved from the body of page 54 to the margin the reference to the Federal Register notice containing the disclosure format for the fees and features associated with T1 and T2 arrangement financial accounts. We combined the boxed sections in Chapter 2 on disclosure require - ments associated with T1 and T2 arrangements since the text was redun - dant, and we moved the result to the body of pages 62 and 63. We also added a list of rules for displaying the relevant information on a school's website. We added a margin note on page 72 mentioning and linking to an electronic announcement that clarifies reporting requirements when there is a Pell Grant overpayment. 4-2 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 We noted in the margin of page 73 that the Pell Grant default limit of 100% of a scheduled award can be exceeded if students qualify for year-round Pell, in which case they can receive up to 150% of a scheduled award. On page 74 we removed the margin note about Iraq and Afghanistan Service grants at more than one school because starting in June 2018 COD will be sending multiple reporting records for that program to indi - cate concurrent enrollment and potential overawards. On page 100 we put a note in the margin referring to our annual electronic announcement that serves as a reminder and summary for financial aid and business offices of the general requirements related to disbursement reporting, excess cash, and reconciliation. We added the paragraph about updating loan disbursement amounts immediately below the bulleted list on page 135. Introduction 4-3 FSA HB September FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Requesting and Managing FSA Funds Except for funds received as an administrative cost allowance (ACA), Federal Student Aid (FSA) funds received by a school are held in trust by the school for students and the Depart - ment. The cash management regulations discussed in this chapter establish rules and proce - dures that a school must follow in requesting and managing FSA program funds. These rules and procedures also apply to third-party servicers. Self-Assessment Tool for fiscal management You can evaluate your school's fiscal management procedures by referring to the \"Fiscal at DCL PURPOSE OF CASH MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS The cash management regulations are intended to promote sound cash management of FSA program funds by schools; minimize the costs to the government of making FSA program funds available to students and schools; and minimize the costs to students who receive FSA loans. Except for funds provided by the Secretary for administrative expenses and funds used for the Job Location and Development Program under 34 CFR part 675, subpart B, funds received by an institution under the Title IV programs are held in trust for the intended beneficiaries. The school, as a trustee of those funds, may not use the funds as collateral or engage in any practice that risks the loss of those funds. Moreover, a school must exercise the level of care and diligence required of a fiduciary in managing Title IV program funds. To ensure adequate cash management practices, a school must have in place a cash management system that adheres to federal regulations and other standards. A school's cash management practices are governed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), standards prescribed by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), U.S. Department of Treasury regulations, and U.S. Department of Education (ED/the Department) regula - tions.Cash management 34 CFR Subpart K Purpose of regulations 34 CFR 668.161 Definition Standard of conduct \u2014The requirement that an institution must exercise the level of care and diligence required of a fiduciary with regard to managing Title IV, HEA program funds. 34 CFR 668.161(c) See 668.82 for other criteria that fall under this requirement.Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Education Central Automated Processing System (EDCAPS) is designed to integrate the Department's financial processes, including financial management, contracts and purchasing, grants administration, and payment management. EDCAPS integrates four formerly separate system modules into a single system. EDCAPS consists of the following: Financial Management Systems Software, Travel Management, Contracts and Purchasing Support System, and Grant Management System (G5). * G5 is the EDCAPS module that directly affects schools' participation in the FSA programs and the only part of EDCAPS to which schools have access. G5 Overview G5 is a delivery system that supports program award and payment administration. It is a component of EDCAPS, ED's integrated financial processing system, managed and administered by the Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). G5 provides financial management support services for the grant life cycle in a single system. It supports the planning, obligating, authorizing, disbursing, and the final closing of Department of Education grant awards. G5 is the central repository for payment transactions of schools that receive funds from the Department. Schools may use G5 to request payments, adjust drawdowns, and return cash. G5 also provides continuous access to current grant and payment information, such as authorized amounts, cumulative drawdowns, current award balances, and payment histories. A school uses G5 to request cash for the Direct Loan Program, Federal Pell Grant Program, Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Program, TEACH Grant Program, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Program.Am I a Grantee or a Payee? A grantee is an entity (not a person) that applies for and receives a grant award from the Department. The grantee is responsible for ensuring the grant is administered according to program regulations. A payee is an entity designated by the grantee to request and manage federal funds on its behalf. The grantee and payee can be the same entity. Access to G5 The G5 website is www.G5.gov . For questions, contact the G5 help desk using one of these options: Phone: 1-888-336-8930 Email: edcaps.user@ed.gov Go to the self-help portal at http://edcaps.force.com / to submit a ticket.Users must register for access to G5, and there is no limit to the number of G5 users an organization may have. Business officers and financial aid administrators are encouraged to use G5 to reconcile FSA funds.What Is a TIN? It is the unique, nine-digit, federal taxpayer identification number given to the grantee organization, which uses the TIN to report activity to the Internal Revenue Service. TIP* G5 controls cash for both FSA and non- DCL What Is a Grant Award Number? The Grant Award Number is a unique, 11-character identifier for each grant award issued by a specific program office to a specific grantee. All funds are requested (and returned) using the Grant Award Number. This is an example of a Grant Award Number and an explanation of its parts: P031B 151234 P Program office issuing the award 031 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numeric suffix of the program B Alphabetic subprogram identifier 15 The trailing year in the academic year for DL and TEACH and the beginning year in the academic year for Pell and all other awards 1234 Unique identifierAccessing G5 Schools request federal cash on the G5 website ( https://www.G5.gov ). Before you can use G5, and as part of applying for Title IV participation, your school must register with the Department. This process includes: 1. obtaining a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, 2. obtaining a grant award number, 3. setting up bank information, 4. registering the DUNS number and TIN with the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM /, and 5. obtaining user ID(s) and password(s). Setting up bank information Funds requested from G5 will be transmitted to the payee's bank account using either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or the Fedwire transmission method. A payee designates its method of transmission when providing its bank account information. ACH For payees using ACH, G5 electronically transfers payments through the U.S. Department of the Treasury into the payee's bank account. To use ACH you must complete a Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form (SF1199A) and mail it with a cover letter and a copy of your program participation agreement to the Department's Office of the Chief Financial Officer at the address on the form. The form is located on the G5 homepage in the frequently asked questions (FAQs). Look under the banking section for the subheading \"Domestic .\" The SF1199A is the first bullet point. You must reenroll in ACH when any of the following occur: 1. you change banks, 2. the payee or its bank changes the account number, 3. the depositor account is closed, or 4. the bank closes\u2014either voluntarily or involuntarily. ACH processing times ACH payment requests made before 3 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) are deposited the next business day. ACH payment requests made after 3 p.m. ET are deposited on the second business day. You can enter payment requests up to 30 days in advance.What Is a DUNS Number? The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is a unique nine-digit identification code that is assigned to a school. G5 grantees and payees must register their DUNS number and TIN with the System for Award Management (SAM). Also, schools must annually confirm registration of their DUNS number(s) on the SAM website and will receive 60-day and 30-day reminder emails to do this. See the electronic announcement of March 14, 2018 . The DUNS number represents your school as a unique financial entity. You must notify the Department if your school merges with or is sold to another organization or separates from an existing organization and becomes a freestanding one. To contact Dun & Bradstreet and get a DUNS number, go to their webpage for phone, email, and web chat options. TIPVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR DCL You should always verify deposits before disbursing cash. When verifying ACH payments, you must tell the bank to check for depos - its made through the Automated Clearing House. There are several kinds of electronic fund transfers. If other terms are used, the bank may search for the wrong payment(s). Fedwire The Fedwire transmission method is an electronic wire transfer of cash directly from G5 through the U.S. Department of Treasury into the payee's bank account. Large payees generally use this payment method. Most banks charge a fee for processing Fedwire payments. Before a payee can receive Fedwire payments, the payee must enroll with the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the Department of Education. If the bank is online with the U.S. Department of Treasury, you must send the Department a letter containing the name and address of the payee's bank; bank's ABA number; contact (name and telephone number at the bank); and depositor's account number at that school, and the bank's tele - graphic abbreviation. If the bank is not online with the U.S. Department of Treasury, send the Department a letter containing the following: name of the payee's bank, and payee's account number at the bank. You must reenroll in Fedwire (by sending the Department a letter) if any of the information listed above changes. Payees may obtain a Fedwire enrollment form letter by contacting the G5 Hotline at 1-888-336-8930 . Fedwire processing time Payees may request Fedwire payments using the G5 Hotline. Payment requests completed by 2 p.m. ET will be deposited in the payee's bank account the same day. Fedwire payment requests made after 2 p.m. ET will be deposited the next business day. You should always verify deposits before disbursing cash. When verifying Fedwire payments, you must tell the bank to check for deposits made through the Fedwire. There are several kinds of elec - tronic fund transfers. If other terms are used, the bank may search for the wrong payment(s). System for Award Management The System for Award Management (SAM) is a free website that consolidates the capabilities in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), Federal Agency Registration (FedReg), and Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). If you had an active record in CCR, you have an active record in SAM. You can search for registered entities in SAM by typing the DUNS number or business name into the search box.Example of Prefixes to Grant Award Numbers P007A FSEOG P033A FWS P063P Pell P268K DL Title IV funds are program and award year specific.

To obtain a user ID, an individual must complete a G5 Production System External User Access Request Form . The form is generated during the online registration process. You can also download the form at https://www.G5.gov . You can register for a user ID and password by following these instructions. 1. The first step in registering after reaching www.G5.gov is to click on the \"Not registered? Sign up\" link. 2. Complete all necessary steps in the external user registration process. 3. Once you have completed registration, you will receive an email to activate the account. Follow the email instructions to finalize the user ID and password registration. If you do not receive an activation email you must contact the G5 Help Desk at 1-888-336-8930. Please note that your G5 user ID will be your email address. There are links if you forgot your email ID or need to reset your password. Using the user ID and password User IDs and passwords are required to gain access to G5 or to request cash through the G5 Hotline. (Note: To enhance G5 security, payees are required to enter or state additional identifiers to gain access to G5.) You will be requested periodically to validate every user ID assigned to your organization. You are responsible for ensuring that this information is correct. Once a grantee receives a grant (or is authorized funding), the designated payees will request cash by Grant Award Number using G5. Alternatively, payees can also call the G5 Hotline between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to request cash. A school may also call the G5 Hotline for help resolving problems with payments. Two-factor authentication The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has mandated that all federal agencies implement increased cybersecurity capabilities to prevent unauthorized access to government systems. The U.S. Department of Education is implementing a more secure means for users of the G5 Grants Administration System to gain access, referred to as two-factor authentication. Schools that use third-party servicers to request and return Title IV funds are ultimately responsible for the process. At a minimum they should request view- only access to G5 so they can review the work of their servicers.TIPVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR DCL Two-factor authentication is a security process in which the user provides two means of identification from separate categories of credentials. One is typically something you know, such as a password, and the other is something you have, such as a security code you download from a mobile device. The combination of these two security elements makes unauthorized access more difficult. Once both factors are validated, users are allowed into the G5 system. Projecting cash needs Immediate need Immediate need is defined as the amount of FSA program funds a school needs to make disbursements within three business days following the date the school receives the funds. This definition of immediate need applies to all FSA program funds (other than Perkins Loan funds), regardless of whether the school draws down funds by electronic funds transfer (EFT) through the ACH or through Fedwire. Drawing down amounts beyond immediate need may result in excess cash, and there are penalties for holding excess cash. Schools should carefully review the excess cash tolerances regulation. (See the discussion of excess cash later in this chapter.) A school on the advance payment method must determine the amount of funds it needs before it transmits a request to G5. So that excess funds do not exist after disbursements are made, f or each FSA program, the amount requested must be limited to the amount needed to make immediate disbursements. The amount should be enough to meet Pell, TEACH, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disburse - ments to students; the federal share of Federal Supplemental Educational Oppor - tunity Grant (FSEOG) disbursements to students and, if it applies, an administrative cost allowance (ACA); the federal share of Federal Work-Study (FWS) payroll dis - bursements and, if it applies, ACA; Direct Loan disbursements. In general, the following equation may be used to calculate projected immediate needs: A school's request for funds should not exceed its immediate need.Excess cash 34 CFR 668.166 Three-day rule for funds received under the advance payment method A school must disburse FSA funds as soon as administratively feasible but no later than three business days following the date the school received those funds. 34 CFR 668.162( b)(3) End of the Perkins Loan Program The Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 ended the authority of schools to make new Perkins loans as of September 30, 2017, and no disbursements on existing loans can be made after June 30, 2018. However, schools may choose to continue servicing their Perkins loans. For more information see DCLs GEN-16-05 and GEN-17-10 and the online FAQs . Anticipated disbursements minus Balance of cash on hand minus Anticipated recoveries minus ACH/EFT cash in transit equals Projected immediate needChapter 1\u2014Requesting FSA Funds FSA school initiates a drawdown from G5, it should consider that processing requests within G5 typically take one to three business days, and consider whether the school is using ACH/EFT or Fedwire. Schools should also be aware of system downtime, federal holidays, and other delays in processing cash requests when determining immediate need. Recording payments Payees should keep records of submitted payment requests. The amount of each request and the corresponding control number(s) need to be carefully documented. These records will serve as an audit trail and help payees reconcile their books to the G5 Activity Report. Delayed, denied, or reduced payment requests Your payment requests may be delayed, denied, or reduced if any of the following occurs: An award included in your payment request is flagged for review and approval. The Department's accounts receivables unit has entered an offset against one or more of the awards. A program office has intervened as a result of a program re - view or audit finding. AWARD PERIODS Before you can request cash, you must understand the award periods for G5 program authorizations. The length of the award periods vary by program and authorizing statute. The award period dictates when the payee can request cash. There are four award periods: 1. Performance period (59 months) 2. Liquidation period (1 month) 3. Suspension period (1 month) 4. Closeout period The discussion that follows explains the differences between the award periods and how they affect a school's ability to draw funds. Also see the discussion in Chapter 4 under Returning Funds Through G5 for Both Open and Closed Awards . Performance period The performance period is the period between the Title IV program award begin date and the Title IV program award end date. During this period, schools can draw down cash. Before drawing down cash, schools must obligate that cash to eligible recipients (such as by submitting to the Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 FSA HB September 20184-12Glossary CFR DCL Department anticipated disbursement records for students eligible for the Federal Pell Grant Program). Once the performance period ends, the closeout process begins. During the performance period payees may request payments; payees may modify payment requests (Note that if a change needs to be made after the payment is out of \"Ready for Scheduling\" status, the school would have to return funds, create an adjust - ment, or create another payment request.); payees may adjust drawdowns (This should only happen when a school has accidentally drawn funds from the wrong award and needs to move the full amount to correct the error.) ; and changes may be made to the Federal Student Aid program's grant awards authorizations. Liquidation period The liquidation period is one month, follows the performance period, and is the first closeout phase. During the liquidation period no new expenditures may be processed against a grant award; payees can draw down funds for obligations incurred during the performance period; and payees may use the period to adjust drawdowns for expendi - tures incurred during the performance period. (This should only happen when a school has accidentally drawn funds from the wrong award and needs to correct the error.) The last date a school can draw down cash from the Department without special permission from the program office is the end of the liquidation period. Suspension period The suspension period is also one month and follows liquidation. Once an FSA program has entered the suspension period, no payment actions can take place without the approval of the program office. The Department program offices use this period to prepare for final closeout. Closeout period The closeout period immediately follows the suspension period. During closeout, the grant award is closed and any remaining cash is deobligated. The closeout process includes the liquidation, suspension, and closeout periods.Chapter 1\u2014Requesting and Managing FSA FundsDRAWING DOWN FSA FUNDS A school's authorization is the amount of FSA funds a school is currently eligible for in the year and the program in question. The authorization is called the Current Funding Level (CFL). Please note that in the Direct Loan and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Programs, you might also hear the authorization referred to as the Cash Control Amount (CCA). A school's available balance is the amount of cash available for a school to draw down through G5. The available balance is the difference between the authorized amount and the school's net drawdowns to date. A separate authorization is maintained for each program by award year. Note that FSA funds are school, award year, and program specific, and should not be used for another school, award year, or program. A school may not request more funds than it needs to make disbursements to eligible students and parents. Therefore, a school must make the disbursements as soon as administratively feasible but no later than three business days following the date the school receives those funds. If G5 accepts a school's request for funds, it will make an EFT of the amount requested to a bank account designated by the school. The methods under which the Department provides Title IV funds to schools The Department provides funds to participating schools through one of three payment methods: the advance, heightened cash monitoring, and reimbursement payment methods. Most schools receive funds under the advance payment method, so we will discuss that first. The heightened cash monitoring and reimbursement payment methods are explained later in this chapter. Advance payment method Under the advance payment method, a school submits a request for funds to the Department that may not exceed the amount of funds the school needs to make immediate disbursements. If the Department accepts that request, it initiates an electronic funds transfer (EFT) of that amount to the depository account designated by the school. The school must disburse the funds requested as soon as administratively feasible but no later than three business days following the date the school receives those funds. FSA HB September 2018 4-13Glossary CFR DCL Three-day disbursement required 34 CFR 668.162(b)(3) The methods under which the Department provides funds 34 CFR 668.162(a) Advance payment method 34 CFR 668.162(b)Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Drawing down funds in the Pell and TEACH Grant Programs There are no initial authorizations in the Pell Grant and TEACH Grant programs. A school's authorization for these programs will be based on the total actual accepted and posted disbursement records accepted by the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System (submitted using the Disbursement Release Indicator or DRI = true). A new electronic statement of account (ESOA) will be sent to a school's Student Aid Internet Gateway ( SAIG) mailbox each time the school's authorization changes. Drawing down funds in the Campus-Based Programs The Department awards Campus-Based funds to a school for an upcoming award year on the basis of the application to participate portion of The Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP). The way in which schools request Campus-Based funds from G5 will vary depending on the funding method under which schools operate. In all cases a school may not request funds in excess of the actual disbursements it has made or will make to students (plus any administrative cost allowance, if applicable). Note: For the Campus-Based Programs, schools do not report individual disbursements in COD. Schools report expenditures on their FISAP expenditure reports (due before October 1). Therefore, a school's allocation of Campus-Based funds is not revised during the year unless the school receives a supplemental allocation (see sidebar). See Volume 6 for more information on applying for and receiving Campus-Based funding. Drawing down funds in the Direct Loan Program Generally, schools on the advance payment method get initial Direct Loan authorizations in late spring or early summer (prior to July 1). Initial authorizations are based on a school's net accepted and posted disbursements from the previous award year. As a school submits actual disbursement records where the DRI = true, the COD System will compare the total net accepted and posted disbursements to the school's current authorization. Each time the school's total net accepted and posted disbursements exceed its authorization, the COD System will automatically increase the authorization to the total net accepted and posted disbursements.Supplemental Campus-Based Allocations Schools must return unused prior year Campus-Based funds and request funds for the upcoming year through the Reallocation-Supplemental award process . Schools deobligate or request additional funds by completing the reallocation form (Department Form E40-4P), due in mid-August. The Department will notify schools of supplemental funding in September.Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Disbursements For the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Program, schools do not submit actual disbursements; the Department will provide an \"exception-based process\" through which schools will be funded when they submit anticipated disbursements (using the DRI = false in COD). FSA HB September 2018 4-14Glossary CFR DCL Schools on the Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM1 and HCM2) and Reimbursement payment methods, foreign schools, and those that request to be \"records first\" do not receive an initial authorization. They receive funding increases based on actual disbursement records that are submitted to and accepted by the COD System.Chapter 1\u2014Requesting and Managing FSA FundsThe Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM) and Reimbursement Payment Methods The Department places a school on an HCM (there are two types) or Reimbursement payment method to closely monitor its cash management. Reasons for this include but are not limited to: lack of financial responsibility; program review or audit findings; student complaints; repeated failures to meet COD reporting requirements; an adverse action against the school by its accreditor or state authorizing agency; an enforcement action against the school (especially if it relates to Title IV) by a consumer protection agency; significant non-compliance with Title IV requirements such as not performing verification, not properly returning funds, or awarding aid for ineligible programs or locations; initiation of a termination action; providing incorrect data to ED officials to cover up violations; suspicion of fraud; and other activity that is or appears to be criminal. Schools operating under these payment methods do not receive an initial authorization. Instead, they receive an authorization and increases to the authorization after the COD System has accepted and posted actual disbursement records. The school must credit a student's ledger account for the amount of Title IV funds the student or parent is eligible to receive and pay the amount of any credit balance due under \u00a7668.164(h), before it submits a request for funds . A school's request may not exceed the amount of the disbursements it has made to the students and parents included in that request. Schools' administration of an HCM or Reimbursement payment method must be audited every year. The independent auditor engaged by the school to conduct its annual compliance audit must express an opinion in the audit report about the school's compliance with the HCM or Reimbursement requirements. The payment methods differ as follows: Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1)\u2014 After a school makes disbursements to eligible students from institutional funds and submits disbursement records to COD, it draws down FSA funds to cover those disbursements in the same way as a school on the advance payment method. Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2)\u2014 A school placed on HCM2 cannot simply draw down funds as an HCM1 school can. After it makes disbursements to students and parents from institutional funds, it must submit a payment request to the Department and include a completed Form 270 (OMB 1845-0089). It must also include a completed data spreadsheet that identifies the students and parents for whom it is seeking reimbursement. This must be in the format specified by the Department, which may tailor the documentation requirements for schools on a case-by-case basis. Finally, the school must include documentation that each student and parent included in the request was eligible to receive and did receive the funds for which reimbursement is sought. When the Department receives the request, it will review for errors the disbursements and the school's documentation for a sample of students and parents. If there are no mistakes, the Department will approve the request. If there are errors, the Department may still approve the request if there are only a few. Otherwise, it will deny the request, though it will reimburse funds for those persons in the sample who were paid correctly. After the payment request is approved, and after recovering any negative or unsubstantiated cash balance that may be owed the Department, the Department electronically transfers the appropriate amount to the bank account in which the school maintains its federal funds. A school may submit only one payment request during any 30-day period. Reimbursement\u2014 The Department places a school on Reimbursement if it determines that the school needs the highest level of monitoring. This generally occurs for the most severe of the reasons listed at the top of the page. The procedure is the same as for HCM2 except the Department reviews the documentation for all the students and parents included in the payment request, not just a sample. If all were paid correctly, the Department approves the request. If there were any errors, the request will be denied for those disbursements which had mistakes, and it will be approved for those disbursements which had no mistakes. 34 CFR 668.162(d) HCM and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 MAINTAINING AND ACCOUNTING FOR FUNDS All schools must maintain a bank account into which the Department transfers, or the school deposits, FSA funds. For a school located in a state, the depository account must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). A school generally is not required to maintain a separate account for each FSA program unless the Department imposes this requirement as a result of a program review or other action. When a school does not maintain a separate account A school has a fiduciary responsibility to segregate federal funds from all other funds and to ensure that federal funds are used only for the benefit of eligible students. Absent a separate bank account, the school must ensure that its accounting records clearly reflect that it segregates FSA funds. Under no circumstances may the school use federal funds for any other purpose, such as paying operating expenses, collateralizing or otherwise securing a loan, or earning interest or generating revenue in a manner that risks the loss of FSA funds or subjects FSA funds to liens or other attachments (such as would be the case with certain overnight investment arrangements or sweeps). Clearly, carrying out these fiduciary duties limits the ways the school can otherwise manage cash in an operating account when that account contains FSA funds. If a school does not maintain a separate account for FSA program funds, its accounting and internal control systems must identify the balance for each FSA program that is included in the school's bank account as readily as if those funds were in a separate account; and identify earnings on FSA program funds in the school's bank account. A school must maintain its financial records in accordance with the record keeping requirements described in Volume 2. SEPARATE DEPOSITORY ACCOUNT The Department may require a school to maintain Title IV funds in a separate depository account that contains no other funds if the Department determines that the school failed to comply with: (1) the cash management regulations, (2) the recordkeeping and reporting requirements, or (3) applicable program regulations. Bank account notification requirements For each account that contains FSA program funds, a school located in a state must identify that FSA funds are maintained in the account byMaintaining and accounting for funds 34 CFR 668.163 Bank account requirements 34 CFR 668.163(a)&(b) Interest-bearing accounts 34 CFR 668.163(c) Timely Return of Funds Schools are required to make a timely return of any unearned funds after a student withdraws, as discussed in Volume 5.Recordkeeping requirements 34 CFR 668.24 Not Applicable to Some Programs The cash management requirements are not applicable to the state grant and scholarship programs. The Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship (Byrd) Program and, if a state is the grantee, the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) are administered under rules established by the state.Depository Accounts of Foreign Schools For a school not located in a state, the depository account may be insured by the FDIC or NCUA, or by an equivalent agency of the government of the country in which the institution is located. If there is no equivalent agency, ED may approve an account designated by the foreign school. FSA HB September 2018 4-16Glossary CFR DCLChapter 1\u2014Requesting and Managing FSA Funds including the phrase federal funds in the name of the account; or notifying the depository institution that the depository account contains Title IV program funds that are held in trust and keeping a copy of this notice in its records and, except for public institutions, filing a Uniform Commercial Code Form (UCC-1) statement with the appropriate state or municipal government entity that discloses that an account contains federal funds. The school must keep a copy of the UCC-1 statement in its records. Interest-bearing account To the extent possible, FSA funds must be maintained in an interest- bearing account unless the school receives less than $120,000 in federal awards per year; or the best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on the school's federal cash balances; or the financial institution holding the funds would require an average or minimum balance so high that maintaining the balance would not be feasible within the expected federal and non-federal cash resources. As provided in 34 CFR 674.8(a), the school keeps any interest earned on Perkins Loan funds. The school may also keep up to $500 per year of the interest or investment revenue earned on other than Perkins funds to pay for the administrative expense of maintaining the account. No later than 30 days after the end of that award year, the school must remit any interest earned in excess of $500. See the margin note. Additional Perkins Loan requirements A school that participates in the Perkins Loan Program must always maintain an interest-bearing account for Perkins Loan funds. The school must maintain sufficient liquidity in its Perkins fund to make all required distributions. If a school is also required to maintain an interest-bearing account for other federal funds, the school may use one account for Perkins Loan funds and all other federal funds. However, if the school chooses to maintain one account, it must determine the amount of any interest earned on the Perkins Loan funds and retain those funds for use in the Perkins Program. The interest earned on the school's Perkins funds is not included in the $500 maximum award year interest the school is permitted to retain.Remitting Interest Schools must remit interest over $500 to the Department of Health and Human Services and include with it an explanation stating that the refund is for excess interest, \"U.S. Department of Education\u2014 Federal Student Aid\" as the name of the awarding agency, and the school's DUNS number in the addendum record or other correspondence. See HHS's instructions , but note they vary somewhat with what is above. For example, the HHS webpage refers to payee account and grant numbers that do not apply here and may be ignored. Schools may remit excess interest electronically by ACH direct deposit or by FedWire; they may also mail a paper check, though the electronic methods are preferred. Note too that the mailing address for paper checks is no longer the Rockville, Maryland address that was included in the regulations. See the electronic announcement of May 19, 2017, for more information.Bank Notification via UCC-1 form The requirement that a school file a UCC-1 statement when an account's name does not include the phrase federal funds was established to reduce the possibility that a school could misrepresent federal funds as its own funds to obtain a loan or secure credit. Because public institutions generally do not seek to obtain credit in the same manner as private institutions, they are exempt from the requirement. Standards for holding federal funds in depository accounts The Department has adopted the OMB guidance for holding federal funds in depository accounts. 2 CFR 200.305(b)(8) Retaining interest Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 A school may deduct from the interest earned any bank or service charges incurred as a result of maintaining the fund assets in an interest- bearing account and deposit only the net earnings. If a collection agency or third-party servicer receives funds directly from Perkins borrowers, it must immediately deposit those funds in a school trust account. The agency or servicer may open and maintain the account, but the funds in it belong to the school. If the funds will be held for more than 45 days, the account must be interest bearing. EXCESS CASH As mentioned earlier, under the advance payment method, a school must disburse funds no later than three business days following the date the school receives them. The Department considers excess cash to be any amount of FSA funds, other than Perkins Loan funds, that a school does not disburse to students or parents by the end of the third business day following the date the school received those funds from the Department; or deposited or transferred to its depository account previously disbursed FSA funds received from the Department, such as those resulting from award adjustments, recoveries, or cancel - lations. Sometimes a school cannot disburse funds in the required three days because of circumstances outside the school's control. For example, a school may not have been able to disburse funds because of a change in a student's enrollment status, a student's failure to attend classes as scheduled, or a change in a student's award as a result of verification. In view of these circumstances, a school may maintain some excess cash for up to seven additional days. Allowable excess cash tolerances A school may retain for up to seven days an additional amount of excess cash that does not exceed 1% of the total amount of funds the school drew down in the prior award year. The school must return immediately to the Department any amount of excess cash over the 1% tolerance and any amount remaining in its account after the seven-day tolerance period. The Department reviews schools to determine where excess cash balances have been improperly maintained. Upon a finding that a school has maintained an excess cash balance in excess of allowable tolerances, a school is required to reimburse the Department for the costs that the government incurred in making those excess funds available to the school. Excess cash 34 CFR 668.166 Perkins bank account requirements 34 CFR and Managing FSA FundsWhen the Department Considers a Check to Have Been Issued Generally, the Department considers a check to be issued when the school mails the check to the student or parent or notifies the student or parent that a check is available for immediate pickup. However, upon finding that a school has maintained excess cash balances, the Department considers the school to have issued a check on the date that check cleared the school's bank account, unless the school demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department that it issued the check to the student shortly after the school wrote that check.Where excess cash balances are disproportionately large or where they represent a continuing problem with the school's ability to responsibly administer the FSA programs, the Department may initiate a proceeding to fine, limit, suspend, or terminate the school's participation in one or more of the FSA programs. For more on fines and other actions against schools, see Volume 2. Consequences for maintaining excess cash Upon a finding that a school maintained excess cash for any amount of time over that allowed, the actions the Department may take include, but are not limited to requiring the school to reimburse the Department for the costs the federal government incurred in providing that excess cash to the institution; and providing funds to the school under the heightened cash moni - toring or reimbursement payment method. Deadlines by which funds must be returned to avoid excess cash penalties For funds electronically transmitted by the Department, the three- day period begins on the day the school receives the funds in the account designated by the school for that purpose. For funds that the school deposits in its federal account\u2014 as part of the school's compliance with the requirement to return funds if a student withdraws before completing a period for which she was paid; that are Pell Grant funds deposited because of adjustments to the student's award and Direct Loan funds deposited because of adjustments or cancellations; and because a student failed to begin attendance\u2014 the three-day period begins on the date the school deposits the funds in its federal account. Note : A school must return aid for a student who withdraws before completing a period for which the student was paid within 45 days of determining the student withdrew. (See Volume 5 .) A school must return or deposit funds for a student who failed to begin attendance no later than 30 days after the date the school becomes aware that the student did not begin and will not begin attendance. See the discussion under When a Student Fails to Begin Attendance in Chapter 3 . FSA HB September 2018 Funds, 2018-2019 ADMINISTRATIVE COST ALLOWANCE (ACA) The ACA is an annual payment calculated by the Department and made available for drawdown in G5 to help offset the cost of administering the FSA programs. The Department reimburses schools participating in the Pell Grant Program $5 per award year for unduplicated recipients at the school who receive a Pell Grant. For the Campus-Based Program, the ACA is taken from the school's federal allocation, and the maximum amount permissible is up to 5% of the sum of the loans advanced in Perkins, the total earned compensation in FWS, and the total awards to recipients in FSEOG. For the Campus-Based Programs, the ACA is not a separate allowance sent to the school. Rather, the school has the option of taking its Campus-Based ACA out of the annual authorizations it receives for the FSEOG and FWS Programs. A school may draw its allowance from both programs, or it may take the total allowance from only one provided there are sufficient funds in that program and the school has disbursed funds to students from that program during the award year. A school must use its ACA to offset its cost of administering the Pell Grant, FWS, and FSEOG programs. Administrative costs may include the expenses incurred in carrying out a school's student consumer information requirements. In addition, a school may use up to 10% of its ACA that is attributable to the school's expenditures under the FWS Program to pay the administrative costs of conducting community service programs. A SCHOOL'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY Except for funds received by a school for administrative expenses and for funds used for the Job Location and Development Program, funds received by a school under the FSA programs are held in trust for the intended student beneficiaries. As a trustee of those funds, a school may not use (or use as collateral) FSA funds for any other purpose. FSA funds are awarded to a student to pay current-year charges. Notwithstanding any authorization obtained by a school from a student or parent, the school must pay any remaining balance from loan funds by the end of the loan period; and other remaining FSA funds by the end of the last payment period in the award year for which they were awarded.Administrative cost allowance 34 CFR 690.10(b) and 34 CFR 673.7 Pell Grant administrative cost allowance funds to which your school is entitled are identified by a unique grant award number P063Q##XXXX, where ## is the last two digits of the first year of the award year. If you receive funds identified by the award number P063Q##XXXX, please note that those are your school's funds. Please do not return the funds to the Department or disburse them to students.TIP For more information about the Pell Grant ACA, see the announcement of March 2, 2018 , on Pell Grant administrative cost allowance payments for the 2017-2018 award year. Paying remaining balances 34 FSA FundsA school that fails to disburse funds by those dates is in violation of the Department's cash management regulations. In addition, a school has a fiduciary responsibility to safeguard FSA funds; ensure FSA funds are used only for the purposes intended; act on the student's behalf to repay a student's FSA education loan debt when the school is unable to pay a credit balance directly to the student; and return to the Department any FSA funds that cannot be used as intended. Accounting and fiscal records As part of meeting its fiduciary responsibilities, a school must maintain accounting and internal control systems that identify the cash balance of the funds of each Title IV , HEA program that are included in the school's depository account(s) as read - ily as if those funds were kept in a separate depository account; identify the earnings on Title IV , HEA program funds in the school's depository account(s); and maintain its fiscal records according to 34 CFR 668.24. GARNISHMENT OF FSA FUNDS IS PROHIBITED No FSA grant, loan, or work assistance (or property traceable to that assistance) is subject to garnishment or attachment except to satisfy a debt owed to the Department. Schools must oppose any garnishment order they receive. FSA funds may only be used for educational purposes. If your school is not the employer in an off-campus employment arrangement, it must have an effective procedure to notify off-campus employers that garnishment of FWS wages for any debt other than a cost of attendance is not permissible. With the permission of the student, a student's FWS wages may be used by the school to pay current year charges and prior-year charges of not more than $200. (See Volume 6 for additional information.) Cash management 34 CFR Subpart K Scope and Institutional responsibility 34 CFR 668.161 Accounting and fiscal records Funds, 2018-2019 ESCHEATING OF FSA FUNDS IS PROHIBITED A school must return to the Department any FSA program funds, except FWS Program funds, that it attempts to disburse directly to a student or parent if the student or parent does not receive the funds or cash the check. (For FWS funds, a school is required to return only the federal portion of the payroll disbursement.) A school must have a process that ensures FSA funds never escheat to a state or revert to the school or any other third party. A failure to have such a process in place would call into question a school's administrative capability, its fiscal responsibility, and its system of internal controls required under the FSA regulations.Time frame for returning unclaimed funds 34 CFR 668.164(l) Example of a Policy to Prevent Escheating Typically, each state establishes the useful life of a check or bank draft used to disburse FSA funds. After the expiration date, the uncashed check cannot be negotiated and the proceeds escheat to an unintended third party (the state or the institution). In State A, a bank check has a useful life of 180 days. To prevent FSA funds from escheating, the business office at School A identifies at the end of each month all outstanding uncashed checks containing FSA funds and voids them prior to the 180th day. It restores the funds to the applicable FSA program and notifies the school's financial aid office so it can report the corresponding student- level disbursement decrease to COD. Undelivered Perkins Funds If a portion of the undelivered credit balance consists of Perkins funds, the school must reimburse its Perkins Loan fund for that amount and report those funds as other income in Part III, Section A of the FISAP .Unpaid FWS Wages If a school cannot locate a student whom it owes FWS funds that she has earned, the federal portion must be returned to the school's FWS account. If the student returns or the school later locates her, it can recover the FWS funds if the account for that year is still open. If the account is closed, the school must pay the student (under the wage laws) with its own funds.Garnishment/attachment prohibited HEA 488A(d) FSA HB September 2018 4-22Glossary CFR DCL In order to prevent the escheating of Title IV funds, the Department encourages schools that disburse Title IV credit balances by EFT to remind students before the end of the award year (or at the time of withdrawal for students who cease attendance before completing the period for which the funds were paid) to examine the balances remaining in any accounts to which Title IV funds were transferred. Glossary explains the rules for crediting Federal Student Aid (FSA) funds to the student's ac - count and making direct disbursements to the student or parent, and it explains early, delayed, and late disbursements. These rules apply to the Pell Grant , Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity ( FSEOG) Grant , and Direct Loan programs. We also note specifically when rules apply to Federal Work-Study (FWS) disbursements. NOTIFICATIONS Notification of disbursement In general, there are two types of notifications a school must provide: (1) a general notification to parent Direct PLUS borrowers and all students receiving FSA funds, and (2) a notice when FSA loan funds or TEACH Grant funds are credited to a student's account. General notification A school must notify a student of the amount of funds the student and his or her parent can expect to receive from each FSA program, including FWS, and how and when those funds will be disbursed. This notification must be sent before the disbursement is made. If the funds include a Direct Loan, the notice must indicate which funds are from subsidized loans and which are from unsubsidized loans. A school must provide the best information that it has regarding the amount of FSA program funds a student can expect to receive. Because the actual loan disbursements received by a student may differ slightly from the amount expected by the school (due to loan fees and rounding differences), you may include the gross amount of the loan disbursement or a close approximation of the net disbursement amount. Loan and TEACH Grant notification Except in the case of loan funds made as part of a post-withdrawal disbursement, when Perkins Loan, Direct Loan or TEACH funds are being credited to a student's ledger account, the school must also notify the borrower in writing (paper or electronically) of the anticipated date and amount of the disbursement; student's or parent's right to cancel all or a portion of a loan, loan disbursement, TEACH Grant, or TEACH Grant disbursement and have the loan proceeds or TEACH Grant proceeds returned to the Department; andThe loan notification requirements for post-withdrawal disbursements are covered in Volume 5.HEA Sec. 420R(d) specifies that Iraq and Afghanistan Service grants shall be awarded in the same manner, and with the same terms and conditions, as Pell Grants. Borrower Notification via email If you are notifying the student of the next disbursement by email or other electronic means, you are encouraged to follow up on any electronic notice for which you receive an \"undeliverable\" message.Notices and Authorizations Notices 34 CFR 668.165(a) Student and parent authorizations 34 CFR 165(b) Privacy of Loan Data Schools are reminded that the details of any loan transaction may be shared only with the borrower. Glossary CFR DCL Volume 4-24 FSA HB September 2018 procedures and deadlines by which the student or parent must notify the school that he or she wishes to cancel the loan, loan disbursement, TEACH Grant, or TEACH Grant disbursement. The timing of a loan or TEACH Grant notification varies depending on whether a school obtains affirmative confirmation from a student that she wants a loan or accepts the grant . Under affirmative confirmation a school obtains written confirmation of the types and amounts of Title IV loans a student wants for the period of enrollment before the school credits the student's account with those loan funds (34 CFR 668.165(a)(6)). The process under which the TEACH Grant program is administered is considered to be an affirmative confirmation process. This notification must be sent if the school obtains affirmative confirmation , no earlier than 30 days before and no later than 30 days after crediting the student's account ; or if the school does NOT obtain affirmative confirmation , no earlier than 30 days before and no later than 7 days after crediting the student's account . If the borrower or TEACH Grant recipient wishes to cancel all or a portion of a loan, loan disbursement, TEACH Grant, or TEACH Grant disbursement, he must inform the school. A school must return the loan or grant, cancel it, or do both, provided that the school receives the loan cancellation request within the following time frames: If the school obtains affirmative confirmation from the student , by the later of the first day of a payment period or 14 days after the date the school notifies the student or parent of her right to cancel all or a part of a loan or grant If the school does not obtain affirmative confirmation from the student , within 30 days of the date the school notifies the student or parent of his right to cancel all or a part of a loan If a school receives a borrower's request for cancellation outside of the period during which the school is required to cancel the loan, grant, or loan or grant disbursement, the school has the option of canceling and returning the loan or grant. In the case of a loan, if a school declines to return a disbursement, the school should direct the borrower to contact the borrower's assigned loan servicer. The school must inform the student or parent in writing of the outcome of any cancellation request. Schools should not return loan funds on a borrower's behalf if more than 120 days have elapsed since the funds were disbursed.Self-assessment tool for fiscal management procedures You can evaluate your school's fiscal management procedures by referring to the \"Fiscal Management Assessment\" at https://ifap.ed.gov/FSAAssessments/ FiscalManagement.html .Acceptable Means of Notification Your school may not use an in-person or telephonic conversation as the sole means of notification of disbursement because these are not adequate and verifiable methods of providing notice. However, a school may use in-person and telephone notices in addition to those provided in CFR should not return Direct Loan funds to ED's federal loan servicers directly. If a borrower asks the school to return Direct Loan funds more than 120 days after the disbursement date, the school should direct the borrower to the appropriate servicer for guidance on how the borrower can return the money. When acting upon a cancellation request, your school must return the funds (if received) and/or cancel the loan or grant as appropriate. A school is not responsible for returning any portion of a loan or grant that was disbursed to a student or parent directly (e.g., as a result of a credit on the student's account ) before the request for cancellation was received. However, you are encouraged to take an active role in advising the borrower to return the funds already received. Direct Loan funds that are returned within 120 days of the disbursement by the school or the borrower, for any reason, are treated as a partial or full cancellation, with the appropriate adjustment of the loan fee and interest. In addition, Direct Loan funds that are returned by a school at any time to comply with a regulatory or statutory requirement are treated as a partial or full cancellation. Direct Loan funds that a borrower returns 120 days or more after disbursement are processed as a payment, and there is no adjustment of the loan fee or interest. For additional information on returning loan funds, see Chapters 3 and 4 in this volume and Volume 5 (for the return of loan funds when a student withdraws). AUTHORIZATIONS You must obtain authorization from a student (or parent borrower) before your school can perform any of the following activities: Use FSA funds to pay for allowable educationally related charges other than tuition, fees, room, and board (if the stu - dent contracts with the school). Credit FWS wages to a student's account to pay any educationally related charges [34 CFR 675.16(b)(1)(i)]. Hold an FSA credit balance (see the discussion later in this chapter). Apply up to $200 of FSA funds to prior-year charges other than for tuition, fees, room, and board [34 CFR 668.164(c)(3)(i)(B) and 675.16(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) ]. Schools should always use G5 to return funds from loans or grants cancelled within the 120-day period.TIP Authorizations 34 CFR 668.165(b) Electronic disclosures & (c)When a student dies See Appendix C of the FSA Handbook, Actions a School Should Take When a Current Student Dies , for information about loan discharge and other issues when a student dies. Bank account definition A Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured account or a National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) account. This account may be a checking, savings, or similar account that underlies a stored-value card or other transaction device.Glossary CFR HB September 2018An authorization must explain what FSA funds are covered by the document, and it must specify the time period covered by the authorization. Unless otherwise specified, a student or parent may authorize a school to carry out the allowable activities for a specific period of time such as an academic year or for the entire period the student is enrolled, including multiple academic years. A school may not require or coerce the student or parent to provide an authorization, and it must clearly explain to the student or parent how to cancel or modify the authorization. The school must also explain how it will go about cancelling the authorization and that a cancellation is not retroactive. A student or parent may cancel or modify an authorization at any time. A cancellation or modification is not retroactive\u2014it takes effect on the date that the school receives it from the student or parent. If a student or parent cancels an authorization to use FSA funds to pay for other allowable charges, the school may use FSA funds to pay only authorized charges incurred by the student before the school received the notice. If a student or parent cancels an authorization to hold excess funds, the funds must be paid directly to the student or parent as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the school receives the notice. (See the discussion under Time frame for paying FSA credit balances later in this chapter.) If a school holds excess student funds, the school must identify the amount of funds the institution holds for each stu - dent or parent in a subsidiary ledger account designed for that purpose; maintain, at all times, cash in its depository account in an amount at least equal to the amount of funds the institution holds on behalf of the student or the parent; and notwithstanding any authorization obtained by the school, pay any remaining balance on loan funds by the end of the loan period, and any remaining other Title IV funds by the end of the last payment period in the award year for which the funds were awarded. A school may include two or more of the items that require authorization in one statement. Each component and term in the authorization must be conspicuous to the reader, and a student (or parent borrower) must be informed that he or she may refuse to authorize any individual item on the statement. Information Security Requirements The Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act requires schools to have an information security program to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against anticipated threats to the security or integrity of such information, and guard against the unauthorized access to or use of such information. For more information related to the GLB Act, see \"FTC standards for safeguarding customer information\" in 2018An authorization must clearly explain how the school will carry out an activity, but it does not need to detail every aspect pertaining to the activity. However, a blanket authorization that only identifies the activities to be performed is not acceptable. For instance, an authorization permitting a school to use an FSA credit balance (discussed later in this chapter) must provide detail that is sufficient to give the student or parent a general idea of what charges the credit balance would be used to pay. A blanket statement that the credit balance would cover any charges is not acceptable. Using electronic processes for notifications and authorizations So long as there are no regulations specifically requiring that a notification or authorization be sent via U.S. mail, a school may provide notices or receive authorizations electronically. You may also use an electronic process to provide required notices and make disclosures by directing students to a secure website that contains the required notifications and disclosures. If you use an electronic process to provide notices, make disclosures, or direct students to a secure website, then you must notify each student individually every year. You may provide the required notice through direct mailing to each individual through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronically directly to an email address. The annual individual notice must identify the information required to be disclosed that year; provide the exact Internet or intranet address where the infor - mation can be found; and state that, upon request, individuals are entitled to a paper copy, and inform students how to request a paper copy. A School Must Obtain a Student's Voluntary Consent to Participate in Electronic Transactions Voluntary consent to participate in electronic transactions is required for all financial information provided or made available to student loan borrowers and for all notices and authorizations to FSA recipients required under 34 CFR 668.165. ( The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or E-Sign Act)Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB 2018Limitations on using power of attorney in disbursing FWS and Perkins funds A school may not obtain a student's power of attorney to authorize FWS disbursements unless the Department has granted prior approval (contact your School Participation Division). Your school must be able to demonstrate that there is no one else (such as a relative, landlord, or member of the clergy) who could act on behalf of the student. Similarly, a school official should not have used a student's power of attorney to endorse any Perkins Loan disbursement check or to sign for any Perkins Loan advance unless the Department has granted prior approval. Approval could be granted only if the student was not available to sign the promissory note and there was no one else (such as a relative, landlord, or member of the clergy) who could act on behalf of the student; the school showed that the funds could not be directly depos - ited or electronically transferred; the power of attorney was not granted to a school official or any other official who had an interest in the loan; and the power of attorney met all legal requirements under the law of the state the school is located in and the school kept the original document granting power of attorney in its files. INSTITUTIONAL CHARGES Institutional versus noninstitutional charges Institutional charges are generally those for tuition and fees, room and board, and other educational expenses that are paid to the school directly. If a fee (like a registration or technology fee) is required for all students in a program, it should be considered an institutional charge. Similarly, if a charge is part of an enrollment agreement or any addendum or if the school routinely debits a student's ledger account for the amount with the tuition and fees, it is an institutional charge. A charge does not have to appear on a student's account to be considered an institutional charge. All charges for tuition, fees, and room and board (if contracted with the school) must be considered institutional charges. A school may include the costs of books and supplies as part of tuition and fees in any of the following three situations: 1. The school demonstrates there is a compelling health or safety reason for it to provide the books and supplies; 2. The school documents on a current basis that the books and supplies, including digital and electronic course materials, Power of attorney Perkins: 34 CFR 2018are not available elsewhere or accessible by students enrolled in that program from sources other than those provided or authorized by the school; or 3. The school has an arrangement with a book publisher or other entity that enables it to make those books or supplies available to students below competitive market rates, provides a way for a student to obtain those books and supplies by the seventh day of a payment period, and offers a way for a student to opt out of how the school provides books and supplies. Books and supplies must be considered part of tuition and fees, and therefore as institutional charges, if a student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase them elsewhere. (See the discussion that follows and the section on demonstrating a real and reasonable opportunity in Chapter 1 of Volume 5. ) Exceptions: When calculating returns under 34 CFR 668.22 a school may exclude from the total amount of institutional charges costs such as the documented cost of unreturnable equipment and of returnable equipment not returned in good condition within 20 days of withdrawal. Note that the documented cost of equipment is what the school spent to buy it, not necessar - ily what students were charged for it. Noninstitutional charges ( not included in a return calculation ) include charges for any required course materials that a school can document a student had a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase elsewhere; charges to a student's account for group health insurance fees if the insurance is required for all students and the coverage remains in effect for the entire period for which the student was charged, despite the student's withdrawal, and charges to a student's account for discretionary, educationally related expenses (e.g., parking or library fines, the cost of athletic or concert tickets, etc.). Apportioning and prorating charges In most cases, the total charges a school assesses the student in a semester, academic year, or other instructional period are for education and services the institution provides within that period of time. However, some schools charge a student up front for the total cost of a multiyear program (for example, the student signs an enrollment agreement and Paying Overtime Charges Is Prohibited A school may not use Title IV funds to pay overtime charges for a student who fails to complete his or her academic program within the normal time frame. Section 472 of the HEA defines cost of attendance as the tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the academic workload required of all students in the same course of study. Overtime charges are in addition to normal tuition and fees. Since they are not charges normally assessed, they may not be included in a student's cost of attendance for Title IV purposes. (See Volume 3 , Chapter 2 for additional information.) Apportioning and prorating charges 34 CFR 668.164(c)(5)Glossary FSA HB September 2018is charged for the total costs of an 1,800-clock-hour program at the beginning of the program). In this case, because the charges assessed up front represent the costs of education and services that will be provided over a two-year period, the institution would, on a program basis, apportion the total charges over the two-year period to determine the amount of charges applicable to each year (each loan period or award year, as appropriate). Institutional charges (in general, tuition and fees) allocated to each year or portion of a year would be based on the education and services the school provides during that period of time, in the same way as they are for schools that charge their students year by year. Charges for books and supplies that are institutional charges would also be prorated. See Disbursements by payment period later in this chapter for an explanation of how to prorate the charges. Three Principles Associated With Institutional Charges Published in a January 7, 1999, policy bulletin, these principles are applicable to determining institutional charges. Principle 1: Most costs charged by the school are institutional charges. The most important principle to keep in mind is that all tuition, fees, room and board, and other educationally related charges a school assesses a student are institutional charges, unless demonstrated otherwise. If you want to exclude specific charges or costs from a calculation, you must document that the charges are not institutional charges. Principle 2: An institutional charge does not need to be assessed to all students. A charge assessed to all students enrolled in a course or program is an institutional charge whether or not it is assessed to all students at the school. Moreover, a charge does not have to be specified in a student's enrollment agreement to be considered an institutional charge. Principle 3: Charges on a student's account are not always school charges; school charges do not always appear on a student's account. With the student's authorization, a school may credit a student's account with Title IV funds to pay for noninstitutional charges. If a student withdraws from the school with debits for noninstitutional charges on his or her account, the school should exclude those charges from the Return calculation. Conversely, there may be institutional charges that do not appear on a student's account. If a school disburses Title IV funds to a student to buy required books, equipment, supplies, or materials and the student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase them from another source, those costs must be classified as institutional charges.Glossary CFR that this procedure for apportioning the costs over the length of the program does not affect how a school maintains or should maintain its accounting records. PAYING INSTITUTIONAL CHARGES Paying pass-through charges The law allows a school to credit a student's account with FSA funds to pay for institutionally provided housing or to pay for charges incurred at a school-owned bookstore. However, it is not necessary that the school actually own the student housing or the bookstore. The school may enter into a contract with a third party to provide institutional housing and/ or bookstore services. A school that has such a contractual agreement for housing and books and supplies is viewed as providing the goods and services itself. As allowed under 34 CFR 668.164(c), with the student's authorization a school may credit his or her account with Title IV, HEA funds to pay for housing and for educationally related goods and services from the bookstore. If a third party operates the bookstore, the school must have a written contract or other legal agreement with it, under which the student is able to charge the goods and services. Other FSA requirements apply to housing and the bookstore. For instance, A school must include the cost of housing as an institutional charge in any return calculation required when an eligible re - cipient ceases to be enrolled prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment. (See Volume 5. ) Bookstore charges must count as institutional charges when performing a return calculation if students did not have a \"real and reasonable opportunity\" to purchase the books and sup - plies from any place other than that bookstore. (See Volume 5. ) The school must include the contracted third-party housing among the locations for which it fulfills the requirements for reporting campus crime and safety information. If the bookstore is on campus or in any off-campus building or property the school owns or controls, the school must include the bookstore among the locations for which it reports campus crime and safety information. See Volume 2 and The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting for more information. The third party that owns the housing or bookstore also must comply with the civil rights and privacy requirements contained in the school's program participation agreement (see Volume 2 ).Charges Incurred at Bookstores 34 CFR 668.164(c) DCL GEN-12-21, November 28, 2012 Students Must Have an Option A school must give a Title IV eligible student the opportunity to opt out of having purchases of books and supplies from any institutionally owned or contracted bookstore charged to the student's account. 34 CFR 668.164(m)(3) HB September 2018Example: Apportioning Charges that Are All Posted During the First Payment Period Katrina Technical Center (KTC) is a nonprofit postsecondary school in Houma, Louisiana, offering a program in storm water abatement. Hanna enters KTC 's abatement program on April 30, 2018. KTC posts the charges for the entire (1,500-hour) program at its beginning. The cost of equipment is incorporated in each student's enrollment agreement, so it is included in the tuition and fees. Program Profile Academic Year/Program 900 hours 30 weeks of instructional time Program 1,500 hours 50 weeks of instructional time Program Start Date April 30, 2018 Program End Date April 12, 2019 Program Cost $13,500 Pell Award Years Included July 1, 2017-June 30, 2018 July 1, 2018-June 30, 2019 Payment Period 1 (450 hours) April 30, 2018, to August 10, 2018 Payment Period 2 (450 hours) August 13, 2018, to November 23, 2018 Payment Period 3 (300 hours) November 26, 2018, to February 1, 2019 Payment Period 4 (300 hours) February 4, 2019, to April 12, 2019 First loan period (900 hours) April 30, 2018, to November 23, 2018 Second loan period (600 hours) November 26, 2018, to April 12, 2019 Hanna's Federal Student Aid Information Hanna is eligible to receive the following Federal Student Aid during her program: 2017-2018 Pell Grant Scheduled Award $4,800 2018-2019 Pell Grant Scheduled Award $4,800 Subsidized Direct Loan for First Loan Period $3,500 Subsidized Direct Loan for Second Loan Period $2,334 When a school charges for an entire program at the start of the course (up front), it must determine the charges in proportion to the number of clock hours in each payment period. So KTC would apportion $4,050 (450 hours/1,500 hours x $13,500) to each of the payment periods in the first loan period and $2,700 (300 hours/1,500 hours x $13,500) to those in the second loan period. Student's Apportioned Charges First Payment Period (450 hours) $ 4,050 Second Payment Period (450 hours) $ 4,050 Third Payment Period (300 hours) $ 2,700 Fourth Payment Period (300 hours) $ 2,700Glossary CFR Apportioning Charges (continued) On April 30, 2018, the school credits Hanna's account with $4,150 : $2,400 in 2017-2018 Pell Grant funds and $1,750 in Direct Loan funds. When these funds are applied against the $4,050 in school charges for the first payment period, it creates an FSA credit balance of $100 ($4,150 - $4,050) that the school electronically transfers to the bank account Hanna previously specified to be used for that purpose. On August 13, 2018, the school credits Hanna's account with $4,150 : $1,750 in Direct Loan funds and $2,400 in Pell funds, which this time are from the 2018-2019 scheduled award. This again creates a credit balance of $100 ($4,150 disbursement $4,050 school charges) that the school transfers to her specified bank account. On November 26, 2018, the school credits Hanna's account with $2,767 (the third payment period is only 300 hours versus 450 in the first and second periods) in FSA funds: $1,600 in 2018-2019 Pell funds and $1,167 in Direct Loan funds. Applied against the $2,700 in school charges for the third payment period, the funds create a credit balance of $67 ($2,767 $2,700) that the school transfers to her bank account. Hanna begins the fourth and final payment period on February 4, 2019, and, as in the third payment period, the aid officer credits her account with $2,767: $1,167 in Direct Loan funds and $1,600 in Pell. This again yields a credit balance of $67 that the school transfers to Hanna's account. Notice that Hanna has now received $5,600 in Pell funds for 2018-2019, which is more than her scheduled award of $4,800. This is okay because Hanna, who is enrolled more than half time, is eligible to receive an additional (year- round) Pell Grant award of up to 50% of her scheduled award (see Volume 3 , Chapter 3 ). The additional $800 in Pell money amounts to 1/6 or 16.7% of her scheduled award ($800 \u00f7 $4,800) and counts toward her Lifetime Eligibility Used. Hanna graduates from KTC and starts to work for the Army Corps of Engineers to help ensure that the levees in New Orleans never fail again. 34 CFR 668.164(c)(5)(ii)Glossary CFR DCL 2018Paying prior-year charges In general, FSA funds may only be used to pay for the student's costs for the period for which the funds are provided. However, a school may use current-year funds to satisfy prior award year charges of not more than $200 for tuition, fees, and room and board provided by the school with - out obtaining the student's or parent's authorization; and educationally related goods and services provided by the school if it obtains the student's or parent's authorization under \u00a7668.165(b). A \"prior year\" is any award year or loan period prior to the current one, as applicable. See the margin note. The costs of education and other services a school provides a student are associated with the year for which the education and services are provided. \"Year\" is defined as follows: For a student or parent who receives only a Direct Loan, the current year is the current loan period. For a student who does not receive a Direct Loan, the current year is the current award year. For a student or parent who receives a Direct Loan AND funds from any other Title IV program, the current year is either the current loan period or the current award year. FSA funds may not be used to repay a student's loan. Loan payments are not part of the cost of attendance for the period of enrollment. Disbursements by payment period Except for paying a student her work-study earnings, or unless one or more payment periods have elapsed before a school makes a disbursement, a school must disburse during the current payment period the amount of FSA funds that the student or her parent is eligible to receive for that payment period. That is, a disbursement must be in direct relation to the actual cost incurred by the student for that payment period. For a program with substantially equal payment periods, a school apportions the charges associated with a current payment period by dividing the total institutional charges for the program by the number of payment periods in the program.A school may not reduce or eliminate a student's eligibility for a Title IV credit balance by front-loading or apportioning institutional charges that the school cannot document are attributable to that payment period.Prior Y ear If the student's aid package does not include a Direct Loan, prior year means any award year that ended prior to the start of the current award year. If the student's aid package includes a Direct Loan, prior year means any loan period that ended prior to the start of the current loan period.Prior-year charges 34 CFR 668.164(c)(3) & (4) Authorizations for paying prior-year charges 34 CFR 668.165(b) Disbursements to Students on Leave of Absence A school may disburse Pell, TEACH Grant, Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant, or FSEOG funds to a student on a leave of absence. However, a school must not disburse Direct Loan funds to a student on a leave of absence. Because FSA credit balance funds are funds that have already been disbursed, a school must pay an FSA credit balance to a student on a leave of CFR 2018For a program that does not have substantially equal payment periods, a school apportions charges by dividing the number of credit or clock hours in the current payment period by the total number of credit or clock hours in the program and multiplying that result by the total institutional charges for the program. A school may make a prior-year, late, or retroactive disbursement during the current payment period as long as the student was enrolled and eligible during the payment period covered by that disbursement. For more information about disbursing funds by payment periods, see Volume 3, Chapter 1 . CHECKING ELIGIBILITY AT THE TIME OF DISBURSEMENT Before you awarded funds to a student, you confirmed that she was an eligible student and was making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1 ). Also, before disbursing FSA funds, you must determine and document that she remains eligible to receive the type and amount of FSA funds that you expect to disburse. You and your third-party servicer must have a process (consistent with the regulations) for determining student eligibility at the time of disbursement. See the discussion under When a School Uses Third-Party Servicers to Disburse FSA Funds by EFT and Tier One and Tier Two Arrangements later in this chapter for additional information about working with third-party servicers. The things you must confirm include the following: for Direct Loans, the student is enrolled at least half time and has a valid, linked MPN ; for a student otherwise eligible for a Pell Grant, the scheduled disbursement will not cause the student to exceed her lifetime eligibility (see Volume 3 ); a student enrolled in a non-term program or nonstandard term program with terms that are not substantially equal in length has completed the previous period (credits and weeks of instruction or clock-hours and weeks of instruction); first-time FSA borrowers have completed entrance counseling, received the required disclosures, and completed the first 30 days of their academic program (see Volume 3 ); for TEACH Grant awards, the student has a) completed the relevant initial or subsequent counseling; b) signed an Agreement to Serve ; and c) earned the appropriate GPA, otherwise met the performance standard through testing, or is a retiree or a current or former teacher (see Volume 1 ). If a Borrower Dies Before Loan Funds Are Disbursed The Department does not permit disbursement of Title IV loan funds when there is no possibility of repayment. Therefore, if a student borrower or parent PLUS loan borrower dies after the school has received the loan funds but before the loan is disbursed, the school must return the entire disbursement to the Department. See Appendix C of the FSA Handbook: Actions a School Should Take When a Current Student Dies . Third-party servicer responsibility to check eligibility before 668.25(c)(4) 34 CFR 668.164(b)(3) A third-party servicer is bound by the same provisions that apply to a school. The servicer must carry out its contracted activities in a manner keeping with a fiduciary under the Title IV, HEA programs. Interim disbursements to students selected for verification A school can make an interim disbursement of certain types of FSA funds to a student who is selected for verification (including a student selected for verification by the school rather than the CPS). If the school has any conflicting documentation or other reason to believe that it does not have a valid output document, it may not make such a disbursement. See Chapter 4 of the Application and Verification Guide .Glossary CFR DCL Volume FSA HB September 2018The most common change that would make a student ineligible for a Direct Loan disbursement is if the student has dropped below half-time enrollment, so it is important that the financial aid office have a system to verify the student's enrollment status at the time of disbursement. If the student has only temporarily dropped below half-time enrollment, you may still make a Direct Loan disbursement after the student resumes at least half-time enrollment. Conditions under which a third-party servicer is responsible for confirming a student's eligibility A third-party servicer is responsible for confirming a student's eligibility if the school engages the servicer to perform activities or transactions that lead to or support a disbursement of Title IV funds. Examples of activities and transactions are: processing financial aid applications; performing need analysis; verifying students have begun attendance in the classes on which their Title IV aid was based; verifying that students are making satisfactory academic progress (SAP); performing verification; determining the type and amount of Title IV funds that stu - dents are eligible to receive; creating origination, disbursement, or other records in COD; requesting funds under the advance, reimbursement, or height - ened cash monitoring (HCM) payment methods; or accounting for funds that are originated, requested, or disbursed in reports or data submissions to the Department. TIME FRAMES FOR PAYING FSA FUNDS Prompt disbursement (three-day) rules In general, schools that are not receiving federal cash from the Department through one of the heightened cash monitoring payment methods must make disbursements as soon as administratively feasible but no later than three business days after receiving funds from the Department. The disbursements may be credited to the student's account or made directly to the student or parent, as discussed earlier. In order to comply with the excess cash regulations (described in Chapter 1 ), when requesting funds with which to make FSA disbursements, schools must ensure they do not draw down more cash than they can disburse over the next three days.TEACH Grant Counseling Students must complete TEACH Grant initial counseling prior to receiving the first disbursement of their first TEACH Grant. See Volume 3 .Importance of Timely Review of Pell Lifetime Eligibility Used Electronic Announcement, August 13, 2012Disbursement of funds received under advance payment 34 CFR 668.162(b)(3) Schools that can't make interim disbursements Because schools on the HCM2 and reimbursement payment methods must, as part of their request for Title IV funds from the Department, submit documentation showing that students were eligible to receive the funds disbursed to them, and because final determination of student eligibility includes completing verification, HCM2 and reimbursement schools are not able to make interim CFR these time frames for disbursing to the student's account (or directly to the student or parent) are different than those for paying FSA credit balances to the student or parent. As we discuss later in this chapter, a school generally has 14 days to pay an FSA credit balance to the student or parent, unless it has written permission to hold the credit balance. Submitting disbursement records A school must submit Federal Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan disbursement records no later than 15 days after making a disbursement or becoming aware of the need to adjust a student's disbursement. A school's failure to submit disbursement records within the required time frame may result in an audit or program review finding. In addition, the Department may impose a fine or other penalty. EARLY DISBURSEMENTS The earliest a school may disburse Title IV funds to an eligible student or parent is if the student is enrolled in a credit-hour program offered in terms that are substantially equal in length , 10 days before the first day of classes of a payment period; or if the student is enrolled in a clock-hour program, a non-term credit-hour program, or a credit-hour program offered in terms that are not substantially equal in length, the later of a) 10 days before the first day of classes of a payment period or b) the date the student completed the previous payment period for which he received Title IV funds. A school may not make an early disbursement of a Direct Loan to a first-year, first-time borrower who is subject to the 30-day delayed disbursement requirements in 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5). A school may not compensate a student employed under the FWS program until the student earns that compensation by performing work, as provided in 34 CFR 675.16(a)(5). Reporting Disbursements Within 15 Days Schools must submit Direct Loan and Pell, TEACH, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disbursement records no later than 15 days after making the disbursement or becoming aware of the need to adjust a previously reported disbursement. The Department considers that Title IV funds are disbursed on the date that schools (a) credit those funds in their general ledger or any subledger to a student's account or (b) pay those funds to a student directly. Title IV aid is disbursed even if schools use their own funds in advance of receiving program funds from the Department. Failure to submit disbursement records within the required time frame may result in rejection of all or part of the reported disbursement and in an audit or program review finding. The Department may also impose a fine or other penalty. Federal Register Volume 82, Number 122, June 27, 2017 Exception to the 30-day delay The 30-day restriction does not apply if the school is exempt from the 30-day delayed disbursement requirements under 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5)(i)(A) or HB September 2018(These rules apply to the FWS program as well. ) It is important to define the date of disbursement because several regulatory requirements are based on that date. For instance, you must disburse an FSA credit balance to a student no later than 14 days after the date it was created or no later than 14 days after the first day of class, and you must notify a student of a loan disbursement within a time frame related to the date of that disbursement. The date of disbursement also determines when the student becomes an FSA recipient and has the rights and responsibilities of an FSA recipient. For example, when FSA loan funds are disbursed to a recipient, the student or parent assumes responsibility for the loan and has the right to cancel the loan. A disbursement occurs when your school credits a student's account or pays a student or parent directly with FSA funds received from the Department; or School funds labeled as FSA funds in advance of receiving actual FSA funds (except as noted below).1 When using school funds in place of FSA funds, there are two situations where the FSA disbursement is considered to have taken place on the earliest day that the student could have received FSA funds rather than the actual disbursement date. If a school credits a student's account with its own funds earlier than 10 days before the first day of classes of a payment period, that credit is not considered an FSA disbursement until the 10th day before the first day of classes (the earliest a school may disburse FSA funds). If a student borrower is subject to the 30-day disbursement delay and a school credits the student's account with its own funds before the 30 days have elapsed, this is not counted as an FSA loan disbursement until the 30th day after the beginning of the payment period (the 31st day of classes ). 1 If your school simply makes a memo entry for billing purposes or credits a student's account and does not identify it as an FSA credit (for example, an estimated Federal Pell Grant), it is not a disbursement. For example, some schools prepare billing statements or invoices showing the estimated amount of FSA funds that students are eligible to receive. These estimated amounts are not FSA disbursements. Defining the Date of Disbursement 2018RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS If a school did not make a disbursement to an enrolled student for a payment period the student completed (for example, because of an administrative delay or because the student's ISIR was not available until a subsequent payment period), the school may pay the student for all prior payment periods in the current award year or loan period for which the student was eligible. A retroactive Pell Grant payment must be calculated based on the student's enrollment status according to work already completed, as required by 34 CFR 690.76(b). LATE DISBURSEMENTS Generally, an otherwise eligible student or parent becomes ineligible to receive FSA funds on the date that for the Direct Loan program, the student is no longer enrolled at the school as at least a half-time student for the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended, or for the FSA grant and Perkins Loan programs, the student is no longer enrolled at the school for the award year. However, if certain conditions are met, students must be considered for a disbursement after the date they became ineligible. These disbursements are called \"late disbursements.\" Conditions for a late disbursement A student must be considered for a late disbursement (and the parent for a parent PLUS Loan disbursement) if the Department processed a SAR/ISIR with an official EFC before the student became ineligible. Therefore, a school must review its records to see if a student who did not receive a disbursement of FSA funds before becoming ineligible is eligible for a late disbursement. (Check the processed date as described in the sidebar on the next page.) In addition, for a Direct Loan or an award under the TEACH Grant Program, the school must have originated the loan or award prior to the date the student became ineligible (see sidebar). For an FSEOG or a Federal Perkins Loan, the school must have made the award to the student prior to the date the student became ineligible. If a school receives a valid SAR/ISIR for a student who is no longer enrolled, before performing a return calculation, the school must recalculate the FSA grant eligibility based on the student's enrollment status on the date the student ceased to be enrolled. Retroactive payments 34 CFR 668.164(k) Late disbursements 34 CFR 668.164(j) Pell and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disbursements If a school receives a valid SAR or ISIR within the applicable deadlines, it must disburse the student's Pell or Iraq & Afghanistan Service Grant. 34 CFR 690.61(a) Date of Origination The regulations define the date of loan origination as \"the date a school creates the electronic loan origination record.\" If the school created an electronic loan origination record in its system before the date the student became ineligible, and the school can document the creation of that record, the school satisfies the date of origination component required for making a late disburs ement (assuming that all other late disbursement requirements are met). 34 CFR 685.301(a)(6). TIPGlossary CFR FSA HB September 2018Limitations on making a late disbursement The regulations prohibit a school from making a late disbursement in certain situations, even if a student otherwise meets the conditions for a late disbursement. A school is prohibited from making a late second or subsequent disbursement of Direct Loan funds unless the student has graduated or successfully completed the loan period; a late disbursement of Direct Loan funds to a first-year, first- time borrower who withdraws before the 30th day of the stu - dent's program of study, unless the school meets the require - ments for a waiver based on low default rates (see Volume 2 ); and a late disbursement of Title IV funds to a student for whom the school did not have a valid SAR/ISIR by the deadline estab - lished by the Department. In addition, a school may not make a late disbursement later than 180 days after the date the student becomes ineligible. Late disbursements that must be made vs. late disbursements that may be made If a student who qualifies for a late disbursement completes or withdraws during the payment period or period of enrollment, a school must make or offer, as appropriate, a late disbursement. If the student completed the payment period or period of enrollment, the school must provide her or her parent the choice to receive the amount of Title IV funds that she or her parent was eligible to receive while she was enrolled. Unlike with post-withdrawal disbursements below, there are no specific requirements for how schools offer this choice. When making a late disbursement in this circumstance, the school may credit the student's account for allowed charges but must pay or offer any remaining amount to the student or parent. A late disbursement for a student who has withdrawn during the payment period or period of enrollment is called a post-withdrawal disbursement. The school must make any post-withdrawal disbursement required by the provisions of 34 CFR 668.22. See the margin note. If a student did not withdraw or fail to complete the payment period or period of enrollment but ceased to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, the school may make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan. So long as the school previously confirmed that the student began attendance for the loan period and was enrolled at least half time, it is not required to reconfirm his attendance before making a late disbursement of the loan. A student who withdraws and subsequently signs a promissory note in time for the school to include the loan funds in the return of Processed Date For purposes of determining eligibility for a late disbursement, use the processing date on the SAR/ISIR. For an ISIR, use the field labeled Processed Date . For a SAR, use the date above the EFC on the first page. For a SAR Acknowledgment, use the date labeled \"transaction process date\" in the school use box. Obtaining SAR/ISIR With Earlier Process Date Sometimes a school may have a SAR/ ISIR with an official EFC processed while the student was enrolled but before the student listed the school on the FAFSA or ISIR. Subsequently, the school may have received a SAR/ISIR for the student with a processed date after the student ceased to be eligible. In this case you need to obtain a copy of the earlier SAR/ ISIR to document eligibility for the late disbursement. Post-withdrawal disbursement This is a type of late disbursement that occurs after a student withdrew and that the student has earned based on a return of Title IV funds calculation. The conditions and limitations for a post-withdrawal disbursement are the same as for all other late disbursements though there are additional requirements. See Volume 5 for the rules about offering and paying a post- withdrawal disbursement. 34 CFR 668.22(a)(5) Late Disbursements May Be Declined Though a school must, in some cases, offer a late disbursement, a student or parent is never required to accept it. For example, a student may decline a late disbursement of a loan to avoid taking on debt.Late Disbursement Limitations 34 IV aid calculation may receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of the applicable amount of her loan funds (see Volume 5 for more information). In addition, a student who loses eligibility for a reason other than her withdrawal and subsequently signs a promissory note may receive a late disbursement of the applicable amount of her loan funds. Paying a late disbursement A school may credit a student's account with a late disbursement of FSA funds without the student's permission for current allowable charges; prior-year charges of not more than $200 for tuition, fees, and room and board provided by the school; and prior-year charges of not more than $200 for educationally re - lated goods and services provided by the school if it obtained the student's or parent's authorization under \u00a7668.165(b) before the student lost eligibility . If funds remain from a late disbursement after the outstanding charges on the student's account have been satisfied, the school must pay the funds directly to the student within 14 days . As already noted, if a student with an FSA credit balance withdraws before the funds are disbursed, other limitations apply. See Volume 5 for an explanation of post-withdrawal disbursements. If a school chooses to make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan to a student who ceases to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, the school determines the amount of the late disbursement of the Direct Loan it will offer the student by determining the educational costs the student incurred for the period of instruction during which the student was enrolled at least half time. DISBURSING FWS WAGES Your school may use any type of payroll period it chooses, provided students are paid at least monthly. It is a good idea to have the FWS payroll correspond to other similar payrolls at the school. Unless you are paying the student with noncash contributions (see sidebar), you must pay the nonfederal share to the student at the same time you pay the federal share. FWS wages are earned when the student performs the work. A school may pay the student after the last day of attendance for FWS wages earned while he or she was still in school. However, when a student has withdrawn from school and is not planning to return, FWS funds may not be used to pay for work performed after the student withdrew. A correspondence student must submit the first completed lesson before receiving a disbursement under the FWS Program.Flexibility in Contacting Students To avoid having to contact students multiple times, a school may use one contact to counsel borrowers about their loan repayment obligations; obtain permission to credit loan funds to students' accounts to cover unpaid institutional charges; obtain permission to make a late dis - bursement of grant or loan funds for other than institutional charges; obtain permission to make a late disbursement of grant or loan funds directly to students; and confirm that students wish the school to receive, as a direct disbursement, any grant or loan funds the students are due as a late disbursement. Students' response to an offer of a late disbursement does not have to be in writing, but the school must document it. Extended Direct Loan Processing Direct Loan processing for an award year generally remains open in COD for 13 months following the end of the award year (until July 31 of the year following the end of the award year). A school should be able to submit data via batch or web processing through that time unless it has already confirmed closeout for the impacted award year. If a school finds the year is closed in COD before the 13 months are up, it should contact COD School Relations for help in re-opening the award year. Once the 13-month period is over and COD has closed the year, a school may request extended processing through https://cod.ed.gov . Toward the end of each award year the Department publishes an announcement with the closeout deadline and instructions on requesting extended processing.Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB September 20181 Within this chart, the rules for a Pell Grant also apply to Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. 2 A school may not originate a Direct Loan for a loan period in which the student is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis, even if the student is otherwise still enrolled at the school. 3 For all programs, the late disbursement is made no later than 180 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew, or, for a student who did not withdraw, 180 days after the student became ineligible.A loan record is originated.2Student is awarded a grant. For all programs, the Department processed a SAR/ISIR with an official EFC.Conditions and Limitations on Late Disbursements For students to receive a late disbursement, these conditions must be met before they lose eligibility [34 CFR 668.164(j)(2)] These additional limitations must be satisfied before a school may make a late disbursement [34 CFR 668.164(j)(4)]3 Program For all Title IV programs, the school received a valid SAR/ISIR by the date established by the Department in the annual deadline date notice. For Direct Loans: 1. Students who are first-time, first-year borrowers completed 30 days of the program (subject to waivers discussed in Volume 3 ). 2. For a second disbursement, students graduated or completed the period for which the loan was intended.Pell Grant 1 FSEOG Direct LoansNo additional requirements TEACH Grants The grant 2018For audit and program review purposes, your school must have documentation (e.g., canceled checks, bank statements) showing that students received disbursements in the amount charged to the FWS Program. Crossover payment periods When a payment period is in two award years (that is, when it begins before July 1 and ends on or after July 1), the student is paid for compensation earned through June 30 with funds allocated for the first award year and for compensation earned beginning July 1 with funds allocated for the following award year. (See Volume 6 for a discussion of carrying back funds for summer employment.) Disbursing to students from the correct award year is important; schools have been held liable when students were paid from the wrong FWS authorization. Holding FWS funds on behalf of the student With written authorization from a student, a school may hold, on behalf of the student, FWS funds that would otherwise be paid directly to the student (unless this is prohibited by the terms of a reimbursement payment method). The restrictions for such an authorization are the same as those that apply to written authorizations for disbursements to student accounts. If your school holds FWS funds on behalf of students, it must: identify the amount of FWS funds held for each student in a designated subsidiary ledger account; maintain cash in its bank account that is always at a minimum equal to the FWS funds being held for students; and disburse any remaining balance by the end of the school's final FWS payroll period for the award period. METHOD OF DISBURSEMENT There are two ways to disburse FSA funds: by crediting the student's account for allowable charges at your school or by paying the student or parent directly. Credit to the student's account When a school disburses FSA funds to a student by crediting a student's account, it may do so only for allowable charges associated with the current payment period (except for the allowances for prior year, late, or retroactive disbursements discussed elsewhere in this chapter). Allowable charges include the following: current charges incurred by the student at the school for tuition and fees as defined in Volume 3, and room and board Extended Processing and Late Disbursements of Pell and Direct Loans for a Closed Y ear Extended processing or post-deadline processing allows a school to make needed adjustments that may be identified after the closeout or processing deadline. A school may request an extension to the data submission deadline for Direct Loans or grants via the post deadline/extended processing request page in COD. Note: Schools do not need to request post deadline processing for Pell Grants if they are processing only downward disbursement adjustments. Authorized school users must log on to the website, select the \"School\" menu and then select \"Request Post Deadline/ Extended Processing\" on the left side. Us - ers then select the correct award year and program for the request; choose the general reason why extended processing is being request - ed from the reason code dropdown menu; provide an explanation for the re - quest; and select \"Submit.\" In the information a school provides to the students when the school informs them that they are due a late disburse - ment, the school may include informa - tion about the advantages of keeping loan debt to a minimum.Glossary CFR DCL Volume FSA HB September 2018if the student contracts with the school (third-party or pass- through charges are not included except in the case of third- party housing, books, and supplies contracted by the school); the prorated amount of those charges if the institution debits the student's ledger account for more than the charges associ - ated with the payment period; books, supplies, and other educationally related goods and services provided by the institution if you obtain the student's or parent's (as applicable) written authorization; and prior-year charges not exceeding $200 (see the discussion under Paying prior-year charges earlier in this chapter). Direct disbursement to the student or parent You may also disburse FSA funds directly to the student or parent. Most schools choose to first credit FSA funds to the student's account at the school and then disburse the credit balance to the student or parent. A school makes a direct payment for the amount of the Title IV program funds a student is eligible to receive (including Direct PLUS Loan funds that the student's parent authorized the student to receive) by initiating an EFT of that amount to the student's financial account, including transferring funds to stored-value cards and debit cards (see the discussion under Paying FSA Credit Balances later in this chapter); issuing a check or other instrument payable to and requiring the endorsement or certification of the student; dispensing cash for which the school obtains a receipt signed by the student. A school makes a direct payment to a parent, for the amount of the Direct PLUS Loan funds that a parent does not authorize the student to receive, by initiating an EFT of that amount to the parent's financial account; issuing a check for that amount payable to and requiring the endorsement of the parent; or dispensing cash for which the school obtains a receipt signed by the parent.FWS payments to students 34 CFR 675.16 Crediting student's account 34 CFR 675.16(b) Noncash contribution Your school has the option of paying its share of a student's FWS wages in the form of a noncash contribution of services or equipment\u2014for example, tuition and fees, room and board, and books and supplies. However, you may not count forgiveness of a charge such as an FWS student's parking fine or library fine as part of the noncash contribution to the student. Noncash payments (tuition, fees, services, or equipment) must be made before the student's final payroll period of the award period. If your school pays its share for a future academic period in the form of prepaid tuition, fees, services, or equipment, you must give the student\u2014again, before the end of her final payroll period\u2014a statement of the amount of the noncash contribution earned. Crediting Direct Loan funds to current charges first Direct Loan funds credited to a student's account must pay for current charges first.Self-assessment tool for disbursement procedures You can evaluate your school's disbursement procedures by referring to the \"Fiscal Management Assessment\" at https://ifap.ed.gov/FSAAssessments/ FiscalManagement.html . Direct 34 CFR 690.78(c) Cost of attendance: HEA Section 472 Tuition and fees Section 472 of the HEA 34 CFR 2018When the Department considers a check to have been issued The Department considers that a school has issued a check on the date the school mails the check to the student or parent; or notifies the student or parent that the check is available for im - mediate pick-up at a specified location at the institution. FSA CREDIT BALANCES A Title IV credit balance occurs whenever the amount of Title IV funds credited to a student's account for a payment period exceeds the amount assessed the student for allowable charges associated with that payment period. Please see Volume 5 for a discussion of credit balances when a student withdraws. If FSA disbursements to the student's account at the school create an FSA credit balance, you must pay the credit balance directly to the student or parent as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the first day of class of a payment period if the credit balance occurred on or before that day; the balance occurred if that was after the first day of class. The law requires that any excess PLUS Loan funds be returned to the parent. Therefore, if PLUS Loan funds create a credit balance, the credit balance would have to be given to the parent. However, the parent may authorize your school (in writing or through StudentLoans.gov ) to transfer the proceeds of a PLUS Loan credit balance directly to the student for whom the loan is made (for example, to a bank account in the student's name). The Department does not specify how a school must determine which FSA funds create an FSA credit balance. A school may not require a student to take any actions to obtain his or her credit balance. It is the sole responsibility of the school to pay, or make available, any FSA credit balance within the 14-day regulatory time frames. Notwithstanding any authorization obtained by the school, the school must provide the student with any remaining FSA credit balance resulting from FSA loan funds by the end of the loan period and any other FSA program credit balances by the end of the last payment period in the award year for which the funds were awarded.Holding a check A school may hold the check for no longer than 21 days after the date the school notifies the student or parent. If the student or parent does not pick up the check, the school must immediately mail the check to the student or parent, pay the student or parent directly by other means, or return the funds to the appropriate Title IV program. 34 CFR 668.164(d)(2) Credit balances 34 CFR 668.164(h)(1) School responsibility to pay credit balance in time frame 34 CFR 668.164(h)(2) School responsibility to pay credit balance by the end of the last payment period 34 CFR 668.165(b)(5)(iii)Disbursements in Programs of Less than One Y ear Where Grades Are Not Awarded Before disbursing funds to students enrolled in programs equal to or less than one year in which they do not receive grades or credits until the end of the program, your school must have a satisfactory academic progress standard as described in Volumes 1 and 2 of the Handbook, and you must measure a student's academic prog - ress by the time the student has com - pleted one-half of the program (one payment period); if no grades are given for the first half/payment pe - riod, a comparable assessment must be made; and not make a second disbursement of FSA funds to students who are not making satisfactory academic prog - ress, except that students on proba - tion or warning may receive a second disbursement if they completed the clock hours or credit hours associated with the first period.Glossary CFR DCL Volume 2018PAYING FSA CREDIT BALANCES Paying FSA credit balances by issuing a check A school may pay a credit balance by issuing a check payable to and requiring the endorsement of the student or parent. A school is considered to have issued the check on the date that it mails the check to the student or parent; or notifies the student that the check is available for immediate pickup and provides the specific location. A school that is paying a student his or her credit balance with a direct disbursement must pay the student within the 14-day time frame. A school can, within that 14-day period, do a number of things, including sending a notice to the student that his or her money is available. A school that does that is considered to have met the 14-day requirement to give the student his or her credit balance, as long as the school's process complies with the rest of the regulation. That is, the school must be able to give the student a check when the student comes to the office within the 14-day time frame. If a student is told (within the 14-day period) to come to the business office to pick up his or her credit balance, the student must be able to leave the business office with the funds in some form (e.g., a check, cash, or an appropriate stored-value card), and not be told that a check will be mailed to him or her. A school may hold the check for up to 21 days after the date it notifies the student. If the student does not pick up the check within this 21-day period, the institution must immediately mail the check to the student or parent, initiate an EFT to the student's or parent's bank account, or return the funds to the appropriate FSA program. Paying FSA credit balances by initiating an EFT A school may pay a credit balance by initiating an EFT to a bank account designated by the student or parent. Moreover, a school may establish a policy requiring its students to provide information about an existing bank account or open an account at a bank of the student's choosing as long as this policy does not delay the disbursement of FSA funds to students. Consequently, if a student does not comply with the school's policy, the school must nevertheless disburse the funds to the student either by dispensing cash, for which the school obtains a signed receipt, or issuing a check. A school must disburse the credit balance within the regulatory time frame. (See the discussion under When a school uses third-party servicers to disburse FSA funds by EFT later in this chapter for additional information.)Credit balances under $1.00 A school is not required to pay a credit balance that is less than $1.00.Refunds vs. paying credit balances FSA regulations refer to the amount of aid that exceeds the allowable charges as a credit balance. School administrators sometimes refer to this as a refund; however, it is not the same thing as a refund under the school's refund policy or a post-withdrawal disbursement given to a student under the return of Title IV funds rules. Delivery of FSA Funds Must Be Free Schools are prohibited from charging students a fee for delivering FSA funds. If a school delivers FSA funds to students by crediting funds to a school-issued debit or smart card, the school may not charge students a fee for making withdrawals of FSA funds from that card. However, the school may charge for a replacement card. See the discussion under the treatment of T1 and T2 accounts later in this chapter for a discussion of charges allowed under those accounts.Paying a credit balance by EFT: 34 CFR & (ii)(B)When an HCM1 school must pay a credit balance The Department considers a school on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 to have made a disbursement when it satisfies the conditions explained under Defining the Date of Disbursement earlier in the chapter. If a disbursement creates a Title IV credit balance, the school must pay the balance directly to the student or parent before it requests funds through G5 but no later than the deadline given on the previous page.Glossary CFR credit balances example An FSA credit balance occurs only if the total amount of FSA program funds credited to the student's account exceeds allowable charges. For example, Ms. Inu Nagar enrolls at Eaglewood Technical Institute as a computer student, and her total allowable charges for the fall term amount to $1,500. ETI credits $2,000 to her account, composed of $1,000 in FSEOG, $500 in private scholarship funds, and $500 in Pell Grant funds. Although there is an excess of $500 on the account, this does not constitute an FSA credit balance because the total amount of FSA funds ($1,500) credited to the student's account does not by itself exceed the amount of allowable charges ($1,500). If, in this example, ETI credited $600 of Pell Grant funds, rather than $500, an FSA credit balance of $100 would be created because the total FSA funds credited to the account ($1,600) would exceed the allowable charges ($1,500). The order in which these funds were credited does not matter.1st payment periodAug 21 Aug 25 Sept 8$ $ Dec 22 Jan 22$ $Jan 3 Jan 8 May 18 14 days 14 days In the first payment period above, the school disburses FSA funds to incoming students after the students have started classes, so it has 14 days from that date to pay the credit balance to the student (or parent, in the case of PLUS). In the second payment period, the school disburses FSA funds before classes start, so the school has 14 days from the beginning of classes to pay the credit balance. 2nd payment periodExample\u201414-Day Time Frame for Paying Credit BalancesGlossary CFR DCL FSA HB September 2018Special provisions for books and supplies In order to academically succeed in a program, a student must be able to purchase books and supplies at the beginning of the academic period. Therefore, by the seventh day of a payment period, a school must provide a way for a student who is eligible for FSA funds to obtain or purchase the books and supplies required for the payment period if ten days before the beginning of the payment period, the school could have disbursed FSA funds to the student; and disbursement of those funds would have created an FSA credit balance. A school must consider all the FSA funds a student is eligible to receive at the time it makes the determination, but the school need not consider aid from non-FSA sources. A school that includes the costs of books and supplies in the tuition charged and provides all of those materials to the student at the start of his or her classes meets the requirements of these regulations. The amount a school must provide is the lesser of the presumed credit balance or the amount determined by the school that the student needs to obtain the books and supplies. In determining the required amount, a school may use the actual costs of books and supplies or the allowance for those materials used in estimating the student's cost of attendance for the period. A school's policy must allow a student to decline to participate in the process the school provides for the student to obtain or purchase books and supplies. If a student uses the method provided by the school to obtain or purchase books and supplies, the student is considered to have authorized the use of FSA funds, and the school does not need to obtain a written authorization for this purpose. If a school uses a bank-issued, stored-value or prepaid debit card that is supported by a federally insured bank account to deliver funds for books and supplies, a student must have access to the funds via the card by the seventh day of his or her payment period. If a bank delays issuing a stored-value or prepaid debit card to the student because it must resolve conflicting identity data under federal law, the Department will not hold the institution accountable as long as the institution exercises reasonable care and diligence in providing in a timely manner any identity information about the student to the bank. Likewise, the school is not responsible if the student provides inaccurate information or delays in responding to a request from the bank to resolve any discrepancies.Provisions for books and supplies 34 CFR 668.164(m) Authorization not required If a Pell-eligible student uses the process provided by the school to obtain books or supplies, the student is considered to have authorized the use of the FSA funds, and no written authorization is required. School options A school has the flexibility to choose the method or methods to satisfy this provision based on its administrative needs and constraints or an evaluation of the costs and benefits of one or more methods. For example, the school may issue a bookstore voucher, make a cash disbursement, issue a stored-value card, or otherwise extend credit to students to make needed purchases. Effect of Verification To be eligible to receive the disbursement for books and supplies, a student must meet all the student eligibility requirements before the start of the student's payment period. A student who has not completed the verification process, has an unresolved \"C\" code on the SAR and ISIR, or has unresolved conflicting information is not covered by the special provisions for books and supplies if those issues have not been resolved at least 10 days before the start of the student's payment period. Schools using HCM and reimbursement payment Although schools on the HCM and reimbursement payment methods do not receive funds from the Department prior to making disbursements, they must still provide a way for students to get or purchase books and supplies within the time specified in the body of this page.Glossary CFR 2018Under a consortium agreement between two eligible schools, if a student is enrolled in a course at the host school and classes start before the payment period begins at the home school that is paying the FSA funds, the regulations require that the student obtain the books and supplies by the seventh day of the start of the payment period of the home school. If the host school is paying the FSA funds, the student must be able to obtain the books and supplies by the seventh day of the start of the payment period of the host school. A student may decline to participate (opt out) in the way a school provides for obtaining books and supplies. For instance, if a school provides a bookstore voucher, the student may opt out by not using the voucher. If the school provides the funds using a stored-value or prepaid debit card, the school must have a procedure through which the student may opt out. For example, a school may require a student to notify the school by a certain date so that the school does not unnecessarily issue a check to the student or transfer funds to the student's bank account. If a student opts out, the school may, but is not required to, offer the student another way to purchase books and supplies as long as it does not otherwise delay providing funds to the student as a credit balance. A school is required to provide, in its financial aid information and its notifications provided to students receiving FSA funds, information on the way the school provides for Federal Pell Grant eligible students to obtain or purchase required books and supplies by the seventh day of a payment period under certain conditions and how the student may opt out. The information must indicate whether the school will enter a charge on the student's account at the school for books and supplies or pay funds to the student directly. Also, during the aid counseling process, the school must explain to a student who qualifies for the funds advanced to purchase books and supplies how the method is handled at the school and how a student may opt out. TIME FRAME FOR RETURNING AN UNCLAIMED TITLE IV CREDIT BALANCE FSA funds may not escheat to a state or any other third party. (See the end of Chapter 1 for more on escheating.) A school must return to the Department any Title IV funds, except FWS program funds, that it attempts to disburse directly to a student or parent that are not received by the student or parent. For FWS program funds, a school is required to return only the federal portion of the payroll disbursement. If an EFT to a student's or parent's financial account is rejected, or a check to a student or parent is returned, a school may make additional attempts to disburse the funds, provided that those attempts are made not later than 45 days after the EFT was rejected or the check returned. In cases where the school does not make another attempt, the funds must be returned to the Department before the end of this 45-day period.30-Day Delay Requirement If the 30-day delayed disbursement provisions for Direct Loans apply to a student, and a Direct Loan is the only Title IV aid the student is receiving, a school does not have to comply with the provisions of 34 CFR 668.164(m).Clarification Book vouchers and institutional charges in the return of Title IV funds calculations Remember, if a book voucher issued by a school cannot be used to purchase course materials from a convenient unaffiliated source, the student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase his or her course materials elsewhere. In that case, the school must include the cost of books and materials purchased with the voucher as institutional charges in Step 5, Part L of any Return of Title IV funds calculation. See Volume 5 . Returning Funds 34 CFR 668.164(l)Glossary CFR FSA HB September 2018The school must cease all attempts to disburse the funds and return them no later than 240 days after the date it issued the first check. All unclaimed credit balances must be returned\u2014there is no de minimis amount.How to Recognize TEACH Grants That Have Converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans TEACH Grants converted to Direct Loans will have in NSLDS a loan type code of D8\u2014Direct Unsubsidized (TEACH). On ISIRs, the financial aid history page has a TEACH Grant Loan Conversion Flag with a \"Y\" for Yes or \"N\" for No. When A School Must Return a Title IV Credit Balance After 240 Days Because the regulations allow schools up to 240 days to deliver a Title IV Credit Balance to a student who left school before receiving the credit balance, a school might find that it is holding Title IV funds that belong to a student the school cannot locate. When that happens, the school should return the Title IV funds in the same order the school would use if the school had to return funds because the student withdrew before the 60% point in the payment period or period of enrollment (See sidebar for the order of return). Direct Loans \u2014The school must complete two separate procedures: 1. The school must return the funds through G5. 2. The return must be offset by a downward adjustment in student's Direct Loan record in COD. When the school reduces the student's Direct Loan actual disbursement amounts in COD, the information is transmitted to the student's loan servicer and results in a reduction of the outstanding principal balance on the student's loan. Perkins Loans \u2014The school must reimburse its Perkins Loan fund; report those funds as income in Part III, Section A of the FISAP; and reduce the student's Perkins Loan balance, and make an accounting entry that ties the reduction to the journal entry for the reimbursement of its Perkins Loan fund. The school should not make any changes to the student's Perkins promissory note. Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants \u2014The school must complete two separate procedures 1. The school must return the funds through G5. 2. The return must be offset by a downward adjustment in student's Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant award in COD. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants \u2014If the award year has not changed, the school can immediately award the funds to another eligible student. If the award year has changed and the school has not already carried forward the maximum 10% allowable, the school may carry the funds forward to the current year and award them to another eligible student. Note that the school will have to amend Part IV, Sections B-E and Part VI of the FISAP to reflect the amount being carried forward. If the FSEOG funds cannot be carried forward to the next award year the school must return them to the correct award year through G5, and amend Part IV, Sections C-E and Part VI of the FSA CREDIT BALANCES A school is permitted to hold credit balances if it obtains a voluntary authorization from the student (or parent, in the case of PLUS). If your school has the authorization to hold the credit balance, it must identify the amount of funds that it holds for the student or parent in a subsidiary ledger account designated for that purpose. Your school also must maintain, at all times, cash in its bank account at least equal to the amount that it holds for students. The school is permitted to retain any interest earned on the student's credit balance funds. Because FSA funds are awarded to students to pay current year charges, notwithstanding any authorization from the student or parent, you must pay any remaining balance on FSA loan funds by the end of the loan period, and any other remaining FSA program funds by the end of the last payment period in the award year for which they were awarded. If your school has lost contact with a student who is due a credit balance, you must use all reasonable means to locate the student. If you still cannot find the student, your school must return the credit balance to the appropriate FSA program(s) and/or lender. The FSA regulations do not set specific rules for determining which funds created a credit balance. However, we encourage schools to return FSA funds to loan programs first to reduce the borrower's loan balance. For more information on holding a credit balance, see the discussion under Authorizations earlier in this chapter and the sample authorization on the next page. Authorization to hold an FSA credit balance All elements of an authorization to hold an FSA credit balance must be conspicuous. An authorization must include the following elements: An authorization must explain what FSA funds are covered by the document, and it must specify the time period covered. An authorization must clearly provide the student or parent with the information he or she needs to make an informed decision. The student or parent must be informed that he or she may refuse to authorize any individual item, that he or she may cancel such authorization at any time, and that a cancellation is not retroactive. A credit-balance authorization must provide detail that is suf - ficient to give the student or parent an idea of how the credit balance will be used.The Order in Which Title IV Funds Must Be Returned Unsubsidized Direct Loans (other than PLUS), including a loan created because a TEACH Grant recipient failed to pro - vide the confirmation required under 34 CFR 686.40(a) 120 days after ceasing enrollment. See 686.43(a). Subsidized Direct Loans Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants FSEOG Grants TEACH Grants Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants Prohibited Behavior A school may not suggest or require that all students or all of a specific group (e.g., those in the final term or payment period of a program) allow the school to hold a Title IV credit balance for unanticipated expenses that do not currently appear on the student's account and are not part of the charges normally assessed to those enrolled in her program. Title IV funds are provided to a student to pay current charges for the payment period or period of enrollment, not those that might accrue later at some undefined time. Moreover, Title IV credit balances must be available for students to pay noninstitutional charges such as off- campus housing or transportation for the current period. In addition, the requirement that Title IV loan funds be disbursed by the end of the loan period means that those funds may not be held in anticipation of charges that might be posted to a student's account after the end of the loan period. During a program review or federal audit, the Department will review authorizations to hold credit balances and note patterns that suggest a school is pressuring students to allow it to hold credit balances and then using those balances to pay charges for periods that begin after the end of the loan period or last payment period in the award year. 34 CFR 668.165(b)(2)(i) and (b)(5)(iii)Glossary CFR FSA HB September 2018 TRISKAIDEKA MARLEY UNIVERSITY AUTHORIZATION TO HOLD A FEDERAL STUDENT AID CREDIT BALANCE Through this document, you will tell Triskaideka Marley University (TKMU/the University) how you would like the school to manage the FSA credit balance on your student account. An FSA credit balance is created when the total of all FSA funds credited to a student's account exceeds the total of tuition, fees, room, board, and other eligible educational charges on a student's account. Your FSA credit balance of $2,500 was created by funds from the Federal Pell Grant and Direct Loan Programs. Unless a student or parent (in the case of a parent PLUS loan) authorizes a school to hold a credit balance, the credit balance must be paid to the student or parent as soon as possible but no later than 14 calendar days after the balance is created (or 14 calendar days after the first day of class if the credit balance was created before the first day of class). This form, if signed by you (the student or parent, as applicable), authorizes TKMU to retain an FSA credit balance and pay it to you in accordance with TKMU'S Procedure for Paying Federal Student Aid Credit Balances . TKMU will pay credit balances by depositing the funds in a savings or checking account or transferring the funds to a \"stored-value\" or debit card that you designate. You have the right to withhold agreement from all or part of this authorization. If you elect not to authorize the University to hold your FSA credit balance, the funds will be paid to you within the 14-day period noted above. Note that if you elect not to sign this form or if you later cancel your authorization, you will be required to pay any outstanding charges to the University. This authorization will remain in effect for each subsequent payment period unless you withdraw it. However, in no case will TKMU hold an FSA credit balance of loan funds beyond the end of the loan period nor an FSA credit balance of other funds beyond the end of the last payment period in the award year for which the funds were awarded. This authorization may be withdrawn at any time by providing a written request to the following address: TKMU Financial Aid Office Director of Financial Aid 1300 Ted Drive, Suite 1313 Pixie, CA 13013 If you withdraw your authorization, the University will deliver any remaining credit balance to you within 14 days. Note that your cancellation is not retroactive. Authorization I voluntarily authorize the University to hold and manage my FSA credit balance as described above, and I acknowledge that interest will not be earned on these balances.Sample Authorization to Hold an FSA Credit Balance 2018Schools on the HCM and reimbursement payment methods are prohibited from holding credit balances Schools on the heightened cash monitoring and reimbursement payment methods must credit a student's ledger account for the amount of Title IV funds the student or parent is eligible to receive and pay the amount of any credit balance due under 34 CFR 668.164(h) before the schools submit a request for those funds. A requirement to pay students their credit balances prohibits schools from holding the funds. Since holding the funds is prohibited, obtaining an authorization do so is also prohibited. THIRD-PARTY SERVICERS DISBURSING CREDIT BALANCES BY EFT In response to current trends, banks and financial service companies are now offering services that include the following: obtaining a student's authorization to perform electronic transfers; transferring Title IV funds electronically to a student's bank account; opening a bank account for the student; and issuing debit cards in conjunction with a participating bank. Companies that contract with schools to provide these types of services in most instances become third-party servicers. So long as a school cannot recall or receive a payment from a student or parent account, the Department considers the electronic transfer of funds to a bank account that a servicer opens on behalf of a student to be the equivalent of a school's transfer of funds to a student's account and the equivalent of making a direct payment to a student. A school that enters into a contract with a servicer to provide debit, demand, or smart cards through which FSA credit balances are paid to students must have a system to ensure compliance with all regulatory time frames, including students having access to any credit balance within the 14 days and to any FWS wages at least once per month. Schools must provide students a choice of the way they receive Title IV credit balances A school located in a state that makes direct payments to students by EFT that enters into an arrangement described later in this chapter under Tier One (T1) and Tier Two (T2) Arrangements including an institution that uses a third-party servicer to make those payments, must establish a selection process under which students choose one of several options for receiving those payments.Reimbursement and HCM payment methods 34 CFR 668.162(c) and (d) See the discussion earlier in this chapter under Conditions under which a third-party servicer is responsible for confirming a student's eligibility for additional information about the responsibilities of third-party servicers. Notifying the Department About Third-Party Servicers Schools are required to notify the Department of all third-party servicer contracts\u2014including those in which a servicer participates in any way in establishing or maintaining accounts that Title IV credit balances are deposited in. If a school has submitted information regarding its third-party servicers as part of applying for certification or recertification, no additional submission is required. The school must notify the Department (by updating Section J of the E-App) within 10 days of any of the following changes to servicer arrangements: The school enters into a contract with a new third-party servicer. The school significantly modifies a contract with an existing third-party servicer. The school or one of its third-party servicers terminates a contract. A third-party servicer ceases to provide contracted services, goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy. This notification must include the name and address of the servicer and the nature of the change or action. A school is only required to submit a copy of its contract with a third-party servicer if the Department requests it; the contract is not required as part of the recertification process. (See Volume 2 for more about third-party servicer contracts.) 34 CFR 668.25(e)Glossary FSA HB September 2018In all cases student consent must be obtained in writing (including electronically) and schools must retain copies of that consent. A school's selection process must 1. inform students in writing that they are not required to open or obtain a financial account or access device offered by or through a specific financial institution in order to receive their Title IV credit balances; 2. ensure that student options for receiving direct payments are described and presented in a clear, fact-based, and neutral manner; 3. ensure that initiating direct payments by EFT to students' exist - ing financial accounts is as timely and no more onerous to stu - dents than initiating an EFT to accounts provided under Tier One and Tier Two arrangements; 4. allow students, at any time, to change their previously selected payment options, as long as students provide the school with written notice of the change within a reasonable time; 5. ensure that no account option is preselected; and 6. ensure that students who do not make an affirmative selection are paid the full amount of their credit balance within the time frame specified in the appropriate regulations. In describing the options under its selection process, a school must present prominently as the first option, a financial account belonging to the student; must list and identify the major features and commonly assessed fees associated with each financial account under Tier One and Tier Two arrangements (see the margin note); must provide a URL on which the terms and conditions associated with each account are provided; may provide, for the benefit of the student, information about available financial accounts (other than those provided in Tier One and Tier Two arrangements) that are checking, savings, or similar accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) accounts or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).Definition State \u2014A State of the Union, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. The latter three are also known as the Freely Associated States. An institution is physically located in a state if it has a campus or other instructional site in that state. 34 CFR 600.2 Exception to Selection Process A school that does not offer or use any financial accounts under Tier One or Tier Two arrangements may make direct payments to a student's or parent's existing financial account, or issue a check or disburse cash to the student or parent without establishing this selection process.Student Choice 34 CFR 668.164(d) Disclosure format See the Federal Register of July 18, 2017 , for the final suggested format for the disclosure of features and fees associated with financial accounts under T1 and third-party servicer is an individual or a state or a private, for-profit or non-profit organization that contracts with a school to administer any of the school's responsibilities under the FSA programs, including managing its Perkins Loan collections. The agreement between the school and servicer must be in the form of a written contract that may or may not require compensation to the servicer. The contract must provide that the servicer agrees to the following: comply with all Title IV provisions, including those that refer solely to schools as well as those that explicitly refer to third-party servicers; be jointly and severally liable with the school for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA provision; use any Title IV funds (and any interest or earnings on them) solely for the purposes specified in and in accordance with the applicable program regulations; refer any reasonable suspicion of fraud or criminal conduct in the Title IV programs by the school or by an applicant or student to the Department's inspector general; return to the school all Title IV funds and records related to the servicer's administration of the Title IV programs if the contract is terminated, the servicer ceases to perform any functions prescribed under the contract, or if the servicer files for bankruptcy; annually submit a compliance audit as provided in 34 CFR 668.23. For a servicer that contracts with several participating schools, a single compliance audit can be performed that covers its administrative services for all the schools. Read more on these requirements at the Department's Office of the Inspector General's website . DCL GEN : For more about activities that define third-party servicers, see Volume 1 FSA HB September 2018TIER ONE AND TIER TWO ARRANGEMENTS The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) changed consumer protections available to college students to address concerns about the marketing practices and financial incentives related to contractual relationships between institutions and credit card providers. The CARD Act authorized new rules to restrict credit card marketing practices on campus, impose transparency requirements, ban ''free'' gifts for signing up for an account, and require consumers under the age of 21 to show ability to pay or get a cosigner in order to get a credit card. In 2015 the Department published regulations supporting the CARD Act protections and identifying two types of agreements between schools and financial service providers: Tier 1 and Tier 2 arrangements. Tier 1 arrangements A Tier 1 (T1) arrangement is one in which a school located in a state contracts with a third-party servicer to perform one or more of the functions associated with processing direct payments of Title IV funds on behalf of the school, and the school or third-party servicer makes payments to one of the following: One or more financial accounts that are offered to students under the contract. A financial account where information about the account is communicated directly to students by the third-party servicer or the school on behalf of or together with the third-party servicer. A financial account where information about the account is communicated directly to students by an entity contracted or affiliated with the third-party servicer. Privacy and security in T1 accounts The Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act requires that schools have in place an information security program that ensures the security and confidentiality of customer information, protects against anticipated threats to the security or integrity of such information, and guards against the unauthorized access to or use of such information. For more information related to the GLB Act, see \"FTC standards for safeguarding customer information\" in Volume 2 .Examples of functions associated with processing direct payments of Title IV funds on behalf of the school include: receiving Title IV funds; posting Title IV funds to student accounts; calculating a student's Title IV credit balance; processing documents for direct payment to students; and disbursing or delivering FSA funds.Why the Department Distinguished Between Financial Institutions and Third-Party Servicers that Process Direct Payments Financial entities and third-party servicers have different incentives. Banks and credit unions seek to create long- term relationships with college students that will go on long after they have left school. Third-party servicers are more likely to seek to partner with schools to provide them and their students fee- based services. A third-party servicer's relationship with students typically ends once they are no longer enrolled. This short- term interaction creates an incentive to increase fee revenue over what traditional banks might charge. In addition, third-party servicers have privileged access to systems and data that traditional banks not serving as third-party servicers do not. As a result, third-party servicers have been able to brand or market access devices in ways that can (1) confuse students into assuming the device is required as part of enrollment, (2) prioritize electronic delivery of credit balances to a preferred account before a preexisting bank account, and (3) access personal student information for targeted marketing purposes. Multiple independent organizations and agencies (Consumers Union, Government Accountability Office, USPIRG, ED's OIG, FDIC, etc.) have found that students in relationships with third-party servicers providing them direct payments often face higher costs, deceptive business practices, and misleading direct marketing. Finally, the requirements described under Tier One and Tier Two arrangements do not apply to accounts only incidentally offered to students. The requirements apply to schools, third- party servicers, and the arrangements those entities voluntarily enter into that affect the delivery of Title IV funds.Glossary CFR that participate in T1 arrangements must ensure that students actively consent to participate in any account offered under that T1 arrangement and that, in obtaining students' consent, schools must satisfy the standards presented earlier in this chapter under Schools must provide students a choice. We remind schools that informing students of the terms and conditions of the each financial account offered are part of that process. A school must ensure that it obtains a student's consent to open an account under a T1 arrangement, before an access device, or a representation of an access device, is sent to the student. However, a school may send a student an access device that is a card provided to the student for school activities, such as a student ID card, so long as the school or financial institution obtains the student's consent before validating the access device for use by the student in relation to the financial account. Before a student selects the way he or she will receive direct payments from a school, the school is prohibited from sharing any personally identifiable information (PII) about a student with a third-party servicer or financial institution except directory information; a unique student identifier generated by the school that does not include a Social Security number, in whole or in part; the disbursement amount; a password, PIN code, or other shared secret provided by the school that is used to identify the student; and any additional items specified by the Department in a notice published in the Federal Register. Schools, third-party servicers, and financial institutions are jointly responsible for ensuring that any personally identifiable information about students is used solely for activities that support making direct paymen ts to the student and not for direct marketing or any other purpose; and is not shared with any other affiliate or entity except for purposes of making direct payments of Title IV, HEA program funds. Student access to and costs for T1 accounts Schools located in a state must ensure that students who choose to participate in accounts offered under T1 arrangements 1. have convenient access to the funds in the financial account through a surcharge-free national or regional Automated Teller Machine (ATM) network that has ATMs sufficient in number and housed and serviced in a way that guarantees that Title IV funds are reasonably available to students, including at the times the school or its third-party servicer makes direct pay - ments into the financial accounts of those students;Definitions Access device \u2014a card, code, or other means of access to a financial account, or any combination thereof, that may be used by a student to initiate electronic fund transfers. Depository account \u2014an account at a depository institution described in 12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(A), or an account maintained by a foreign institution at a comparable depository institution that meets the requirements of 34 CFR 668.163(a)(1). EFT (electronic funds transfer)\u2014a transaction initiated electronically instructing the crediting or debiting of a financial account or an institution's depository account. For transactions initiated by the Department, EFT includes all transactions covered by 31 CFR 208.2(f). For transactions initiated by or on behalf of an institution, EFT includes, from among the transactions covered by 31 CFR 208.2(f), only Automated Clearing House transactions. Financial account\u2014 a student's or parent's checking or savings account, prepaid card account, or other consumer asset account held directly or indirectly by a financial institution. Financial institution \u2014a bank, savings association, credit union, or any other person or entity that directly or indirectly holds a financial account belonging to a student, issues to a student an access device associated with a financial account, and agrees with the student to provide EFT services. Parent \u2014the parent borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan. Student ledger account\u2014 a bookkeeping account maintained by an institution to record the financial transactions pertaining to a student's enrollment at the institution.Glossary CFR DCL FSA HB September 20182. do not incur any cost for opening the financial account or initially receiving an access device; for conducting a balance inquiry or withdrawal of funds at an ATM in a state that belongs to the sur - charge-free regional or national network; when the student conducts point-of-sale transactions in a state (assessed by the institution, third-party servicer, or a financial institution associated with the third-party servicer); 3. have no credit extended or associated with the financial account; and 4. have no fees charged to the student for any transaction or withdrawal that exceeds the balance in the financial account or on the access device. Other responsibilities of schools that offer T1 accounts A school offering accounts under T1 arrangements must ensure that financial accounts and access devices are not marketed, por - trayed as, or converted into credit cards; no credit is extended or associated with the financial account, and no fee is charged to the student for any transaction or withdrawal that exceeds the balance in the financial account or on the access device, except that a transaction or withdrawal that exceeds the balance may be permitted only for an inadver - tently authorized overdraft, so long as no fee is charged to the student for such inadvertently authorized overdraft; the school, third-party servicer, or third-party servicer's asso - ciated financial institution provides a student account holder convenient access to Title IV , HEA program funds in part and in full up to the account balance via domestic withdrawals and transfers without charge, during the student's entire period of enrollment following the date that such Title IV , HEA program funds are deposited or transferred to the financial account; the school takes affirmative steps, by way of contractual arrangements with its' third-party servicer as necessary, to ensure all requirements for T1 arrangements are met; ensure that the terms of the accounts offered pursuant to a T1 arrangement are not inconsistent with the best financial inter - ests of the students opening them. Situations That Are Neither T1 Nor T2 Arrangements Examples of circumstances that are neither T1 nor T2 arrangements and therefore not subject to the regulations: General marketing of a financial insti - tution that does not specify the kind of account or how it may be opened (i.e., not direct marketing described under \u00a7668.164(f)(3)) Sponsorship of on-campus facilities with financial institution branding that does not promote particular accounts A lease permitting the operation of an on-campus branch or on-campus ATMs A list of area financial institutions rec - ommended generally to students for informational purposes rather than being provided as part of a contract with the institution Providing students access to Title IV credit balances through school-issued, stored-value cards with no third-party involvement. See the discussion later in this Department considers this requirement to be met if: a school documents that it conducts reasonable due diligence reviews at least every two years to ascertain whether the fees imposed under the T1 arrangement are, considered as a whole, consistent with or below prevailing market rates; and all contracts for the marketing or offering of a school's T1 arrangements to its students make provision for termination of the arrangement by the school based on complaints received from students or a determination by the school that the fees assessed under the T1 arrangement are not consistent with or are higher than prevailing market rates. When a student who receives T1 payments is no longer enrolled Except for the disclosure requirements about students enrolled during the award year, the T1 requirements cease when students are no longer enrolled and there are no pending Title IV disbursements at the school. A school may continue to share information related to enrollment status with the servicer so that it can comply with the regulations. Tier 2 arrangements A Tier 2 (T2) arrangement is one where a school contracts with a financial institution or other entity to offer financial accounts that are marketed directly to students. A financial account is marketed directly if the school communicates information directly to its students about the financial account and how it may be opened; the financial account or access device is cobranded with the school's name, logo, mascot, or other affiliation and is marketed principally to students at the institution; or a card or tool provided to the student for school purposes, such as a student ID card, is validated, enabling the student to use the device to access a financial account. Formula for determining the required level of school compliance A school must comply with all of the requirements that apply to Tier 2 arrangements if for the three most recently completed award years 1. an average of 500 or more of its students had a Title IV credit balance; or 2. an average of 5% or more of the students enrolled at the institu - tion had a Title IV credit balance as determined through the fol - lowing formula: T1 and T2 accounts must meet the regulations on federal participation in the Automated Clearing House (ACH) 34 CFR 668.164(g) When T1 and T2 accounts are opened through outreach to a school's students and made through ACH credit of Title IV funds, those are federal payments and as such must be deposited into an account at a financial institution in the name of the student. All payments of Title IV funds deposited to an account that students will access through a prepaid card must be held at a financial institution; must meet the requirements for pass-through deposit or share insur - ance such that the funds accessible through the card are insured for the benefit of the recipient by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in accordance with applicable law; and NOT be attached to a line of credit or loan agreement under which repay - ment from the account is triggered upon delivery of the Title IV payments. In addition, the financial institution issuing the card must provide the holder of the card with all of the consumer protections, and must comply with all of the requirements that apply to a payroll card account under the rules implementing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, as amended. 31 CFR 210.5(a) and (b)(5)Glossary CFR HB September 2018The average number of students with credit balances for the three most recently completed award years The average number of students enrolled at the institution at any time during the three most recently completed award years Schools that fall below this threshold but have at least one student with a Title IV credit balance for the three most recently completed award years, are exempt from certain requirements as described later in this chapter under Schools that fall below the threshold. Privacy and security in T2 accounts The Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act requires that schools have in place an information security program that ensures the security and confidentiality of customer information, protects against anticipated threats to the security or integrity of such information, and guards against the unauthorized access to or use of such information. For more information related to the GLB Act, see \"FTC standards for safeguarding customer information\" in Volume 2 . Schools that participate in T2 arrangements must ensure that students actively consent to participate in any account offered under a T2 arrangement. A school must obtain that consent before the school provides, or permits a third-party servicer to pro - vide, any personally identifiabl e information abo ut the student to the financial institution or its agents, other than directory information; and an access device, or a representation of an access device, is sent to the student. However, a school may send a student an access device that is a card provided to the student for school activities, such as a student ID card, so long as the school or financial institution obtains the student's consent before validating the access device for use by the student in relation to the financial account. In addition, before the final T2 account is opened, schools must list and identify the major features and commonly assessed fees associated with each financial account offered un - der Tier One and Tier Two arrangements; and provide a URL on which the terms and conditions associated with each account are provided. Student access to and costs for T2 accounts Schools must ensure that students who choose to participate in accounts offered under T2 arrangementsLimited Applicability of Fee Restrictions Note that the fee restrictions that apply to Tier 1 accounts do not apply to Tier 2 accounts.Glossary CFR 20181. have convenient access to the funds in the financial account through a surcharge-free national or regional automated teller machine (ATM) network that has ATMs sufficient in number and housed and serviced in a way that guarantees that Title IV funds are reasonably available to students, including at the times the school or its third-party servicer makes direct pay - ments into the financial accounts of those students; and 2. do not incur any cost for opening the financial account or initially receiving an access device; or conducting a balance inquiry or withdrawal of funds at an ATM in a state that belongs to the surcharge-free regional or national network. Other responsibilities of schools that offer T2 accounts A school offering accounts under T2 arrangements must ensure that the financial accounts are not marketed or portrayed as, or converted into, credit cards; the school takes affirmative steps, by way of contractual arrangements with its third-party servicer as necessary, to en - sure all requirements for T2 arrangements are met; the terms of all T2 accounts offered are not inconsistent with the best financial interests of the students opening them. The Department considers this requirement to be met if\u2014 The school documents that it conducts reasonable due diligence reviews at least every two years to ascertain whether the fees imposed under the T2 arrangement are, on the whole, consistent with or below prevailing market rates; and All contracts for the marketing or offering of accounts to students allow the school to end the arrangement based on complaints from students or a determina - tion in a school review (see the previous bullet) that the fees assessed under the T2 arrangement are not consistent with or are above prevailing market rates. When a student who receives T2 payments is no longer enrolled Except for the disclosure requirements regarding students enrolled during the award year, the T2 requirements cease when students are no longer enrolled and there are no pending Title IV disbursements at the school. A school may continue to share information related to enrollment status with the financial institution or entity that is party to the arrangement.Glossary CFR DCL Volume FSA HB September 2018Schools that fall below the threshold A school that had at least one student with a Title IV credit balance for the three most recently completed award years, but had less than the number and percentage of students with credit balances described under Formula for determining the required level of school compliance earlier in this chapter is exempt from the following T2 requirements: the requirement discussed earlier in this chapter under Schools must provide students a choice ; the web disclosure requirements described under Disclosure Requirements Associated with Tier Two Arrangements earlier in this chapter; ensuring the terms of all accounts offered under a T2 arrangement are consistent with the best financial interests of the students opening them; and ensuring that students have convenient access to the funds in the financial account through a surcharge-free national or regional ATM network that has ATMs sufficient in number and housed and serviced in a way that guarantees that Title IV funds are reasonably available to students, including at the times the school or its third-party servicer makes direct pay - ments into the financial accounts of those students. Cobranding of financial accounts that are not T2 accounts If a school enters into an agreement for the cobranding of a financial account with the school's name, logo, mascot, or other school insignia but the school maintains that the account is not marketed principally to its enrolled students and does not otherwise satisfy the definition of a Tier 2 account, the school must retain the cobranding contract and all other documentation the school believes provides evidence that the account is not marketed directly to its enrolled students. A school must include in the documentation it maintains all evidence that the cobranded financial account or access device is offered generally to the public. Disclosure Requirements for T1 and T2 Arrangements No later than 60 days following the most recently completed award year, schools that offer accounts under a T1 or T2 arrangement must disclose conspicuously on their website in a format established by the Department the contract(s) establishing the arrangement except for any portions that, if disclosed, would compromise personal privacy, proprietary information technology, or the security of information technology or physical facilities. No later than 60 days following the most recently completed award year, schools with T1 and certain T2 arrangements must also disclose on their website the total consideration for the year, monetary and The Department encourages scho ols that fall below the threshold to comply voluntarily with the web disclosure requirements described under Disclosure Requirements Associated with Tier Two Arrangements earlier in this chapter.Glossary CFR 2018non-monetary, paid or received by the parties under the terms of the contract. The school must also include, for any year in which its enrolled students open 30 or more financial accounts under the T1 or T2 arrangement, the number of students who had financial accounts under the contract at any time during the year, and the mean and median of the actual costs incurred by those account holders. In doing this, schools should follow these rules: Prominently place first the number of student account holders and the information on the mean and median costs they incurred. Place information on the total monetary consideration paid or received by the contracting parties directly below the information on student accounts. Place any non-monetary consideration between the contracting parties directly below the monetary consideration. Display the monetary consideration and the mean and median fees charged to students in a format that includes a dollar sign, the amount in whole dollars, and a comma after the thousands place (e.g. $1,234). See DCL GEN-16-16 for more information about the cost disclosure requirements above, including suggestions on calculating cost disclosure information, and the June 16, 2017, electronic announcement , which has more information about the format schools should use in making the disclosures. Schools with T2 accounts are also required to ensure this data is posted in the centralized database on a URL provided by the Department. SCHOOL-ISSUED, STORED-VALUE CARDS WITH NO THIRD-PARTY INVOLVEMENT Historically, there have been instances where schools themselves have provided student ID cards which, in addition to allowing access to controlled buildings, permitting the use of labs and equipment, providing library privileges, etc., are used to hold funds for student use. In some cases, those schools also allow students to have their Title IV credit balances placed on those \"school-issued stored-value\" cards. As long as there is no financial institution or third-party involved in mar - keting the school-issued stored-value cards; the school itself is holding and is in control of the funds held on those cards; the \"stored-value 4-64 FSA HB September 2018 the ID cards are not \"branded\" with the name of a financial in - stitution or bank; and the ATMs through which students access their funds are leased or owned by the school\u2014 then the school-issued cards do not fall under the definition of an account with a third-party servicer. When a school pays an FSA credit balance to a student by making those funds available through a school-issued, stored-value card over which the school exercises control, and with which there is no third- party involvement , the school is, in effect, holding a student's FSA credit balance. Therefore, all of the conditions on holding credit balances apply. If a student withdraws his or her authorization for the school to hold the credit balance in a school-issued, stored-value card, the school must deliver any remaining credit balance within 14 days . If a student withdraws from school and any of the FSA credit balance in his or her school-issued, stored-value card is unclaimed, the school must return to the Department any unclaimed funds within the time frames specified earlier in this volume under Time frame for returning unclaimed FSA credit balances.4-65 FSA HB September 2018Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary In chapter we will discuss a student's and a school's responsibility for resolving overawards and overpayments. This chapter does not cover returning funds when a student withdraws; see Volume 5 for that discussion. See Volume 3 for avoiding overawards during packaging. OVERAWARDS An overaward exists when a student's aid package exceeds his or her need. While your school must always take care not to overaward a student when packaging his or her aid, circumstances may change after you have packaged the student's aid that result in an overaward. For in - stance, the student may receive a scholarship or grant from an outside organization. When an overaward situation arises, you may be required to adjust the Federal Student Aid (FSA) in the student's package in order to eliminate the overaward. Overawards only become overpayments if a school cannot correct them before funds are disbursed to a student. That is, an overpayment exists when some or all of the funds that make up an overaward have been disbursed to the student. An overaward exists whenever a school awards aid either to a student who is ineligible for a specific program or to a student who is ineligible for any FSA program assistance; student's award in an individual program exceeds the regula - tory maximum, e.g., lifetime limit for Pell, annual or aggregate loan limits, annual limit on Federal Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) awards, or a Pell award based on the wrong payment schedule/enrollment status; student's aid package exceeds his or her need (including when the student's expected family contribution [EFC] is revised up - ward after initial packaging); student's award exceeds his or her cost of attendance (COA); and student is receiving a Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant at multiple schools for the same period. In general, unless a school is liable, a student is liable for any overpayment made to him or h er that is greater than $25.Overpayments FSA debts 34 CFR 668.35 Pell Direct Loans 34 Sec. 484(a)(3) 34 CFR 668.32(g)(4), 668.35(c) & (e) Recovery of loan disbursements to students ineligible due to immigration status 34 CFR 668.139 Recovery of interim disbursements 34 CFR 668.61 When There Are Different Regulations When a student's aid package includes assistance from multiple programs that have different overpayment regulations/ requirements, a school must apply the most restrictive requirements. CHAPTERC 3Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Pell Grants A Pell Grant is determined by using the Pell Payment Schedule appropriate for the student's enrollment status, as well as the correct EFC and COA. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. Therefore, if a student's aid package ex - ceeds his or her need, you must attempt to eliminate the overaward by reducing other aid your school controls. A Pell Grant awarded to an ineli - gible student is an overaward, as is a grant based on an enrollment status greater than that for which the student is enrolled. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants The following situations are considered Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant overawards and must be corrected an award made to an ineligible student; an award based on a Pell Grant Payment Schedule for an enrollment status that is greater than that for which the student is enrolled; and an award that by itself exceeds a student's COA. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, like Pell Grants, are not adjusted to take into account other forms of aid. So, if a student's aid package includes an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant and the aid package exceeds his or her need or cost of attendance, but the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant was determined correctly and by itself does not exceed the student's need, you must reduce other aid in your effort to eliminate the overaward. Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grants When a student has no need-based aid TEACH Grants are not considered to be need-based aid. However, a student's TEACH Grant in combination with a student's other non- need-based estimated financial assistance (EFA) may not exceed the student's COA. If a student is not receiving need-based financial assistance, the EFC is not included in determining whether a student is in an overaward status. If you discover a situation in which a student who is not receiv - ing any need-based financial assistance has a TEACH Grant that in combination with other non-need based EFA, exceeds the student's COA, the TEACH Grant must be reduced. When a student is receiving need-based aid For a student who is receiving need-based federal student aid, a student's EFC, plus the student's TEACH Grant, plus the student's other EFA may not exceed the student's COA. If an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Recipient Becomes Pell-Eligible If an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant recipient becomes eligible for a Pell Grant during the award year, then the school must treat the Pell Grant as estimated financial assistance and may need to adjust the student's aid package. Schools must have a process to identify those Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant recipients who become Pell Grant-eligible during the year. COA may not be exceeded Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 121 / June 23, 2008 / page 35483 TEACH Grant maximums 34 CFR with Unsubsidized Direct Loans, PLUS loans, and nonfederal education loans, TEACH Grants may be used to replace a student's EFC. If a TEACH Grant exceeds a student's EFC, the excess TEACH Grant is considered financial assistance for other FSA programs. If a student's EFC, plus the student's TEACH Grant, plus the student's EFA exceeds the student's COA, the school should first apply the TEACH Grant to finance the EFC. (Remember, any TEACH Grant above the EFC is considered financial assistance for other FSA programs.) If the EFC plus any excess TEACH Grant, plus any other EFA still ex - ceeds the student's COA, the student is in an overaward status that the school must resolve. Before reducing a student's need-based aid, the school should reevaluate his COA to determine whether he has increased costs that the school did not anticipate when he was originally awarded aid. If the stu - dent's costs have increased and his total aid package does not exceed the revised COA, the school is not required to take further action. If his aid package still exceeds his COA, the school must resolve the overaward. Campus-Based Programs If a school learns that a student received financial assistance that was not included when calculating her eligibility for Campus-Based aid and that resulted in the student's total aid exceeding her financial need by more than $300, the school must resolve the overpayment. Before reducing the student's Campus-Based aid, the school should determine if she has increased need that was not anticipated when she was initially awarded aid. If her need has increased and the total financial assistance does not exceed the revised need by more than $300, the school is not required to take further action. If her need has not increased or it has increased but the total financial assistance still exceeds her need by more than $300, the amount over the $300 threshold is an overpayment that the school must eliminate. Federal Work-Study Program Because students can't be required to repay wages earned, you can only adjust FWS by reducing the hours they can work in the future and thus their future earnings. You can continue to employ the students, but they can't be paid from FWS funds. If you've already adjusted all other federal aid and institutional aid, and there's still an overaward, you must reimburse the FWS program from your school's funds. FSEOG Overpayments For purposes of FSEOG overpayments, when a school awards FSEOG using the individual recipient or aggregate matching share methods, the FSEOG overpayment amount includes only the federal share. When a school uses the fund-specific method of matching, there is no distinction between federal and other funds. As a result, 100% of the funds disbursed are considered part of the overpayment.Reminders 1. If a school chooses not to use the TEACH Grant to finance the EFC, then all of the TEACH Grant is considered EFA for the other FSA programs. 2. If a TEACH Grant overpayment exists, the school should first reduce stu - dents' level of borrowing, beginning with any unsubsidized loans. Once their loans have been reduced or if they have no loans, it may be neces - sary for the school to reduce their TEACH Grant or other aid. 3. If the school failed to follow required procedures, it must repay any FSA overpayment. If it followed the re - quired procedures and the overpay - ment is $25 or more, the student must repay the overpayment. tolerance the Campus-Based Programs is allowed only if an overaward occurs after Campus-Based aid has been packaged. The threshold does not allow a school to de - liberately award Campus-Based aid that, in combination with other, exceeds the student's financial need. 4-67 FSA HB When a student is not receiving need-based aid Rule: The TEACH Grant, in combination with other non-need- based EFA, may not exceed COA, and any EFC is ignored. COA $9,000 TEACH Grant $4,000 EFC (ignore) 1,000 Other non-need-based EFA 6,000 Total EFA $10,000 A student receives a $6,000 non-need-based scholarship after beginning class and after his TEACH Grant has been posted to his account. The student is not receiving any need-based EFA, and therefore the EFC is ignored. The TEACH Grant plus the other non-need-based EFA exceeds the COA by $1,000 ($10,000 $9,000). The $1,000 is a TEACH Grant overpayment the school must resolve. Example 2 When a student is receiving need-based aid Rule: The student's EFC plus the TEACH Grant, in combination with any other EFA, may not exceed COA. However, the TEACH Grant may be used to replace the EFC. If a school elects this option, the amount by which the TEACH Grant exceeds the EFC is considered EFA for FSA purposes. A student receives a $6,000 need-based scholarship after beginning class and after his TEACH Grant has been posted to his account. The student is receiving need-based EFA. Therefore, the EFC must be considered. The total of the EFC ($1,000), the TEACH Grant ($4,000), and other EFA ($6,000), is $11,000 and exceeds the COA by $2,000 ($11,000 $9,000). The $2,000 is an overpay - ment the school must resolve . COA $9,000 TEACH Grant $4,000 Need-based EFA 6,000 EFC that must be included 1,000 $11,000 If the school elects to use $1,000 of the TEACH Grant to replace the EFC, only $3,000 of the TEACH Grant will be included as financial assistance, and the overpayment that the school must resolve will be reduced to $1,000 (from $2,000 because the aid will now total $10,000).Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL Direct Loans If you discover that you have budgeted a student to receive more Direct Subsidized Loan funds than the student is eligible to receive, so long as the student has remaining annual and aggregate eligibility for Direct Unsubsidized Loans, you may resolve the overaward by replacing the undisbursed Direct Subsidized Loan funds with Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. Note : The guidance in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-13-02 that prohibits replacing a Direct Subsidized Loan with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan as a means of resolving prior inadvertent overborrowing does not apply to the situation described here. If you discover that a student has been overawarded and your school has already received and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have a number of options: If the package includes an Unsubsidized Direct Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan, and the aid package doesn't already apply these loans to finance the EFC, and the school so chooses, the aid package can be adjusted so that all or some part of these loans replaces the EFC, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward. If you have not yet made the second or subsequent disburse - ment of a Direct Loan, the second or subsequent disbursement can be reduced or cancelled. If you determine that the loan was made to an ineligible student, the school must return any amount it retained, and for any loan funds disbursed directly to a student, the school must notify the appropriate loan servicer of the loan of funds that are outstanding, so that the Department can issue a 30-day demand letter to the student. If the overaward situation occurs after Direct Loan funds have been fully disbursed, you do not need to adjust it. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds or the aid package exceeding the student's need. Although a school isn't required to return Direct Loan or nonfed - eral education loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by applying them to the student account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn't prevent your school from returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct payment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by his or her misreporting or withholding information. 4-69 FSA HB September 2018Overaward Tolerance for Direct Loans In general there is no tolerance when determining an overaward in the Direct Loan Program. However, if a student's financial aid package contains a Direct Loan and an FWS award, a $300 toler - ance can be applied to eliminate the overaward. If an overpayment occurs for a student who has a Direct Loan and Campus- Based awards, unless the Direct Loan has been fully disbursed, the Direct Loan must be reduced before the Campus-Based awards are adjusted or canceled. If a school wants to replace a Direct Subsidized Loan with a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, (since COD reporting and interface information is so closely tied to the award type as identi - fied in the award ID) a school must can - cel the Direct Subsidized Loan and origi - nate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan. TIPVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL A resolved overaward may become an overpayment If a school has resolved an overpayment by reducing scheduled future disbursements for a second or subsequent payment period and the stu - dent ceases attendance before the end of the current payment period, that portion of the student's award that was an overpayment must be repaid outside of the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22, which generally address the handling of Title IV funds when a student withdraws. If the school is responsible for repaying the overpayment, the school must repay the overpayment before completing any required return cal - culation as described in Volume 5 . If a student is responsible for repaying the overpayment and the student withdrew after the 60% point in the payment period or period of attendance, as applicable, the school should try to collect the overpayment from the student, and if it is unable to do so, should refer the student to the Department's Default Resolution Group. If the student is responsible for repaying the overpayment, and the student withdrew before the 60% point in the payment period or period of attendance, as applicable, the school should not take any action until it has completed the required return calculation. However, when performing the return calculation, the school should not include the amount of the overpayment for which the student is responsible as aid that was or could have been disbursed (see Volume 5 ). Then, when the school has completed the return calculation, it should document the amount of the overpayment and, as applicable, reduce any post-withdrawal disbursement or increase any amount the student must return by the amount of the overpayment owed by the student. WHEN A STUDENT FAILS TO BEGIN ATTENDANCE If your school disburses Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, Perkins Loan, or FSEOG funds, but the student never begins attending classes, you must return the disbursed funds to their programs even if they were disbursed directly to the student.1 If the student begins attending some but not all of her classes, you will have to recalculate the student's Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant award based on the student's actual enrollment status (see Volume 3 ). If a school disburses Direct Loan funds but the student does not begin attendance in any courses during the payment period, the school must return all Direct Loan funds that were credited to the student's ac - count at the school for the payment period or period of enrollment. In addition, a school must return the amount of any payments made directly by or on behalf of the student to the school for the payment period or pe - riod of enrollment, up to the total amount of the loan funds disbursed.Overaward and Unsubsidized Loan Example Hector's cost of attendance is $12,000 and EFC is 4,000. He is supposed to re - ceive a subsidized Direct Loan of $5,000 and an unsubsidized Direct Loan of $3,000, which completely meet his need. Before he receives his first loan disburse - ment, Guerrero University also gives him a $2,000 scholarship. If Hector's entire loan amount of $8,000 had been sub - sidized, Guerrero would have to send some of the loan back. But because part of the loan amount is unsubsidized, Guerrero simply considers that $2,000 of the unsubsidized loan that applied to Hector's financial need is now being used to replace part of his EFC. A student is considered not to have be - gun attendance if a school is unable to document his attendance in any class. Returning funds for students who do not register or fail to begin attendance 34 CFR 668.21 GEN-13-02 Time frame for returning funds for stu - dents who fail to begin attendance 34 CFR 668.21(b) 1 A school may satisfy this requirement ei - ther by redepositing the funds in its federal funds account and disbursing them within three days to another eligible student in the same program and award year or by return - ing them to the appropriate FSA program using the refund function in In addition, a school must return any Direct Loan funds that it disbursed directly to a student if the school knew prior to disbursing the funds directly to the student that the student would not begin attendance (for example, if a student notified the school that he or she would not be attending or if the school expelled the student prior to directly disbursing the funds). For any remaining loan funds disbursed directly to a student\u2014and if the school does not choose to repay those funds on her behalf\u2014the school must notify the appropriate loan servicer of the loan funds that are outstanding so the Department can issue a 30-day demand letter to the student. To identify the current servicer of an FSA loan, use the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and select \"Aid.\" Identify the stu - dent and select \"Loan History\"; the current loan will be listed at the top. Use the \"Servicer\" field to identify the organization to which you will be returning funds. Click on the servicer name to access the NSLDS Orga - nizational Contact List page. Additional contact information for the loan servicers is available on the Information for Financial Aid Professionals (IFAP) website under the Help menu (Contact Information > Service Centers for Schools > Loan Servicing Centers for Schools). Schools must return funds disbursed to a student who failed to begin attendance as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after the date they become aware that the student will not or has not begun attendance. At a school that is not required to take attendance but that has a census date on which it reports its enrollment levels to a state, local juris - diction, or outside agency, it is reasonable to expect the school to return funds as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after the census date. A school that draws down FSA grant or Direct Loan funds under the advanced payment method must disburse those funds no later than three business days following the date the school receives them. If, after a school draws down FSA grant or Direct Loan funds, but before the school disburses them, the school discovers that it cannot disburse all the funds because one of the students for whom the funds were intended has not begun classes, the school must return those funds within the three-day period unless it can disburse them to another eligible borrower or as described under Excess Cash in Chapter 1 .When a Student Withdraws after Starting Classes But Before a School's Census Date A student begins earning FSA funds on her first day of attendance. Therefore, even if she withdraws before a school's census date, the school must perform a return calculation (see Volume 5) . Recalculating Pell eligibility when a student's enrollment status changes before beginning attendance in all classes 34 CFR 690.80(b)(2)(ii)A school may not ignore information available to any office at the school indicating that a student failed to begin attendance. After the start of classes, schools should not disburse FSA funds without confirming that recipients have begun attendance.Reporting enrollment changes in NSLDS If a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement either fails to begin atten - dance or begins attendance on a less than half-time basis, the school must report the change in the student's enrollment status to the Department using the NSLDS enrollment reporting process. Upon receiving the revised enrollment sta - tus from NSLDS, the student's federal loan servicer will change the student's loan status as follows: In-school status will change to grace period status. In-school deferment status will change to repayment status. 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL When a student begins attendance on a less than half-time basis If a student who received a Direct Loan disbursement begins attendance for the loan period but does so on a less than half-time basis despite having originally enrolled (registered for classes) on at least a half- time basis, neither the school nor the student is required to return any loan proceeds. However, the school must not make any subsequent dis - bursements of the loan unless the student resumes enrollment on at least a half-time basis. When funds are considered to have been returned for a student who fails to begin attendance The Department considers a school to have returned FSA funds time - ly if the school does the following: 1. deposits or transfers the funds into its federal funds account no later than 30 days after the date that the school becomes aware that a student will not or has not begun attendance; or 2. initiates an electronic funds transfer (EFT) no later than 30 days after the date that the school becomes aware that a student will not or has not begun attendance. TREATMENT OF OVERPAYMENTS Overpayments for which the school is responsible Your school is liable for any amount of a Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, Perkins Loan or FSEOG overpayment (including amounts under $25) that occurred because your school failed to follow the requirements in 34 CFR parts 668, 673, 674, 676, 690, or 691, as applicable. If your school makes a Perkins Loan or FSEOG overpayment in any amount for which it is liable, you must immediately restore (to your Perkins loan fund or FSEOG account, as applicable) an amount equal to the overpayment plus any administrative cost allowance claimed on the overpayment. When returning Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and TEACH Grant overpayments, you must make a downward adjustment to the student's award in COD, and either return the funds through G5 or disburse them to another eligible student. For a description of overpayments for which students are responsible, see the discussion later in this chapter. A school may attempt to collect from a student funds it has returned. However, this is not an FSA debt because an overpayment for which a school is responsible can never become an FSA debt for a student. Therefore an overpayment for which a school is responsible can never result in a student's losing FSA eligibility and should never be reported to NSLDS or referred to the Department for collection.Pell Grant overpayments, COD, NSLDS, and G5 The Department found that some schools were misreporting Pell overpayments, so we issued an electronic announcement to clarify the actions schools should take when there is a Pell overpayment. How that should be reported depends on whether the school or student is responsible for the overpayment and on how much of it the school is collect - ing. Read the announcement , and see the linked table that summarizes the reporting requirements vis-a-vis NSLDS, Comment Code If a student's SAR/ISIR contains a Com - ment Code that requires resolution (e.g., 100-Perkins Overpayment, 132- Default), the underlying issue must be resolved before any funds may be dis - bursed to the student. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV funds to a student with a SAR Comment Code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has resolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED. See Volume 5 for more information about a student who withdraws.Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL If an overpayment is the result of an interim disbursement of Pell, Perkins Loan, or FSEOG funds (see the Application and Verification Guide ) to the extent that the overpayment is not recovered by reducing subsequent disbursements to the student for the award year or by a pay - ment made by the student, the school must eliminate the overpayment by reimbursing the appropriate account by either requiring the student to return the overpayment, or making restitution from its own funds by the earlier of 60 days after the applicant's last day of attendance, or the last day of the award year. If an overpayment is the result of an interim disbursement of FWS Program funds, the school must eliminate the FWS overpayment by adjusting the applicant's other financial aid or reimbursing the FWS Program account from its own funds. If the school cannot correct the overpayment by adjusting the student's other financial assistance, the student must still be paid for all work performed. Because the interim disbursement was made at the school's discretion, the school is ultimately responsible for repaying it. More - over, because the student does not owe an FSA overpayment, the student should not be reported to NSLDS or referred to the Department for collection. Prohibition on receiving funds for enrollment at more than one school and Potential Overawards (POP) Students may not receive more than 100%* of their scheduled award for a Pell Grant during an award year. Moreover, they may not receive a Pell Grant for concurrent attendance at two or more schools. If a student has identified himself or herself as a transfer student, or if a school has any information that indicates the student might have previously attended another postsecondary school, the school should request transfer monitoring of the student on NSLDS. A school's coordinating official (see Volume 2 ) is responsible for ensuring that a school does not ignore information the school has about a student's prior or concurrent enrollment. If a student has not self-identified, information on the student's SAR/ ISIR can sometimes alert a school to the fact that a student has already received a Pell Grant during the current award year. Schools should examine the Pell payment data on the SAR/ISIR generated from the student's most recent transaction to see if the percentage of the sched - uled award used for the award year (% Sch Used) is greater than 0, and examine the \"As Of\" date ( MM/DD/CCYY ) to see if the information is current. If the SAR/ISIR is the most recent and the percentage of the scheduled award used for the award year is greater than zero, the school should request transfer monitoring of that student and wait until it has received the results of that process before creating a Pell award for that student in COD.Examples of Overpayments Due to School Error Allen received a Pell grant at Sarven Technical Institute, which had the cor - rect EFC on Allen's ISIR but looked at the wrong chart and used a different EFC in the Pell calculation, causing Allen to re - ceive too much money. Because Sarven erred, it is liable for the overpayment. Owen received an outside scholar - ship to attend Guerrero University. The bursar's office was notified of the scholarship so that it would apply the payments properly but didn't notify the financial aid office, which awarded Owen a Perkins Loan without taking the scholarship into account. When the aid office finds out about the scholarship, it discovers that Owen has a $600 Perkins overpayment. Because the school had information about the scholarship\u2014 even though the financial aid office didn't\u2014the overpayment is due to school error. Recovery of funds from interim disbursements 34 CFR 668.61 Pell Grant payment from more than school 34 CFR 690.11 4-73 FSA HB September 2018* If students qualify for additional Pell money in an award year (\"year-round Pell\"), they can receive up to 150% of a scheduled award. See Volume 3 , Chapter 3 .Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL In their award of Pell funds to a student, schools are required to ensure that they do not originate awards that would result in a student receiving more than 100% of the student's scheduled award for the year. Concurrent Enrollment When multiple schools report disbursements for a student and the enrollment dates reported are within 30 calendar days of each other, the COD System identifies a potential concurrent enrollment and sends a warning message to all schools involved. COD sends the school that submitted the second or subsequent disbursement information a response document that contains warning edit 69. COD also sends all the schools with accepted disbursement infor - mation in COD for the student and that award year, a multiple reporting record (MRR) alerting the schools to a possible overlap in enrollment. The Department expects all schools involved to cooperate in resolving the concurrent enrollment issue. To help facilitate resolution, the MRR contains the Pell contact information, as reported by the schools to COD, for the schools involved. Pell Potential Overaward Process A student may receive disbursements from more than one school during an award year. When more than one school reports disburse - ments for a student, COD checks to make sure he has not received more than 100% of his eligibility for a Pell Grant. If COD receives disbursement information that will cause a student to receive more than 100% of his \"total eligibility used\" or TEU, the stu - dent has entered a potential overaward (POP) situation. COD will accept the disbursement and notify the schools involved in the POP in the fol - lowing three ways: 1. COD sends the school that submitted the disbursement that caused the student to exceed the 100% TEU for the year warn - ing edit 68 in the response document. 2. Weekly, COD sends all schools that have accepted and posted disbursements for students in a POP status a Pell POP report that will identify the student and schools involved. 3. COD sends all schools that have accepted and posted disbursements for the student in the award year an MRR containing the Pell contact information for the schools involved. During the 30-day period, the Department expects each school involved in the potential overaward to review the student's award and disbursements and perform the proper eligibility calculations. If the schools (working with COD School Relations) do not resolve the POP situation during the 30-day period, COD will reduce all schools' authori -Calculating September 2018Warning Edit 69 The edit informs schools that submit second or subsequent disbursement information that Pell disbursements for a student have been received from two or more schools, and the enrollment dates for the student are within 30 days of one another. Warning Edit 68 The edit informs the school that sub- mitted the disbursement that caused the student to exceed the 100% TEU for the year that 1. Pell disbursements for a student have been received from two or more schools. 2. The student's TEU is greater than 100.000%. 3. The POP situation must be resolved within 30 calendar days. Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL zation for the student to zero, and the issue will have to be addressed with the Department's involvement. Schools must work together and with the student involved to resolve the POP before contacting COD School Relations for help. Schools should document any phone calls, emails, and letters that were part of their attempts to resolve the POP with the student, and the other schools involved, and be prepared to provide that documentation to COD School Relations if requested. During the 30-day period, COD will accept and post disbursements that decrease or increase the amount of the student's year-to-date dis - bursement. Students will be removed from POP status within 30 days of the date the student was initially placed in the POP if the student's TEU becomes 100% or below based on downward disbursement adjustments submitted by the schools. If after 30 calendar days the situation has not been resolved, COD generates a negative disbursement that reduces all accepted and posted disbursements to $0 for the student in the award year in question at all schools involved. A school that has attempted to resolve an overaward situation with the other schools that have submitted disbursement records for the student and has been unable to arrive at a satisfactory solution should call the COD School Relations Center to request escalated mediation . A school that calls the COD School Relations Center to request escalated mediation should be prepared to provide the name and social security number of the student involved. The COD School Relations Center will review the POP situation and, if necessary, refer the case to the Department for additional action. Schools should remember that failure to take action when they receive warning notices from COD; correct overaward situations; ensure that students do not receive Pell awards for concurrent enrollment at two or more schools; and prevent repeated POP situations from occurring; may call into question a school's administrative capability and fiscal responsibility, and might eventually result in ED's taking action to limit, suspend, or terminate a school's participation in the Federal Student Aid programs. 4-75 FSA HB September 2018COD Processing and POPs 1. The COD System accepts Disburse - ment Information from a maximum of three schools for a student in a POP situation. 2. COD does not prevent the same schools from creating another POP situation for the same student. 3. Schools do not need to request post-deadline processing (Extended Processing) to submit upward ad - justment records after the end of the processing year in order to correct a POP situation. 4. The COD System accepts downward adjustments to disbursement or award information at any time. 5. Disbursement information can be submitted via the COD website for those schools that do not wish, or are not able, to reopen any software they may have used to process the affected award year. Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Overpayments for which the student is responsible In some instances a student, rather than the school, is responsible for repaying the overpayment. If a student has received more Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant funds than the student was eligible to receive because the student's eligibility for a Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant decreased, you can try to eliminate the Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant over - payment by adjusting later disbursements for the award year. You may not reduce a student's correctly awarded and disbursed Pell or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant to address overpayments in other programs. For TEACH Grant, FSEOG, and Perkins Loan overpayments, you can adjust subsequent disbursements. If that is not possible, you must promptly attempt to recover the overpayment by notifying the student (by paper or electronically) and requesting full payment. The notice must state that if the student fails to repay the overpayment or to make satisfactory arrangements for repay - ment, he or she will be ineligible for FSA funds until the overpayment is resolved. If the student claims that your school made a mistake in determining the overpayment, you must consider any information he or she provides and judge whether the objection is warranted. If, after notification to the student and consideration of possible objections, an overpayment remains and the student has not repaid or made satisfactory arrangements to repay the overpayment, you must take further action. For TEACH Grant, FSEOG, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and Pell Grant funds, you must refer the overpayment to the Department with the required information (see Referring overpayments to Default Resolution Group later in this chapter), and you must report to NSLDS the unresolved overpayment. After that, you are not required to make any further attempt to collect the TEACH Grant, FSEOG, Iraq and Afghani - stan Service Grant, or Pell Grant overpayment. For Perkins Loans, you are not required to refer overpayments to Default Resolution Group, but you must report them to NSLDS because the student is required to repay the overpayment to your school's revolv - ing loan fund. A student is not liable for an overpayment when the original amount of the overpayment is less than $25. A student is liable for an overpay - ment of less than $25 when that $25 is a remaining balance. That is, when the overpayment amount was originally $25 or more but is now less than $25 because the student has made payments. Examples of Overpayments Due to Student Error When Chavo filled out his FAFSA, he had not filed a tax return because he didn't think he had to. After he received his aid from Sarven Technical Institute in June, he told the aid office that he had to file a return after all. When Chavo submitted the corrections, his EFC increased, and Sarven determined that he'd received a Pell overpayment. Sarven canceled his second Pell disbursement, but he still owed $100. Sarven allowed Chavo to agree to repay $25 a month for four months so that he'd still be eligible for other aid for the rest of the year. Meurig has to report financial informa - tion about his father on the application although he's living with his stepfather. On his 2018-2019 application, Meurig didn't report any assets for his father, and Brust Conservatory used the information from that application to award aid. However, his 2018-2019 application is selected for verification, which reveals that Meurig's father has a share in a business that should have been reported as an asset. Brust then determines that Meurig should also have reported the business asset on the 2017-2018 application. Meurig's EFC increases when he makes the correction, and he received an overpayment for the 2017-2018 award year. Because he's re - ceived all his aid for that year, he has to either pay the overpayment or negotiate a satisfactory repayment agreement. 2018Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and is also liable for overpayments of less than $25 when that amount is the result of applying the $300 Campus-Based overaward threshold/tolerance. For example, if a school discovers that after a student's Campus-Based aid was disbursed, the student received addi - tional aid that resulted in the aid the student received exceeding his or her need by $314, the $314 is an overaward. When the school applies the $300 overaward tolerance, the student only has a Campus-Based over - payment of $14. The student is responsible for repaying the $14 because the initial amount of the overpayment (before the $300 tolerance was applied) was $314 (which is in excess of the less than $25 de minimis amount). Your school may decide to pay a student's obligation by returning to the appropriate FSA program account the amount overpaid to the student. Once your school makes the appropriate return, the student will no longer owe an FSA debt, but rather a debt to your school that you can collect according to your procedures. The student's eligibility for FSA funds is restored as long as the student meets other FSA eligibility criteria. A student who receives an overpayment of an FSA program loan, or an FSA program grant, may re-establish eligibility for FSA program assistance by repaying the excess amount or by making arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to pay the excess amount. Exceptions to student liability There are some exceptions to holding a student liable for a Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, Perkins Loan, or FSEOG overpayment. Generally, a student is liable for any Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, FSEOG, or Perkins Loan overpayment he or she receives unless the school is liable for it. However, as noted previously, the student is not liable for the overpayment if it is less than $25 and is not a remain - ing balance or, in the case of a Perkins Loan or FSEOG, is the result of the application of the $300 overaward threshold. Such overpayments do not affect the student's FSA eligibility. There - fore, your school need not attempt recovery of such overpayments, report such overpayments to NSLDS, or refer such overpayments to the Department for collection. Overpayments created by inadvertent overborrowing Another kind of overpayment occurs when a student inadvertently has received FSA loan funds in excess of annual or aggregate loan limits and is no longer eligible for FSA funds. 4-77 FSA HB September 2018When a School Acts to Restore a Student's Eligibility If a student (through the school) or a school (with its own funds) satisfies the student's overpayment, the school must update the student's overpayment in - formation in NSLDS as discussed later in this chapter under Reporting Over- payments to NSLDS .TIPVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL A school must determine that a borrower's receipt of loan funds in excess of an annual or aggregate loan limit was inadvertent before the borrower may regain Title IV eligibility. Examples of circumstances that may have resulted in a student in - advertently exceeding an annual or aggregate loan limit include, but are not limited to: school processing errors, missing or incorrect National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) information (e.g., capitalized interest incorrectly included in a borrower's aggregate outstanding loan balance), or unintentional student error or omission. Borrowing in excess of annual or aggregate loan limits is not con - sidered to have been inadvertent if there is any evidence that the over - borrowing was the result of deliberate action on the part of the school that determined the borrower's eligibility for the loan or on the part of the borrower who received the loan. If the school determines that the overborrowing was the result of deliberate action on the part of another school or the borrower, it must notify its school participation division and provide the necessary evidence. If the school suspects fraud involving fed - eral student aid, it should call the inspector general hotline at 1-800-MIS- USED (1-800-647-8733). If a student has consolidated the loan(s) that exceeded the annual or aggregate loan limit, he is considered to have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the debt and no additional action on his part is required. This is true regardless of the type of loan\u2014Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) or Direct Loan\u2014consolidated and the type of consolidated loan. A student who is not in default on an FSA loan but who has inadver - tently received FSA loan funds that exceed the annual or aggregate loan limits is ineligible for any further FSA funds until she (1) repays in full the excess loan amount or (2) makes arrangements, satisfactory to the holder of the loan, to repay that excess loan amount. Note that such a borrower advancing an undergraduate grade level or becoming a graduate student and thus gaining higher annual or aggregate loan limits does not allow her to receive additional loans; the inadvertent undergraduate overbor - rowing must first be resolved before she can receive any Title IV aid. If a student who has inadvertently received loan funds in excess of an annual or aggregate loan limit wishes to receive additional Title IV aid, the school where she wishes to receive the aid must identify the loan(s) that resulted in the overborrowing, discuss the overborrowing with the student, and resolve any discrepancies in the information that is obtained. If the loan that caused the inadvertent overborrowing is a Direct Loan or a FFEL Program loan that is held by the Department, the student must contact the federal loan servicer that services the loan to resolve the inadvertent overborrowing. If the loan that caused the inadvertent overborrowing is a FFEL Program loan held by a loan holder other than the Department (a \"commercially held\" FFEL Program loan), the student Though the de minimis threshold for overpayments due to withdrawal is $50, it is less than $25 for all other overpay - ments. 4-78 FSA HB September 2018Regaining Title IV eligibility after exceeding loan limits DCL: GEN-13-02 A student who received subsidized loan funds in excess of the applicable subsidized annual or aggregate loan limit can no longer regain Title IV eligibility by having the excess subsidized loan amount changed to an unsubsidized loan. See the subsection on Direct Loans under Overawards earlier in this chapter for the treatment on correcting an overaward of Direct Subsidized Loan funds in the current award year.Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL must contact the FFEL loan holder or the servicer for the loan to resolve the inadvertent overborrowing. Repayment of the excess loan amount If a student who has inadvertently overborrowed wishes to regain Title IV eligibility by repaying the excess loan amount, the student must contact the applicable servicer and comply with the servicer's repay - ment instructions. The school may assist the student in identifying and contacting the servicer, but the student, not the school, must make the payment of the excess loan funds in accordance with the servicer's in - structions. Once the student has repaid the excess loan amount in full, the servicer will send the student confirmation that the excess loan amount has been repaid. The student or servicer must provide a copy of the re - payment confirmation to the school. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer received the borrower's full payment of the excess loan amount. Satisfactory repayment arrangements A student who has inadvertently overborrowed may regain Title IV eligibility by making satisfactory repayment arrangements acceptable to the servicer of the loan. The satisfactory repayment arrangement require - ment can be met if the student agrees, in writing, to repay the excess amount according to the terms and conditions of the promissory note that supported the loan. This is called \"reaffirmation.\" The reaffirmation process includes the following five steps: 1. Either the school or the student contacts the servicer and explains that the student has inadvertently overborrowed and wishes to reaffirm the debt. 2. The servicer sends the student a reaffirmation agreement. 3. The student reads, signs, and returns to the servicer the reaffirmation agreement. 4. The servicer sends the student confirmation that the reaffirmation agreement has been accepted. The student or ser - vicer must provide a copy of the reaffirmation confirmation to the school. 5. The inadvertent overborrowing is considered to have been resolved as of the date the servicer receives the student's signed reaffirmation agreement. Once you have documented that the inadvertent overborrowing has been resolved (through repayment in full, making satisfactory arrange - ments to repay the debt, or consolidation of the excess loan amount), you may award additional FSA funds to the student. Keep in mind, however, that the student may have no remaining loan eligibility or may be eligible only for unsubsidized loans.Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements We require a borrower who does not repay the excess loan amount in full to make satisfactory repayment arrange- ments in order to ensure that the borrower acknowledges a debt in excess of the regulatory maximum. For defaulted loans, the law and regulations specify what constitutes a satisfactory repayment agreement. For students who have exceeded loan limits or owe an overpayment of an FSA grant, the law and regulations do not specify what makes a repayment agreement satisfactory. The loan holder determines whether the repayment arrangement is satisfactory. 4-79 FSA HB September 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Because you're responsible for knowing about the student's prior FSA loans before disbursing additional loan funds to the student, inadvertent overborrowing shouldn't occur often. Excess borrowing might occur if a school is unaware of loans a student received at another school. This might happen if the student received the loans under a different name or Social Security number (SSN). (See Volume 1 for a description of how the NSLDS postscreening and transfer monitoring processes can help prevent these kinds of overpayments.) A student who inadvertently overborrowed and who has regained Title IV eligibility by either repaying the excess loan amount or by signing a \"reaffirmation agreement\" may receive additional Direct Loan funds. A student who regains Title IV eligibility after having exceeded an annual loan limit for an academic year is not eligible to receive additional Direct Loan funds for that same academic year, but could receive other types of Title IV aid for the year. If the student exceeded only the annual subsidized limit and has regained eligibility, the student might be eligible to receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans up to the appropriate annual maximum. A student who had inadvertently exceeded the combined subsidized/ unsubsidized aggregate loan limit may not receive any additional Direct Subsidized Loans or Direct Unsubsidized Loans (though a dependent student's parent or a graduate or professional student could receive Direct PLUS Loans). A student who has regained eligibility might be eligible to receive Direct Loan funds for subsequent academic years if the student has remaining eligibility under the subsidized or unsubsidized aggregate loan limits as long as the new loan does not result in the student's exceeding the combined aggregate limit. What a School Must Do When It Has Disbursed a Title IV Loan to an Ineligible Student If a school has disbursed a Direct Loan to an ineligible student, it must return any part of the loan it retained, and for any part of the loan it disbursed directly to the student, it must notify the appropriate loan servicer of the loan funds that are outstanding so that the servicer on behalf of the Department can issue a 30-day demand letter to the student. To identify the current servicer of an FSA loan, ac - cess NSLDS and select \"Aid. \" Then identify the student and select \"Loan History. \" Under Loan History, the current loan will be listed at the top. Use the field \"Ser - vicer\" to find whom you will be returning funds to. Click on the servicer name to access the NSLDS Organizational Contact List page. Additional contact informa - tion for the loan servicers is available on IFAP under the Help menu (Contact In - formation > Service Centers for Schools > Loan Servicing Centers for Schools).Effective Date for Regaining Title IV Eligibility When an otherwise eligible student resolves an inadvertent overborrowing issue by one of the methods discussed above, the student regains eligibility for the Pell Grant, Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant programs beginning with the payment period in which the issue was resolved and regains Direct Loan Pro - gram eligibility retroactive to the begin - ning of the academic year in which the issue was resolved.Reaffirmation process and form DCL GEN-15-20 describes the reaffirmation process and includes as an attachment the reaffirmation form. 4-80 FSA HB September 2018Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL What a School Must Do When It Has Disbursed a Title IV Grant to an Ineligible Student If a school discovers that because of an error made by a student, the school has disbursed a Federal Pell Grant or FSEOG to an ineligible student (e.g., because the student provided false information on a FAFSA), the school must take the following action. Immediately after discovering that it has paid an ineligible student a Title IV grant, the school must report the overpayment to NSLDS on the NSLDS Professional Access website under the AID tab, \"Overpayment List\" menu option entering \"School\" in the source field, and \"Over - payment\" in the indicator field. After making the appropriate change in NSLDS, the school must notify the student of the fol - lowing: 1. He owes an overpayment of Title IV grant funds. 2. His eligibility for additional Title IV funds has been suspended. 3. If he fails to repay the debt in full within 30 days, he will be referred to the Depart - ment's Default Resolution Group for collection and to the Department's Office of the Inspector General for possible legal action. Remember that referring overpayments for collection is a separate process from reporting overpayments to NSLDS. Reporting is the process of creating within NSLDS a record of a student's overpayment. Referring is the process of turning over a student's debt to the De - fault Resolution Group. If the student fails to repay the grant overpayment in full within 30 days, the school must re - fer the grant overpayment to the Default Resolution Group by following the instructions later in the chapter under Referring overpayments to the Default Resolution Group. In addition, if the student fails to repay the grant overpayment in full within 30 days, the school must update the student's record in NSLDS by entering \"TRF-Transfer\" in the source field and \"Overpayment\" as the overpayment status in the indicator field. If the student repays the debt in full within 30 days, the school must update the student's re - cord in NSLDS by changing the overpayment status to \"Repaid\" in the indicator field. 4-81 FSA 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Recording student payments and reductions in the Direct Loan Program If, through its return calculation, a school determines that a student has received an overpayment of Direct Loan funds, the school should reduce the student's award/disbursements by making a downward adjust - ment in COD. Schools can report current year adjustments for awards/disburse - ments either through their loan processing software or by using the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov . Returning Direct Loan funds If a school is required to return DL funds to comply with a regulatory or statutory requirement\u2014even if more than 120 days have elapsed since the disbursement date\u2014the school must return DL funds through G5. The school returns DL funds to the Department following the same pro - cedures the school follows when making other G5 refunds/returns. Direct Loan processing for an award year generally remains open in COD for 13 months following the end of the award year (until July 31 of the next year). A school should be able to submit data via batch or web processing through that time unless it has already confirmed close - out for the impacted award year. If the year is closed in COD before the 13-month period is over, the school should contact COD school relations for help in reopening the award year. Once the 13-month period is over and COD has closed the year, a school may request extended processing through the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov . Toward the end of each award year, the Department publishes an electronic announcement containing information on the closeout dead - line and instructions on how schools can request extended processing for Direct Loans after the closeout deadline. For more information on returning FSA funds, see Chapter 4 . Recording student payments and reductions in the Pell, TEACH, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant programs For reductions to awards and payments, schools should record reductions and payments by entering a replacement value in the COD system. The replacement value will be the original value less only the amount the school has returned (the sum of: that amount the school is responsible for returning + any portion of the grant overpayment that would be the responsibility of the student but which the school has cho - sen to return for him + any portion of the grant overpayment the school has collected from the student). Do not reduce the award/disbursement by the amount the student must return (unless the student has made a payment to the school) . Updating Direct Loan Disbursement Data in COD If a school has confirmed closeout but then needs to submit additional student level data to COD (and the data submis - sion deadline has not yet passed), the school contacts COD customer support and asks that the year be reopened. If the data submission deadline has passed, the school uses the request post deadline/extended processing screen in COD to request an extension. If the re - quest is granted, the school may submit data to COD until the end of the exten - sion period. If a Direct Loan award year has been archived (all Direct Loan award years pri - or to 2011-2012 have been archived) and a school needs to report a decrease to a student-level disbursement record, the school sends an email to schoolreconciliation@ed.gov . In the email the school must provide its full name as it appears in COD, its DL ID number, the award year, and the number of records it needs to process. The school will receive an email telling them how to submit the necessary data and how that data should be processed. If a school needs to report a decrease to a FFEL/FFEL purchased loan, the procedure for returning funds to FFEL servicers is school receives a payment for a current-year overpayment that has not been referred to the Default Resolution Group, the school should NOT send the payment to the Default Resolution Group. Instead, after you have reduced the student's disbursement in COD, return the un - earned funds as follows: If your school has made repayment arrangements with a stu - dent and received a payment on a current-year overpayment, the school should deposit the funds in its Pell, Iraq and Af - ghanistan Service Grant, or TEACH Grant account and make the appropriate entry in the COD system. If a student makes a payment on any previous year's Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, or TEACH Grant overpay - ment, a school makes the aforementioned COD system entry using the same software the school used to create the award. The school then returns the funds to the Department using the Electronic Refund function in G5 following the same pro - cedures the school follows when making other G5 refunds or returns. If, through its return of Title IV funds calculation for a student who has withdrawn ( see Volume 5 ), a school determines that a student has received an overpayment of FSEOG funds, the school must adjust its institutional ledgers, financial aid records, and the student's account by subtracting the amount the school must return (the FISAP filed for the year will reflect the net award to the student). If a student makes a pay - ment on an FSEOG overpayment made in the current award year, the school should deposit the payment in its federal funds account and award the funds to other needy students. If the school collects an overpayment of an FSEOG for an award made in a prior award year , the funds recovered should be returned to the Department using the electronic refund function in G5. Payments should be applied to the award year in which the recovered funds were awarded. REPORTING OVERPAYMENTS TO NSLDS You must report overpayments or changes to previously submitted information to NSLDS within 30 days of the date you learn of the over - payment or change. If a grant overpayment is the result of the student's withdrawal and a return of Title IV funds calculation, you must contact the student within 30 days of determining that the student withdrew (see Volume 5 ). You only report unresolved overpayments if they're due to student error. Don't report those that are a result of school error; instead, as ex - plained previously, you must repay the overpayment with school funds.Importance of Making Timely Adjustments Since each disbursement transaction (positive or negative) of a student's Pell Grant in COD affects his lifetime eligibil - ity for Pell funds, schools should ensure that adjustments are made in a timely manner. See Volume 3 for a discussion of the Pell lifetime eligibility. Removal of Pell Grant Data from COD The absolute deadline for updating Pell Grant student data in COD is the last busi - ness day of the fiscal year five years after the award year in question, for example, September 28, 2018, for the 2012-2013 award year. If that deadline has passed, but you have an adjustment to submit that affects a student's Pell Grant Life - time Eligibility Used (LEU), contact COD support for instructions on updating his LEU information. If your school has funds it needs to return to the Pell Grant pro - gram, contact the G5 Hotline for help.TIP 4-83 FSA CFR DCL If you report a Pell Grant overpayment in NSLDS, do not reduce the award/disbursement in the COD system by the amount the student must return (unless the student has made a payment to the school). For addi - tional information, please see the discussion earlier in this chapter under Recording student payments and reductions in the Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and TEACH Grant programs and later in this chapter under School responsibility after referral and accepting payments on referred overpayments. You must use the NSLDS Professional Access website to report over - payments. To do so, your school must have Internet access, and your primary destination point administrator (PDPA) must have signed up at least one user for overpayment updates for NSLDS online services at https://fsawebenroll.ed.gov . Once the overpayment is reported to NSLDS, the student's future output documents will show that he or she has an overpayment (see \"NSLDS Match\"). The financial aid history section of the SAR and ISIR will have information on the overpayment, including whether the student has made satisfactory repayment arrangements. REFERRING OVERPAYMENTS Referring overpayments to the Default Resolution Group If you have tried but not succeeded in collecting a Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, or FSEOG overpayment for which the student is liable, you must refer the overpayment to FSA's Default Resolution Group. To be referred, the initial amount of the over - payment must be at least $25. Note : For an FSEOG overpayment, when a school uses the individual recipient or aggregate matching methods, the over - payment includes only the federal share. When the school uses the fund-specific method of matching, the overpayment includes both the federal and nonfederal shares. See Volume 6 for more information. You would still refer a student debt of less than $25 to the Default Resolution Group when the amount due is a remaining balance or when the amount is the result of the application of the Campus-Based over - award threshold/tolerance. You must make this referral in addition to reporting the overpayment to NSLDS. If your school elects not to refer an overpayment to the Default Resolution Group, your school is liable for and must repay the overpayment from its own funds. To refer student overpayments for collection, schools should use a format similar to the one found at the end of this chapter and send the data to the address at the bottom of that page. Each referral must be typed or printed and must be submitted on school letterhead. Schools Must Resolve Student Concerns If a student claims that a school's over - payment determination is wrong, the school must consider any information the student provides and determine whether the objection is warranted be - fore referring the case for collection.Reporting Overpayments to NSLDS DCL GEN-98-14, July 1998 All new Perkins, Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, and FSEOG overpayments and previ - ously reported FSEOG overpayments for which an NSLDS data element has changed must be reported. Perkins and other data providers must meet all NSLDS reporting requirements as detailed in the appropriate operating manuals. NSLDS reference materials are available on IFAP in our In order to avoid creating a double record for a single overpayment, the school must populate its Overpayment Referral Form: Dates of Disbursement with the exact same dates the school used when it created the NSLDS record. In addition, a school must ensure that it enters the year the disbursement was made in the award year field. In addition, when referring the overpayment, you should update the overpayment information previously reported to NSLDS by changing the \"Source\" field from SCH-SCHOOL to TRF-TRANSFER. Once the Default Resolution Group has accepted a referred student overpayment, it will transmit the information to NSLDS and \"ED Region\" will replace \"School\" as the appropriate contact source for information about the overpayment. On its overpayment referral, a school must provide its Pell identifi - cation number. It should NOT enter its routing identifier. School responsibility after referral and accepting payments on referred overpayments A school may continue to accept payments on FSA grant overpay - ments after those overpayments have been referred to the Department. A school that accepts a check on an overpayment that has been referred to the Default Resolution Group must note the student's name and SSN on the check; indicate that the payment is for an overpayment of an FSA grant; and forward the payment to the Default Resolution Group at National Payment Center P.O. Box 105028 Atlanta, Georgia 30348-5028 If a school accepts a cash payment from one or more students who owe overpayments and who have been referred to the Default Resolution Group, the school should write its own check to the Department and at - tach a letter indicating that the check is for an FSA grant overpayment. The school must include in its letter a roster that includes, for each stu - dent who made a payment, the student's name, Social Security number, and amount paid. If you want a payment to be applied to a specific overpayment (by program and award year), you must include a memorandum on school letterhead. The memorandum must include the award year and pro - gram award number of the award you want credited, and your DUNS number . If a school receives a payment for an overpayment previously referred to the Default Resolution Group and if 4-85 FSA HB September CFR DCL the overpayment was made in the current award year, and the payment will retire the student's debt in full, the school must deposit the payment in its appropriate institutionally main - tained federal funds account; for Federal Pell Grant overpayments, make the appropriate en - try in the student's record on the COD system (either on COD or via Common Record); and send a letter or fax to the Default Resolution Group identify - ing the student and indicating that the student's overpayment has been completely repaid. This will allow the Department to properly update its records in both the Default Resolution Group system and NSLDS. The fax number for this purpose and school use only is 903-454-2243 Note: This process cannot be performed via email. In the fax or letter, a school must include the award year of the overpayment (current award year only); student's Social Security number; student's last name, first name, and middle initial; student's date of birth; type of overpayment\u2014Federal Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, FSEOG, or TEACH Grant; and the disbursement date the institution used to create the over - payment record in NSLDS. If a student whose overpayment case has been accepted by the De - partment wishes to establish a repayment schedule, she should call the Default Resolution Group at 1-800-621-3115 . She can send an email by going to https://myeddebt.ed.gov and selecting the borrower tab > \"Con - tact Us\" (at the bottom of the page) > \"Click here\" under \"Send email .\" Responsibilities of the Default Resolution Group Upon receipt of an overpayment referral, the Department will deter - mine if enough information has been provided to start collection activity; any referral lacking information will be returned to your school to be completed. 4-86 FSA HB September 2018Chapter 3\u2014Overawards and OverpaymentsGlossary CFR DCL The Default Resolution Group will then try via letters and telephone to establish a repayment schedule or to secure payment in full. It will also update the NSLDS information that you've already reported to show that the Department now holds the overpayment. Any future SARs or ISIRs for the student will show that he or she owes an overpayment and will direct the student to contact the Default Resolution Group instead of the school. Finally, the Default Resolution Group also communicates Pell Grant overpayment referrals to the COD system. COD will then alert a school of a student's Pell Grant overpayment status if the student submits a FAFSA in the future. A student's Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant overpayment status will be tracked and reported manually.Payment in Full Anytime a school receives funds (includ - ing the application of an FSA credit bal - ance) that will satisfy an overpayment in full, the school must also update its origi - nal submission to NSLDS by changing the entry for the indicator field on the \"Over - payment Update Screen\" to \"Repaid.\" 4-87 FSA HB September 2018Information Required When Referring Student Overpayments to the Default Resolution Group Student Informatio n Parent/Spouse Informatio n Name (Last, First, MI): Telephone Number:Address: If your Pell Reporting ID is different than your Pell Attended ID, please provide both.

For information about those returns, see Volume 5 . RETURNING FUNDS There are a number of reasons why a school may have to return funds to the Department, including the return of FSA funds required when a school must correct an overaward or an overpayment, and the return of funds required when a student withdraws or otherwise ceases attendance during a payment period or period of enrollment (see Volume 5 for the latter type of returns); having FSA funds with no expectation they can be disbursed to other eligible students within three days (excess cash); owing the Department for expenditures disallowed during a program review or audit; and having earned interest in excess of $500 (see the margin) on its federal funds (other than in its Perkins account). Schools can return money to the Department as an electronic refund in G5. If a school is required to refund cash as part of a liability assessed in an audit or program review, it must follow the instructions provided by the issuing office. For questions or more information on returning funds through G5, please contact the G5 help desk (see the margin note). Returning funds by depositing them in a school account Returning funds in a timely manner is one of the factors examined by the Department in evaluating a school's financial responsibility. In addition to the general requirement for schools to return funds, the Department sets specific time frames for students who do not begin attendance and those who begin attendance but cease attendance before completing the period for which they have received Title IV funds. One way for schools to satisfy the requirement is to deposit the funds in the account in which the school keeps its federal funds.Returning FSA Funds Returning Excess Interest As noted in Chapter 1 , schools must remit any interest over $500 according to the guidance of the electronic announcement cited in the margin of page 15. G5 Help Hours: Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., EST FSA Funds, 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Returning funds by depositing them in a federal funds account For funds obtained from the Department, a school meets the return of Title IV funds requirement for a student who has withdrawn if it deposits or transfers the funds into its federal account no later than 45 days after the school determined the student withdrew or received an overpayment the school was responsible for returning. (See Volume 5 .) If a school has not drawn down federal funds or has made disbursements that exceed the amount the school has drawn, the school does not need to deposit funds in its federal account. Of course, the school's accounting records must show that school funds were used to credit the student's account. Return of Title IV funds when a school does not maintain a separate federal bank account The Department considers a school that maintains FSA funds and general operating funds in the same bank account (commingles) to satisfy the requirement that it return unearned funds on a timely basis if the school maintains subsidiary ledgers for each type of funds commingled in that account that clearly show how and when those funds were used and the subsidiary ledgers are reconciled to its general ledger, the subsidiary ledger for each FSA program provides a detailed audit trail on a student-by-student basis that reconciles to the amount of FSA program funds received and disbursed by the school, and the school updates the relevant subsidiary ledger accounts in its general ledger no later than 45 days after it determines that the student withdrew. More specifically, the return of an unearned funds transaction should be recorded as a debit to an FSA program fund subsidiary ledger account and a credit to the school's operating fund subsidiary ledger account. The date of the return is the date this transaction is posted to the school's general ledger. WHEN FUNDS ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN RETURNED The Department considers a school to have returned FSA funds when the school has deposited or transferred the funds into its federal funds account or initiated an electronic funds transfer (EFT) to the Department.Use G5 to Return Funds The Department discontinued paper check processing of Direct Loan refunds of cash on January 1, 2015, so schools must return funds electronically using G5 except in unusual circumstances or when returning funds from an audit or program review. For more on returning funds via G5, go to https://www.g5.gov or call the G5 hotline at 888-336-8930 or 202-401-6238. Returning FADL and FPRD Funds by Check If a final audit determination letter (FADL) or final program review determination (FPRD) letter requires that you return FSA funds by check, you must 1. make the check payable to the U.S. Department of Education and 2. include the following with your payment: the amount of the liability, the school's DUNS number, its 9-digit tax ID number, and review or audit control number. DCL RETURNING FUNDS FROM AN AUDIT OR PROGRAM REVIEW If, as a result of a program review or audit, a school is required to repay FSA funds, a copy of its FADL or FPRD letter is sent to the Bank Change and Receivables Group where an account receivable is established for the school. The Department will then, through its billing agent, bill the school for the disallowed expenditures, accrued interest, and penalties, if any. Payment instructions will be included with the bill. If the total liabilities owed to the Department are less than $1,000, the school is instructed to make any required adjust - ments in COD and return funds through G5. If the total liabilities owed to the Department are $1,000 or more but less than $100,000, the school returns the funds by check to a lock box in St. Louis, Missouri. Payment and/or adjustments made via G5 will not be accepted as payment of this liability. Before sending its payment, the school must make any required adjustments in COD as required by the applicable finding(s). Upon receipt of the school's payment, the Department will apply the funds to the appropriate G5 award (if necessary). If the total liabilities owed to the Department are $100,000 or more, the school returns the funds through its financial institution via electronic transfer (Fedwire). A school may not reduce amounts reported as net drawdowns on its G5 activity reports to account for expenditures disallowed as a result of an audit or program review. Any FSA funds returned for this purpose will not be credited to a school's G5 account. Unless otherwise directed by the FADL or FPRD letter, a school may not adjust its prior-year FISAPs or Federal Pell Grant/Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant processed payment information to reflect expenditures disallowed as a result of an audit or program review. Unless specifically instructed by the Department, a school should always repay funds using the appropriate function in G5. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF FSA GRANT AND DIRECT LOAN DISBURSEMENT RECORDS REQUIRED Returns of FSA grant funds (except FSEOG and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants), other than funds that are being returned to stay in compliance with the excess cash requirements, must be offset by downward reductions in students' records in COD. Likewise, all returns of Direct Loan funds must be offset by downward reductions in students' records in COD. ClarificationWhen Funds Are Considered to Have Been Returned for a Student Who Fails to Begin Attendance For a student who does not begin attendance, the deposit or transfer of funds, the EFT, or the issuance of the check must occur no later than 30 days after the date that the school became aware that a student will not begin or has not begun attendance. The Department considers a school to have returned FSA funds timely if, no later than 30 days after the date that it became aware that a student will not begin or has not begun attendance, it deposits or transfers the funds into its federal funds account, initiates an electronic funds transfer, or issues a check. A school does not satisfy this requirement if its records show the check was issued more than 30 days after the date it became aware the student would not begin or had not begun attendance or the date on the cancelled check shows that the bank used by the Department endorsed the check more than 45 days after the date the school became aware the student would not begin or had not begun attendance.4-92 FSA HB September 2018 Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL In addition, w hen all or a portion of a Direct L oan (DL) is cancelled (either because the borrower requested the cancellation within the regulatory time frame s or to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements) , the school must make the appropriate adjustment to the student records in COD. All returns of FSA grants and Direct Loan funds previously disbursed (unclaimed credit balances) should be made through G5 . RETURNING DIRECT LOAN FUNDS If a school has to return Direct Loan funds to comply with a regulatory or statutory requirement\u2014even if more than 120 days have elapsed since the disbursement date \u2014the school must return the funds to the Department through G5 following the same procedures used when making other G5 refunds/returns. All Direct Loan funds that are not disbursed to student or parent borrowers within three business days from the date that the drawdown is received (or within seven calendar days in certain circumstances) must be returned to the Department in accordance with the cash management regulations of 34 CFR 668.166. However, Direct Loan funds are not student-specific but are school-, program-, and award year-specific. This means a school can disburse the funds to other eligible students who will be receiving Direct Loans for the same award year if it can disburse the funds within the three-day limit\u2014if the school can't do that, the funds must be returned. Schools should not use drawdown adjustments in G5 to make a refund of cash. Also, refunds of cash are school-, program-, and award- year-specific and should not be netted with a drawdown from another school, program, or award year. If a school is required to refund cash as part of a liability assessed in an audit or program review, it must follow the instructions provided by the issuing office. If a school is returning cash as a result of refunds made to a borrower's account, a corresponding downward disbursement adjustment must also be reported to the COD system. For more information about making disbursement adjustments, see the November 21, 2011, electronic announcement on the IFAP website. Direct Loan disbursements, disbursement adjustments, and refunds of cash should be reported or submitted in whole dollar amounts only. Using pennies in Direct Loan processing may affect a school's ability to successfully complete monthly reconciliation because net drawdowns may not match net disbursements reported to the COD system.Returning DL Funds That Can't Be Disbursed Within Three Days A school that has drawn down more funds than it can disburse due to changes in a student's status between the drawdown and disbursement date would need to return the funds if it can't disburse them within the allowed time. However, if the school expects the student will reestablish eligibility within the allowed time, such returns would not need to be offset by reductions in the student 's record in COD . The school would only need to modify the expected disbursement date.4-93 FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 4\u2014Returning FSA FundsGlossary CFR DCL RETURNING FUNDS AFTER 240 DAYS In all cases a school will have to request permission to make a change to the FISAP after December 15 following the close of the award year. If FSA grant funds (other than FSEOG and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants) must be returned after 240 days, a school must enter the student's revised Pell Grant award in COD; return the funds to the Department through G5, if applicable; and make the appropriate change to the FISAP . Note that for Pell funds from a prior award year, a school may not use the funds for an eligible student in the current year. If FSEOG funds must be returned after 240 days, a school must enter the student's revised FSEOG award both in the individual student's account and the school's FSEOG ledger; either return the funds to the Department through G5 OR carry them forward to the next award year; and make the appropriate change to the FISAP . If Perkins Loan funds from a prior award year must be returned after 240 days, a school must reimburse its Perkins Loan fund; report those funds as income in Part III, Section A of the FISAP; and reduce the student's Perkins Loan balance and make an ac - counting entry to tie that reduction to the journal entry for the aforementioned reimbursement of its Perkins Loan fund. The school should not make any changes to the student's Perkins promissory note. If a school cannot locate a student to whom it owes FWS funds the student has earned, the federal portion must be returned to the school's FWS account. If the student comes back or the school later locates the student, the school can recover the FWS funds as long as the account for that year is still open. If the account is closed, the school must pay the student (under the wage and hour laws) using its own funds.COD School Relations Center For questions about adjusting student loan amounts, call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 or email CODSupport@ed.gov . When a School Is Holding a Credit Balance and 240 Days Have Elapsed See Chapter 2 for instructions on how a school should proceed when it is holding a Title IV credit balance and has been unable to find the student in the 240 days allowed.TIP4-94 FSA HB September 2018 Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid Funds, 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL Amending a FISAP after the close of an award year or after the December 15 correction deadline Reminder : December 15 of the year in which a school submits its FISAP is the deadline for submitting data corrections. The time between the October 1 submission deadline and the December 15 correction deadline provides schools an opportunity to review and correct their submitted FISAP data. If a school needs to amend a prior-year's FISAP or its current FISAP after the correction deadline, it must use the Change Request Process. The Change Request Process may not be used to request an increase in Campus-Based funding or increase in a school's administrative cost allowance. To submit a change request, a school logs in to COD and selects the appropriate FISAP from the FISAP Dashboard page. After the school has made the appropriate changes and saved the data, the school selects \"Submit.\" The system will prompt the school to explain what changes the school is making and why. The school then must provide the FISAP part, section number, and line number(s) on which the changes were made; the amount of the change; and a description of the conditions that require the revision (e.g., to comply with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22). After providing all of the required information, the school clicks the \"Submit Button\" and then affirms that it wants to \"Continue to Submit.\" The Campus-Based staff will evaluate the school's submission. If a school's request is denied, the Campus-Based staff will inform the school why its request was denied. If the school's request is approved, the Campus-Based staff will notify the school by sending an email to the individual on record as the school's financial aid director (in field 19) that the school's FISAP has been unlocked and that the school has five days to submit the revised working copy as the final copy. For assistance with amending a previous year's FISAP, schools should call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 .4-95 RETURNING FUNDS THROUGH G5 FOR BOTH OPEN AND CLOSED AWARDS From time to time, a school will have to return funds from a previous award year. A school that needs to return funds from a previous award year logs into G5 as it would when requesting funds or returning funds from the current award year and selects \"Payments\" from the command bar near the top of the screen. On the next page (the payments screen), under \"Refunds\" select \"Refunds Creation.\" On the \"Create Refunds\" screen, you main sections: \"Your Open Awards\" and \"Miscellaneous Awards.\" There are four award periods: 1. Performance period (59 months) 2. Liquidation period (1 month) 3. Suspension period (1 month) 4. Closeout period Awards that are in the performance, liquidation, and suspension periods will appear under \"Your Open Awards.\" When you are returning funds for an award that is open, always return the funds to the program from which the funds were drawn. For the award in question, in the column \"Refund Amount,\" enter the amount you want to return. In the next column (Bank Account) select from the drop down menu the bank account from which you want the funds drawn. When you have entered an amount for all the programs to which you wish to return funds, select \"Continue\" to navigate to the summary screen. If you believe the information on the summary screen is correct, select the \"Submit Refund Request(s) \" button to process the refund (return). If you've completed the process correctly, you'll find yourself on the confirmation screen. From the confirmation screen, copy and save your tracking number. (If a refund has not been properly processed, an error message will be displayed at the top of the summary screen and you can select the \" Previous\" button at the bottom of the screen to go back and correct your data .) Once an award year has closed (is no longer in the performance, liquidation, or suspension periods), a school will not be able to return funds to a specific program. However, a school can return funds even when a year is closed. To return funds from an award year that is closed a school uses the \"Miscellaneous Awards\" section at the bottom of the \"Create Refunds\" screen. (Note that because refunds made in the \"Miscellaneous Awards\" section are not program specific, if you have to return funds from multiple closed awards you can lump them together in one refund.)Note on Terminology Federal Student Aid uses the term \"return\" to describe the process of sending money back to the program from which the funds were drawn. G5 uses the term \"refund\" to describe that process.4-96 FSA HB September 2018 Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019Glossary CFR DCL To return funds that originated in what is now a closed award, on the \"Create Refunds\" screen, scroll down to the section headed \"Miscellaneous Awards.\" In the column \"Refund Amount,\" enter the amount you want to return. In the next column (\"Bank Account\") select from the drop down menu the account from which you want the funds drawn. In the column \"Refund Type,\" select from the drop down menu the type of refund you wish to make. For example, if you are returning a Title IV credit balance that you have discovered was never delivered to the appropriate student, you would select \"Closed Awards.\" Once you have completed your entries, select \" Continue\" to navigate to the summary screen. If you believe information on the summary screen is correct, select the \"Submit Refund Request(s)\" button to process the refund (return). If you've completed the process correctly, you'll find yourself on the confirmation screen. From the confirmation screen, copy and save your tracking number. (If a refund has not been properly processed, an error message will be displayed at the top of the summary screen and you can select the \"previous\" button at the bottom of the screen to go back and correct your data .) RETURNING FUNDS FROM FFEL LOANS PURCHASED/SERVICED BY THE DEPARTMENT The Department has purchase d many Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans from FFEL loan holders. The Department has contracted with several organizations to provide loan services on these purchased FFEL loans. If a school is required to return any portion of a FFEL Program loan that has been purchased by the Department, the money would be returned to the appropriate federal servicer for that loan. To identify the current servicer of an FSA loan, access NSLDS and select \"Aid.\" Then identify the student and select \"Loan History.\" Under \"Loan History,\" the current loan will be listed at the top. Use the field \"Servicer\" to identify the organization to which you will be returning funds. Click on the servicer name to access the NSLDS Organizational Contact List page. Additional contact information for the loan servicers is available on IFAP under the \"Help\" menu (Contact Information > Service Centers for Schools > Loan Servicing Centers for Schools \u2014the \"MORE\" button).Information required when returning loan funds to a servicer by check If a school cannot use the electronic process preferred by the loan's servicer and must return the funds with a paper check, to gether with the check for the funds the school is returning, the sc hool must include, on school letterhead , the following information: 1. The borrower's name 2. The borrower's Social Sec urity number 3. The loan's unique CommonLine ID 4. The type of loan (subsidized unsubsidized, PLUS, etc.) 5. The period for which the loan was certified 6. The scheduled and actual date of the disbursement 7. The amount of the disbursement 8. The amount being returned 9.

Reconciliation in the Pell Grant and Campus- Based Pro gramsCHAPTERC 5Glossary CFR DCL THE IMPORTANCE OF TITLE IV RECONCILIATION Reconciliation and fiduciary responsibility Except for funds received by a school for administrative expenses and for funds used for the Job Location and Development (JLD) Program, funds received by a school under the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs are held in trust for the intended student beneficiaries. As a trustee of those funds, a school must have procedures in place that ensure FSA funds are used as intended. The cash management regulations establish rules and procedures that a school must follow in requesting and managing FSA program funds. Under the cash management regulations, a school has a fiduciary responsibility to have a system in place to safeguard FSA funds, ensure FSA funds are used only for the purposes intended, act on the student's behalf to repay a student's FSA education loan debt when the school is unable to pay a credit balance di - rectly to the student, and return to the Department any FSA funds that cannot be used as intended. Failure to have such a system in place calls into question a school's administrative capability, its fiscal responsibility, and its system of internal controls. In short, it calls into question a school's qualifications to participate in the FSA programs. A key component of the system described is the process of reconciliation. Reconciliation is a process in which financial records are compared and discrepancies resolved. Conducting reconciliation frequently can help ensure that your school is properly exercising its fiduciary responsibilities to safeguard federal funds and ensure that they are used as intended.Cash management regulations 34 CFR Part 668 Subpart K 668.162 Requesting funds Financial responsibility regulations 34 CFR Part 668 Subpart L 4-99FSA HB September 2018 4-100FSA HB September Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Glossary CFR DCL Your school is required to have documented reconciliation procedures that describe who, how, and when your school will reconcile. You should review these procedures regularly to identify issues and make any necessary improvements. Your school must meet all cash management and disbursement reporting requirements. Regular reconciliation can help identify and resolve discrepancies so your school can stay in compliance. Title IV reconciliation is the process by which a school reviews and compares Title IV aid (grants, loans, and Campus-Based aid) recorded on the Department's systems (COD, G5) with the information in the school's internal records. Through reconciliation, disbursement and cash discrepancies are identified and resolved in a timely manner to ensure the school meets all regulatory requirements. Schools must document their reconciliation and retain the documentation for audits. If completed on a regular basis, reconciliation can assist schools in determining whether the disbursement reporting and excess cash deadlines are being met and also whether any additional data needs to be submitted to ensure all school data is reflected correctly in the Department's records. A school performs internal reconciliation when it compares business office records of funds requested, received, disbursed, and returned to financial aid office records of funds awarded to students. When the school compares its reconciled internal records to the Department's records of funds received and returned, and of grants or loans originated and disbursed to students at the school, it is performing external reconciliation . A school ensures that the Department's records reconcile with the school's records, both at the cumulative and individual student levels, when it performs external reconciliation. At a minimum, your school should reconcile its FSA financial records monthly. However, the more often you perform reconciliation, the more likely you will be able to identify and resolve issues before they become a bigger problem. Frequent reconciliation is an important internal control that can increase the overall integrity of the FSA programs at your school. Also, schools that have a system of identifying discrepancies between their internal records and data from Department reports will find that monthly reconciliation is easier and the year-end closeout less time consuming. Speak with your school's administrative software systems specialists about creating a program that compares COD student level data to: student Title IV award information maintained separately by the financial aid office; Title IV funds posted to each student's account; and report exceptions found during the comparison process. Internal Controls in Automated Systems Since no one person may have the ability to change data that affect both authorization and disbursement (see Volume 2, System of checks and balances ), if award entries made by the financial aid office automatically roll over and populate award fields in the business office, then the separation of functions must take place elsewhere. For example, if your system automatically awards funds based on a student's budget, then your system must ensure that only employees with a special security standing can change those budgets or otherwise modify a student's award. In addition, your system must be able to identify any employee who makes a change to a data element that can affect the level of a student's award (anyone who initiates a budget or award override) . Excess cash 34 CFR 668.166 Annual financial aid and business office reminder See the electronic announcement of November 22, 2017 , for a summary and reminder of the general requirements regarding disbursement reporting, excess cash, and reconciliation.Chapter 5\u2014Reconciliation in the Pell Grant and Campus-Based Programs4-101FSA HB September 2018 Glossary CFR DCL The following are conditions that might cause the type of discrepancies you can identify by using COD reports in your school's reconciliation process: A recipient's disbursement data appears on the school's records for an award amount less than the amount shown in the COD system. A recipient's data appears on the school's records for an award amount greater than the amount shown in the COD system. A recipient's disbursement data appears on the school's records but does not appear in the COD system. Note: The Department has reviewed the operation of schools where the schools' administrative systems generate reports whenever data in the schools' business and financial aid offices do not agree (sometimes as often as daily). The schools' directors of financial aid and business officers meet whenever the reports are generated to resolve discrepancies. We found that at these schools the annual internal closeout takes hours rather than days and that time required for reconciliation with the Depart - ment's data is equally reduced. Who is responsible for reconciliation? Each office has access to and expertise with data needed to facilitate the process. Cooperation between the business and financial aid offices is essential if reconciliation of FSA funds is to be successful. For example, the financial aid office will likely be the source of information sent to, and recipient of reports from, the COD system, while the business office is generally responsible for G5 and student accounts. Though it is possible and even advisable for financial aid and business office staff to be able to view information in each other's systems, there is no substitute for the direct involvement of professionals in each office in the reconciliation process. Reconciliation and a school's coordinating official Department regulations require that every participating school designate a capable individual to coordinate aid from the FSA programs with all other aid received by students attending the school. The coordinating official is responsible for ensuring that the school has a system for identifying and resolving discrepancies in FSA-related information no matter where it occurs at the school. Note that resolution includes determining what information is correct and correcting the inaccurate da ta. Since the resolution of discrepancies in data is the essence of reconciliation, your school's coordinating official should be part of the reconciliation process. (See Volume 2 for more information about the requirement for schools to have coordinating officials.)Coordinating official 34 CFR 668.16(b)(1)4-102FSA HB September 2018 Funds, 2018-2019 Glossary CFR DCL The Department does not specify the office in which your school's coordinating official must work. Neither do we specify the type of system your school must have to reconcile its data internally and externally. The Department does require that your school have a coordinating official and that your school performs reconciliation. (See Volume 2 for more information on the requirement to have a coordinating official and other key requirements of administrative capability.) Recommended general reconciliation practices A key factor in facilitating reconciliation is staying on top of the process. The Department encourages schools to define responsibilities of key individuals and offices; document your reconciliation procedures; build in regular communication between your business office, financial aid office, and school's technical staff; compare internal student accounts and business office/bursar records with financial aid office records and resolve any dis - crepancies; balance all subsidiary accounts to the general ledger; ensure that all drawdowns and refunds of cash are accounted for and applied to the correct program year; ensure that all batches have been sent to and accepted by the COD system, all disbursements and adjustments are accurately reflected on the COD system, and all responses are imported into the school's system; ensure that all unbooked loans are booked or inactivated (reduced to $0) for Direct Loans and TEACH; resolve all outstanding rejected records; return all refunds of cash via G5; and request any remaining funds owed to the school based on actual disbursements accepted by the COD System (Pell, DL, TEACH) or reported as expenditures on your FISAP (Campus- Based Programs).Important Reconciliation is a procedure that schools must follow in managing the FSA programs, but it is also a tool they should use to ensure they are managing those programs well. Also important is that reconciliation is a shared responsibility: the business office and the financial aid office are equally responsible for reconciliation. This responsibility involves much more than the mere sharing of reports; it requires joint action by the financial aid and business office to identify and correct discrepancies in a timely way. Contact Information For disbursement reporting, excess cash, o r reconciliation questions, call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978. You may also email CODSupport@ ed.gov . Each school is assigned a COD reconciliation coordinator who can be reached at the number above and can help answer reconciliation questions. If reconciliation issues arise that require your immediate attention, your coordinator may contact you.Chapter 5\u2014Reconciliation in the Pell Grant and Campus-Based Programs4-103FSA HB September 2018 Glossary CFR DCL Internal reconciliation Discrepancies that occur between the financial aid and business offices are usually caused by a lapse in communication. Note that these discrepancies often do not show up in a comparison of the financial aid office's records to COD, or in the comparison of drawdowns/returns between the business office and G5 payment system. For instance the financial aid office notifies the business office that the student is eligible for payment on a certain date, but the disbursement record is rejected by COD. If the financial aid of - fice doesn't tell the business office to cancel the disbursement, the business office draws down funds and makes a disburse - ment to the student that is not supported in COD or in the financial aid office's records. the business office cancels a disbursement and/or makes a refund of cash to the G5 system without informing the aid office. Thus, the original amount will still be included as a disbursement but will not be reflected in the net Cash Receipts. The first step in the reconciliation process should be to confirm that business office records of actual disbursements posted to student accounts are consistent with financial aid office records of student award and scheduled disbursement amounts. Both offices should also agree on the amount of funds that should have been drawn down from G5 to cover the funds disbursed to students. Discrepancies can be avoided by establishing daily or weekly communication touchpoints between the two offices or by scheduling a data comparison between the two office's systems. Resolving differences in internal reconciliation will lead to a smoother external reconciliation with the Department's official data. Internal reconciliation should also include steps to reconcile cash transactions such as drawdowns and refunds of cash. Your school should ensure that bank statements correctly reflect all funds drawn or returned and that this information matches the school's ledgers and other internal records. Your school should confirm that any returns of Title IV aid calculated by the financial aid office are reflected correctly in the business office student account records and that any funds not necessary for immediate use have been returned to the Department. So, you could begin the internal reconciliation process by comparing a monthly financial aid office roster of scheduled disbursements to a monthly business office cash detail report that reflects funds drawn down and funds disbursed for the month. If you discover discrepancies, you must resolve them. Reconciliation and Third-Party Servicers Your school is ultimately responsible \u2014 including when it uses a third-party servicer\u2014for meeting all regulatory requirements and seeing that reconciliation occurs on a regular basis. You should request and retain documentation of your reconciliation efforts. Also, reconciliation should include ensuring that your school's internal records match what is at the servicer as well as what is in the COD System.TIP4-104FSA HB September 2018 Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Glossary CFR DCL In addition, you should also compare business office and financial aid office records of adjustments (refunds of cash) made during the month. Often, returns of cash due to withdrawals performed by the financial aid office aren't applied by the business office. Just as often, adjustments made by the business office aren't noted in the financial aid office. Either of these omissions can cause an internal discrepancy that will affect a school's ending cash balance and should be resolved before a school begins its external reconciliation process. External reconciliation During internal reconciliation, the school will have resolved any differences between records in the financial aid office and those in the business office. In external reconciliation, a school will reconcile its records to the Department's records. Schools may perform internal and external reconciliation in any order. However, if internal reconciliation is completed first, there will be fewer discrepancies to resolve during external reconciliation. The Department offers various tools to assist you with external reconciliation, as explained in the rest of this chapter and the next one. RECONCILIATION IN THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM Although there is no regulatory requirement for reconciling your school's Pell Grant Program operations on a monthly basis, it is almost impossible to satisfy other program requirements without performing monthly reconciliation of your school's Pell Grant Program participation. For example, a school must submit Federal Pell Grant or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disbursement records no later than the deadline dates as published in the Federal Register notice (see the margin note on page 108) af ter making a Pell Grant or Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disbursement or becoming aware of the need to adjust a student's previously reported disbursement for those programs. A school's failure to submit disbursement records within the required time frame may result in an audit or program review finding. To be proactive, on a monthly basis, your school should compare the records of Pell Grant awards and scheduled disbursements to students made in the financial aid office to awards on individual student accounts in the business office; the record of disbursements in the school's Pell Grant Program ledger to the record of Pell Grants disbursed to students in the business office; the individual and program records of all adjustments (positive and negative) made during the period; andChapter 5\u2014Reconciliation in the Pell September 2018 Glossary CFR DCL on an individual and program basis, the record of Pell Grants disbursed to students in COD to the records of Pell Grant disbursements in the business office. Monthly reconciliation for the Pell Grant Program should include verifying that individually and cumulatively records of student awards and pending disbursements calculat - ed and maintained by the financial aid office match the records of pending disbursement data received or maintained by the business office; business office records of actual disbursements posted to stu - dent accounts are consistent with financial aid office records of student eligibility and applicable award and disbursement amounts; records of disbursements in the general ledger match those in subsidiary ledgers (e.g. student ledgers and accounts); the actual disbursements posted to students' accounts internally match the actual disbursements accepted in the COD system (including any adjustments to actual disbursements); cumulative school and COD records of Pell Grant disburse - ments match net draws (drawdowns minus refunds of cash) in G5 for the award year in the Pell Grant Program; any remaining excess cash balances have been returned to the Department per cash management regulations; and all reconciliation efforts have been documented for future ref - erence, and all identified balance issues have been resolved in a timely manner. Reconciling school-level data Whether you maintain your records electronically or on paper, comparing the records of Pell Grant awards made to students by the financial aid office to the records of Pell Grant disbursements recorded in individual student accounts is not a complex task. If awards recorded by the financial aid office automatically populate the business office records, the data should always agree. If your school's processes are automated, your systems staff can create a program that compares the relevant data elements and generates an exception report that identifies discrepancies between business office and financial aid office data. Reconciliation of school level data functions is an internal control check mechanism. By reviewing the exception report on a daily basis, the bursar ensures that the school's internal records agree and he or she also confirms that the school's system for communicating data between offices is functioning correctly.Pell Grant Reconciliation Defined Pell Grant reconciliation is when a school reviews and compares Pell Grant data in its internal records with information in the Department's systems. This should occur regularly and is recommended at least monthly. Internal Reconciliation This is the reconciliation of disbursement transactions (actual disbursements and adjustments) and related cash transactions (drawdowns, drawdown adjustments, refunds of cash, and returns) between business office records and the financial aid system. The school should document any discrepancies and resolve them in a timely manner. External Reconciliation This is the reconciliation of internal disbursement and cash balances from the business office and financial aid office with disbursement and cash balances from the COD system. At a minimum this reconciliation should be completed monthly to ensure that data is correct in all systems and that cash management and disbursement reporting timelines are being met. If the school completes internal reconciliation first, there will be fewer discrepancies to resolve in external reconciliation. The Department offers various tools to assist schools with external reconciliation.4-106FSA HB September 2018 Volume 4\u2014Processing Glossary CFR DCL Reconciling school-level data with COD Pell Grant data Your school should reconcile all cash (drawdowns and refunds of cash) and disbursement records (actual disbursements and adjustments) with information in COD on an ongoing basis (external reconciliation). This will greatly minimize the number of post deadline adjustments and help identify and resolve issues as they arise. There are many tools specific to the Pell Grant program to help you with reconciliation. In reconciling school-level Pell Grant records of individual student awards with individual student records in COD, you can use the following tools: Pell Grant school account statement (SAS) and SAS disburse - ment detail on demand The COD system produces monthly the Pell Grant SAS, which is similar to a bank statement and summarizes processing ac - tivity (both cash and disbursement data) for that month and/ or year-to-date (YTD). It can be used as a reconciliation tool to compare to financial aid and business office records. Schools may also request Pell Grant SAS disbursement detail on demand files through the new report requests page on the COD website. This report contains disbursement level detail for schools to use for interim reconciliation as needed. Pell Grant reconciliation report The Pell Grant reconciliation report is a one-record student sum - mary of processed records and can be helpful to your school as it completes both the year-end and ongoing reconciliation pro - cesses. This report can be downloaded, printed, or imported into a spreadsheet for comparison with your school's data. This report provides the total YTD disbursement amount per student as it is in COD. Pell Grant electronic statement of account (ESOA) The ESOA summarizes the status of a school's current funding level (CFL) versus the net drawdown for that award year. In ad - dition, the ESOA provides (for the current processing day only) the YTD unduplicated recipient count, the YTD total accepted and posted disbursements, the YTD total ACA paid to schools, and the net drawdown payments in G5 up to the current pro - cessing day. That is, it provides the sum of school initiated draw - downs, direct payments for obligate/pay accounts, adjustments (+/-) less refunds, and returns. Resources The COD School Relations staff at 1-800-848-0978 and CODSupport@ed.gov is available to help users within COD reports in the reconciliation process.TIP COD reports The COD Technical Reference, Volume VI, Section 8\u2014Reports can be found at https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/publications.jsp .

This \"list by student\" reports anticipated dis - bursements received and accepted, but not yet made, in a school's Pell Grant Program. Pell Grant YTD record A Pell Grant YTD record can be requested for an individual stu - dent or for all Pell Grant recipients at your school. A YTD record contains more detailed award and disbursement data than the Pell Grant Reconciliation Report. It contains information at the individual transaction level and can be used to replace a cor - rupt database or to reconcile records with accepted data on COD. The YTD record shows the award information that COD is using for each student. You can view each disbursement as well as the total disbursed to a student for the year. The YTD sum - mary shows the total number of recipients at your school, the number of awards, and the disbursements accepted, rejected, or corrected. The details in a YTD record can help you resolve dis - crepancies between school and COD data. You can also use the following COD website screens: Funding Information screen and school funding history report The Funding Information screen shows totals such as current funding level, available balance, net drawdowns, net accepted and posted disbursements and cash > net accepted and posted disbursements. These totals can be used to compare against your internal totals from both your business office and financial aid office. If discrepancies are found, the detail should be com - pared and any discrepancies resolved. Schools can access the school funding history report through a link at the bottom of the funding information screen. This re - port displays year-to-date funding authorization (current fund - ing level or CFL) information for the selected school, program type, and award year. This report also contains a history of cash activity transactions for the school. Cash Activity screen The cash activity screen shows all individual drawdown, refund of cash, and drawdown adjustment transactions received in COD from G5. This information can be used to reconcile to internal bank statements and cash transactions.4-108FSA HB September 2018 Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Glossary CFR DCL Completing Final Reconciliation If a school is meeting all disbursement/ adjustment reporting, excess cash, and reconciliation requirements, final reconciliation should begin no later than the last award or payment period end date for a given program and year. A school should be able to reconcile to a zero ending cash balance soon after its final disbursements and should not carry an ending cash balance (positive or negative) for an extended period . Schools can close out via the COD School Balance Confirmation page when they have a zero ending cash balance or are within the established tolerance and have $0 in total net unbooked disbursements. Additional Information For more information on Pell Grant reconciliation, call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 or email CODSupport@ed.gov . Anticipated Disbursement Queue This page allows schools to search\u2014by award year, program, disbursement date range, and SSN\u2014and view anticipated dis - bursements currently on file in the COD system. They can select up to 100 records at a time and submit them as actual disbursements and can also export the anticipated disburse - ment list. Schools will no longer use the action queue to release pending disbursements, but it will still be on the COD website. Final reconciliation of a Pell Grant award year In addition to regular monthly reconciliation of Pell Grant data, a final reconciliation should be performed as soon as possible after final scheduled disbursements have been made for the award year. This final reconciliation should ensure that all data are correct and that total net drawdowns equal net accepted and posted disbursements (NAPD) in the COD System (cash > NAPD balances should equal $0). This process must be performed within the applicable data submission deadline defined below, as well as immediately following processing of any additional data by the school (for example, returns of unclaimed credit balance checks, eligible late disbursements, or disbursement adjustments made within regulatory time frames but which occur after the data submission deadline). There are two deadlines which impact this process. Data submission deadline Schools must finalize reconciliation of cash and reporting of Pell Grant and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant disbursements and disbursement adjustments by the data submission deadline, which is published annually in the Federal Register and is the last business day of September following the official end of the award year (e.g., for 2018-2019, the deadline will be September 30, 2019). After this date the COD system will not accept upward awards or disbursement adjustments without approval for extended processing (downward adjustments will continue to be accepted). Your school can request an extension to the data submission deadline via the COD website on the Request Reopen/ Extended Processing page. Funding cancellation deadline Pell Grants and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are completely closed and funding is cancelled (no longer available) five years after the award year on the last business day of September (e.g., for 2018-2019, funding will be cancelled on September 30, 2024) . After that time, schools will be unable to draw down or adjust funds via G5 (although refunds of cash will still be accepted), and the COD System will be completely closed to any further award or disbursement processing for that award year. Schools must complete all final reconciliation activities well before this final deadline, in accord with disbursement reporting timelines and the data submission deadline. After the five-year period, funds m ust be returned directly to the Treasury. If you need help returning funds after the five-year closing date, call G5 customer service at 1-888-336-8930 .Deadline Dates The data submission and funding cancellation deadline dates appear in the same Federal Register notice mentioned earlier in the chapter. For 2017-2018 that was Federal Register Volume 82, Number 122, June 27, 2017.Chapter 5\u2014Reconciliation in the Pell Campus-Based Programs4-109FSA HB September 2018 Glossary CFR DCL RECONCILIATION, RECORDS, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE CAMPUS-BASED PROGRAMS A school is required to reconcile its Campus-Based program and financial records at least monthly . In addition, you perform annual reconciliation of your school's annual participation in the Campus-Based programs when you complete the Fiscal Operations Report (FISOP). The FISOP is parts III, IV, V, and VI of the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP). Note: If you participated in any Campus-Based programs in an award year, you must report on your activities for those pro - grams by completing the appropriate portions of the FISAP by the following October. Your school must reconcile, at least monthly, your Campus-Based draws recorded in G5 to the funds received in the bank account your school has designated to receive electronic transfers and account for any discrepancies. In addition, your school must have a system that, on at least a monthly basis, reconciles your drawdowns for the award year in the individual Campus-Based Programs plus any funds provided by your school or received from other sources to the amounts expended in the three programs. Reconciliation and the Federal Perkins Loan Program Your school must have a system that, on at least a monthly basis, reconciles and accounts for any discrepancies in cash on hand in your Perkins fund at the start of the period; federal funds received and deposited in your Perkins fund dur - ing the period (in years when there was a Federal Capital Con - tribution); school funds deposited in the Perkins fund during the period; payments of principal, interest, late charges, and collection charges received during the period; other additions to the Perkins fund during the period, to loans made to students during the period; expenses paid from the fund during the period (permissible collection costs not paid by the borrower); accounts on which incorrect information is recorded in NSLDS; and cash on hand in the fund at the end of the period.Monthly Reconciliation Required A school is required to reconcile its Campus-Based records no less frequently than once a month. Schools may be required to provide records of their monthly reconciliations during the required annual audit or during a program review. Perkins 34 CFR Funds, 2018-2019 Glossary CFR DCL Reconciliation and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Program Your school must have a system that at least monthly reconciles and accounts for any discrepancies between FSEOG awards made to students during the period plus the administrative cost allowance (ACA) and any 1. federal funds drawn down during the period for FSEOG awards, plus 2. funds transferred (or carried in) from the other Campus-Based Programs during the period, plus 3. any nonfederal funds ( both institutional and noninstitutional) made available for grants to students during the period, plus 4. any other resources designated as FSEOG awards to students. Reconciliation and the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program Your school should reconcile monthly the amount drawn down and received to the amounts disbursed to students or returned to the Department, and explain all discrepancies. Your school must have a system that, on at least a monthly basis, reconciles the federal funds drawn down during the period for FWS awards, plus funds transferred (or carried) in from the other Campus- Based programs during the period, plus any nonfederal (both institutional and noninstitutional) funds made available for FWS payments to students during the period to FWS funds paid to students during the period, plus ACA, plus job location and development ex penditures, and accounts for any discrepancies. In addition, you should examine your FWS program and fiscal records at the start of the award year and monthly thereafter. The following questions might help you develop procedures that will enhance the effectiveness of reconciliation and your FWS program generally: Do you have a method for verifying that a student's rate of pay in your payroll system matches the rate of pay on which the award was calculated, and if the rate assigned to the position and the experience level of the student matches the levels re - quired by the school's policies and procedures? Do you have a system that records the maximum a student may earn in FWS wages and alerts you if a student approaches that amount? Do you periodically evaluate your rate of expenditures to de - termine if you are spending funds at the same rate, if you are spending less, or if you are spending more than the amount you budgeted for FWS expenditures?Chapter 5\u2014Reconciliation in the Pell September 2018 Glossary CFR DCL Are your matching funds consistently deposited at the same time you received your federal share? In the FWS Program, your requests for funds should always be for a payroll for which data has been entered. The only time your need for funds should be greater or less than your draw is when anticipated payments from an off-campus employer are early or late. Excepting those occasions, do you often find yourself re - questing additional funds or returning unused funds? Do you have a process in place to ensure that students are actu - ally working the hours reported\u2014that timesheets are accurate? Do you frequently audit payrolls to test whether hours record - ed in the payroll system match the hours reported on student timesheets? Do you reconcile the expenditure of funds in the community service part or your FWS program to the reports submitted by employers? CONTACT INFORMATION FOR RECONCILIATION For disbursement reporting, excess cash, or reconciliation questions about the Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, FWS, FSEOG, Perkins Loan, or Direct Loan programs, call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 or e-mail CODSupport@ed.gov .4-112FSA HB September 2018 the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL OVERVIEW OF DIRECT LOAN RECONCILIATION A school that participates in the Direct Loan Program is required monthly to reconcile cash (funds it received from the G5 system to pay its students) with disbursements (actual disbursement records) it submitted to the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system. Direct Loan schools are also required to complete a year-end closeout or final reconciliation of their Direct Loan (DL) accounts. This should be done as soon as possible after the end of the schools' latest award period (loan period) end date but no later than the program year closeout date. Note: Exceptions to the last processing day of the program year may be made on a case-by-case basis if a school's processing period extends past the closeout deadline. Schools in this category should contact the COD School Relations Center for further help. Once the closeout deadline has passed, requests may be made directly via the COD website. As a reminder, all cash management, disbursement reporting, and monthly reconciliation regulatory requirements supersede the closeout deadline so a school should be able to reconcile to a zero ending cash balance and close out soon after its final disbursements. Your school should not wait until the closeout deadline. The Direct Loan Program year closeout date is the last processing day of July in the year following the award year, which for 2018-2019 will be Friday, July 31, 2020. The starting point for reconciliation is the ending cash balance (ECB) on the School Account Statement (SAS) that COD sends to the school each month. The SAS is the Department's official record of your school's cash and disbursement transactions. The ECB is simply the difference between the net drawdowns/payments your school has received from the G5 payment system and the actual disbursement information you've reported to COD (and COD has accepted) for individual students and parents (known as total net booked disbursements). Ideally, the net drawdown/payments your school has received in the past month will be fully substantiated by the total net disbursements your Regulations 34 CFR 685.300(b)(5) Direct Loan monthly reconciliation required 34 CFR 668.162 Requesting funds 34 CFR 668.166 Excess cash Ending cash balance = beginning cash balance + net drawdowns/payments - total net booked disbursements Net drawdowns/payments = cash receipts (drawdowns + drawdown adjustments + returns) - refunds of cash (refunds) Total net booked disbursements = booked disbursements + booked adjustments (upward or downward) 4-113 FSA HB 2018Glossary CFR DCL school has reported (including any subsequent adjustments). Therefore, your school's monthly ECB should be as close to zero as possible keeping timing variances in mind. When the ECB for a month is greater or less than zero, you must be able to account for any differences between the net totals for booked disbursements and drawdowns/payments. The SAS provides you with the information that the Department has recorded for your actual disbursements to students and cash transactions (payments/drawdowns). You can use this information as a starting point in identifying the underlying reasons for the ECB. Sometimes the difference between total net booked disbursements and net drawdowns/payments is just a matter of end-of-month timing\u2014 funds were delivered to the school's account at the end of one month and the disbursements were reported to COD at the beginning of the next month (or vice versa). If there are legitimate reasons for a positive or negative ECB from month to month, you may not need to correct or update any of the information your school has provided to the COD or G5 systems. Just document the reasons for the differences and you are done reconciling for that month. During your review, you may also find omissions or errors in your school's transactions with COD and G5. For instance, you may find that some disbursement data for your students was submitted to, but not accepted by, COD or that G5 transactions were entered for the wrong award year. In these cases, you will need to resubmit corrected disbursement records to COD or correct earlier transactions on the G5 system. Ensuring that your school records match exactly to the data in COD is an example of external reconciliation. It is also possible that the discrepancy results from inconsistencies between the information in the school's financial aid system and the information kept by its business office\u2014these will need to be resolved by comparing and correcting your school's records. This is an example of internal reconciliation . To have a common set of figures to reconcile against COD, schools should complete an internal reconciliation before beginning the require d external monthly reconciliation. Who is responsible for Direct Loan reconciliation? As noted in Chapter 5, reconciliation is a team effort by the business and financial aid offices. Since both have information that is needed to reconcile, cooperation between them is essential for successful reconciliation of DL funds. For example, the financial aid office will likely have the information sent to and reports received from COD, while the business office is generally responsible for G5 and student accounts. It is possible and even advisable for financial aid and business office staff to be able to view information in each other's systems, but there is no substitute for the direct involvement of each office in reconciliation.Booked vs. Unbooked Disbursements For a disbursement to be considered booked, it must consist of the following three components. 1. It must be a part of an accepted loan origination record (as submitted to COD by the school); 2. It must have an accepted master promissory note associated with it (linked MPN); and 3. It must be reflected as an actual disbursement in COD (the disbursement release indicator = \"True\" and the date of disbursement must have occurred). Once these three things occur, the loan is booked and sent to the loan servicer assigned to the borrower, and the student is liable in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in the master promissory note. Unbooked disbursements include any future-dated transactions with disbursement dates falling after the end of the report.4-115FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL Reconciling ED and School Records The SAS (sent by COD) includes both disbursement data and cash transactions from COD. This ED system data must be reconciled with data in the school's financial aid and business offices. Exchange data on students and parents who are eligible to be paid; payments cancelled and funds returned. Student & parent loan disbursement data reported to COD Sources of Discrepancies Timing issues\u2014funds are drawn down and disbursed in a different month from the month student/parent records are sent to COD. Drawdowns, drawdown adjustments, or refunds of cash made in the wrong award year. Disbursement batches not yet sent to COD (or sent to COD but not acknowledged). Rejected disbursements/adjustment to disbursement records that have not been resolved. Disbursements reported to COD but unbooked because of future disbursement date. Downward disbursement adjustments made and accepted in COD but funds are not returned or used for other eligible borrowers within regulatory time frames or vice versa. Disbursements reported to COD by the aid office but not reported by the aid office to the business office for payment. Disbursements made by the business office but not supported by disbursement records in the financial aid office system and COD ( would show up in internal reconciliation ).Funds drawn down from (or returned to) G5 payment systemVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid 2018Glossary CFR DCL TYPES OF DIRECT LOAN RECONCILIATION As explained in Chapter 5, there are two types of reconciliation, which can be performed separately or simultaneously during the month. Internal reconciliation for Direct Loans Internal reconciliation is the process where the business and financial aid offices compare their Direct Loan records to ensure that they match, both in disbursement date and disbursement amount. The frequency and methods used for internal reconciliation are based on school decision and need but should occur at least monthly and for Direct Loans before the required monthly reconciliation to the Direct Loan SAS. The business office should review its Direct Loan account bank statement to ensure that funds drawn and returned are in the appropriate year. In addition the business office will need to regularly monitor the account to comply with cash management regulations, i.e., making sure that funds are drawn for immediate need and any funds that cannot be used within cash management guidelines are returned. To be in compliance with reporting disbursements and disbursement adjustments within 15 days, the business and financial aid offices will need to communicate frequently, making sure that their systems are in sync. It is very important that the date funds are credited to a student's account in the institution's general ledger or any subledger of the general ledger, or paid to a student directly is the disbursement date the financial aid office reports to COD. This date is reported to the Direct Loan servicers and is the time when interest begins to accrue on the loan funds. Discrepancies that occur between the financial aid and business offices are usually caused by a lapse in communication, and they often do not show up in a comparison of the financial aid office's records with COD or in a comparison of drawdowns/returns between the business office and the G5 payment system. For example: The financial aid office notifies the business office that the student is eligible for payment on a certain date, but the dis - bursement record is rejected by COD. If the financial aid office doesn't tell the business office to cancel the disbursement, the business office draws down funds and makes a disbursement to the student that is not supported in COD or in the financial aid office's records. The business office cancels a disbursement and/or makes a refund of cash to the G5 system without informing the aid of - fice. Thus, the original amount will still be included in the net booked disbursements on the SAS but will not be reflected in the net cash receipts. Discrepancies can be avoided by a daily or weekly communication between the two offices or by scheduling a data comparison between the Possible Sources of Discrepancies Between Financial Aid and Business Office Records The aid office calculates a return of Title IV aid (R2T4) but doesn't notify the business office. The aid office schedules a disburse - ment with the business office but does not create an \"actual disburse - ment\" record to send to COD. (Or the \"actual disbursement\" record sent by the aid office is rejected by COD.) The business office cancels a dis - bursement but does not inform the financial aid office. The business office makes a refund of cash to the G5 system but does not inform the aid office.4-117FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL two office systems. Resolving differences in internal reconciliation will lead to a smoother external reconciliation with the Department's official data as reflected in the SAS. External reconciliation During internal reconciliation the school resolves any differences between records in the financial aid office and those in the business office. In external reconciliation a school reconciles its records to the Department's: the school compares its reconciled internal records to the Department's records of funds received and returned and loans originated and disbursed to students at the school. At a minimum, this reconciliation must be completed at least monthly to ensure that data is correct in all systems and that cash management and disbursement reporting timelines are being met. Schools may perform internal and external reconciliation in any order, but when internal reconciliation is completed first, there will be fewer discrepancies to resolve during external reconciliation. The Department offers various tools to help with external reconciliation that will be reviewed later in this chapter. Documenting monthly reconciliation A school has completed its monthly reconciliation when all differences between the Direct Loan SAS and the school's internal records (Direct Loan system , financial aid office, and business office system) have been resolved or documented and the school's ending cash balance is zero. Schools should clearly outline their method of documentation in both business office and financial aid office procedures.Discrepancies Between the Financial Aid and Business Offices Financial Aid Office Actual Disbursement = 0COD Actual Disbursement = 0 Business Office Disbursement = $1,739G5 Funds drawn = $1,739Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid 2018Glossary CFR DCL The Department does not mandate or prescribe any particular method of documentation, which allows your school to determine the type and method that best suits your internal processes. Your school must maintain documented results of its monthly reconciliation to provide to auditors and reviewers at their request but does not need to send any proof of this reconciliation to the Department. Each month you should Identify any discrepancies due to timing and track them to make sure that the missing transactions appear in the next month's SAS. Identify any discrepancies due to misreporting or internal mis - communication and take necessary corrective actions to ensure they will not recur in the following month. Document all reconciliation efforts, including any reasons for an ending cash balance, for future reference. TOOLS AND REPORTS FOR DIRECT LOAN RECONCILIATION The Department provides several tools to assist your school in completing its Direct Loan reconciliation responsibilities. Among them are COD reports, report readers, COD webpages, and Direct Loan tools. COD reports and webpages COD provides a variety of reports and webpages (available at https://cod.ed.gov /) to help you in your Direct Loan reconciliation. Detailed information including message classes, record layouts, and delivery methods for all Direct Loan reports can be found in the COD Technical Reference, Volume VI, Section 8. COD reports Highlighted here are a few reports and COD web screens useful to reconciliation: School account statement (SAS)\u2014 The Department issues an award-year specific school account statement (SAS), similar to a bank statement, on a monthly basis to schools participating in the Direct Loan Program. The SAS contains the Depart - ment's official ending cash balance for the school and award year, as well as a record of all detailed transactions (cash and actual disbursement data) processed in the COD System dur - ing the reported period. Y our school can use the summary and detail-level information contained in the SAS to reconcile to its internal records. More information on the SAS can be found later in this chapter and in the COD Technical Reference .Key Components of Monthly Reconciliation All discrepancies have been identified, resolved, and documented. Timing issues are tracked for reconcilia - tion in next month's SAS. Historical records of issues are kept for later review or to update new or return - ing staff members.4-119FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL SAS disbursement detail on demand\u2014ad-hoc report that allows schools to get SAS disbursement detail data independent of the school's monthly SAS file. This re - port can be requested via the new report request page on the COD website. SAS disbursement detail on demand report reader and instructions\u2014formats the fixed length SAS disburse - ment detail on demand report into an Excel spread - sheet. Found under the COD resources link at the bottom of any COD website page. Pending Disbursement Listing \u2014This report provides a list of all pending disbursements reported by your school and can help you to identify future funding needs, identify pending Steps in Monthly Reconciliation Reconcile with SAS data from ED Upon receiving the monthly SAS, first compare the cash summary information to your internal records. If the subtotals and ECB match or any discrepancies can be explained and documented , you are done. If not, then proceed to the next step of comparing SAS cash detail with student account records in the business office (or elsewhere) . Look for End-of-month submissions that were processed by COD in the next month Cash transactions attributed to wrong award year Funds drawn down from one award year but \"recycled\" to make disbursements for loans in a different award year Compare SAS loan/disbursement detail with financial aid office records. (The \"Loan Compare\" function in DL Tools can be used to import school data and compare it to the SAS loan disbursement detail.) Look for Disbursement batches not yet sent to COD (or sent to COD but not acknowledged) Rejected disbursements that have not been resolved Disbursements reported to COD but unbooked because of future disbursement date Remember, you must document reasons for any discrepancies in your ECB.Monthly Reconciliation Process Compare financial aid office records with business office disbursements. Look for: Refunds of cash made by the business office to G5 but not recorded in the financial aid office system Disbursements made by the business office but not recorded in the financial aid office system or not sent to COD and accepted Instances when the financial aid office calculated a return of aid and reported a downward adjustment to COD, but the information was not recorded in the business office system and the funds were not returned to G5Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR DCL disbursements that should be reported as actual, and identify awards or disbursements that need to be made deactivated (re - duced to zero). Direct Loan Actual Disbursement List \u2014This weekly report dis - plays actual disbursements from the previous Saturday (seven days before the report generation date) through the following Friday (one day before the report generation date). Actual dis - bursements appear on the report based on their post date, indi - cating when each actual disbursement or adjustment is posted on the COD System. The report includes booked, unbooked, and future dated actual disbursements and adjustments, pro - vided they are created within the reporting period. COD webpages School Summary Information \u2014Provides an overview of your school's current funding level (CFL) as well as cash greater than accepted and posted disbursements over 30 days. It is a great tool to use every time you log into COD to confirm that your school is reporting disbursements in a timely manner to substantiate the funds drawn. School Funding Information and School Funding History Re - port\u2014Lists your school's current available balance, net draw - downs, net accepted and posted disbursements, and cash > net accepted and posted disbursement balances as well as last CFL changes. We recommend that schools make reviewing the bal - ances for each program and award year on this page a regular part of their processes. Schools can access the school funding history report through a link at the bottom of the school funding information screen. This report displays year-to-date funding authorization (cur - rent funding level or CFL) information for the selected school, program type, and award year. This report also contains a his - tory of cash activity transactions for the school. School Summary Financial Information\u2014 Provides close to real time balance information for your school, formatted similarly to the year-to-date cash summary section of the SAS. Cash Activity \u2014Provides up-to-date drawdown and refund of cash detail activity for your school as well as days remaining for on-time reporting. This information is sent to the COD System from G5, and can be used to reconcile to internal bank statements and cash transactions. Anticipated Disbursement Queue \u2014As mentioned in the last chapter, the anticipated disbursement queue page on the COD website allows schools to view anticipated disbursements cur - rently on file in COD and to search by award year, program, disbursement date range, and SSN. They can select up to 100 records at a time and submit them as actual disbursements For more information on COD reports, refer to the latest COD Technical Reference , Volume VI, Section 8, available at https:// fsadownload.ed.gov . For more information on COD web screens, refer to the COD website help text or download the free COD computer- based training from ifap.ed.gov under \"Tools for Schools.\" COD Report Readers The Department provides three report readers that offer a simplified way of importing the COD report files into an Excel spreadsheet. A school that does not already have a process for using these reports to regularly reconcile its Pell Grant and Direct Loan data should consider downloading the readers for this purpose. Note that to use the readers, a school must receive the fixed- length format of the reports. There are readers for the following reports: Pell Grant reconciliation file Pell Grant YTD file SAS disbursement detail on demand file The readers, with instructions on how to use them, are on the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov/cod/LoginPage under the COD Resources link. If you have questions about the readers or need help using them, call the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 or email CODSupport@ ed.gov .TIP4-121FSA HB September in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL and can also export the anticipated disbursement list. The ac - tion queue is no longer used to release pending disbursements though it can still be viewed on the COD website. Direct Loan Tools The Direct Loan Tools software application is designed to work with your own mainframe or middle-range application, or hand-in-hand with EDExpress, to ensure that your Direct Loan records reconcile with the COD system. With a few simple keystrokes you can compare the SAS file you receive monthly from the COD System with your own database to identify discrepancies that need to be addressed. Direct Loan (DL) Tools for Windows is a supplemental software product for Direct Loan participants. You can download software and related user documentation from the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid Download (FSAdownload) website located at https:// fsadownload.ed.gov . You can use DL Tools during your reconciliation process to print the SAS in a readable format; track cash receipts (drawdowns) and refunds of cash; and compare the SAS to loans and actual disbursements recorded in either EDExpress or an external file (your school's system), and/or compare the SAS to the DL Tools Cash database (records of receipts and refunds of cash). Reports available to schools using DL Tools include SAS cash summary SAS cash detail SAS loan and disbursement detail Internal ending cash balance report Cash detail comparison Loan detail comparison Disbursement detail comparison Disbursement measurement toolUsing DL Tools for Reconciliation Many schools have found that DL Tools software helps them in the reconciliation process, even if they are not using EDExpress. DL Tools can be used to import and format information from the SAS and can produce formatted reports for Cash summary SAS cash detail SAS loan and disbursement detail In addition, DL Tools can be used to compare the information from the SAS to the school's data. We'll talk more about these features under cash detail and loan disbursement detail. DL Tools runs on Windows-based PCs and can be downloaded free at https:// fsadownload.ed.gov . NOTE: Comparison reports are designed to be run using the SAS reports with YTD detail, not monthly detail. You can change your report options (YTD detail, for example) by accessing the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov (see the section in this document titled, \"School Account Statement Options\"). Note that fixed-length formatting is required in \"Compare. \" We find that schools that have changed their preference to, for instance, comma-delimited, don't realize that formats other than fixed length won't work for compare reports. For more information on the DL Tools software, refer to the COD Technical Reference, Volume IV . There is also training available on IFAP: click on Tools for Schools > COD Computer-Based Training and EDExpress Online Training .Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid 4-122FSA HB September 2018Glossary CFR DCL THE SCHOOL ACCOUNT STATEMENT The school account statement (SAS) is similar to a bank statement and gives the Department's official cash balance as of the end date of the reported period, based on data submitted by the school. It also gives detailed cash and loan or disbursement transactions for that reported period. The SAS is the primary tool for reconciliation and program year closeout. Your school is required monthly to reconcile the information on the SAS to its internal records. If more frequent reconciliation is needed, you can also request a SAS disbursement detail on demand report on an as-needed basis. More information on the content and formats available for the SAS is in the COD Technical Reference, Volume VI, Section 8 . Each month COD sends the SAS to your SAIG Mailbox. This report is generated by COD during the first full weekend (Saturday and Sunday) of the month with data through the end of the previous month (for example, the first weekend in September, COD generates a report for August and sends it to your school). The SAS reflects all cash transactions performed in G5 as reported to COD and all loan and disbursement detail reported by your school and accepted in COD. Note that your school will receive a separate SAS for each award year that it participates in Direct Loans until that award year is closed out as directed by ED and you have completed processing. Since schools often have multiple award years open at the same time, they may receive more than one SAS for a month. To successfully close out your Direct Loan account at the end of an award year, you must have an ECB of zero and total net unbooked disbursements of zero, as reflected on the SAS. The SAS is broken down into the following four sections: Cash summary Disbursement summary (by loan type) Cash detail report Loan or disbursement detail report Cash summary This section of the SAS provides the Department's official ECB for the school for the reported period. The ECB is the difference between net drawdown of cash and net booked disbursements. The cash summary contains both a monthly and a year-to-date summary of cash and loan data processed at COD for that program year. This section can be compared to summary information on the school's internal systems. The comparison may then identify areas where further research is needed. DL Tools for Cash Management You can use the \"Cash Management\" feature in DL Tools to keep a record of cash receipts (drawdowns) and refunds of cash for Direct Loans. However, if you use this feature, you must take care to ensure that EVERY transaction is recorded in the cash management tool. Thus, if your business office tracks transactions in other software, you may want to rely on that software to record cash transactions, rather than making duplicate entries. If you are using the cash management feature of DL Tools, you can also run the following reports for all program years: Internal ending cash balance report Cash detail comparison .Using DL Tools to Evaluate Y our Average Processing Time If your school uses EDExpress, you can use the disbursement measurement tool in DL Tools to calculate the average time from actual dis - bursement date to sending the actual disbursements in a batch to COD and the average time from actual dis - bursement date to booking the loan. These average times can be compared to the recommended tolerances you have established as your quality control standard.4-123FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL Ultimately, if a school's net drawdowns/payments are equal to its total net booked disbursements, its ECB will equal zero. Disbursement summary by loan type The disbursement summary by loan type section of the SAS provides monthly and YTD summary information by loan type for the reported period. It can be used to monitor loan volume at the summary level. Cash detail The cash detail section of the SAS provides detail on cash transactions processed in COD during the reported period. This includes drawdowns, drawdown adjustments, or refunds of cash. If the monthly option is chosen, this section will only include cash transactions processed in COD during that month. If the YTD option is chosen, the section will include cash transactions processed at COD from the start of the program year through the end date of the report. If you choose the monthly option, t his section will not include any cash transactions requested or sent during t he month, but not processed on COD until after the last day of that month. Loan Detail/Loan Disbursement Activity Level The \"Loan Detail/Loan Disbursement Activity Level\" section of the SAS contains loan detail transactions at either the loan level or the individual disbursement transaction level, depending on school options. If loan detail is requested at the loan level, the SAS will contain one record per loan, with YTD disbursement information. If loan detail is requested at the disbursement activity level, the SAS will contain all actual disbursement and disbursement adjustment activity that occurred during the preceding month or year-to-date (depending on the options selected by the school) as reported by the school and accepted by COD. This portion of the report is helpful because it allows schools to match individual (student by student) COD accepted disbursements and adjustments against the individual disbursements and adjustments reflected in the school's financial aid system. By identifying discrepancies between disbursements in COD and your financial aid system, you will be able to resolve the differences. In the following sections, we'll explain how to compare the summary and detail reports to your school data to identify any underlying discrepancies that may be affecting the ECB.Using the SAS Three sections of the school account statement (SAS) are particularly useful for purposes of reconciliation: cash summary g compare to summary school data in both business office and financial aid system cash detail g compare to business office records loan disbursement detail g compare to financial aid system Setting Options for the Format and Content of the SAS Schools can set their SAS format and content options on the COD website by selecting School > Report Selection > Modify SAS Options. SAS format choices are fixed-length (the default), comma-delimited without headers, comma-delimited with headers, or pipe-delimited. If you plan to use DL Tools to format your report and/or run a comparison to school records, you must select fixed-length format. If you plan to open your SAS in Excel, you should select comma-delimited without headers for a data-only report, or comma-delimited with headers for a more formatted report. Note that the YTD report is needed to run the comparison. SAS content options include: names of borrowers monthly or YTD or both for cash and loan detail (if you choose both, you will receive two separate reports but both have the same message class) disbursement summary by loan type disbursement detail or loan-level detail (YTD) or both. You will always receive both YTD and monthly data on your cash summary regardless of which options you choose. Go to https:// fsadownload.ed.gov and see the COD Technical Reference, Volume VI, Section 8 for more information on available SAS options.TIPVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR the SASSchool Receives SAS Compare SummaryCompare Cash Detail Compare Loan DetailResolve IssuesMatch? Resolved? DONENo Ye (Documentation)No Ye s P4-125FSA Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL WORKING WITH THE SAS Once your school receives the SAS, the first step in monthly reconciliation is to compare the cash summary data to the corresponding totals in your school's financial aid and business office systems. Ideally your ECB will be zero, suggesting that there are no discrepancies to be explained. But there could be rare instances where positive and negative discrepancies are canceling each other out, so you need to look at the rest of the cash summary to make sure that it matches your school's data. In addition to the ECB, the cash summary shows net drawdowns/payments, which reflect cash receipts (funds drawn through G5) minus refunds of cash (funds returned through G5 or to COD by check), and total net booked disbursements, which reflect booked disbursemen ts plus or minus booked adjustments. Many differences between your drawdowns from G5 and the disbursements reported to COD can be explained by timing issues. For instance, if your school draws down $25,000 to pay students at the end of September but does not send in actual disbursement records for those students until the beginning of October (within the 15-day reporting requirement), the SAS for the month of September will include $25,000 in cash receipts from the G5 system that are not matched by booked disbursements in COD. Keep in mind that loan disbursement records sent to COD near the end of the month may not be processed and acknowledged until the beginning of the next month. If you can identify such discrepancies and account for any remaining cash balance (positive or negative) at the cash summary level, then you've successfully completed reconciliation for the month. Remember that a school must document its reconciliation process and the results of each monthly reconciliation. However, in many cases, you may need to compare the SAS and school data at a more detailed level, using two other sections of the SAS the SAS cash detail for cash receipts and refunds of cash; and the SAS loan or disbursement detail for actual disbursement and adjustment data accepted in COD.Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR DCL Reconciling Department and School Records The SAS (sent by COD) includes both disbursement data and cash transactions at COD (but received from G5) . This data in ED systems must be reconciled with data in your school's financial aid office and business office. Financial Aid OfficeFunds drawn down from (or returned to) G5 payment system Discrepancies can occur for a variety of reasons, such as Timing issues\u2014funds are drawn down and disbursed in a different month from the month student/ parent records are sent to COD.

COD Business OfficeCOD (from G5) Net Booked Disbursements Net Cash Receipts SAS4-127FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL iExample of SAS Cash Summary Analysis of Sample SAS Cash Summary The beginning cash balance is zero at the start of the award year. Otherwise it is equal to the previous month's ending cash balance. The SAS shows that the school drew down $33,074 from the G5 payment system and returned $1,350 in cash during September. If these amounts differ from the school's summary data, the SAS cash detail should be compared to the business office's records of cash transactions. The SAS shows $25,721 in booked disbursements reported to COD and a net of $1,250 in adjustments that reduces the total disbursements. Because the school drew down more money from G5 in September than the amount of loan disbursements it reported to COD, the ending cash balance has grown to $7,253. In this sample, one or more unbooked disbursements\u2014possibly the result of future-dated disbursement records\u2014 are contributing to the positive ending cash balance. If the $1,264 in disbursements is booked in October, they will reduce the ending cash balance. Comparing the loan disbursement detail on the SAS with the financial aid office's records may show unbooked disbursements that were not reported to COD (and thus don't appear on the SAS). The remainder (cash > accepted and posted disbursements) is the difference between net drawdowns/payments and all actual disbursements accepted at COD, both booked and unbooked. It may be explained by timing issues between school actions and the date transactions are recorded in COD, differences between financial aid office and business office records, or rejected disbursement records at COD that have yet to be resolved.The information in the cash summary is fairly general\u2014you will usually need to examine the detail information in the SAS and in your school's records to be able to identify the source of any discrepancies shown in the summary. The example shown below is a monthly cash summary. End Date: 09/30/2018 School Code: G09009 Beginning Balance $0 Net Drawdowns/Payments $31,724 Booked Booked Adjustments Accepted and Posted Disbursements: $5,989u uv vw x y w x yECB CFR DCL uiExample Detail Trans Trans Trans COD Process G5 Control/ Type Date Amount Date Check Number Receipt $8,250 09/25/201 7 2005091234567 Total Cash Receipt Records 3 Total Refunds of Cash Records 1 Total SAS Cash Detail Records 4 Total Cash Receipt Amount $33,074 Total Refunds of Cash Amount $725The cash detail shows each exchange of funds with the G5 (formerly known as GAPS) system as reported to COD. (Either cash received by the school or a refund of cash to G5.) The amounts listed in the cash detail often represent amounts for multiple loans that have been reported separately to the COD system. Analysis of Sample SAS Cash Detail: The transactions listed in the Cash Detail include G5 control numbers for drawdowns and refunds. It will also show the check number if the school made a refund (return of cash) directly to COD (not recommended). From the Cash Detail, we see that the $725 total Refund of Cash was made in a single transaction. Given the amount, it is possible that it represents the cancellation of a single loan disbursement, but one would have to examine the business office records to confirm this. (If the loan had already been reported to COD when it was cancelled, the Loan Disbursement Detail on the SAS should also show a subsequent adjustment to reduce the loan amount.) These three lines show the total number of drawdowns (cash receipts) by the school for the month vs. the total number of refunds sent back by the school during the same time frame. These two lines show the total amount drawn down for the month (cash receipts) and the total amount returned. u v wv w x x A comparison with the school's business office records may identify missing transactions. For instance, if the school intended to make a refund of cash for this award year but attributed it to the wrong award year, the amount of that transaction would not be reflected on the SAS for this award year, and the total refunds amount on the statement would be too low. (Conversely, the total refunds amount on the SAS for the other award year would be too high.)4-129FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL LOAN DISBURSEMENT DETAIL In contrast to the bank transactions shown on the cash detail, the loan disbursement detail is meant to be compared with the individual loan records in your financial aid office system. This detailed report includes all actual disbursement information and adjustments that have been accepted by COD during that month based on the date the individual transaction books at COD (disbursement booked date). The default option for the SAS is the monthly disbursement detail. If you plan to use DL Tools to compare the SAS data with your school records, you should request this information in the form of the year-to- date disbursement detail (note that this will significantly increase the size of the report as the award year progresses). SAS options can be changed on the COD website. Timing issues and the school account statement As noted earlier, timing issues could be a recurring source of discrepancies. Disbursement and adjustment transactions appear on the SAS for the month in which the COD system receives or acknowledges the transaction. An actual disbursement that is transmitted to COD in late September may not be acknowledged by the COD system until October and therefore will appear on the October SAS, which will arrive at the school in early November. The same kind of discrepancy can occur when the business office draws down and disburses loan funds to the student in late September, but the financial aid office doesn't send the actual disbursement records for those loans until the beginning of October. If such discrepancies are common at your school, you may want to look at ways to make sure that actual disbursement records are sent to COD sooner. In either case, the disbursement amount may show up on the September SAS as part of a drawdown from G5 but not on the loan detail for September. You will need to check to make sure that the disbursement was accepted by COD, and document the discrepancy. You should also check to make sure that the disbursement is included when you receive the SAS loan detail for October.DL Tools and the Loan Compare Report You can use DL Tools to compare the SAS loan and disbursement detail recorded in your financial aid office's system. For more information on DL Tools and the comparison reports available see the COD Technical Reference, Volume IV or view the DL Tools web-based training available on IFAP /Tools for Schools/EDExpress Online Training and in the COD Computer- Based Training (CBT) modules under \"Tools for 1 Report Time: 12:01:01 DIRECT LOAN TOOLS\u20142018-2019 SAS Loan Detail Sort by: Loan ID THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION PROTECTED BY THE PRIVACY ACT *********************************************************************************************************** Example of SAS Loan Detail (Disbursement Detail) Date Range: 08/01/2018 to 08/31/2018 School Type: All Student's Name PLUS Borrower's Name Record Gross Fee Int.

This example shows first disbursements of Direct Subsidized loans to Bill Blue and Olivia Ohio, and the first disbursement (with an adjustment) of a Direct Unsubsidized loan to Ilene Illinois. The first line of the loan listing shows if the loan is booked or unbooked, the gross amount, fee, interest rebate (interest rebates do not appear for loans first disbursed after July 1, 2012), and the net amount of the loan. The second line shows the date of the disbursement or adjustment and the gross and net amounts of the disbursement. The letter S, U, or P in the ninth position of the Loan ID indicates whether it is a Subsidized, Unsubsidized, or PLUS Loan. For Ilene Illinois' Direct Unsubsidized Loan, we see that the disbursed amount has been adjusted (disbursement 1, sequence 2). Note that the adjusted amount is the amount of the disbursement after the change has been recorded. The adjustment itself is a reduction of $100. Next Steps... What's NOT on the SAS Loan Disbursement Detail is as important as the loans that are listed. Note that rejected disbursements will not appear on the SAS. 4 Compare the loan disbursements on this Detail to the data in your financial aid office system. If you are using DL Tools software, the Loan Detail Compare report will identify loans that appear in your school's database but not on the SAS, and vice versa. In addition, most software packages can generate reports showing the current status of all award records, MPNs, and actual disbursements in your database. Look for actual disbursements that are in your school's database but have not been transmitted to COD (or were rejected by COD). Look for any actual disbursements that were entered directly on the COD website, but not in the financial aid office software database. 4 Check for unbooked loans If you not are using DL Tools software, you can identify many unbooked loans by reviewing the 30-Day Warning Report sent by COD. Look for any loans that are missing a necessary component (loan origination record, MPN, or first disbursement) to book the loan. 4 Check the disbursement information in your school's business office records . Via internal reconciliation, compare the disbursement records in the business office (credits and payments to students) to the actual disbursements listed in the financial aid office system. Look for any disbursements made by the business office that are not substantiated by an actual disbursement record submitted to COD (and accepted) in the same month. Look for any actual disbursements reported to COD but not made by the business office within the same month.uVolume 4\u2014Processing Aid and CFR DCL Back Up Y our Data! Before you begin reconciliation, be sure to back up all Direct Loan and other data files that may be affected by reconciliation.BEST PRACTICES FOR RECONCILIATION Establishing preventive procedures Month end reconciliation can be a simple process for schools that maintain good daily processing practices and cash management procedures. During the month, your school's financial aid and business offices should ensure: all funds received have been substantiated with actual accepted disbursements in COD by regularly checking your financial aid database for any unsent or rejected batches and disbursements; any downward adjustments have been accompanied by either a refund of cash or a disbursement of funds to another eligible student in the same award year (within cash management regu - lations); any excess funds have been returned to the Department as a refund of cash; all funds requested are for disbursements to be made within the period of immediate need (three business days) and that funds are disbursed within that period or returned to the Department; and all awards and disbursements are reported within the 15-day reporting period allowed by regulation. Preparing for monthly reconciliation You can minimize discrepancies by making sure that all COD transactions have been completed and your internal records are up-to- date prior to the end of each month. Export all batches that are ready to be processed by COD at least two business days before the end of the month. Import the acknowledgements. Alternatively, you could run a query or report to identify unsent batches and rejects and use that to see what needs to be cleaned up. Run reports within your financial aid software to identify and resolve records (MPN, origination, and disbursement) that are not in an accepted (A) status. Review the batch activity list for any unconfirmed batches, and import any missing acknowledgments. Reconcile internally with the business office or bursar's office so that you have the same cash balance to compare to the balance shown on the SAS. For its part, the business office can Review drawdown and refund activity in your school's federal bank account and reconcile any discrepancies. Make sure that draws and refunds are posted to the correct award year.4-133FSA HB September 2018 Chapter 6\u2014Reconciliation in the Direct Loan ProgramGlossary CFR DCL Communicate with the financial aid office when it has drawn cash or returned funds within the last three business days of the month. (These transactions may not be recorded on the most recent SAS, creating a timing issue and discrepancy in the net drawdown/payments.) Return any refunds or excess cash using the electronic process through G5. Direct Loan year-end closeout Direct Loan schools must complete a final reconciliation and program year closeout. Program year closeout should occur within a month or two of your final disbursements but no later than the program year closeout deadline, which is the last processing day in July of the year following the end of the award year. If schools are fulfilling their monthly reconciliation requirements, year-end closeout is really only one more month of reconciliation. Note: Exceptions to the last processing day of the program year may be made on a case-by-case basis if the school's processing period extends beyond the closeout deadline. Schools falling within this category must request extended processi ng online, or by contacting the COD School Relations Center.Sample Internal Report Comparing Financial Aid and Business Office Data for Loan Disbursements These two disbursements were made by the business office but were not substantiated in COD because the financial aid office has not submitted an actual disbursement record to COD. As shown on the previous page, this discrepancy will not show up in a comparison of school data with the SAS's loan disbursement detail or cash detail. The discrepancy can only be identified by a comparison of loan-level data between the financial aid office's system and the business office. O n the next page, we show how these two transactions would appear as $3,152 in excess cash on the reconciliation worksheet.

If a school is meeting these regulatory requirements, the final closeout stage should begin no later than the last award end date at the school for a given program and year. In other words, a school should be able to reconcile to a zero ending cash balance and close out soon after its final disbursements and should not wait until the closeout deadline. To be considered successfully closed out, a school must have an ECB of $0 and total net unbooked disbursements of $0 internally and as reflected on the SAS, and complete the balance confirmation form on the COD website. For each loan schools should zero out all pending disbursements they will not be making. They should reduce loan amounts to the sum of the actual disbursements they made. Loan periods must be updated to remove any terms/payment periods for which an actual disbursement was not made and retained. You will be notified of the closeout requirements through electronic announcements and COD system-generated closeout correspondence. As part of the closeout process, COD will send ongoing notices via zero balance confirmation or remaining balance confirmation emails. In addition, COD will distribute a notification/warning letter via email to schools in May. This letter will go to the financial aid administrator and president at each school that has not confirmed closeout on the COD website (including any schools with a zero balance). It will serve as a reminder to finish processing and confirm closeout before the final deadline. After the closeout deadline, schools with remaining positive balances will be billed. Once you have successfully confirmed closeout via the balance confirmation page in COD, the financial aid administrator and president of the school will receive a program year closeout letter to keep for your records. Schools must be aware of their closeout status even if a third-party servicer handles their Direct Loan processing. It is schools' responsibility for processing to be completed and closeout confirmed on time, so we encourage them to communicate regularly with their third-party servicer to ensure that happens. SUMMARY A key factor to an easy Direct Loan reconciliation and closeout is staying on top of the process. Completing Y ear-End Closeout We encourage you to complete the following simple steps while reviewing your school's internal records and the SAS: Ensure that all drawdowns and re - funds of cash are accounted for and applied to the correct program year; Ensure that all disbursements and adjustments are accurate and have been reported to and accepted by the COD system; Ensure that all batches have been sent to and accepted by the COD system; Ensure that all unbooked loans are resolved; Resolve all outstanding rejected re - cords; and Return all refunds of cash to the G5 payment system.Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid 2018Glossary CFR DCL 1.

The most recent announcements for reconciliation were published on the IFAP website on November 22 ( general reconciliation ) and December 21 ( Direct Loan reconciliation ), 2017. The latter of these includes a four-page attachment of Q's and A's. The most recent announcement for closeout was on May 16, 2018, for the 2016-2017 program year.

On a current basis they must establish and maintain the following: 1. Financial records that reflect each Title IV program transaction. 2. General ledger control accounts and related subsidiary accounts that identify each Title IV program transaction and separate those transactions from all other institutional financial activity. 3. Accounting and internal control systems that identifies the cash balance of the funds of each Title IV program that are included in the school's bank account as readily as if those program funds were maintained in a separate account; and identifies the earnings on Title IV program funds maintained in the school's bank account. 34 CFR and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 The Department does not specify the type of system a school must use. However, the accounting and internal control system must be able to provide individuals examining the financial records of a school's participation in the federal student aid programs with the type of information described below. A school's chart of accounts must identify all general ledger and subsidiary ledger accounts relevant to the Federal Student Aid (FSA) Programs. In addition, a school's accounts, journals, and records must follow federal cash from the moment the funds are drawn through G5 to when funds are disbursed to students, including when cash is deposited into institutional bank accounts; transferred between bank accounts; posted to general and subsidiary ledgers; posted to the individual student account ledgers; and if applicable, disbursed directly to students. Note: An institution is not required to have a specific or minimum number of bank accounts. However, an institution's general and subsidiary ledgers must clearly identify the amount of Title IV, HEA funds, by program, in each account, including interest payments attributable to certain programs, such that a clear audit trail exists. ACCOUNTING RECORDS An effective institutional financial aid program requires a cooperative effort among all school offices involved in delivering financial aid to students. Separate reporting and recordkeeping responsibilities required of each office, as well as shared responsibilities, are detailed in the Federal Student Aid Handbook, Volume 2. The business office is responsible for most financial accounting and recordkeeping (except for the detailed records and files on individual financial aid recipients that must be kept in the financial aid office). The remainder of this chapter is designed to help the business office satisfy its accounting responsibilities efficiently and with a minimum of effort. Bookkeeping and recordkeeping Bookkeeping and recordkeeping systems should be designed to: enable timely internal and external financial reporting; meet documentation requirements; ensure proper filing of applications; accurate reports.Appendix A\u2014Accounting Systems4-141 FSA HB September 2018FUND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND THE FSA PROGRAMS A fund accounting system is required whenever an entity is responsible to a third party for ensuring that funds are used as intended by the third party. Such funds must be restricted for use in accordance with the third-party's requirements and separate fund accounts must be established for each third-party program from which the entity is receiving funds. Fund accounting is the method of segregating assets into categories according to the individual program requirements placed on their use by the third party. Fund accounting contrasts with the more widely known system used in corporate accounting in one fundamental way\u2014entities receiving third-party funds may not exceed their budgets. Additionally, the concepts of encumbrance and budgeting obligations found in fund accounting are not found in corporate accounting. Fund accounting is characterized by the following: A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts consisting of assets, liabilities, and fund balances. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund to ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of the resources of each fund. For reporting purposes, funds with similar characteristics are combined into fund groups. Expenditures are recorded in each fund and measured against budgets, thereby providing finite limits within which funded entities within the school must operate in carrying out their mission. When designing an accounting system, the chart of accounts, books of original entry, billing and reporting requirements, and other FSA requirements must all be considered. For example, the numerous ledger accounts suggested in the chart of accounts that appears later in this chapter for the Perkins Loan Program were created to assist schools in preparing year-end reports that must be filed with the Department. The school can simply copy the information from its ledgers to the electronic FISAP format supplied by the Department. When designing a chart of accounts, institutions also need to consider their fund-accounting needs, particularly with respect to restricted funds or funds that are initially restricted. The chart of accounts should accurately reflect the school's current organization and programs, and it should have the flexibility to accommodate any future changes in the organization.4-142 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Audit trails Your accounting records and systems for FSA funds must provide a clear audit trail that makes it possible to trace all federal cash from drawdown to its final destination. An audit trail, whether in a manual system, an automated system, or a combination of systems, includes the accounting record of a transaction and all the documentation that supports each transaction. In accounting records, when data is recorded, a reference should also be recorded to identify the source of the data. The reference can be in the form of a date, a name, an address, or a number such as a journal page number, ledger account number, or check number. These references, used throughout the accounting cycle, form an audit trail that makes it possible to trace the details of a transaction from the source document to the financial statements and accounting records. A vital part of an audit trail is cross-referencing . Cross-referencing is the recording of identifying numbers pointing both ways in offsetting or supporting accounting entries. For example, in your FSEOG cash account, for a deposit received from G5, you would record an entry that pointed to the journal page on which you recorded the names of students for whom this particular cash draw was intended to provide the federal share. Likewise, on the aforementioned journal page, you would record an identifier that pointed to the appropriate draw in your FSEOG cash account. Chart of Accounts As an aid in discussing records and accounting techniques for financial aid programs, the Summary Chart of Accounts later in this appendix lists accounts considered necessary for institutions to account properly for FSA program funds. These accounts may be set up in either a manual or automated accounting system. Either system will need the basic suggested ledger accounts to meet the Department's minimum program and fiscal requirements, as well as the institution's external reporting requirements, such as basic financial statements and fund statements. Such a system will serve to meet the accounting needs of the school, the Department, and other federal agencies. Additional accounts may be added as deemed necessary by the school. These accounts should be reviewed at least annually to determine if additions or deletions are necessary to meet changes in federal regulations. The chart of accounts is a primary internal control mechanism delineating the framework of the accounts. This chart has two components: (1) a fund number and (2) an account number that usually follows a standard account-code structure (a definition, by name, of the account code). A uniform numbering scheme is used here to assist in identifying the parts of the financial statements on which ledger accounts are located. The numbers assigned to these ledger accounts are arbitrarily DL Fiscal Requirements Lesson See the Direct Loans page of the FSA Assessments for a lesson on DL fiscal requirements. Go to https://ifap.ed.gov/ qahome/qaassessments/directloans. html and click on Activity HB September 2018assigned, but in sequential order, and these specific numbers are not required to put these ledgers in place in institutional accounting systems. In all cases, the first digit of an account number identifies an element of the financial statements, as follows: 1 - Asset Account 2 - Asset Reduction Account 3 - Liability Account 4 - Capital Account (or Program Balance) 5 - Capital Reduction Account 6 - Income Account (or Revenue Account) 7 - Expense Account The accounting record for each federal student aid program is self- balancing and must be separated completely from the accounting records of all other federal student aid programs and from the accounting record for the general operating fund of the school. Within each program, the sum of ledger accounts with debit balances equals the sum of ledger accounts with credit balances. In the following Summary Chart of Accounts, award authorizations are not shown. It is recommended that they be booked as a memo journal entry or budget item. Then, as award authorizations are adjusted, appropriate adjustments to budget figures would be entered. This process helps ensure that drawdown amounts do not exceed authorization levels. Note: The G5 account shown in the Summary Chart of Accounts, account # 1 - 2 (Accounts Receivable, G5) is used only if a school does not use the reimbursement payment method for drawing down FSA funds. The accounting for the reimbursement method will not be covered here. However, account # 1 - 2 should be booked as any other account receiv - able. Each respective subsidiary ledger would also book the receivable.Reconciling Subsidiary Records to Account Balances All accounts should be backed up by subsidiary ledger detail. Although a trial balance can be used to ensure that accounts balance in the aggregate, it does not guarantee that there is sufficient evidence that subsidiary records exist to support the totals in each account. Errors can occur when corrections or changes are made to control accounts without corresponding adjustments being made to subsidiary records. Reconciliations between accounts and subsidiary record detail should be performed at least monthly and should be conducted on a more frequent basis during periods of high transaction volume. As mentioned earlier, most FSA programs require monthly reconciliations.4-144 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Examples of Information a School's Accounting System Must Be Able to Provide Documentation that for any drawdown of federal cash the funds were deposited in an account in which the funds were clearly identified as federal Documentation, if applicable, that for any drawdown the funds were transferred to the appropriate subsidiary ledgers or, if intended for students, posted to the students' accounts within the three days permitted Documentation that if the posting of federal cash to a student account created an FSA credit balance, the funds were made available to the student within the 14 days stipulated by regulation (see Volume 5 for a discussion of FSA credit balances when a student withdraws) If the school holds FSA credit balances for students, documentation that there is a ledger that identifies all such credit balances and that there is sufficient cash in the school's bank account to cover all such credit balances Documentation that for each Return of Title IV Funds required under 34 CFR 668.22, within the time frame allowed by regulation, cash has been transferred from the student's account to the school's federal funds account and then has either been returned to the Department or reallocated and disbursed to other eligible students Through its accounting system a clear audit trail to account for all Title IV, HEA funds throughout the cash management cycle For the Campus-Based Programs, documentation that all nonfederal matching funds (when the matches are made with cash) were deposited before or at the same time that federal funds were received For the Federal Work-Study Program, for schools without a waiver or exception, documentation that the school expended at least 7% of its FWS allocation in making payments to students employed in community service jobs for the year For the Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant Program, documentation that the awards made to students equal the federal share, plus the institutional share minus any administrative cost allowance (ACA) taken by the school, plus or minus any funds transferred or carried forward/backAppendix A\u2014Accounting Systems4-145 FSA HB September 2018Examples of Information a School's Accounting System Must Be Able to Provide (continued) For the Federal Work-Study Program, documentation that the total gross compensation paid to students reported on the school's Fiscal Operations Report is supported by the school's payroll records including accounting records of any amount paid to students in noncash institutional matching For a school receiving funds through the heightened cash monitoring 2 (HCM2) or reimbursement payment (Funding Controls) methods, documentation that before submitting a request for federal cash for a student, the school made the disbursement(s) with its own funds to the student's account and identified the disbursement(s) appropriately (e.g., as a Federal Pell Grant) For a school receiving funds through the HCM2 or reimbursement payment methods, documentation that if disbursing its own funds (labeled Title IV funds) to a student's account created a Title IV credit balance, the school made that credit balance available to the student within the 14 days required by regulation For any student who receives Title IV funds, a student subsidiary account/ student ledger that clearly identifies the date and amount of each transaction, and the balance after each Subsidiary financial aid ledgers that are year specific (though federal funds from different award years may be maintained in the same bank account) Student Subsidiary Accounts/Student Ledgers The Department considers student subsidiary accounts, also known as student ledgers, part of a school's accounting system.

It is established to identify the balance of federal cash disbursed to a school through G5. The system described here segregates federal cash by using separate accounts for G5 FSA-funded programs. These separate G5 accounts allow reconciliation of funds sent and/or available through G5. Separate checking accounts need not be maintained for each program as long as school records indicate precisely where cash was used. Debit this account for: All cash received from G5 for all FSA programs, except Pell Grant ACA reimbursement or Perkins Loan cancellation reimburse - ments (contra account # 1-2). All unexpended cash on programs when accountability has been transferred to NFC (contra account # 1-2). Credit this account with: All cash transferred to programs. Excess cash billings paid to National Finance Center (NFC) (contra account # 1-2). 1 - 2 Accounts Receivable, G5 : This account can be a debit or credit balance account depending on the timing of disbursements and drawdowns. It represents all amounts due from all open-status G5- funded programs.* The debit balance may exist between the time funds are requested from G5 and the time they are received. Debit this account for: Amount of awards disbursed to students and recorded as income transferred from G5 in each respective FSA program account. Credit this account for: Cash received from G5 (contra account # 1 - 1). Any unexpended program balances after accountability has been transferred to NFC (contra account # 1 - 1).* A different accounting treatment is needed if a school has been placed on the reimbursement payment method for drawing down FSA funds.Appendix A\u2014Accounting Cash Unremitted to NFC : This account is used to reflect that a portion of cash is no longer under G5 accountability; the accountability has been transferred to the National Finance Center (NFC). This cash is segregated if a grant's final closing amount is in dispute. Accounting for the funds here reflects a transfer of accountability from G5. If more than one program is in dispute, separate subsidiary accounts should be set up for each one. Disallowed expenditures on open, current- year G5 accounts are recorded by reclassifying the expenditures from the specific program account to institutional accounts and reinstating the same amount from the FSA program account to the G5 account. Debit this account for: Cash received from the school for disallowed expenditure (contra account # 1-2). Interest earnings on FSA funds that exceed the regulatory thresh - old (contra account # 3-1). Credit this account with: Amounts remitted to NFC (contra account # 3-1). 1-2 Due from School : This debit balance account reflects amounts due from the school as a result of disallowed expenditures on closed accounts not under G5 accountability. Debit this account for: Billings from NFC for expenditures disallowed by program review or audit, excess cash, and the like (contra account # 3-1). Credit this account for: Cash received from the school (contra account # 1-1). 3-1 Accounts Payable, NFC : This account is normally a credit balance account that reflects any liabilities to NFC as a result of cash accountability separated from G5 as described earlier or disallowed expenditures on programs not under G5 accountability or excess interest earnings returnable to ED through NFC.

In this chapter, we will discuss the minimum criteria for those procedures and systems, identify areas where problems might arise, and point out potential system weaknesses. 4-165 FSA HB September 2018APPENDIXBCFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS A school's financial management system (including the school's accounting system) must provide effective control over and accountability for all funds received from the U.S. Department of Education's (ED's) Grant Management System (G5). An FSA fiscal management system includes procedures for requesting funds from ED; disbursing funds to eligible students and parents; accounting for funds and financial activities;1 keeping accurate and auditable records including providing the clear audit trail required by cash management regulations;1 meeting the documentation requirements of the individual program regulations; managing cash; ensuring proper filing of timely applications; and enabling timely internal and external financial reporting. At a minimum, a school's financial management system including its accounting system must provide 1. accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial condition of each federal aid program or project sponsored by ED; 2. records that adequately identify the source and application of funds for sponsored activities and contain information on institutional awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, income, liabilities, revenues, expenditures, and cash disbursements;1 1. Accounting system functionFinancial management systems 34 CFR 668, Subpart K Accounting System Defined A school's accounting system includes those procedures that deal with the organization and controls necessary to identify and record transactions in a school's journals and ledgers, while systematically providing for the supporting documentation for all journal entries. The accounting system is a subset of the school's larger system of financial management. 4-166 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 3. effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and other assets, including adequate safeguarding of all such assets to ensure that they are used solely for authorized purposes;1 4. comparison of actual expended amounts with amounts budgeted for each FSA program;1 5. procedures to ensure the timely, efficient transfer of funds when they are advanced through electronic methods (these procedures must limit the time between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and cash disbursement by the school to students so that funds are disbursed no later than three busi - ness days following the receipt of funds, and do not result in excess cash.);1 6. procedures according to the applicable terms of the FSA pro - gram for determining reasonableness, allowability, and alloca - bility of costs;1 7. accounting records that are supported by audit trail documen - tation;2 8. monthly reconciliation of individual student FSA awards as recorded in the financial aid, business office, student account, and Department systems (for Pell and Direct Loan);1 and 9. examinations in the form of external or internal audits, which must be made according to generally accepted auditing stan - dards and government auditing standards.1 Schools organize and manage their financial operations differently depending on such factors as the size of the school, administrative structure, staffing, automation, and federal program participation. Although fiscal operations can vary from school to school, successfully managing FSA programs at any school depends on coordinated efforts across institutional offices. Coordination has become increasingly important as automated systems have replaced paper-based ones. Automated systems bring many benefits, such as enhanced data integrity and speedy data exchange, but they also present challenges. Perhaps the most critical challenge is that automation can blur responsibility for functions that, by law, must be kept separate, such as awarding and disbursing federal funds. 1. Financial management system functions 2. Accounting functionAppendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-167 FSA HB September NETWORK OF RESPONSIBILITIES Managing FSA assistance is a school-wide responsibility. FSA program funds are provided to the school, and all offices at a school must work together to ensure successful program management. A school's FSA program management generally takes place in three functional areas: the office of the chief executive (CEO, president, chancellor, owner, etc.), the financial aid office, and the business (bursar's) office. Schools differ in how they divide these functions among administrative offices. However, the president's office, the financial aid office, and the business office always play key roles. The CEO's office Ultimate responsibility for a school's FSA programs resides with the school's CEO. Although authority and responsibility are delegated to other offices, the leadership and support of the CEO are crucial to successfully administering FSA programs. By recognizing the importance of federal aid programs, making FSA program administration a high priority, and holding key officials accountable, CEO leadership can foster an environment that promotes an effective and responsive financial aid program that meets institutional goals, students' needs, and federal requirements. The next page lists the administrative responsibilities of a school's CEO.4-168 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Meets the financial standards for administering the FSA programs Has an individual capable of administering the FSA programs and coordinating federal and nonfederal financial aid Has an adequate number of qualified staff to administer FSA programs Has a procedure to report changes to ED about the school's current eligibility status (for example, changes in ownership, address, name, officials, third-party servicers, programs, and locations) Has a procedure to ensure that FSA funds for new programs and locations are not disbursed until approvals (when required) are received from ED Has established clear lines of responsibility among the pertinent school offices Has good communication and cooperation among personnel in the pertinent school offices Maintains effective recordkeeping systems for both student records and financial records Has an adequate system of checks and balances to ensure separation of award functions from disbursement functions Has accurate information about student applicants for FSA aid and resolves any discrepancies or inconsistencies Provides adequate financial aid and loan debt management counseling to studentsThe CEO's/President's Responsibilities Refers any suspected cases of FSA fraud, abuse, or misrepresentation to ED's Office of Inspector General Obtains a letter of credit (if the school has failed to meet the standards of financial responsibility) Has an independent auditor perform an annual federal audit of the school's FSA financial operations Cooperates fully with any program reviews or audits and makes available all necessary information to the reviewers or auditors Has no criminal or fraudulent activities occur as it manages federal funds and administers FSA programs Has established reasonable standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for students Has established a fair and equitable institutional refund policy (if required by the school's accrediting agency) Has an operable and accessible drug abuse prevention program, as required by the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Has a drug-free workplace, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act Makes available all published information required by the Student Right-to-Know Act and the Campus Security Act and any other applicable laws and regulations Provides the services described in its publications For complete information about the requirement to obtain a letter of credit when a school fails to meet the standards of financial responsibility and the requirement to obtain an independent audit of a school's participation in the FSA programs please see the Federal Student Aid Handbook, Volume 2 .Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-169 FSA HB September 2018The financial aid office While the financial aid office usually has most of the responsibility for administering the FSA programs, its role in the school's fiscal operation is typically limited. In some cases, functions such as loan counseling might be performed by the business office instead of the aid office. Responsibilities Commonly Assigned to a School's Financial Aid Office Advise and counsel students and parents about financial aid Provide students with consumer information, as required by federal regulations Develop written policies and procedures about the way the school administers FSA programs Determine students' eligibility for financial aid Make financial aid awards to students Adhere to the principle of separation of functions (no single office or individual may authorize payments and disburse FSA funds to students) In administering financial aid programs, coordinate financial aid activities with those of other school offices Interact with various outside groups, agencies, associations, and individuals about issues concerning the school's administration of financial aid programs Monitor students' satisfactory academic progress (SAP) Maintain school records and student records that document the administration of the financial aid office and provide data for reports Keep current on changes in laws and regulations to ensure that the school remains in compliance Assist in reporting program expenditures Manage and report on activities that involve financial aid funds Calculate the return of Title IV funds and, if it applies, authorize post-withdrawal disbursements to students Assist in reconciling loan records (for schools in the Direct Loan Program) Reconcile student financial aid data provided to the business office to ensure all payments have been made, return of FSA funds have been accounted for, and expenditures have been reported Have a procedure to report any changes to ED about the school's current eligibility status (for example, change in ownership, address, name, officials, third- party servicers, etc.) Perform limited fiscal operations, such as authorizing payment of FSA funds to student accounts or to students directly authorizing return of Title IV funds to program accounts and post-withdrawal disbursements to students notifying a student who owes an overpayment as a result of the student's withdrawal from the school in order for ED or the school to recover the overpayment notifying ED of the overpayment coordinating submission of the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) verifying records that have been updated in COD to ensure subsidized usage limit calculations are accurate for students, per the guidance of DCL GEN-13-13 and the relevant September 25, 2015, electronic announcement . Provide entrance and exit counseling to borrowers of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loan Program loans as part of the award and delivery process1 Provide entrance and exit counseling to borrowers of Federal Perkins Loans as part of the award and delivery process1 1. At some schools, the business office performs this function.4-170 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and 2018-2019 The business (bursar's) office Most FSA related fiscal operations are handled by a school's business office. This office may also be known as the fiscal office, finance office, comptroller's office, bursar's office, treasurer's office, or student accounts office. For the duration of this text, this office will be referred to simply as the business office . The business office provides critical services to the school in managing both federal and nonfederal financial aid programs. Administering the accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting functions related to the school's use of federal and other funds requires many detailed, complex systems. Strong internal controls and sound business and financial management practices are keys to the success of these operations and delivering funds to students. The next page lists some of the common responsibilities of the business office.Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-171 FSA HB September 2018Responsibilities Commonly Assigned to a School's Business Office Coordinate activities and cooperate with the financial aid office in projecting cash needed to cover disbursements processing cancellations and institutional refunds obtaining authorization to pay FSA funds being aware of the changes in FSA laws and regulation submitting accurate and timely reports reconciling records to ensure that financial aid adjustments are properly recorded Maintain a system of internal controls that includes adequate checks and balances Ensure that the functions of authorizing and disbursing FSA funds remain separate Maintain records consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and government auditing standards Maintain records to ensure a clear audit trail Draw down and return FSA funds to program accounts Disburse funds to eligible students from FSA program accounts Maintain a system of student accounts that records charges, credits, and amounts due Collect Federal Perkins Loans1 Calculate the return of Title IV funds, and if it applies, authorize post-withdrawal disbursements to students2 Establish and implement the institution's refund policy (if required by the school's accrediting or state agency)2 Process return of Title IV funds to program accounts and post-withdrawal disbursements to students according to the applicable federal laws and regulations Assist in reporting FSA expenditures to the Department in a timely manner Reconcile accounts, including reconciling cash between school records and bank statements and reports reconciling federal funds between bank statements and federally reported balances Assist in completing applications, fiscal reports for federal funds, and FISAP Maintain a cash management system to meet disbursement requirements and federal laws and regulations Provide general stewardship for federal funds, including maintaining bank accounts and investments as appropriate Prepare for and participate in FSA program reviews and audits Before making a first disbursement of Direct Loan funds, confirm that new borrowers have completed entrance counseling2 Ensure that Direct Loan and Perkins Loan borrowers have completed exit counseling within the time permitted by the appropriate regulations and school policies3 Establish and monitor Federal Work-Study (FWS) payroll and time sheets4 1. At some schools a separate student loan office collects these loans. 2. At some schools the financial aid office does this. 3. At some schools the financial aid office ensures this. Also, the business office may be responsible for administering other aspects of the Perkins Loan Program. While the financial aid office may be responsible for awarding Perkins Loan funds, the business office may be responsible for collecting and handling promissory notes, billing borrowers in repayment, col - lecting payments, authorizing deferments, cancelling loans, and reporting Perkins Loans to NSLDS. 4. At some schools the personnel office does this.4-172 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Synchronizing operations and responsibilities Typically, several offices at your school will share responsibility for managing any one FSA program. To illustrate this network of responsibilities, consider the relatively routine activity of managing FWS Program time sheets for student employees. The financial aid office typically authorizes FWS awards and monitors student earnings to ensure students have not exceeded their authorized awards. On the other hand, the business office usually processes payroll and monitors the school's nonfederal share of FWS to ensure the school is adequately matching the federal share. Your school's processes should demonstrate similar interdependence in your management of its FSA programs. To further explore this principle, if your school participates in the FWS programs, please complete the FWS questionnaire on the next page as it applies to your school.Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program time sheet requires oversight certification. Who is authorized to certify that a student has worked the hours reported and earned the amount paid? 2. Students must remain eligible from one term to the next. Who monitors student eligibility and academic progress? 3. Some eligibility requirements are school policies. Who develops these policies for the school? 4. Students are paid wages on the basis of their time sheets. Who collects the time sheets from students? Who processes the payroll? Who reconciles the payroll to the time sheets? 5. Students may only earn up to the amount of their authorized FWS awards. Who determines the amount of the award? Who monitors students' earnings to ensure they do not earn more than that amount? 6.

What is internal control? Internal control is an integral component of an organization's management. An effective internal control structure includes a school's plan of organization and all the policies, procedures, and actions taken by the school to provide reasonable assurance that the school will achieve its objectives in the following areas: 1. Effectiveness and efficiency of operations 2. Accuracy of operating data 3. Reliability of program reporting 4. Protection of funds against fraud and misuse 5. Compliance with organizational policies and applicable FSA laws and regulations The first category addresses a school's administrative objectives, including performance and financial goals and safeguarding of resources. The second relates to the need to ensure that the decisions made by a school in its day-to-day operations are based on accurate information. The third relates to the preparation of financial statements, audits, and other fiscal and operational reports a school is required to make to the Department. The fourth refers to a school's fiduciary responsibility to safeguard FSA funds and ensure they are used for the purposes and by the recipients intended. The fifth addresses the requirement that a school comply with all applicable federal, and state, laws and regulations, as well as the regulations of its accrediting agency. Components of internal control Internal control consists of five interrelated components derived from the way a school is managed. The components are Control environment \u2014The control environment sets the tone of an organization and influences the mind-set of its employees. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing its discipline and structure. Control environment factors include the integrity, ethical values, and competence of the school's people; management's philosophy and operating style; and the way a school's administration assigns authority and responsibility and organizes and develops its employees. Checks and balances 34 CFR 668.16(c)(1) HB September 2018Administrators must convey the message that integrity and ethical values cannot be compromised, and employees must receive and understand that message. Adopting codes of con - duct and other policies regarding acceptable institutional prac - tices, conflicts of interest, and expected standards of ethical and moral behavior help establish an organizational climate in which the other components of internal control are able to achieve their purposes. Risk assessment\u2014 Every entity faces a variety of risks from ex - ternal and internal sources. Risk assessment is the identifica - tion and analysis of risks that have the potential to negatively affect a school's satisfactory management of the FSA programs, its financial strength, its public image, and the overall quality of its programs and services. Many techniques have been developed to identify risks. The majority\u2014particularly those developed by internal and exter - nal auditors to determine the scope of their activities\u2014involve qualitative or quantitative methods to prioritize and identify higher risk activities. The FSA Assessment Tools can help your school identify needed areas of improvement. In addition, your case management team can provide you with a list of those fiscal and administrative responsibilities that were most often problematic during recent program reviews. Certain circumstances demand special attention because of their potential impact on the control environment. For exam - ple, when any of the following occur, a school should examine the ways in which it affects the schools operations and the ap - propriate response. A change in the operating environment . Changes in the HEA or state law, ED's regulations, or accrediting agency procedures might require a change in organi - zational procedures. New personnel . Turnover of personnel in the absence of effective training and supervision can result in breakdowns in the control environment. New or revamped information systems . Normally ef - fective controls can break down when new systems are developed, particularly when those systems are brought online under tight time constraints or at a critical time (e.g., just before registration). Rapid growth . When a school experiences rapid growth in the number of FSA recipients or the amount of federal funds it is receiving on behalf of those re - cipients, existing control systems may break down. New technology . When a new technology is incorpo - rated into management practices, a high likelihood exists that internal controls will need to be modified. Adopting EFT as the method of distributing FSA 4-176 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 credit balances, and changing to the use of smart cards as a mechanism for providing access to student's FSA funds are examples of technologies that may require changes in control procedures. Information and communication . Pertinent information must be identified, captured, and communicated in a form and time frame that enables employees to carry out their responsibilities. One type of communication involves the creation of an appropriate control environment. A second involves operational, financial, and compliance related information. All employees must receive a clear message from senior administrators that control responsibilities must be taken seriously. Employees must understand their own roles in the internal control system, as well as how individual activities relate to the work of others. They must have a means of communicating significant information to those administrators who can affect change. Employees at all levels need access to information to make appropriate operational, financial, and compliance decisions. The quality of information is determined by the degree to which the content is appropriate \u2014Is the needed information there? information is timely \u2014Is it there when required? information is current \u2014Is it the latest available? information is accurate \u2014Are the data correct? information is accessible \u2014Can it be obtained easily by appropriate parties? Monitoring \u2014Internal control systems need to be monitored\u2014 a process that assesses the quality of the system's performance over time. This can be accomplished through ongoing moni - toring activities, separate evaluations, or a combination of the two. Ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of operations. It includes regular management and supervisory activities and other actions employees take in performing their duties. On the other hand, successful institutions pause from time to time to evaluate the degree to which they are achieving their objectives and plan for changes needed to improve perfor - mance where needed. Evaluating the success of internal control procedures should be part of an institution's periodic overall evaluations.Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-177 FSA HB September 2018 Control activities \u2014Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure a school's administrative directives are followed. They help guarantee that the actions necessary to reduce risk are carried out. Control activities occur throughout an organization and include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, and periodic reviews of performance, security of funds, and separation of function. Control activities usually involve two elements: (1) a policy that establishes what should be done (and that serves as a basis for the second element), and (2) procedures to implement the policy. The most effective policies and procedures are those that are written. Control activities should be part of new employees' orientation, and the subject of periodic training for continuing employees. Of course, no matter how well designed and operated, internal control cannot provide absolute assurance that all objectives will be met. Factors outside the control or influence of management can affect the entity's ability to achieve all of its goals. In addition, modern data management systems create special problems because often, paper and audit trails may be problematic. Good systems of internal control should provide for paper documentation at key points in the electronic system. One key feature of any internal control system should be built in independent checks on performance. In large organizations, the internal audit function should report directly to the CEO or board of directors. This helps avoid the difficulties and conflicts of interests that result when the internal audit staff reports to the accounting manager, Vice President for Finance, or Chief Financial Officer. In small organizations where total separation of duties is not an economically viable alternative, owners and presidents must be involved in the control system through independent performance checks. In addition, they must assume key duties such as check signing and monthly bank account reconciliations. A thorough discussion of the creation of a school-wide internal control environment is beyond the scope of this volume. However, we want to emphasize the importance of a school-wide commitment to control activities that begins with a school's chief executive and involves all employees who in any way participate in the school's FSA programs or are responsible for FSA funds. September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Control activities important in managing FSA funds To participate in federally funded student financial aid programs, a school must be able to demonstrate that adequate checks and balances are in place. A school's internal control system should, at a minimum, include separating the functions of authorizing and awarding FSA aid and disbursing FSA program funds; taking trial balances (to determine whether accounts are in balance); reconciling cash (a reconciliation between accounting [ledger] balances and bank balances); reconciling federal funds (ensuring that all federal funds drawn down are appropriately disbursed or returned within the time frames allowed by regulation); and maintaining adequate electronic data processing (EDP) controls. A school should use its internal audits or external audits to verify that the systems of checks and balances in place at the school have been properly designed and are being followed routinely. The separation of functions To accomplish separation of duties, duties are divided among different individuals to reduce the risk of error or inappropriate action (for example, when the employee or office responsible for safeguarding an asset is someone other than the employee or office that maintains accounting records for that asset). In general, responsibility for related transactions should be divided among employees so that one employee's work serves as a check on the work of other employees. When duties are separated, there must be collusion between employees for assets to be stolen and the theft disguised in the accounting records. Federal regulations require a school to separate the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing funds so that no single office or individual exercises both functions for any student receiving FSA funds. Even very small institutions with limited staff are not exempt from this requirement. These two functions must be performed by individuals who are not members of the same family (as defined in the margin), who do not together exercise substantial control over the school, and who are organizationally independent. Individuals responsible for authorizing or disbursing FSA funds may not do both, but they may perform other functions as well. If a school performs these functions by computer, no one person may have the ability to change data that affect both the authorization and disbursement of FSA funds.Separating functions 34 CFR 668.16(c)(2) Family defined A member of a person's family is a parent, sibling, spouse, child, spouse's parent or sibling, or sibling's or child's spouse. 34 CFR 668.15(f)(3) Definition Ownership Systems4-179 FSA HB September 2018Typically, the financial aid office is responsible for authorizing disbursements by awarding aid through the need analysis and packaging processes. Awards are then turned over to a business office that typically requests funds from ED's Grant Administration and Payment System (G5), and disburses the funds by crediting student accounts, delivering checks to students, authorizing an EFT, or delivering cash to students. The person (or office) that awards FSA funds may not sign checks or deliver them to students, nor be permitted to disburse cash to students, or to credit student accounts with FSA funds to cover allowable costs (such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, or other authorized charges). There should also be a segregation of functions within the business office. This separation should provide that the individual within the school who reconciles federal cash does not also receive federal cash or disburse it. This will ensure that several individuals at the school evaluate federal funds and, at each step of the process, that the applicable regulations are being followed. The person performing reconciliations should receive bank statements and Direct Loan reconciliation reports directly from the respective, appropriate sources. Supervisory approval of the completed reconciliations should also be obtained and documented on the forms. While electronic processes enhance accuracy and efficiency, they also can blur separation of functions so the awarding and disbursement occur virtually simultaneously. Schools must set up controls that prevent an individual or an office from having the authority (or the ability) to perform both functions. In addition, your system also should have controls that prevent cross-functional tampering. For example, financial aid office employees should not be able to change data elements that are entered by the registrar's office. Finally, your system only should allow individuals with special security classifications to make changes to the programs that determine student need and awards, and it should be able to identify the individuals who make such changes. For further guidance on the separation of functions, contact the Department's Case Management and Oversight Team that serves your school's state. Remember, because electronic processes can blur separation of functions, a school must be careful to create controls that ensure separation of authorizing FSA payments and disbursing FSA payments. This also applies within the business office itself. One individual should not be solely responsible for receiving funds and reconciling those funds.Internal Controls In Automated Systems Since no one person may have the ability to change data that affect both authorization and disbursement, if award entries made by the financial aid office automatically roll over and populate award fields in the business office, then the separation of functions must take place elsewhere. For example, if your system automatically awards funds based on a student's budget and/or need, then your system must ensure that only employees with a special security standing can change those budgets or otherwise modify a student's award. In addition, your system must be able to identify any employee who makes a change to a data element or program that can affect the level of a student's award (anyone who initiates a budget or award override).4-180 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Trial balance A trial balance is the confirmation that debit and credit balances are equal. A trial balance for federal student financial aid programs is a confirmation that accounts receivable, program expenditures, and the cash balance equal the amount of aid that has been authorized by the financial aid office. To be effective, taking a trial balance should be performed at least monthly and reconciling cash should be performed when bank statements are received or at least monthly if statements are received more frequently. Reconciliation of bank records Since cash is more susceptible to manipulation than other assets, multiple checks and balances are necessary for effective internal control of cash. Reconciling cash is one confirmation that the cash balance shown in the school's accounting records is in agreement with the balance reflected in the school's bank statement. Differences between the school's accounting records and the school's bank statement balance can be caused by timing variances, errors, or unrecorded entries. The bank reconciliation process can lead to adjusting entries for bank service charges; non-sufficient funds (NSF) charges; debit and/or credit memoranda; and correcting errors. The individual performing bank reconciliation should be trained to recognize and report sources of errors such as delays in deposit; checks that remain outstanding after long periods of time; irregularities in funds transfers and adjustments; and deviations on canceled checks (payee, signature, or endorse - ment). The prompt and thorough performance of bank reconciliation duties enhances the internal control system. Note that if a school maintains separate bank accounts for each program, a separate bank reconciliation process should be performed for each account/program.Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management FSA funds Reconciliation of FSA funds is a key component of internal control in the FSA programs. A school reconciles data when, for example, on the FISAP it reports cumulative data for its Federal Perkins Loan portfolio. A school also performs reconciliation on an annual basis when it reports annual FSEOG data on the FISAP and when it closes out its general ledger. However, to help fulfill its responsibility to safeguard federal funds and ensure they are expended as intended, a school must perform reconciliation in each FSA program monthly. That is, to provide adequate internal controls, a school must have a system for comparing separately, for each FSA program, the total draws recorded in G5 in a 30-day period to the amount disbursed to students or returned to the Department and explaining all discrepancies. Reconciliation in the FSA programs is an internal control procedure that helps ensure that a school has met its fiduciary responsibility to use its FSA funds in the manner and for the purposes prescribed by regulations. The process of reconciliation as required in the regulations applies primarily to a school's accounting records. Other internal control procedures ensure that a school's other fiscal records and its program records are being maintained properly and that they accurately reflect the school's FSA operations. During reconciliation, a school compares its G5 records to its banking records, and the accounting entries in its FSA cash accounts to the accounting entries in its FSA disbursement accounts. The reconciliation process will seek to explain the differences between the funds the school received and the funds the school disbursed or returned. Regulations require that all federal funds drawn down be accounted for. Moreover, a school must identify expenditures of FSA funds on a student-by-student basis. So, if the trial balances run for one or more of the FSA programs fail to show that all federal funds received by the school were disbursed or returned in the time frames allowed by regulations, the school will have to examine its accounting detail (student- by-student records) to identify the discrepancies keeping the accounts out of balance. All discrepancies must be explained for the accounts to be considered reconciled. A key element in the reconciliation process is the clear audit trail a school's accounting records should provide. That audit trail should track FSA funds from G5 to individual students. Part of the monthly reconciliation a school must perform requires examining fiscal and program records to ensure that they agree with and substantiate the reconciled accounting records. Note: Generally, program records are maintained by the financial aid office and fiscal records by the business office. Required fiscal records 34 CFR 668.24(b) Reconciliation is one of the tools a school uses to evaluate its system for accounting for the receipt and expenditure of FSA funds in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Examining its cash draws as recorded in G5 for the previous 30- day period, a school finds a record of a drawdown of $75,000 in federal funds identified as FSEOG federal share. 2. The school examines its bank records for the account the school has designated to receive FSA funds to ensure that the funds were received. 3. In the school's G5 Cash Control Account, the $75,000 is entered as an offset to $75,000 in G5 Accounts Receivable. 4. The records show a $75,000 credit to the G5 Cash Control Account (an asset account) and a $75,000 debit to the income account, FSEOG Transfer from G5. 5. At the same time the records should show that the school deposited its match1\u2014credited its Institutional Cash Account with $25,000, and debited Institution's Cash Contributions (its G5 income account) with $25,000. (Note that the detail record for this transaction is the school's bank records and its internal subsidiary ledgers.) 6. The records show a $75,000 credit in FSEOG Transfer from G5 and $25,000 credit in Institution's Cash Contributions and debits of $25,000 and $75,000 to the expense account Student Grants Paid\u2014FSEOG. 7. Student Grants Paid\u2014FSEOG shows a credit of $100,000 to the individual student accounts. (The records might show one credit of $100,000 to a memo account in which the detail of the individual students who received the grants is present.) 8. The student account records (student account cards in a manual system) are fiscal records (not program records). The account records are the detail records that substantiate the subsidiary ledger Student Grants Paid. They substantiate that the $75,000 G5 draw was used as intended. 1. If a school matches with tuition, fees, room and board, waivers, etc., the school's accounting records must show a clear audit trail from the noncash match in the student's account to the memo account September 2018Questions you can ask about your program and fiscal records include the following: What program records does your school use to determine the amount of your federal funds request to G5. Do the date and amount of your anticipated disbursements of grant, loan, and FWS payroll funds support the cash requests you've made to G5? Do the amounts and dates of your school's calculations of refunds or overpayments made or due to ED, and the amounts and dates of return calculations for students who withdraw substantiate the entries in the G5 cash control contra account Funds Returned to ED? As part of your school's internal control procedures, you should have a system that examines your fiscal and program records to ensure they are in agreement and support your accounting records. We will provide examples of those internal control procedures in our discussion of the individual FSA programs. Electronic data processing (EDP) controls The Department continues to encourage and support schools' use of electronic recordkeeping and communications. Of course, any time a school electronically transfers funds, records or transmits confidential information, or obtains a student's confirmation, acknowledgment, or approval, the school must adopt reasonable safeguards against possible fraud and abuse. Such safeguards include: creating written policies and procedures for the security and proper operation of student information systems that go all the way down to the individual user level; informing authorized users of guidelines for proper system use, and having users acknowledge their responsibilities by signing an acknowledgment statement; issuing unique user IDs and passwords to each employee to en - sure individual user accountability; changing passwords frequently; revoking access for unsuccessful logins; segregation of computer security duties and responsibilities, including granting appropriate levels of access to staff and lim - iting an employee's access to only those functions necessary to perform his/her assigned duties; establishing adequate software-security controls, audit func - tions, user identification, entry point tracking, and system surveys (these security controls should be sufficient to indicate or detect possible misuse, abuse, or unauthorized activity on the system), and conducting random audits of the system using the aforementioned functions;4-184 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 providing adequate provisions for system and data back up, contingency, disaster recovery, and business resumption; conducting security tests of code access; and physical computer security. Before the start of an award year, you should test your school's automated packaging program to ensure that the calculations used to determine the amount of students' grant, loan, or FWS awards yield consistent results, and that the awards that result are within the amounts allowed by regulation. In addition, you should compare the records of awards made to students by the financial aid office to the records of those awards in the business office. Other checks and balances Assigning specific duties to individual employees When the responsibility for a particular work function is assigned to one employee or to a small group of employees, that employee (or that group) is accountable for specific tasks. Then, if a problem oc - curs, the employee responsible can be easily identified. Rotating job assignments Some schools cross train their employees and rotate job assign - ments each fiscal year. This policy discourages employees from engaging in long-term schemes to defraud the school and ED. Rotating assignments also makes it more likely that theft or misuse will be discovered quickly because an employee in a new assignment will quickly identify behavior or records that are out of compliance with school policy or ED regulations. Mechanical devices and system safeguards Requiring the use of simple mechanical devices can often reduce temptation and prevent theft. For example, schools that distribute FSA credit balances by check should adopt procedures that ensure that checks that cannot be delivered are returned to a lockbox type device\u2014not to the school's mail room. Returned checks should be recorded and provided the same safeguards as cash.Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-185 FSA HB September 2018Policies and procedures manuals Control activities usually involve two elements\u2014policies establishing what should be done, and procedures to effect the policies. For example, in evaluating satisfactory academic progress (SAP), a school might have a policy that, to be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress, a student must have a 2.0 GPA once that student has attempted 60 credits. The procedures associated with that policy are the action steps the school takes to measure a student's progress in increments and intervene with students who appear to be in danger of failing to achieve the required GPA. Many factors support the creation of a written policies and procedures manual for a school's participation in the FSA programs. The first factor is compliance with Department regulations. In some cases, e.g., verification deadlines, withdrawal procedures, approved leaves of absence and SAP, schools are required by ED regulations to have written procedures and to make them available. Second, for policies and procedures to be created with input from all appropriate offices within an organization the draft versions must be in writing so everyone works from the same starting point. Third, thoughtful, conscientious, and consistent implementation of any organization-wide activity requires a mutually agreed upon and understood framework for the activity. Finally, a comprehensive, well-written policies and procedures manual can document how and when the school establishes specific policies and procedures; provide a single location for the school's policies and proce - dures; serve as a valuable reference during a program review or audit; and provide the basis for orientation and training of new employees and refreshing the skills of current employees. The Department strongly recommends that participating schools create policies and procedures manuals that cover the entirety of the school's participation in the FSA programs. We believe that an all-inclusive policies and procedures manual is critical to establishing internal controls and ensuring effective and efficient operation of a school's FSA programs. We encourage those individuals responsible for participating in schools' business operations to join with their colleagues in financial aid in creating a comprehensive FSA policies and procedures manual for their schools.The FSA Assessments can also help schools create a policy and procedure manual.

4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 EVALUATING AND IMPROVING YOUR SCHOOL'S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Improving the way schools manage the Federal Student Aid programs is a priority for the Department, and should be one for school business and financial aid officers. Strengthening your school's administration of FSA aid begins with an annual analysis of existing procedures, practices, and polices, is followed by an honest evaluation of where you have been successful and where improvements are needed, and concludes with planning for the upcoming year. An annual program of analysis, evaluation, and planning can help your school ensure its compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and promote constant improvement in your procedures, practices, and polices. The primary methods for evaluating a school's management of the FSA programs are self-evaluation and peer evaluation. Self-evaluation Compliance is a requirement, but quality is a choice. If your school is serious about this choice, the Department provides a way for you to conduct a practical self-evaluation of your FSA programs. The Department has developed an FSA Assessment Tool that is intended to help schools examine and improve their management of the FSA programs. The FSA Assessment Tool can be used to evaluate and analyze a school's existing policies, procedures, and practices to determine where improvements are needed. The Department encourages schools to use the assessment activities on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance and establish the foundation for continuous improvement. The FSA Assessment Tool consists of a comprehensive set of activities and questions designed to help your school assess its current FSA operations. Each assessment contains the major functional requirements, as well as suggested assessment steps. The assessments can help you anticipate and address problems; spot-check the systems you are using to manage information; prepare for an audit or other review; maximize the efficiency of your staff in handling their duties; and continuously revise your approaches to management of the FSA programs according to your campus needs. Appendix B\u2014 A School's Financial Management Systems4-189 FSA HB September 2018FSA Assessment topics currently available include the following: 1. Student Eligibility 2. Satisfactory Academic Progress 3. FSA Verification 4. Institutional Eligibility Recertification Change In Ownership Administrative Capabilities 5. Default Prevention Management 6. Direct Loans 7.

Automation To enhance their effectiveness, the Assessment Tools include activities to test compliance and procedures. The Assessment Tools also are linked to the latest regulations, Dear Colleague Letters, Federal Registers, and other related documents. Downloadable Microsoft Word documents include the hyperlinks as well. Those who download any of the FSA Assessments can access all hyperlinks through their Internet service provider (ISP). Since financial aid is an institutional responsibility, some assessments may need to involve several offices on campus (financial aid, business office, admissions) to complete the assessment. A second tool for self improvement is The Self-Evaluation Guide , published by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA). It provides a step-by-step outline for reviewing financial aid and fiscal policies, procedures, and practices. It can help your school develop a comprehensive system for evaluating its FSA participation.DL quality assurance 34 CFR 685.300(b)(9) See the electronic announcement of November 13, 2013 , for information about the Direct Loan quality assurance requirement. See also Activity 2 on the Direct Loans page of the QA website . Note that the DL quality assurance requirement is not the same as, nor does it fall under, the QA Program.4-190 FSA HB September 2018Volume 4\u2014Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds, 2018-2019 Peer evaluation Peer evaluation is another technique your school can employ to obtain an independent, objective review of your administration of FSA programs. A peer evaluator can be a financial aid administrator or fiscal officer from another school or a financial aid consultant. During a peer evaluation, a school obtains an objective assessment of its operation from someone at a similar school. The person performing the evaluation also benefits by getting a firsthand look at how another school manages financial aid programs. Comparing notes and exchanging ideas are methods by which colleagues in financial aid offices and business offices can share their expertise for improved FSA administration.Appendix B\u2014 A School's *Refunds of Cash are entered as negative numbers on this spreadsheet for the summation for Net Drawdowns/Payments to calculate correctly.SCHOOL FINAID SYSTEM TO COD SCHOOL ACCOUNT STATEMENT RECONCILIATION REPORT As of Date: 4-192 FSA HB September 2018Volume $0 $0 *Refunds of Cash are entered as negative numbers on this spreadsheet, for the summation for Net Drawdowns/Payments to calculate correctly. **Since the Business Office usually does not distinguish booked from unbooked, these figures are a total of all actual disbursements at the school.SCHOOL INTERNAL RECONCILIATION REPORT As of Date: 5-1 FSA HB November 2018 An overpayment occurs when the student receives more aid than he or she was eligible to receive. One kind of overpayment, traditionally called an overaward, results from changes in the student's aid package; a second occurs when a student withdraws. This volume covers how a school should respond when a student withdraws. Here, we provide a summary of the changes and clarifications presented in greater detail in the chapters that follow. Alone the text herein does not provide schools with the guidance needed to satisfactorily administer the Title IV HEA programs . For more complete guidance, you should refer to the text in the chapters cited, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and the Higher Education Act (HEA) as amended. Throughout this volume, new information is indicated with the following symbol: When the text represents a clarification rather than a change, it is indicated with: When we believe that historically there might be some misunderstanding of a requirement, we indicate that with: If we want to point out a bit of helpful information, we indicate it with: Finally, if we want to draw your attention to something, we indicate it with: Notes on Active Links At the top of each page you will find links to Dear Colleague Letters, the Code of Federal Regulation, and the Federal Student Aid Glossary and Appendices.NEW Reminder TIPClarification CFR Glossary DCL Introduction to Volume 5Major Changes Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds t We remind schools that once a student has begun attendance in a payment period, the school must perform an R2T4 calculation if the student withdraws or is granted a retroactive withdrawal. t We remind schools that, if a student who has begun attendance, the institution changes the amount of institutional charges it is assessing a student or decides to eliminate all institutional charges, those changes affect neither the charges nor aid earned in the calculation . t We remind schools that when a student is charged for a period longer than a payment period, the institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period are the greater of (a) the prorated amount of institutional charges for the longer period; or (b) the amount of title IV assistance retained for institutional charges as of the student's withdrawal date (e.g., when a student has provided an authorization to retain funds). Chapter 2\u2014The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation t We clarify that the rule on multiple payment periods is only applicable to nonstandard term credit hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal in length. t We have added an additional example on performing an R2T4 calculation for a student receiving aid under two payment period definitions. t We added a sidebar directing schools to an expanded discussion of proration in Volume 4, Chapter 2 , and reminding schools that they may always exclude from institutional charges in an R2T4 calculation the documented cost to the school (what the school paid for the items) of unreturnable equipment and returnable equipment not returned in good condition. t We explain what a school should do when it cannot locate a student for whom it holds a Title IV credit balance if the student has outstanding Direct Loans. t We remind schools that two years is the maximum time a school may allow in a satisfactory agreement to repay a grant overpayment that is a result of an R2T4 calculation. t We remind schools that a school must have a procedure in place that ensures the school immediately refers for collection (to the Default Resolution Group) any student who violates the terms of the repayment agreement (including failing to repay the full amount within two years). t We remind schools that the Department may take enforcement action against schools that fail to refer for collection any student who violates the terms of his or her repayment agreement. Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds t We modified Case Study 5 to show that first the school prorated the student's charges, and then excluded the cost of unreturned equipment from the institutional charges for the period. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, HB November 20185-3 FSA HB November 2018Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds This chapter will discuss the general requirements for the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws.CFR Glossary DCL WITHDRAWALS This chapter explains how Title IV funds are handled when a recipient of those funds ceases to be enrolled (100% withdrawal) prior to the end of a payment period or period of enro llment. These requirements do not apply to a student who does not actually begin attendance or cease attendance at the school. For example, when a student reduces his or her course load from 12 credits to 9 credits, the reduction represents a change in enrollment status, not a withdrawal. Therefore, no Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4) calculation is required. The R2T4 regulations do not dictate an institutional refund policy. Instead, a school is required to determine the earned and unearned portions of Title IV aid as of the date the student ceased attendance based on the amount of time the student spent in attendance or, in the case of a clock-hour program, was scheduled to be in attendance. Up through the 60% point in each payment period or period of enrollment, a pro rata schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds the student has earned at the time of withdrawal. After the 60% point in the payment period or period of enrollment, a student has earned 100% of the Title IV funds the student was scheduled to receive during the period. For a student who withdraws after the 60% point-in-time, there are no unearned funds. However, a school must still determine whether the student is eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement (PWD). The R2T4 regulations do not prohibit a school from developing its own refund policy. However, the school must comply with refund policies required by a state or other outside agencies. Although a school, state or agency refund policy will determine the charges a student will owe after withdrawing, those policies will not affect the amount of Title IV Aid the student has earned under the R2T4 calculation.Return of Title IV funds HEA, Section 484B 34 CFR 668.22 The FSA Assessment Module that can assist you in understanding and assessing your compliance with the provisions of this chapter is \"Return of Title IV Funds,\" at: https://ifap.ed.gov/qahome/ qaassessments/returntivfunds.htmlTerminology In other Handbook volumes when we speak collectively of Federal Pell Grants Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants TEACH Grants FSEOG Grants Direct Loans we use the term \"federal student aid programs.\" In this volume, because the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 are commonly referred to as the Return of Title IV Funds requirements, we use \"Title IV Programs.\" Reporting required If a school determines that a student has withdrawn, the student is no longer considered to be enrolled and in attendance. Therefore, the student is no longer eligible for in-school status or an in-school deferment, and the school must report the student as withdrawn in NSLDS Enrollment Reporting. Schools are encouraged to access the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) Professional Access Website at https://www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/nslds_FAP/ and update the student's enrollment status to \"W\" to ensure the timeliest processing of the information. 685.309(b) and 34 CFR 682.610(c)) CHAPTERC 1Volume DCL 5-4 FSA HB November 2018General requirements Title IV funds are awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws, the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that the student was originally scheduled to receive. If a recipient of Title IV grant or loan funds withdraws from a school after beginning attendance, the school must perform an R2T4 calculation to determine the amount of Title IV assistance earned by the student. If the amount disbursed to the student is greater than the amount the student earned, the unearned funds must be returned. If the amount disbursed to the student is less than the amount the student earned, and for which the student is otherwise eligible, he or she is eligible to receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. When a student is considered to have withdrawn A student is considered to have withdrawn from a payment period or period of enrollment if in the case of a program that is measured in credit hours, the student does not complete all the days in the payment period or period of enrollment that the student was scheduled to complete; in the case of a program that is measured in clock hours, the student does not complete all of the clock hours and weeks of instructional time in the payment period or period of enrollment that the student was scheduled to complete; or for a student in a nonterm or nonstandard-term program, the student is not scheduled to begin another course within a pay - ment period or period of enrollment for more than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending, unless the student is on an approved leave of absence, as defined later in this chapter. Please see Withdrawals from programs offered in modules in Chapter 2 for more information about withdrawals from modular programs. If a student remains enrolled only in non-Title IV-eligible courses A student's schedule sometimes includes courses the student is taking for credit and for which he or she may receive Title IV funds, and courses for which the student may not receive Title IV funds \u2014courses the student is auditing, completing (courses in which he or she previously received an \"Incomplete\"), or repeating for a second or greater time (See Satisfactory Academic Progress in Volume 1, and Retaking Coursework in Term-based Programs in Volume 3 for additional information).When a Student Withdraws Before a School's Census Date A student begins earning Title IV funds on his or her first day of attendance. Therefore, even if a student withdraws before a school's census date, the school must perform an R2T4 calculation using the number of days the student attended or the number of scheduled clock hours the student attended class (see Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned in Chapter 2.) The school must include in the R2T4 calculation all forms of Title IV aid that were disbursed or that could have been disbursed, even if the student receives a full tuition refund. Tuition Refunds and Retroactive Withdrawals Tuition refunds following a student's withdrawal have no impact on the amount of Title IV aid that the student has earned under a R2T4 calculation. If a student withdraws during a term and a school provides a full tuition refund for that term (for example, for special circumstances such as medical reasons), the school may not return more Title IV aid than the R2T4 calculation specifies unless it seeks, and subsequently receives, the student's permission to do so. If a student drops classes (or is administratively dropped/withdrawn) by a school) on the same day the student withdraws, or if the student is later granted a retroactive withdrawal, the student's enrollment status and charges are not adjusted to reflect the dropped classes for R2T4 purposes.Reminder TIPChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If a student ceases attendance (drops or withdraws) from all his or her Title IV, eligible courses in a payment period or period of enrollment, the student must be considered a withdrawal for Title IV purposes. The principle is the same for programs offered in modules within terms . For example, a student is scheduled to attend one course in each of five modules during a semester. The student receives an incomplete in course number two in the second module and, because the student may not progress to course number three until course number two is completed, the student completes the remaining portion of course number two in the third module. While the student is completing the incomplete portion of module number two in the period during which the student was to have been taking the third module, he or she is not considered to be enrolled in the course for Title IV purposes, so attendance of just that course does not count as attendance for purposes of the R2T4 requirements. Therefore, For the student enrolled in modules within terms not to be considered a withdrawal for Title IV purposes, the institution would need to obtain written confirmation of future attendance in a Title IV eligible course later in the semester at the time that would have otherwise been a withdrawal in accordance with 34 CFR 668.22(a)(2)(ii), or put the student on an approved leave of absence, for the student not to be considered a withdrawal for Title IV purposes. In the absence of written confirmation of future attendance or being placed on an approved leave of absence, an R2T4 calculation would be required. However, if the student subsequently returns to a Title IV, eligible course later in the period, the student's R2T4 calculation would be undone in accordance with 34 CFR 668.22(a)(2)(iii). When a student who fails to begin attendance in all the courses he or she was scheduled to attend withdraws Anytime a student begins attendance in at least one course but does not begin attendance in all the courses the student was scheduled to attend regardless of whether the student is a withdrawal, the school must determine if it is necessary to recalculate the student's eligibility for Pell Grant and Campus-Based funds based on a revised enrollment status and cost of attendance. If the student is a withdrawal, this recalculation must be done before performing an R2T4 calculation, and the school must use the recalculated amounts of aid in the R2T4 calculation. If a student who has withdrawn did not begin attendance in enough courses to establish a half-time enrollment status, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student after the student withdraws. However, the funds are included as Aid that could have been disbursed in the R2T4 calculation. For more information, please see the discussion under Withdrawals from programs offered in modules in Chapter 2.See the discussion under Title IV Aid that could have been disbursed later in this chapter for a complete discussion of that topic.TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title 5-6 FSA HB November 2018Worksheets and the R2T4 Web product The Department has developed worksheets and software to assist schools in implementing the R2T4 regulations (you can find blank worksheets in the appendix at the end of this volume). There is one worksheet for students who withdraw from credit-hour programs and one for students who withdraw from clock-hour programs. These worksheets are also in portable document file (PDF) format on the Department's Information for Financial Aid Professionals website at: ifap.ed.gov/ifap/wst.jsp The Department has developed an R2T4 Web product. It is accessible via the main menu of the FAA Access at the CPS Online website: https://faaaccess.ed.gov/FOTWWebApp/faa/faa.jsp The Return of Title IV Funds on the Web in FAA Access to CPS Online has not been updated to include Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. If schools need to complete an R2T4 calculation for a student who received the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, they should use the worksheets described above. The use of the Department's worksheets and the Web Product is optional. Consumer information In the consumer information a school must make available upon request to prospective and enrolled students, the school must include a statement of any refund policy with which the school must comply, the requirements for the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws, and the requirements and procedures for officially withdrawing from the school.Consumer information HEA Sec. 485(a)(1)(F), 34 CFR 668.43 For more information, see Appendix F\u2014 Institutional Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. Changing the Basis of the Calculation A school may change the basis for its R2T4 calculations for new students as they begin classes. However, for continuing students, since the institution's Return policy must be included in the published materials the school provides to students as part of the consumer information requirement, the school would have to change its catalog, its written policies and procedures, and its enrollment agreements (if any), and allow sufficient time for those continuing students who would be governed by the new policy to receive and review the materials.Technical Questions Technical questions on the Return of Title IV funds Web product are handled by the CPS at: 1-800-330-5947 or via email at cpssaig@ed.gov Access to R2T4 Web Product via CPS Online Individual staff members must be enrolled in the SAIG in order to have access to the Return Web product. Your school's SAIG Destination Point Administrator (DPA) can enroll the selected staff members via the SAIG Enrollment website at: http://fsawebenroll.ed.govChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL A school should provide sufficient information for a student or prospective student to determine the procedures for withdrawing and the financial consequences of doing so. In addition, a student should be able to estimate how much Title IV aid the student will retain and how much the student may have to return upon withdrawing. Since the R2T4 provisions do not affect institutional refund policies, a school must provide a student with information on both the school's refund policy and the R2T4 requirements, and explain the interaction between the two. The information should include a discussion of how a school might adjust a student's charges to take into account any return of funds the school might be required to make. Finally, a student or prospective student should be informed that if he or she withdraws, institutional charges that were previously paid by Title IV funds might become a debt that the student would be responsible for paying. As a part of the institution's disclosure of the procedures for officially withdrawing, the school must identify the offices the school has designated to accept notification of official withdrawals. GENERAL TITLE IV PRINCIPLES WITH SPECIAL APPLICABILITY IN THE RETURN OF TITLE IV AID Definition of a Title IV recipient The requirements for the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws apply to any recipient of Title IV grant or loan funds who ceases all attendance. For purposes of these requirements, a recipient of grant or loan assistance is a student who has actually received Title IV funds or has met the conditions that entitled the student to a late disbursement. These conditions are listed in the chart Conditions and Limitations on Late Disbursements in Volume 4 . The R2T4 requirements apply only to the receipt of or qualification for aid that can be included in the calculation. For example, the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 do not apply to Federal Work-Study (FWS) funds. Therefore, the R2T4 requirements do not apply to a student if the only Title IV program assistance that the student has received or could have received was FWS funds. Please note that if the student never actually began attendance for the payment period or period of enrollment, 34 CFR 668.22 does not apply. Likewise, if a student began attendance but was not and could not have been disbursed Title IV grant or loan funds prior to withdrawal, the student is not considered to have been a Title IV recipient and the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 do not apply. In these cases, Title IV funds would be handled in accordance with the regulations for returning funds for students who do not register or fail to begin attendance (see sidebar).Sample Summary Provided A sample summary of the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 is provided at the end of this chapter. Title IV Recipient In determining whether the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 apply, a school must first determine whether a student was eligible to receive any Title IV funds. If a Student Withdraws Before Title IV Funds Are Disbursed Even if a student paid all institutional charges and ceased enrollment prior to Title IV funds being disbursed, if Title IV funds could have been disbursed, the institution must determine the Title IV funds earned by the student and follow the procedures for making a post-withdrawal disbursement. Returning funds for students who do not register or fail to begin attendance 5-8 FSA HB November 2018Verification impose no additional liability for interim disbursements made to students selected for verification. However, the R2T4 requirements do place limits on interim disbursements that can be made to students selected for verification who have ceased attendance. A school may not make an interim disbursement to a student after the student has ceased attendance. The Department establishes deadlines for the submission of required verification documents that apply to all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based Program and Direct Loan Program, a school may establish an institutional verification deadline that may be earlier than the date established by the Department. The institution must include its verification deadlines in the consumer materials it provides to students. When a school is completing an R2T4 calculation for a student subject to verification the following rules apply: A school must offer any post-withdrawal disbursemen t of loan funds with in 30 days of the date the school determined the stu - dent withdrew. A school must always return any unearned Title IV funds it is responsible for returning within 45 days of the date the school determined the student withdrew. A school must disburse any Title IV grant funds a student is due as part of a post-withdrawal disbursement within 45 days of the date the school determined the student withdrew and disburse any loan funds a student accepts within 180 days of the date the school determined the student withdrew. Unless a student subject to verification has provided all required verification documents in time for the school to meet the R2T4 deadlines, the school includes as Aid disbursed or Aid that could have been disbursed in the R2T4 calculation only those Title IV funds not subject to verification. If a student who failed to provide all required verification documents in time for the school to meet the R2T4 deadline later provides those documents prior to the applicable verification deadline, the school must perform a new R2T4 calculation based on all of the aid the student qualified for based on the completed verification documents and make the appropriate adjustments.No Earlier Verification Deadline for Pell For the Pell Grant and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant programs, a school may not establish an earlier deadline than that established by the Department in its annual notice. Therefore, if a Pell-eligible student submits the documents required for verification no later than 120 days after the student's last day of attendance or the deadline established each year by the Department, whichever is earlier, a school must make any applicable post-withdrawal disbursement of the student's Pell Grant.Verification GEN-04-03 Revised, November 2004Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and Funds5-9 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When verification is completed before the R2T4 deadlines A school must offer any post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds within 30 days of the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew, and return any unearned funds and make a post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds within 45 days of that date . If a student provides all documents required fo r verification after withdrawing but before the verification submission deadline, and in time for the institution to meet the 30-day R2T4 deadline, the institution performs the R2T4 calculation including all Title IV aid for which the student has established eligibility as a result of verification and for which the conditions of a late disbursement had been met prior to the student's loss of eligibility due to withdrawal. (See Volume 4 and 34 CFR 668.164(j)(2).) When verification is not completed before the R2T4 deadlines If a student who has withdrawn does not provide the required documents in time for the school to complete the verification process and meet the R2T4 deadlines noted previously, the institution includes in the R2T4 calculation only the Title IV aid that was not subject to the verification process. For a student who failed to provide all required verification documents, the only aid that may be included in an R2T4 calculation are Direct PLUS Loan funds and Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (verification is not required for receipt of these funds) for which the conditions of a late disbursement (as discussed under Title IV Aid that could have been disbursed, in Chapter 2) were met prior to the student's loss of eligibility due to withdrawal. If a school has made an interim disbursement to a student who has failed to provide all the documents required for verification in time for the school to meet the 45-day R2T4 deadline, the student has failed to establish eligibility for the Title IV funds affected by verification. Therefore, the institution must return any Title IV funds subject to verification that were disbursed to the student on an interim basis and may not include any of those funds as aid that was or could have been disbursed in the R2T4 calculation.Verification and the 30-Day Deadline If, because verification is not complete, a school is unable to meet the requirement to offer a post-withdrawal disbursement directly to a student (or parent for a Direct PLUS Loan) within 30 days of the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew, once verification is complete, the school must perform a new R2T4 calculation. The school must offer the funds as soon as possible and should provide the student or parent with the minimum 14-day (or longer, if the school chooses) response period whenever possible. A school must make any post-withdrawal disbursement that results from the new R2T4 calculation as soon as possible but no later than the applicable 180-day late disbursement deadline.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-10 FSA HB November 2018When verification is completed after the R2T4 deadlines If, before the verification deadline but after the institution has completed the R2T4 calculation, a student provides all the documentation required for verification, the institution must perform a new R2T4 calculation including, as Aid that could have been disbursed all Title IV aid for which the student has established eligibility based upon verification and for which the conditions of a late disbursement have been met prior to the student's loss of eligibility due to withdrawal. If, as a result of verification, the student's eligibility for Federal Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and TEACH Grant funds has been reduced, only the reduced amount is included in the new R2T4 calculation. For additional information on verification, please consult The Application and Verification Guide . Approved leave of absence A leave of absence (LOA) fo r R2T4 purposes is a temporary interruption in a student's program of study. LOA refers to the specific time period during a program when a student is not in attendance. An LOA is not required if a student is not in attendance only for an institutionally scheduled break. However, a scheduled break may occur during an LOA. An LOA must meet certain conditions to be counted as a temporary interruption in a student's education instead of being counted as a withdrawal requiring a school to perform an R2T4 calculation. If an LOA does not meet the conditions in 34 CFR 668.22(d), the student is considered to have ceased attendance and to have withdrawn from the school, and the school is required to perform an R2T4 calculation. For an LOA to qualify as an approved LOA: the school must have a formal written policy regarding leaves of absence requiring that all requests for leaves of absence be submitted in writing and include the reason for the student's request; the student must follow the school's policy in requesting the LOA; there must be a reasonable expectation that the student will return from the LOA; the school must approve the student's request for an LOA in accordance with the school's policy; the institution may not assess the student any additional institutional charges, the student's need may not increase, and therefore, the student is not eligible for any additional Title IV aid;Maximum Time Frame for LOA When calculating the maximum time- frame for a student's approved LOA, the school must ensure that it accounts for all periods of nonattendance (including weekends and scheduled breaks). Thus, since an approved LOA may not be more than 180 days, a school might have to reduce the length of a student's LOA if the 180th day is scheduled to fall on a day the school would be closed. Full Tuition Credit An institution may grant a full tuition credit toward the course the student chooses to reenter as a way to comply with the requirement that the institution not assess the student any additional charges upon return from an approved leave of absence.Approved leave of absence 34 CFR 668.22(d)Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the November 2018CFR Glossary DCL the LOA, together with any additional leaves of absence, must not exceed a total of 180 days in any 12-month period; except in a clock-hour or nonterm credit-hour program, a stu - dent returning from an LOA must resume training at the same point in the academic program that he or she began the LOA; and if the student is a Title IV loan recipient, the school must ex - plain to the student, prior to granting the LOA, the effects that the student's failure to return from an LOA may have on the student's loan repayment terms, including the expiration of the student's grace period. A student granted an LOA that meets the criteria in this section is not considered to have withdrawn, and no R2T4 calculation is required. Upon the student's return from the leave, he or she continues to earn the Title IV aid previously awarded for the period. Written formal policy required Among the policies and procedures a school must maintain is one that discusses the procedures a student must follow in applying for a leave of absence and the criteria the school will apply in determining whether to approve the application. A school's LOA policy must specify that all requests for an LOA be submitted in writing, be signed, and be dated. As mentioned previously, the regulations provide that a school must determine, before it grants an LOA, that there is a reasonable expectation that the student will return from the leave. For the school to make such a determination and ensure that the student meets the criteria in the school's LOA policy, the school must know the student's reason for requesting the leave. Therefore, a school's LOA policy must specify that the reason for a student's leave request be included on a student's application for an LOA. A school's policy must require a student to apply in advance for an LOA unless unforeseen circumstances prevent the student from doing so. For example, if a student were injured in a car accident and needed a few weeks to recover before returning to school, the student would not have been able to request the LOA in advance. A school may grant an LOA to a student who did not provide the request prior to the LOA due to unforeseen circumstances if the school documents the reason for its decision and collects the request from the student at a later date. In this example, the beginning date of the approved LOA would be determined by the school to be the date the student was unable to attend school because of the accident. A school must publicize its LOA policy. The school may do this by including that policy in the consumer information the school makes available to students (see Volume 2 ).Disbursement Rules for Students on Leave of Absence You may NOT make a disbursement of the proceeds of a Direct Loan to a student on an LOA. You may disburse Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and FSEOG, funds to a student on an LOA. You must pay any funds that are part of a Title IV credit balance (and therefore are funds that have already been disbursed) to a student on an LOA. (See the discussion unde r Treatment of Title IV credit balances when a student withdraws later in this chapter.) Do not confuse a Return of Title IV funds approved LOA with your school's academic LOA. Many schools have academic policies that allow them to temporarily extend the length of a student's academic term in the event of conditions that prevent the student's on-time completion of an academic period. Typically, these academic LOAs do not meet the requirements of a Return of Title IV funds approved LOA. A school that grants a student an approved leave of absence must, in NSLDS Enrollment Reporting, report the student with a status of \"A\" (approved leave of absence).TIPTIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-12 FSA HB November 2018Reasonable expectation of return This condition is specified to make clear that a school may not grant a student an LOA merely to delay the return of unearned Title IV funds. Completion of coursework upon return in term-based credit-hour programs Approved leaves of absence are viewed as temporary interruptions in a student's attendance. For term-based programs, a student returning from an LOA must complete the term to be eligible to receive a second or subsequent disbursement. For an LOA to be an official LOA, a school must allow students enrolled in credit-hour term-based programs who are returning from a LOA to complete the coursework the student started prior to the LOA. The school may not impose additional charges and may not award the student additional Title IV assistance. Completion of coursework upon return in clock-hour and credit-hour nonterm programs For nonterm-based programs, the regulations provide that the payment peri od is the period of time it takes a student to complete both half the number of credits and half the number of weeks of instruction in the academic year, program, or remainder of the program. For clock- hour programs, the payment period is the period of time it takes a student to complete half the number of clock hours and half the weeks of instructional time in the academic year or remainder of the program. Therefore, for clock-hour and nonterm programs, it doesn't matter whether the student returns to the same course and point when the LOA began or the student starts in a new course within the program (so long as there are no additional charges). The student simply has to complete the number of clock hours or credit hours and the weeks of instruction in the payment period. A student may return early from a leave of absence A school may permit a student to return to class before the expiration of the student's LOA to review material previously covered. However, until the student has resumed the academic program at the point he or she began the LOA, the student is considered to still be on the approved LOA. If a student returns early, the days the student spends in class before the course reaches the point at which the student began his or her LOA must be counted in the 180 days maximum for an approved leave of absence. That is, a student repeating coursework while on an LOA must reach the point at which he or she interrupted training within the 180 days of the start of the student's LOA.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL The requirement that an institution not impose additional charges when an approved LOA ends and the student resumes his or her program of study applies when a student returns to repeat prior coursework. Moreover, even if the student enters at the beginning of the module or course from which he or she took the leave of absence, a student is not eligible for any additional Title IV program assistance for this preparatory phase. Since a student is still considered to be on an LOA while repeating prior coursework, if the student fails to resume attendance at the point in the academic program where he or she interrupted training at the beginning of the LOA, the student must be treated as a withdrawal. In that case, at an institution that is not required to take attendance, the date of the student's withdrawal that must be used in the R2T4 calculation is the date the student began the LOA. At an institution that is required to take attendance, the Last Date of Attendance (LDA) is used as the withdrawal date for a student that does not return from an LOA. Leaves of absence versus the grade of incomplete At term-based schools, students who are unable to complete the requirements of an individual course are often assigned the grade of incomplete (I). Students are usually expected to complete the required work within a reasonable time to receive credit and a passing grade. If a student is assigned an incomplete status for one or several courses but continues to attend other courses, the student is not considered to have withdrawn. A student who is awarded the grade of incomplete in all of his or her classes is not considered a student on an approved LOA unless the LOA meets the criteria in this section. Because of the criteria that must be met for an LOA to be an approved LOA, term-based schools can grant LOAs that meet the Department's criteria for an approved LOA in a very limited number of cases. A term-based, credit-hour institution that wishes to explore the possibility of granting an LOA that meets the criteria specified in 34 CFR 668.22(d) should call its School Participation Team for additional information.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title DCL 5-14 FSA HB November students on an LOA An LOA is a temporary break in the student's attendance during which, for purposes of determining whether an R2T4 calculation is required, the student is considered to be enrolled. Since students who are continuously enrolled are not assessed additional charges, any additional charges to a student, even minimal reentry charges, indicate that the institution does not truly consider the student to be on an approved LOA. No additional Title IV assistance while a student is on LOA Since an institution may not assess any additional charges to a student returning from LOA, the institution may not award any additional Title IV aid until the student has completed the coursework in which the student was enrolled when the leave was granted. An LOA may not exceed 180 days in any 12-month period Institutions, at their discretion, may grant a student multiple leaves of absence as long as the total number of days for all leaves does not exceed 180 days within a 12-month period. This 12-month period begins on the first day of the student's initial LOA . When a student fails to return from a leave of absence At an institution not required to take attendance, if a student does not return to the school at the expiration of an approved LOA (or a student takes an unapproved LOA), the student's withdrawal date is the date the student began the LOA. At an institution required to take attendance, the withdrawal date for the same student would always be the student's last day of attendance. If a student on an approved leave of absence fails to return within 180 days, the school must, in NSLDS Enrollment Reporting, report the student as withdrawn with the date the student began the LOA as the effective date.TIPChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return IV Funds5-15 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Explanation of the consequences of withdrawal to loan recipients granted an LOA A student who is granted an approved LOA remains in an in-school status for Title IV loan repayment purposes. If a student on an approved LOA fails to return, the school must report to the loan holder the student's change in enrollment status as of the withdrawal date. One possible consequence of not returning from an LOA is that a student's grace period for a Title IV program loan might be exhausted. Therefore, for an LOA to be an approved LOA, prior to granting a leave of absence, a school must inform a student who is a Title IV loan recipient of the possible consequences a withdrawal may have on the student's loan repayment terms, including the exhaustion of the student's grace period. Unapproved leaves of absence A school may grant a student an LOA that does not meet the conditions to be an approved LOA for Title IV purposes (for example, for academic reasons). However, an LOA that does not meet all of the conditions for an approved LOA is considered a withdrawal for Title IV purposes. The student's withdrawal date at an institution not required to take attendance is the date the student begins the LOA. At an institution required to take attendance, the student's withdrawal date is the student's last day of attendance. An unapproved LOA may not be treated as an unofficial withdrawal . An unofficial withdrawal is one where the school has not received notice from the student that the student has ceased or will cease attending the school. If a school has granted a student an unapproved LOA, the school would know immediately that the student had ceased attendance for Title IV purposes and must use the specified withdrawal date in the R2T4 calculation. Deferment or Forbearance A student who has exhausted his or her grace period and is unable to begin repayment of a loan may apply for a deferment or forbearance of paymen t.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-16 FSA HB November 2018INSTITUTIONAL CHARGES Institutional charges are used to determine the portion of unearned Title IV aid that the school is responsible for returning. Schools must ensure that all appropriate fees, as well as applicable charges for books, supplies, materials, and equipment, are included in Step 5, Part G of the R2T4 calculation (see Example of institutional charges versus non- institutional charges later in this chapter). Institutional charges do not affect the amount of Title IV aid that a student earns when he or she withdraws. Use of institutional charges in determining a school's responsibility for returning funds The institutional charges used in the calculation usually are the charges that were initially assessed the student for the entire payment period or period of enrollment as applicable. Initial charges may only be adjusted by those changes the institution made prior to the student's withdrawal (for example, for a change in enrollment status unrelated to the withdrawa l). If, at the time of the withdrawal or afterward, the school changes the amount of institutional charges it is assessing a student or decides to eliminate all institutional charges, those changes affect neither the charges nor aid earned in the calculation. (Please see Step 3\u2014 Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student, in Chapter 2 for a further discussion of aid earned and institutional charges.) The R2T4 regulations presume that Title IV program funds are used to pay institutional charges ahead of all other sources of aid. Institutional charges may not be reduced even if other sources of aid are used to pay those charges . For example, a school may not reduce institutional charges when an outside agency supplying aid requires that aid to be used for tuition.Institutional charges 34 CFR 668.22(g)(1)(ii) \u00a7 668.22(g)(2) DCL GEN-00-24 Fees as noninstitutional charges Application fees are excluded from institutional charges because they are not an educational cost. (Federal Register, Vol. 59, No. 82, April 29, 1994, page 22356). Institutional charges and cost of attendance If a charge may not be included in a student's cost of attendance, it may not be covered with Title IV aid and, therefore, is not counted as an institutional or noninstitutional charge for Return of Title IV funds purposes. See Volume 3, for information on cost of attendance. Institutional charges and third-party housing If an institution enters into a contract with a third party to provide institutional housing, the institution must include the cost of housing as an institutional charge in a R2T4 calculation. Charges for non-title iv-eligible courses A school should not include in Step 5, Block L, of the R2T4 calculation tuition charges for courses for which the student may not receive Title IV funds.Reminder TIPChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Institutional versus noninstitutional charges Institutional charges generally are defined as the charges for tuition and fees, room and board, and other educational expenses that are paid to the school directly. If a fee (like an enrollment fee, registration or technology fee) is required for all students in a program, is part of an enrollment agreement or an addendum to it, or is a fee for which a school routinely debits a students' ledger, then the fee is considered an institutional charge. A charge does not have to appear on a student's account to be considered an institutional charge. The following educational expenses must be considered institutional charges: all charges for tuition, fees, and room and board (if contracted with the school); expenses for required course materials (books, kits, tools, supplies, etc.) if the student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase the required course materials from any place but the school. Exceptions: Excludable costs are costs a school may exclude from the total amount of institutional costs, such as the documented cost of unreturnable equipment and documented cost of returnable equipment if not returned in good condition within 20 days of withdrawal. Noninstitutional charges ( not included in an R2T4 calculation ) include the following: charges for any required course materials that a school can document a student had a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase elsewhere (see the discussion that follows); charges to a student's account for group health insurance fees if the insurance is required for all students and the coverage remains in effect for the entire period for which the student was charged, despite the student's withdrawal, and charges to a student's account for discretionary, educationally related expenses (e.g., parking or library fines, the cost of athletic or concert tickets, etc.).Three Principles Associated With Institutional Charges Published in a January 7, 1999, policy bulletin, these principles are applicable to determining institutional charges. Principle 1: Most costs charged by the school are institutional charges. The most important principle to keep in mind is that all tuition, fees, room and board, and other educationally related charges a school assesses a student are institutional charges, unless demonstrated otherwise. If you want to exclude specific charges or costs from a calculation, you must document that the charges are not institutional charges. Principle 2: An institutional charge does not need to be assessed to all students. A charge assessed to all students enrolled in a course or program is an institutional charge whether or not it is assessed to all students at the school. Moreover, a charge does not have to be specified in a student's enrollment agreement to be considered an institutional charge. Principle 3: Charges on a student's account are not always institutional charges; institutional charges do not always appear on a student's account. With the student's authorization, a school may credit a student's account with Title IV funds to pay for noninstitutional charges. If a student withdraws from the school with debits for noninstitutional charges on his or her account, the school should exclude those charges from the R2T4 calculation. Conversely, there may be institutional charges that do not appear on a student's account. If a school disburses Title IV funds to a student to buy required books, equipment, supplies, or materials and the student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase them from another source, those costs must be classified as institutional charges.TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title DCL 5-18 FSA HB November 2018Returning equipment If a school can substantiate that its return policies are reasonable, consistent, and fair to all students, and students are notified in writing of those policies when they enroll, the school may exclude documented costs for nonreturnable equipment and returnable equipment if not returned in good condition within 20 days of withdrawal. A policy that classifies all used books or equipment as nonreturnable is not reasonable or fair . An acceptable policy must specify the circumstances that would prevent the school from selling the books or equipment to other students. Example of institutional charges versus non-institutional charges Aerospace Tech requires its students to purchase a titanium-plated tool set by the first day of class. Aerospace's enrollment agreement does not contain a charge for the tools, and it does not say that the student is required to purchase the tools from Aerospace or a vendor affiliated with Aerospace. As it happens, the required tools are available for purchase from Aerospace and from a retailer across the street. As a routine practice, Aerospace gets written authorization from its students to credit all financial aid to their school accounts, hold any credit balances, and establish a line of credit for students at the campus store so they can purchase the required tools by the first day of class. Most students buy the tools at the campus store and charge the purchase to their school accounts. Although the cost of the tools is not listed as a charge in the student's enrollment agreement, Aerospace requires that the tools be purchased by everyone in the program of study. Therefore, as a general rule, the tool charges would be considered institutional charges. However, under the exceptions rule, the tool charges do not have to be considered institutional charges if Aerospace can demonstrate that (1) the tools were available for purchase elsewhere, (2) Aerospace made financial aid available to students in time to purchase the tools from another vendor before the first day of class, and (3) Aerospace's practices provide students with an equal opportunity to purchase tools from the campus bookstore or the retailer across the street. In this case, the school meets the first criterion, the tools are available at the store across the street, so an opportunity could exist. However, the school fails to satisfy the second and third criteria because the school's routine practice of crediting students' accounts with all financial aid and extending lines of credit for purchases at the campus bookstore discourages students from purchasing the required tools from another vendor. Unless a student specifically requests that Aerospace not hold his or her credit balance, a student whose education is funded primarily through financial assistance has to purchase the tools at the campus store. As a result, the cost of the tools must be classified as institutional charges.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds5-19 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Demonstrating a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase books, supplies and equipment A school may treat charges for books, supplies, equipment, and materials as noninstitutional charges if the school can substantiate that its students have the option of obtaining the required course materials from an alternative source. The school must be able to document that the required course materials were available for purchase at a relatively convenient location unaffiliated in any way with the school, and the school does not restrict the availability of financial aid funds. (The school provides financial aid funds in a way and at a time that made it possible for the student to purchase the materials in a timely manner.) Note that, a signed statement by a student that he or she had the option to purchase the materials from an alternative source is not sufficient documentation. Effects of waivers on institutional charges If your school treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees that have actually been charged to a student, then the waiver is considered estimated financial assistance, and the full amount of the tuition and fees must be included in Step 5, Part L of the R2T4 calculation. On the other hand, if the student is never assessed the full charges, the waiver is not considered to be financial aid, and only the actual charges would be included in the R2T4 calculation (see DCL GEN-00-24, January 2000, for a further discussion of waivers and the R2T4 calculation).Waiver Example An institution charges state residents $900 per semester. Out-of-state students are charged an additional $2,000 for a total of $2,900. However, the institution grants waivers of the out-of-state charges to out- of-state athletes. The waiver is considered a payment to those charges (estimated financial assistance), and the full $2,900 would need to be included in any R2T4 calculation.Providing books and materials at or below market rates 34 CFR 668.164(c)(2). Book vouchers and institutional charges in the return of Title IV funds calculations If a book voucher issued by a school cannot be used to purchase course materials from a convenient unaffiliated source, the student does not have a real and reasonable opportunity to purchase his or her course materials elsewhere. In that case, the school must include the cost of books and materials purchased with the voucher as institutional charges in Step 5, Part L of the R2T4 calculation. DCL GEN-12-21Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the 5-20 FSA HB November 2018When to prorate charges When a school chooses to calculate the treatment of Title IV, program assistance on a payment period basis for a nonterm credit- hour or clock-hour program but the institutional charges for a period longer than the payment period (most likely the period of enrollment), there may not be a specific amount that reflects the actual institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period. When a student is charged for a period longer than a payment period, the institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period are the greater of\u2014 the prorated amount of institutional charges for the longer period; or the amount of title IV assistance retained for institutional charges as of the student's withdrawal date (e.g., when a student has provided an authorization to retain funds). Therefore, if a school charges by the period of enrollment but performs its R2T4 calculation on a payment period basis, before entering data in Step 5, Part L of the R2T4 calculation, the school must determine whether to enter: (a) the prorated amount of all institutional charges, or (b) the amount the school retained. To do this, the school 1. prorates all institutional charges; 2. determines the amount actually retained; 3. compares the two results and enters in Step 5, Part L the greater of the two amounts. For example, institutional charges are $10,000 (inclusive of tuition, fees, books and supplies) for a nonterm-based program that spans two payment periods of 450 clock hours each. The school chooses to calculate the treatment of federal student aid funds on a payment period basis. A student withdraws in the first payment period. The prorated amount of institutional charges for each payment period is $5,000. The school debited the student's ledger account for the entire cost of the program, \u2014$10,000. Title IV disbursements for the student's first payment period, consisting of Pell Grant and Direct Stafford Loan (subsidized and unsubsidized) total $5,629 ($5000 was applied to charges, and $629 was a Title IV credit balance.) However, under the cash management rules for determining the prorated amount of institutional charges, the institution may only retain Title IV aid funds toward the prorated amount of $5,000 for the payment period, with the remainder treated as a Title IV credit balance. Therefore, the institutional charges the school must use in the Return calculation for the payment period are $5,000.Prorating charges 34 CFR 668.22(g)(3) \u00a7668.164(c)(1)(i) & \u00a7668.164(c)(5) Apportioning and prorating charges The October 30, 2015 cash management regulations for apportioning and prorating charges must be followed when determining the amount of Title IV assistance retained for institutional charges as of the student's withdrawal date. See Volume 4.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return Title IV Funds5-21 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Treatment of Title IV credit balances when a student withdraws This treatment applies only to the handling of Title IV credit balances when a student withdraws. For a discussion of credit balances in other circumstances, please see Volume 4. When a student withdraws during a period, a Title IV credit balance created during the period is handled as follows: 1. Do not release any portion of a Title IV credit balance to the student, and do not return any portion to the Title IV programs prior to performing the R2T4 calculation. The institution must hold these funds even if, consistent with the 14-day credit balance payment requirement of 34 CFR 668.164(e), it would otherwise be required to release them. 2. Perform the R2T4 calculation, including any existing Title IV credit balance for the period in the calculation as disbursed aid. 3. Apply any applicable refund policy (state, accrediting agency, institutional, etc.) to determine if doing so creates a new or larger Title IV credit balance. 4. Allocate any Title IV credit balance as follows: a) Any Title IV credit balance must be allocated first to repay any grant overpayment owed by the student as a result of the current withdrawal. The institution must return such funds to the Title IV grant account within 14 days of the date that the institution performs the R2T4 calculation. Although not included in an R2T4 calculation, any Title IV credit balance from a prior period that remains on a student's account when the student with - draws is included as Title IV funds when you deter - mine the amount of any final Title IV credit balance when a student withdraws. Remember, the school must use the final credit balance first to satisfy any current student grant overpayment. b) Within 14 days of the date that the institution performs the R2T4 calculation, an institution must pay any remaining Title IV credit balance funds in one or more of the following ways: in accordance with the cash management regula - tions to pay authorized charges at the institution (including previously paid charges that now are unpaid due to a return of Title IV funds by the institution);Treatment of credit balance when a student withdraws DCL GEN 04-03, Revised, November 2004 New 14-day deadline In most cases, the cash management regulations require a school to refund a Title IV credit balance to a student within 14 days. However, when a student withdraws, a school is required to perform a R2T4 calculation to determine, among other things, whether adjustments to the credit balance will occur. For this reason, the existing 14-day payment requirement is placed on hold to determine the final amount of any Title IV credit balance. Your school does not need to obtain a student's or parent's authorization to hold a Title IV credit balance that existed prior to the Return calculation (beyond the original 14-day deadline) while you determine the final amount of the credit balance. In order to allow an institution time to appropriately apply any credit balance after it has been recalculated, a new 14-day deadline is triggered when a school performs a R2T4 calculation. The new 14-day deadline begins on the date the school performs the Return calculation, not the date the school performs any calculations required by its institutional refund policy. Of course, in order to determine the correct Title IV credit balance, the school must take into account both the results of the R2T4 calculation and any applicable refund policy.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title DCL 5-22 FSA HB November 2018A school may not use a Title IV credit balance to return funds for which it is responsible as a result of an R2T4 calculation (Step 5, item O); with the student's written authorization , to reduce the student's Title IV loan debt (not lim - ited to loan debt for the period of withdrawal); or to the student (or parent for a Direct PLUS Loan); If the institution cannot locate the student (or parent) to whom a Title IV credit balance must be paid, it must return the credit balance to the Title IV programs. The Department does not specify the order of return to the Title IV programs for a credit balance. We encourage institutions to make determinations that are in the best interest of the individual student. You must apply your school refund policy before allocating a Title IV credit balance. However, you are not required to actually complete the refund process (for example, by making a refund to a student) before completing the steps for allocating the Title IV credit balance. In order to accommodate differences in institutional accounting and administrative processes, you are not required to actually apply the Title IV credit balance to the student's grant overpayment before applying the Title IV credit balance to other debts, as long as the grant overpayment is satisfied by the 14-day deadline. You may use school funds instead of the actual Title IV credit balance to satisfy any student grant overpayment. For the treatment of credit balances when a student dies, see When a student receiving Title IV aid dies during the payment period or period of enrollment, in Chapter 2. Time frame for returning an unclaimed Title IV credit balance If a school attempts to disburse the credit balance by check and the check is not cashed, the school must return the funds no later than 240 days after the date the school issued the check. If a check is returned to a school or an EFT is rejected, the school may make additional attempts to disburse the funds, provided that those attempts are made not later than 45 days after the funds were returned or rejected. When a check is returned or EFT is rejected and the school does not make another attempt to disburse the funds, the funds must be returned before the end of the initial 45-day period. The school must cease all attempts to disburse the funds and return them no later than 240 days after the date it issued the first check.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds5-23 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of a school performing a R2T4 calculation for a student whose account has a Title IV credit balance Legolas, a first-time student at Northern Mirkwood Community College (NMCC), began classes on September 1. His account was credited with a Pell Grant of $2,000.00 and debited with institutional charges of $500.00, creating a Title IV credit balance of $1,500.00. Because NMCC has several mini-semesters in which Legolas had expressed an interest, the school obtained the student's permission to hold the Title IV credit balance while Legolas considered his options. On September 30, when he has completed 25% of the semester, Legolas informs the school that he has decided to withdraw in order to pursue his dream of winning a gold medal as an Olympic archer. NMCC places a hold on Legolas's account while it performs the required R2T4 calculation and applies its institutional refund policy. The school performs the required R2T4 calculation on October 20 and determines that the Amount of unearned funds due from the school is $375.00, and that the initial amount of unearned funds due from the student is $1,125.00. Since the $1,125.00 is composed entirely of grant funds, after applying the 50% grant protection (see Step 9 later in this chapter), the Amount for the student to return is a grant overpayment of $125.00. Before Legolas withdrew, the Title IV funds on his account totaled $2,000.00, and $500.00 of that $2,000.00 was used to cover the existing charges. There were no charges due the school, and the Title IV credit balance was $1,500.00. After the school returned the $375.00 it is required to return, the new total of Title IV funds on the student's account was $1,625.00 ($2,000.00 $375.00), and the new Title IV credit balance was $1,125.00. Then, the school applies its institutional refund policy. Under NMCC's refund policy, a first-time student who withdraws before the 50% point in the semester is entitled to an 80% refund of institutional charges. Since Legolas withdrew at the 25% point of the semester, he is entitled to a refund of 80% of the amount he was charged, or $400.00 ($500.00 X .80). So, the new institutional charges on the student's account are $100.00, and the new (final) Title IV credit balance is $1,525.00 ($1,625.00 $100.00). Note that this new credit balance is larger than the credit balance that existed before the student withdrew. Consistent with rules for handling credit balances when a student withdraws, NMCC has 14 days from October 20 (the date they performed the R2T4 calculation) to return the student's grant overpayment. After the school returns the $125.00 grant overpayment, the Title IV credit balance of the student's account is $1,400.00 ($1,525.00 $125.00). The school must pay those funds to the student within 14 days of October 20. Note: With a never before achieved perfect score, Legolas won a gold medal in the Olympic archery competition.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-24 FSA HB November 2018PRINCIPLES WITH UNIQUE APPLICATIONS IN THE RETURN OF TITLE IV AID Date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew The date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew varies depending on the type of withdrawal. For example, if a student begins the official withdrawal process or provides official notification to the school of his or her intent to withdraw, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew would be the date the student began the official withdrawal process or the date of the student's notification, whichever is later. If a student did not begin the official withdrawal process or provide notification of his or her intent to withdraw, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew would be the date that the school becomes aware that the student ceased attendance. The types of withdrawal and the corresponding definition of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew are listed in the chart on withdrawal dates in chapter 2. For a student who withdraws, without providing notification, from a school that is not required to take attendance, the school must determine the withdrawal date no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of (1) the payment period or the period of enrollment (as applicable), (2) the academic year, or (3) the student's educational program. Date of determination at institutions that are required to take attendance Institutions that are required to take attendance are expected to have a procedure in place for routinely monitoring attendance records to determine in a timely manner when a student withdraws. Except in unusual instances, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew should be no later than 14 days (less if the school has a policy requiring determination in fewer than 14 days) after the student's last date of attendance as determined by the institutio n from its attendance records. If the date a student provides withdrawal notification to the school is prior to the date the school would regularly determine to be the student withdrawal date, the date of determination is the date of the student's notification. The school is NOT required to administratively withdraw a student who has been absent for 14 days (or less if applicable). However, after 14 days, it is expected to have determined whether the student intends to return to classes or to withdraw. If the student is eventually determined to be a withdrawal, the end of the 14-day period begins the time frame for completing an R2T4 calculation. Example of making a determination at a school required to take attendance Consider a school that makes a determination on September 15 that a student has not been in attendance since September 1. The school contacts the student, who tells the school he's been ill but plans on coming back during the next week (and this falls within the time period for excused absences and absences allowed by state, accrediting agency, and other applicable policies). For the moment, the school may delay taking any action. However, if the student does not return, the school must complete a Return calculation using September 1 as the student's last day of attendance and September 15 as the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. The school must return any unearned funds by October 30.Date of determination that a student has withdrawn 34 CFR 668.22(l)(3) Date of determination at an institution required to take attendance 34 CFR 668.22(b)(1) DCL GEN-04-03, Revised November 2004 DCL GEN-04-12, November 2004 DCL GEN-11-14, July 2011 Date by which funds must be returned 34 CFR 668.22(j) Excused absences and administrative withdrawal 34 CFR 668.4(e)Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If a school has a policy that states the maximum number of excused absences that can occur after which a student will be administratively withdrawn, it may delay contacting the student until that date. However if the student eventually is determined to be withdrawn, the date of determination of the student's withdrawal remains 14 days from the student's last day of attendance. If the number of days in the school's policy is less than 14 days, then the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew is the date the school's policy indicates that the student will be administratively withdrawn. A school must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after it determines or should have determined that the student withdrew. In addition, if a student is due a post- withdrawal disbursement, then the date of the school's determination must allow for the school to meet the 30-day post-withdrawal disbursement notification requirement. This requirement does not affect a student's withdrawal date. At a school that is required to take attendance, a student's withdrawal date is always the last date of attendance as determined by the school from its attendance records. When a student enrolled in a series of modules fails to return as scheduled When a student is not treated as a withdrawal from a program offered in modules at a school that is required to take attendance because the student has confirmed attendance in a module that begins later in the payment period or period of enrollment, no action is required by the school unless the student does not return as scheduled. If the student does not return as scheduled, the student is treated as a withdrawal, and the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew should be no later than 14 days after the date that the student was scheduled to resume attendance. For more information on withdrawals from programs offered in modules, see Withdrawals from programs offered in modu les in Chapter 2 .Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL 5-26 FSA HB November 2018A student who ceases attendance during a payment period or period of enrollment is a withdrawal for Title IV purposes unless the student is on an approved LOA. Therefore, for a student who has ceased attendance, the institution must either: place the student on an approved LOA (provided that the con - ditions for an approved LOA are met); or withdraw the student and, if the student returns, treat the stu - dent as a reentry if permitted under the regulations. As noted, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew is not necessarily the same as a student's withdrawal date. A student's withdrawal date is used to determine the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed and, therefore, the amount of aid a student has earned. The date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew is used in the following circumstances: A school must offer any amount of a post-withdrawal disburse - ment that is not credited to the student's account within 30 days of the date of determination. If the student or parent submits a timely response that instructs the school to make all or a portion of the post-withdrawal dis - bursement, the school must normally disburse the funds within 180 days of the date of determination. A school must document a student's withdrawal date and maintain the documentation as of the date of determination. Within 30 days of the date of determination, a school must notify a student if a grant overpayment is due. A school that is collecting an overpayment must require repay - ment of the full amount of the overpayment within two years of the date of determination. The school must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date of determi - nation. The date of determination is used to determine the amount of Title IV aid that must be included in any R2T4 calculation.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL USE OF PAYMENT PERIOD OR PERIOD OF ENROLLMENT The worksheets require that a school indicate whether the calculation is being done on the basis of a payment period or on the basis of a period of enrollment. For students who withdraw from semester, trimester, or quarter programs, a school must perform the R2T4 calculation on a payment period basis. For students who withdraw from a nonstandard term-based or nonterm-based educational program, the school has the choice of performing the R2T4 calculation on either basis. The institution must use the same basis (payment period or period of enrollment) in its calculations for all students within a program who cease attendance. An exception is allowed for students who transfer to or reenter a school that offers nonterm-based or nonstandard term-based educational programs. For students who transfer to or reenter a nonterm-based or nonstandard term-based educational program, a school may make a separate selection of payment period or period of enrollment to use in calculating their Return of Title IV funds for everyone within the group that transfers or reenters. The periods used for transfer and reentry students do not have to be the same. A school may choose to use payment period for transfer students and period of enrollment for reentry students. Payment period The definition of a payment period is the same definition used for other Title IV program purposes. This definition is found in 34 CFR 668.4 (see Volume 3 ). Schools that use payment periods as the basis for their R2T4 calculations should note that making multiple disbursements within a payment period does not create a new or additional payment period. Period of enrollment A period of enrollment is the academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (i.e., the length of the student's program or the academic year). A school that chooses to use a period of enrollment in an R2T4 calculation will use a period consistent with the loan period it uses for students in the applicable program. For information on determining the length of a payment period or period of enrollment for a student who withdraws from a program offered in modules, see Withdrawals from programs offered in modules in Chapter 2. Period of enrollment 34 CFR 668.22(l)(2)TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-28 FSA HB November 2018Applicability The use of a payment period or period of enrollment is important for many aspects of the R2T4 calculation. For example, if a school is determining the treatment of Title IV funds on a payment period basis, the student's Title IV program assistance to be used in the calculation is the aid that is disbursed or that could have been disbursed for the payment period. Also, the institutional charges used in the calculation generally have to reflect the charges for the payment period. Generally, the higher the institutional charges, the greater the amount of unearned aid that is to be returned by the school (see Step 4 of the R2T4 calculation, in Chapter 2). In some cases, this mitigates against a school using the period of enrollment as the basis for the R2T4 calculation. An institution must prorate the charges for the period of enrollment to correspond to a payment period if the institution has elected to use the payment period rather than period of enrollment basis for the R2T4 calculations. If, for a nonterm or nonstandard term program, a school chooses to calculate the return of funds on a payment period basis but the institutional charges for a period longer than a payment period (e.g., period of enrollment), total institutional charges for the period will be the greater of the: prorated institutional charges for the period, or the amount of Title IV assistance retained for institutional charges as of the student's date of withdrawal. Rounding Enter dollars and cents using standard rounding rules to round to the nearest penny. Final repayment amounts that the school and student are each responsible for returning may be rounded to the nearest dollar. Percentages are calculated to four decimal places, and rounded to three decimal places. The third decimal place is rounded up if the fourth decimal place is five or above. For example, .4486 would be rounded to .449, or 44.9%. The one exception to the rounding rule occurs in determining the percentage of Title IV program assistance earned. Students who withdraw at any point after the 60% point in the payment period or period of enrollment have earned 100% of their Title IV funds. If the standard rounding rules were used in this situation, a quotient of .6001 through .6004, which is greater than 60%, would be rounded down to .600 (60%), and the student would not have earned 100% of his or her Title IV aid. To recognize that students completing more than 60% of the period (by any amount) earn 100% of their Title IV aid, amounts of .6001 through .6004 are not rounded for the purpose of determining whether a student has earned 100% of the Title IV funds for the term.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds5-29 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Funds to include in an R2T4 calculation The calculation of earned Title IV funds includes the following Title IV grant and loan funds if they were disbursed or could have been disbursed to a student for the period of time for which the calculation is being performed (payment period or period of enrollment). Pell Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant TEACH Grant FSEOG Direct Loan FSEOG Program funds are excluded under certain circumstances. Federal Work-Study (FWS) funds are not included in the calculation. FSEOG Program funds The nonfederal share of FSEOG Program funds is excluded when a school meets its FSEOG matching share by either the individual recipient method or the aggregate method. If a school meets its matching share requirement through the use of a fund-specific match, 100% of the FSEOG award (both the federal and nonfederal shares) must be included in the R2T4 calculation. Otherwise, the nonfederal share of FSEOG awards is excluded from the calculation. For more information on types of FSEOG matching funds, see Volume 6 .Limits on Title IV Funds that May Be Included as Aid That Could Have Been Disbursed A school may not include as Aid that could have been disbursed Pell Grant funds that if disbursed would, in combination with other Pell Grant funds previously received by the student, cause the student to exceed his or her Pell Grant maximum lifetime eligibility. Likewise, a school may not include as Aid That could have been disbursed Direct Subsidized Loan funds that would, in combination with other Direct Subsidized Loan funds previously received by the student, cause the student to exceed his or her 150% maximum eligibility period for Direct Subsidized Loans. Funds to include when a student enrolled in a crossover period withdraws before the higher Pell Grant is disbursed If, for a student enrolled in a crossover period, a school had a second SAR/ISIR with an official EFC (reflecting eligibility for more Pell Grant funds) before the student lost eligibility but the school had failed to disburse the additional funds before the student withdrew, the school must include the additional funds on the Return of Title IV aid worksheets as Aid that could have been disbursed . The school must do the following: 1. Enter the Pell Grant funds that were disbursed while the student was in school in Step 1, line 1, column A, as Aid that was disbursed . 2. Enter the increase (the difference between student's higher Pell Grant eligibility and the Pell Grant that was disbursed) in Step 1, line 1, column C, as Aid that Could Have Been Disbursed , together with any Pell Grant funds from the original award that were not disbursed. 3. Enter any other Title IV aid as it stood when the student withdrew, and perform the Return calculation as directed.Funds to include in a R2T4 calculation 34 CFR 668.22(a)(3)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the 5-30 an overpayment If a school has resolved an overpayment by reducing scheduled future disbursements for a second or subsequent payment period and the student ceases attendance before the end of the current payment period, that portion of the student's award that was an overpayment must be repaid outside of the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22. If the school is responsible for repaying the overpayment, the school must repay the overpayment before completing any required R2T4 calculation. If the stude nt is responsible for repaying the overpayment, and the student withdrew during the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, the school should try to collect the overpayment from the student and, if it is unable to do so, should refer the student to the Department's Default Resolution Group. If the student is responsible for repaying the overpayment, and the student withdrew during the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, the school should not take any action until it has completed the required R2T4 calculation. When performing the R2T4 calculation, the school should not include the amount of the overpayment for which the student is responsible as Aid disbursed or Aid that cou ld have been disbursed . Then, when the school has completed the R2T4 calculation, it should document the amount of the overpayment and, as applicable, reduce any post-withdrawal disbursement or increase any amount the student must return by the amount of the overpayment owed by the student.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return IV Funds5-31 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Treatment of Students Who Withdraw From Clock- Hour Programs, Non-Term Credit Hour Programs, and Nonstandard Term Credit-Hour Programs with Terms That Are Not Substantially Equal (and in which no Term Is Less than 9 Weeks In Length), and then Transfer To a New School or Reenter the Same School In a Similar Program Reentry within 180 days A student who reenters within 180 days is treated as if he or she did not cease attendance for purposes of determining the student's aid awards for the period. For credit-hour nonterm-based programs or programs that measure progress in clock hours, a student who withdraws and then reenters the same program at the same school within 180 days is considered to be in the same payment period he or she was in at the time of the withdrawal. The student retains his or her original eligibility for that payment period and is treated as though he or she did not cease attendance. A student who reenters a credit-hour, nonterm-based program or a program that measures progress in clock hours within 180 days of his or her withdrawal is immediately eligible to receive all Title IV funds that were returned when the student ceased attendance. Thus, upon the student's return, the school must restore the types and amount of aid that the student was eligible for before the student ceased attendance, and schedule the appropriate disbursements. Actions to be taken by the school would include: redisbursing aid that had been disbursed and then returned under the R2T4 provisions; disbursing aid the student was otherwise eligible for that had not yet been disbursed at the time the student withdrew; and canceling any overpayments assessed the student as a result of the prior withdrawal if those funds were disbursed upon reen - try. Once the student completes the payment period for which he or she has been paid, he or she becomes eligible for subsequent Title IV student aid payments. There are additional actions that must be taken if a student who received a Direct Loan withdraws from a clock-hour or nonterm-based credit hour program transfers to a new school, or returns to the previous school in the same or similar program within 180 days. For more information, see the discussion under Adjusting Direct Loans later in this chapter. Reentry within 180 days 34 CFR 668.4(f) Consistent With Leave of Absence This arrangement is similar to an LOA , and the 180-day time frame is consistent with the maximum 180 days allowed for an approved LOA in the Return regulations. The difference, of course, is that with an unauthorized LOA, the institution would not know that the student would be returning and would have treated the student as a withdrawal. Based upon that withdrawal, the institution would have completed the R2T4 calculation, which may have required both the institution and the student to return funds to the Title IV programs. If the student returns within 180 days to his or her original program, while an official leave was not granted and the provisions of the Return regulations were applied, upon the student's return, the student can be treated as though he or she had been on an approved LOA. Costs Upon Reentry The cost of attendance used in the calculation are the costs associated with the original period before the student withdrew. Once the student has withdrawn and then returned to the same program within a 180-day period, the regulation states that the student remains in the same payment period. The cost of attendance for such a student returning to the same program within 180 days must reflect the original educational costs associated with the payment period from which the student withdrew. Reentry Before the End of the Grace Period If a student who received a Direct Loan that has a grace period withdraws and then reenrolls in school on at least a half- time basis before the grace period expires, the student regains in-school status and will receive a full grace period when he or she ceases half-time enrollment.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return DCL 5-32 FSA HB November 2018Note: For a student who completed more than 60% of the period for which the student was paid before ceasing attendance, the school would not have returned any Title IV aid. If that student were to reenter school within 180 days, because the student had received 100% of his or her aid for the period, the student would not be eligible to receive additional Title IV aid until he or she has completed the weeks of instructional time and hours or credits (as applicable) for which the student was previously paid. However, if during the student's initial enroll - ment the student has borrowed less than the appropriate an - nual maximum Direct Loan, upon returning within 180 days, the student could borrow the balance of that annual maximum Direct Loan. What to do when a student whose overpayment has been referred to Default Resolution Group reenters within 180 days If a student whose overpayment has previously been referred to the Department's Default Resolution Group returns to school within 180 days, the school must send the Default Resolution Group a fax identifying the student overpayment, and stating that it should be made void. This will allow the Department to properly update its records in both the Default Resolution Group system and NSLDS. This fax number is for school use only and only for this purpose. Fax Number: 703-393-6490 Note: This process cannot be performed via email. In the fax, the school must include the: award year of the overpayment; student's Social Security number; student's last name, first name, and middle initial; student's date of birth; type of overpayment\u2014Federal Pell Grant, TEACH Gra nt, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, or FSEOG; the disbursement date the institution used to create the o ver- payment record in NSLDS; a letter that includes the following text: This student has returned to school. The regulations (34 CFR 668.4(f)) require that the overpayment referenced herein be voided. When a Student Reenters Within 180 Days The return regulations require a school to return unearned funds for which it is responsible as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew. If a student returns to the institution before the Title IV funds are returned, the institution is not required to return the funds. An institution may not delay its Return of Title IV funds. An institution is expected to begin the Return of funds process immediately upon its determination that a student has withdrawn. The institution may not delay returning Title IV funds because it believes a student might return.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of Reentry Within 180 days Consider a student who began attendance in a clock-hour program that was 1,500 hours in length with a defined academic year of 900 hours. For the first 450-hour payment period, the student was awarded and disbursed $1,500 in Pell Grant funds, $500 in FSEOG funds, and $500 in Title IV loan funds, for a total of $2,500 in Title IV aid. Assume that this student withdrew from school after completing 200 of the 225 hours he or she was scheduled to complete by that point in the payment period (50% of the period), and the school uses payment periods to calculate the Return of Title IV Aid. Under the Return regulations, the school used scheduled hours (225) to determine that the student earned 50% of his or her Title IV aid. The school returned $500 to the loan program. The $750 the student was initially scheduled to return (Step 9, Part S of the R2T4 calculation) was eliminated by the application of grant protection in Step 9, Part U. If the student returns to the same program at the same school within 180 days of the withdrawal, the student would be considered to be in the same payment period, and the student's eligibility for Title IV aid should be the same as if the student had not left. The school redisburses the $500 the school had returned, and extends the loan period and academic year as necessary to reflect the new date that the student is expected to complete the first academic year of the program and set s new dates for any second disbursement or additional disbursements. The school would schedule additional Title IV disbursements for the day after the student is expected to complete the remainder of the payment period from which the student had withdrawn. If the student withdraws again before completing the payment period, the school would apply the provisions of the Return regulations using the total number of hours the student was scheduled to complete in the numerator, the full 450 hours in the payment period in the denominator, and then apply that fraction to the total Title IV Aid disbursed for the period.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title 5-34 FSA HB November 2018When a student reenters in a new award year A student who was originally enrolled in a payment period that began, and was scheduled to end, in one award year could return after the end of that award year (June 30). However, the intent of the regulations is that such a student is to be considered, upon his or her return, to be in the same period. Therefore, any Title IV program funds that will be disbursed to the student should be paid from the original award year regardless of whether the resumption of the payment period is in a new award year. Consider a student who received Pell Grant funds and withdrew from school in one award year and who reenters training within 180 days in a new award year. If the school returned funds after an R2T4 calculation, the student might now be due additional Pell Grant funds from an award year that is closed. (Deadline submission dates are published annually in a Federal Register Notice. The date will typically be the end of September after the official end of an award year.) To report the additional disbursement information and request these funds, the school must request an extension to the established data submission deadline. This can be done through the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) website at cod.ed.gov/cod/LoginPage Authorized school users must log on to the website, select the \"School\" menu and then select \"Request Post Deadline/Extended Processing\" on the left side. Users then: Select the correct award year and program for the request. Choose \"Reentry within 180 days\" from the drop down menu as the reason code. Provide an explanation for the request. Select \"Submit. \" Schools will be notified if/when the request has been approved. Note: If the returning student is eligible to receive Title IV loan funds and the student's bill is already paid, in the information a school provides to the students when the school informs them that they are due a late disbursement, the school should include information about the advantages of keeping loan debt to a minimum.When a Student is Due Campus-Based Funds from a Closed Y ear For the Campus-Based Programs, if funds are not available from the year in which the awards were originally made, the school may award funds from the current year. Note that doing this does not increase the annual maximum awards that may be made to an individual student. TIPChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Reentry after 180 days, return to the same school in a new program, or transfer to a new school If a student withdraws from a credit-hour, nonterm program or a clock-hour program without completing the period and reenters the same program at the same school more than 180 days after withdrawal, receiving credit for hours previously earned; or transfers into another credit-hour nonterm or clock-hour pro - gram at any time (either at the same school or at a new school) and the school accepts all or some of the hours earned in the prior program; then the student starts a new payment period when he or she reenters or transfers. In calculating awards for a student who reenters the same program after 180 days, returns and enters a new program, or transfers to a new school, the school treats the hours remaining in the program as if they are the student's entire program. The number of payment periods and length of each payment period are determined by applying the rules in the appropriate part of the definition of a payment period to the hours remaining in the program upon transfer or reentry. A school may consider a student who returns and enters a new program as remaining in th e same payment period if five conditions are met: 1. The student is continuously enrolled at the school. 2. The coursework in the payment period the student is transferring out of is substantially similar to the coursework the student will be taking when he or she first transfers into the new program. 3. The payment periods are substantially equal in length in weeks of instructional time and credit hours or clock hours, as applicable. 4. There are little or no changes to the institutional charges to the student for the period. 5. The credits from the payment period the student is transferring out of are accepted toward the new program. This provision addresses situations where a student's entry into a new program at the same school results in very little change to the student's academic circumstance (e.g., a change that is really nothing more than a change in majors). The Department believes that when this occurs, it is appropriate to spare the school the burden of withdrawing a student, performing an R2T4 calculation, and returning Title IV grant or loan funds, only to award them again for the new payment period(s).Reentry after 180 days 34 CFR 668.4(g) Extended Direct Loan Processing Direct Loan processing for an award year generally remains open in COD for 13 months from the start of the award year. A school should be able to submit data via batch or web processing through that time unless it has already confirmed closeout for the impacted award year. If a school finds the year is closed in COD before the 13-month period is over, the school should contact COD School Relations for assistance in re-opening the award year. Once the 13-month period is over and COD has closed the year, a school may request Extended Processing through the COD School Relations Center. Toward the end of each award year the Department publishes an electronic announcement containing information on the closeout deadline and instructions on how schools can request Extended Processing for Direct Loans after the closeout deadline. COD School Relations Center Grant Programs: 800-848-0978 877-623-5082 Office Hours: 8:00 Monday through Friday Email: CODSupport@ed.gov Website: https://cod.ed.gov/cod/LoginPageVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and DCL 5-36 FSA HB November 2018If a school treats the student as one who is not withdrawing from the school, no R2T4 calculation is performed, and the student continues in the same payment period he started in with his original program. If a student for whom this approach is taken later withdraws from the school, the start and end dates used in Step 2 of the R2T4 calculation will be the start of the first program and the end of the second. The charges used in Step 5 will be the total charged the student for the two programs. Eligibility of transfer students for additional Title IV funds Generally, at a clock-hour or nonterm credit-hour school, a student can be paid again for clock hours or credit hours that he or she has already completed at that school only if he or she has completed a program and reenrolls to take that program again or to take another program. In addition, when a student reenters a clock-hour or credit- hour nonterm-based program after 180 days, the student may be paid for repeated courses. (The recent limitation on students being paid for multiple repeats applies only to students enrolled in term-based programs.) For example, a student who withdraws after completing 302 clock hours of a 900 clock-hour program has 148 hours remaining in the 450-hour payment period. The student reenrolls after 180 days in the same program and receives credit for 100 hours. The program length for purposes of determining the new payment periods is 800 clock hours (the remainder of the student's program), so the new payment periods are 400 hours and 400 hours (the 302 hours completed and the 148 hours that remained do not apply). Any reduction in the payment would be based on whether the student's scheduled award or annual loan limits are exceeded. (If the student in this example received no credit for previously completed hours, the student's program length for purposes of determining the payment periods would be 900 clock hours.) However, a transfer student's eligibility for additional Title IV funds may be subject to a variety of limitations associated with the aid the student received during the student's most recent period of attendance. For example, in the Pell Grant Program, a student may never receive more than his or her Pell Grant scheduled award for an award year. In the Federal Direct Loan Program, the application of the annual loan limits imposes additional limitations on a borrower's eligibility for funds when the borrower transfers (see Loan Principles Applicable to Reentry in and Transfer to Clock-Hour Programs , Non-Term Credit Hour Programs , and Nonstandard Term Credit -Hour Programs with Terms that Are Not Substantially Equal (in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length ). When a Student Who Withdraws from a Term-Based Credit-Hour Program Offered in Modules Returns Within a Payment Period or Period of Enrollment If a student enrolled in a term-based, credit-hour program offered in modules who withdrew without confirming an intent to return to a module later in the payment period or period of enrollment reenters the same program prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, the student is treated as if he or she did not cease attendance. Please see the discussion under Withdrawals from programs offered in modules, in Chapter 2.Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return Funds5-37 FSA November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Loan Principles Applicable in and Transfer to Clock -Hour Programs , Non- Term Credit Hour Programs , and Nonstandard Term Credit -Hour Programs with Terms that Are Not Substantially Equal (in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length) 1. A Borrower-Based Academic Year, specifically BBAY3 (See Volume 3 for more information about BBAY3) must be used to monitor annual loan limits of students in clock-hour programs, nonterm credit hour programs, and nonstandard term credit-hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal (and in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length) . 2. When a student who withdrew re-enters the same clock-hour program or nonterm credit hour program within 180 days, the maximum amount the student can receive from his or her original loan equals the borrower's annual loan limit, less the amount previously borrowed for the academic year, plus any amount returned per 34 CFR 668.22. 3. For a student who transfers to a new school into a clock-hour program, nonterm credit hour program, or nonstandard term credit-hour program with terms that are not substantially equal (and in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length), when an overlap exists between academic years of the two schools, the new school may originate a loan for abbreviated loan period that covers the remaining portion of the prior school's academic year. (Note: the new school can find the prior school's academic year in COD.) The abbreviated loan period at the new school ends on the calendar end date of the prior school's academic year without regard to the weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours comp leted by the student during the abbreviated loan period . The amount of the loan for the abbreviated loan period may not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the grade level applicable at the new school. The borrower is not eligible for a new annual loan limit until the original academic year has ended. However, if the student is transferring into a program that is less than a full academic year in length, or into a remaining portion of a program that is less than a full academic year in length, the total loan amount the student receives for the abbreviated loan period and for any subsequent loan period may not exceed the prorated loan limit for the program or remaining portion of the program. If there is no overlap between the academic years of the two schools , the borrower is immediately eligible for a new annual loan limit . If the portion of the program that remains is less than an academic year, the loan could be subject to proration. 4. When originating a new loan for a student the cost of attendance used for the new loan may include only those costs associated with the period for which the new loan is being originated. 5. When a student withdraws after receiving the first disbursement but before the second disbursement, and then reenters the same program within 180 days, the school must extend the original loan period end date and academic year and reschedule the second disbursement. In this case, the student is held to the same disbursement requirements that applied initially (e.g., a student enrolled in a one-year clock-hour program must successfully complete one-half the clock hours and one-half the weeks of instructional time in the program before he or she can receive the second disbursement). The borrower is not eligible for a new loan until the original loan period and original academic year have ended. If some portion of the program remains after the completion of the new loan period, the school can originate a new loan for that portion of the program. If the portion of the program that remains is less than an academic year, the loan limit would be subject to proration. See Volume 3 for examples of originating loans for transfer students with overlapping academic years and for guidance on proration of the annual loan limit. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-2019CFR Glossary DCL 5-38 FSA HB November 2018DIRECTIONS FOR ADJUSTING DIRECT LOANS If a student who ceased attendance for a period in which he or she received a Direct Loan returns to school within the time that regulations require that his or her Title IV aid be redisbursed, a school must submit a change record to the COD system that: adjusts the amount of the loan to the amount appropriate to the enrollment status at which the student has reenrolled; adjusts the academic year and loan period (award period) to the student's new anticipated completion date; and changes the disbursement dates to reflect when disbursements actually occur. If a school needs to submit a change record after the closeout date for an award year (the last processing day in July of the year following the award year of which the loan was originated), the school will need to request an extension to the established data submission (closeout) deadline. This can be done through the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov/ Authorized school users must log on to the website, select the \"School\" menu and then select \"Request Post Deadline/Extended Processing\" on the left side. Users then 1. Select the correct award year and program for the request. 2. Choose \"Reentry within 180 days\" from the drop down menu as the reason code. 3. Provide an explanation for the request. 4. Select \"Submit. \" Schools will be notified if/when the request has been approved.TIPChapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return Title IV Funds5-39 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL DIRECTIONS FOR ADJUSTING PELL GRANTS Consider a student who received Pell Grant funds and ceased attendance in one award year and who then reenters training within 180 days, but in a new award year. If the school returned funds after an R2T4 calculation, the student might be due Pell Grant funds from an award year that is over. To request these funds, the school will have to go to the COD website at cod.ed.gov/cod/LoginPage Log in under the \"School\" tab using the school's user name and password (available from the school's system administrator), select \"Post Deadline System Processing\" on the left side, and request administrative relief with \"Reentry within 180 days\" as the reason.Limits on Requesting Administrative Relief Generally, a school may request administrative relief for a student who reenters training during the award year following the award year in which the funds were originally awarded.Requesting Administrative Relief by email A school can also request administrative relief by sending an email directly to: FSA.Administrative.Relief@ed.gov The request must include the reason (reentry within 180 days); school's Pell Grant ID number; name of the person to contact; the contact's phone number; and the contact's email address.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and DCL 5-40 FSA HB November 2018BREAKS IN ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS MEASURED IN CREDIT HOURS WITHOUT ACADEMIC TERMS To receive Title IV aid, a student must be enrolled in an eligible program. That program has required courses, some of which must be taken in sequence. If no specific academic plan exists for a particular student, we consider the program requirements to be the student's academic plan. A student who completes a course is expected to begin attending the next available course in the program until the student completes the credits for which he or she has received Title IV aid. If, before a student completes the credits for which he or she has received Title IV aid, the student fails to enroll in the next (appropriate in sequence) course in the program, the student must be put on an approved LOA or considered withdrawn. A student enrolled in a program measured in credit hours without academic terms who has completed the credits for which aid was awarded does not have to be considered a withdrawal or placed on LOA if he or she takes a break before enrolling in additional courses. CHANGING OR CORRECTING AN R2T4 CALCULATION Changes that aren't corrections are allowed only if the change can be made in time for the institution to meet any applicable R2T4 deadline. A change is not a correction if a calculation (R2T4/post- withdrawal disbursement) was correct at the time it was processed. For example, a school that used the midpoint as the withdrawal date may want to go back and revise an already processed R2T4 calculation to use a last date of attendance at an academically related activity past the midpoint. Such a change is not a correction because the use of the midpoint was not a mistake \u2014as would be using the wrong amount of a Pell Grant disbursement. Similarly, the signing of a promissory note after a calculation is processed is not a correction because failing to sign a promissory note is not a mistake. An institution is never required to do a recalculation of a change that is not a correction . Chapter 1\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds5-41 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL deadlines impact most R2T4 calculations\u2014the 45-day time frame for the Return of Title IV Funds (also see the discussion under Time frame for the return of Title IV funds in Chapter 2), and the 30-day required notification of the need for authorization to make a post- withdrawal disbursement of FSA loan funds (see the discussion under Post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV Loan funds in Chapter 2). Any action taken after a deadline, even a correction, is a violation of that deadline requirement. So, when an institution corrects an R2T4 calculation and, as a result, returns funds after the 45-day deadline, it is a late return. Likewise, if a school makes a correction and fails to notify a student or parent that they are eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement within 30 days of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, the school has violated that deadline. 5-43 FSA HB November 2018The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation This chapter discusses the data elements in the order in which they occur on the worksheets. It is not a set of instructions. It is an explanation of the criteria a school must consider as it enters data in the steps of the calculation.STEP 1: STUDENT'S TITLE IV AID INFORMATION Title IV aid disbursed A school must calculate the amount of earned Title IV funds by applying a percentage to the total amount of Title IV program assistance that was disbursed and that could have been disbursed. Under Step 1 of the worksheet, a school fills in the amount of each type of Title IV aid that was disbursed and that could have been disbursed. When entering the amount of loan funds, a school should enter the net amount of Aid disbursed and Aid that could have been disbursed . Generally, a student's Title IV funds are disbursed when a school credits a student's account with the funds or pays a student or parent directly with Title IV funds received from the Department. There are a couple of exceptions to this definition. For a complete discussion of the definition of disbursed Title IV funds, see Volume 4 . A student's aid is included as Aid disbursed in the calculation if it is disbursed as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, and so long as the disbursement was not an inadvertent overpayment (see the discussion in Chapter 1 under Date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew ). Inadvertent overpayments are an exception. Inadvertent overpayments\u2014disbursements inadvertently made to a student after the student ceased attendance but prior to the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew\u2014are included in an R2T4 calculation as Aid that could have been disbursed rather than Aid disbursed . (See the discussion under Treatment of inadvertent overpayments later in this chapter.) A school may not alter the amounts of Title IV grant and loan funds that were disbursed prior to the school's determination that the student withdrew. For example, a school may not replace a withdrawn student's loan funds with grant funds that the student was otherwise eligible to receive before performing the R2T4 calculation. CFR Glossary FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Title IV aid that could have been disbursed In addition to Aid disbursed, Aid that could have been disbursed is also used in the calculation. There are two principles that govern the treatment of disbursements of Title IV funds in R2T4 calculations. The first principle provides that, for purposes of determining earned Title IV aid, generally, so long as the conditions for late disbursements in 34 CFR 668.164(j)(2) were met prior to the date the student became ineligible, any undisbursed Title IV aid for the period for which the R2T4 calculation is performed is counted as Aid that could have been disbursed (regardless of whether the institution was prohibited from making the disbursement on or before the day the student withdrew because of the limitations in 34 CFR 668.164(j)(4) or elsewhere). Any undisbursed Title IV aid for the period that the school uses as the basis for the R2T4 calculation is counted as Aid that could have been disbursed as long as the following conditions were met before the date the student became ineligible: For all programs, the Department processed a Student Aid Report (SAR) or Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) with an official Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for the student. For an FSEOG, the institution made the award to the student. For a Direct Loan, the institution originated the loan. For a TEACH Grant, the institution made the award. For a Direct PLUS Loan a satisfactory credit check was received. In all Title IV loan programs, a pro missory note must be signed for a loan to be included as Aid that could have been disbursed in an R2T4 calculation. The signature may be obtained after the student withdraws. However, for the loan to be included as Aid that could have been disbursed, the promissory note must be signed before the school performs the R2T4 calculation. Of course, a school can only include aid (e.g., the loan funds) for the period for which the institution does the R2T4 calculation. If the calculation is performed on a payment period basis, the loan funds counted are those for the payment period; if the calculation is performed on the period of enrollment basis (e.g., the academic year basis), the loan funds counted are those for the entire period of enrollment.Conditions for late disbursement 34 CFR 668.164(j)(2) Limitations on making a late disbursement 34 CFR 668.164(j)(4) Official EFC An \" official EFC \" is an EFC calculated by the Department and provided on a SAR or ISIR. It may or may not be a valid EFC (defined as an EFC based on information that is correct and complete).When a Student Drops Below Half Time Before Withdrawing If a student who is otherwise eligible for a late first disbursement drops below half- time enrollment and then withdraws, the institution would include any undisbursed Direct Loan funds in the R2T4 calculation as \" Aid that could have been disbursed .\" However, an institution may never make a post-withdrawal disbursement of Direct Loan funds a student could not have received if he or she had remained in school.Limits on Title IV Funds that May Be Included as Aid That Could Have Been Disbursed A school may not include as Aid That Could Have Been Disbursed , Pell Grant funds that if disbursed would, in combination with other Pell Grant funds previously received by the student, cause the student to exceed his or her Pell Grant maximum lifetime eligibility. Likewise, a school may not include as Aid that could have been disbursed, Direct Subsidized Loan funds that would, in combination with other Direct Subsidized Loan funds previously received by the student, cause the student to exceed his or her 150% maximum eligibility period for Direct Subsidized Loans. Credit Check 34 CFR 685.200(c)(viii)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-45 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL The second principle provides that a student can never receive as a post-withdrawal disbursement any funds from a disbursement that the institution was prohibited from making on or before the date the student withdrew. Therefore, although the following potential disbursements can be counted as Aid that could have been disbursed (if intended for the period for which the R2T4 calculation is being performed), an institution is prohibited from disbursing: for nonstandard term credit-hour programs where the terms are not substantially equal in length, credit-hour nonterm programs, and clock-hour programs, a second disbursement of Direct Loan funds where the student has not successfully completed half of the number of credit hours or clock hours and half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the payment period (34 CFR 685.303(d)(3)(ii)(B)); a second or subsequent disbursement of Direct Loan funds unless the student has graduated or successfully completed the loan period (34 CFR 668.164(j)(4)(2)); a disbursement of Direct Loan funds for which the borrower has not signed a promissory note; for clock-hour or credit-hour nonterm programs, a disbursement of a Federal Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, or for a subsequent payment period when the student has not completed the earlier payment period for which the student has already been paid (34 CFR 690.75(a)(5) and 34 CFR 686.31(a)(5) ; a disbursement of a Direct Loan to a first-year, first-time borrower who withdraws before the 30th day of the student's program of study (34 CFR 668.164(j)(4)(iii)) (except when this delay does not apply because of low default rates); a disbursement of a Federal Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant or, to a student for whom the institution did not have a valid SAR/ISIR by the deadline established by the Department (34 CFR 668.164(j)(4)(iv)) annually in the public deadline notice, and a first disbursement of a Direct Loan (i.e., the first disbursement of a Direct Loan in a loan period) to a student enrolled in a modular program who has withdrawn before beginning attendance in enough courses to establish a half- time enrollment status. Some schools can use the 50% point as the withdrawal date for a student who unofficially withdraws in determining earned Title IV aid. However, to determine whether the funds can be disbursed as a post-withdrawal disbursement, the school must make a separate determination of the date the student lost eligibility.Making a Separate Determination of Eligibility for a Post-Withdrawal Disbursement Consider a student enrolled at a school that is not required to take attendance by an outside entity. The student registers for, and on September 1, begins attendance in 12 credits. On September 15, the student drops classes worth seven credits, and his enrollment status changes to less than half time. On December 1, the school receives $2,000 in Stafford loan funds for the student. In reviewing its records, the school determines that the student stopped attending all classes and is an unofficial withdrawal. Though the school can use the 50% point as the withdrawal date, it must make a separate determination of the student's eligibility for a post-withdrawal disbursement. In this case, because the student lost eligibility for Stafford funds on September 15 (the day the student ceased to be enrolled at least half time), the student may not receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of Stafford loan funds.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return 2018-20195-46 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Exception to including funds as Aid that could have been disbursed when a student has a disqualifying comment code If a student's SAR/ISIR contains a Comment Code that requires resolution (e.g., 132-Default) in order for the funds to be included as Aid that could have been disbursed , the underlying issue must be resolved before the institution performs the R2T4 calculation and in time for the institution to meet any applicable R2T4 deadline. Treatment of inadvertent overpayments An inadvertent overpayment occurs when an institution disburses funds to a student who is no longer in attendance (for example, when an institution makes a scheduled disbursement on Monday to a student who dropped out on the previous Friday). Inadvertent overpayments are included in R2T4 calculations as Aid that could have been disbursed rather than Aid that was disbursed . A school is allowed to hold an inadvertent overpayment while determining if the student is owed a post-withdrawal disbursement. However, this is not intended to affect the amount of aid a student would receive under an R2T4 calculation. Rather, it is permitted to avoid a school having to return funds only to have to later request and disburse them if a student is eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. An inadvertent overpayment does not create a separate basis for permitting funds to be paid to a student's account. So, if an inadvertent overpayment does not meet the criteria for a late disbursement, the second principle under Title IV aid that could have been disbursed discussed previously applies, and neither the institution nor the student may retain any portion of the overpayment. However, the funds are included as Aid that could have been disbursed and may result in a student being able to retain more grant funds. To be consistent with the aforementioned second principle, an institution must treat inadvertent overpayments as Aid that could have been disbursed rather than Aid that was disbursed . If the inadvertent overpayment could not have been made as a late disbursement under the regulations, the institution must return the entire amount of the overpayment. If the overpayment could have been made as a late disbursement, the institution must return only the unearned portion of the inadvertent overpayment. An institution is not required to return the inadvertent overpayment immediately but must return it within 45 days of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew (the time frame for an institution's return of Title IV funds under 34 CFR 668.22(j)(1)). An institution must return an inadvertent overpayment in accordance with the applicable regulations for returning overpayments. Discussion of inadvertent overpayments Federal Register, Volume 64, Number 151, August 6, 1999, Proposed Rules, page 43026 Federal Register, Volume 64, Number 210, November 1, 1999, Rules and Regulations, page 59018 DCL GEN-04-03 Revised, November 2004Example Of Prohibited Disbursement Consider a credit-hour program where each semester comprises three modules of five weeks each.

However, if the student withdraws during the first module and the school has not made the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student prior to the withdrawal, the school may not make that first disbursement of the Direct Loan to the student at this point; however, the amount of the first disbursement would be included as Aid that could have been disbursed in the required R2T4 calculation.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-47 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL For example, if a late disbursement would have been prohibited because the student had withdrawn and the disbursement would have been a late second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, the inadvertent overpayment must be returned because the student had not successfully completed the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended (34 CFR 668.164(j)(4)(ii)). Institutions are expected to have the administrative capability to prevent inadvertent overpayments on a routine basis. Specifically, an institution is expected to have in place a mechanism for making the necessary eligibility determinations prior to the disbursement of any Title IV funds\u2014for example, a process by which withdrawals are reported immediately to those individuals at the institution who are responsible for making Title IV disbursements. During a program review, we would question a pattern or practice of making these inadvertent overpayments. Late arriving aid If a school is determining the treatment of Title IV funds on a payment period basis, the student's Title IV program assistance used in the calculation is the aid that is disbursed or that could have been disbursed for the payment period during which the student withdrew. (Also, the institutional charges used in the calculation generally have to reflect the charges for the payment period.) If Aid that could have been disbursed during a previous payment period (completed by the student) is received in a subsequent period during which the student withdrew, the aid is not considered Aid disbursed or Aid that could have been disbursed in the period during which the student withdrew. This late-arriving assistance, while it can be disbursed in the current term, is disbursed for attendance in the previous term. Therefore, it is not included in the R2T4 calculation for the period in which the student withdrew. For a student who has withdrawn, a school cannot disburse aid received for a previous semester unless the student qualifies for a late disbursement.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-48 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of Second or Subsequent Direct Loan Disbursements and an Example of a Second Payment Period Pell Grant Disbursement Example 1 Consider a student who withdrew after completing 400 clock hours in a 900 clock-hour program and before passing the midpoint in calendar time of the loan period. The loan period is the 900 clock-hour academic year. The payment periods are 450 hours each. The R2T4 calculation is done on a period of enrollment basis. Half of the Direct Loan and half of a Federal Pell Grant were disbursed at the beginning of the first payment period, and the student was scheduled to receive the other half in the second payment period. Because the student had not completed half of the clock hours and, for the loan, half of the time in the loan period, the student was not eligible to receive the second installment of the loan and the Federal Pell Grant. Therefore, the second disbursements were not made before the student withdrew. Under current guidance, the second disbursements of both the Pell Grant and the loan are included as Aid that could have been disbursed in the calculation of earned Title IV aid so that the amount of Title IV aid used in the calculation (and earned by the student) will be larger. Please note, however, the institution may not make a post-withdrawal disbursement from the second scheduled disbursements of Pell Grant or Direct Loan funds because of the prohibition on making these disbursements. Example 2 Consider a student who completed 500 clock hours in a 900 clock-hour program and passed the midpoint in calendar time of the loan period at an institution that uses the period of enrollment as the basis for its R2T4 calculations. The loan period is the 900 clock-hour academic year. The payment periods are 450 hours each. Half of the Direct Loan was disbursed at the beginning of the first payment period, and the student was scheduled to receive the second half in the second payment period. Although the student completed half of the clock hours and passed the midpoint in calendar time of the loan period and was otherwise eligible to receive the second installment of the loan, the second disbursement of the loan was not disbursed before the student withdrew. Because the Department had processed a SAR/ ISIR and the institution previously had originated the loan before the student lost eligibility, the second disbursement of the loan is included as Aid that could have been disbursed in the calculation of earned Title IV aid. However, the late disbursement regulations prohibit an institution from making a second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan unless the student has graduated or successfully completed the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended. The R2T4 requirements, including the post- withdrawal disbursement requirements, do not supersede this provision. Therefore, although in this case a second or subsequent Direct Loan disbursement is counted as Aid that could have been disbursed for purposes of determining earned Title IV aid, the funds may not be disbursed as part of a post-withdrawal disbursement.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-49 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of Second or Subsequent Direct Loan Disbursements and an Example of a Second Payment Period Pell Grant Disbursement (Continued) Example 3 Consider a student who withdraws after completing 350 clock hours in a 900 clock- hour program at an institution that uses the period of enrollment as the basis for its R2T4 calculations. The loan period is the 900 clock-hour academic year. The payment periods are 450 hours each. The institution chooses to disburse the loan in four disbursements. The first quarter of the Direct Loan for the first quarter (225 hours) of the period of enrollment has been disbursed. The student is scheduled to receive the second quarter of the loan in the second half of the first 450-hour payment period. The student withdraws during the first payment period after receiving only the first disbursement of the loan. The second, third, and fourth scheduled disbursements of the loan are included in the calculation as Aid that could have been disbursed because the school has chosen to perform the R2T4 calculation on the period of enrollment basis for all students in this program. However, the institution may not make a post-withdrawal disbursement from the second (or subsequent) scheduled disbursement of the loan because of the prohibition on making late second or subsequent disbursements of Direct Loans when a student has not completed the period for which the loan was intended.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-50 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL STEP 2: PERCENTAGE OF TITLE IV AID EARNED The percentage of Title IV aid earned is determined differently for credit-hour program withdrawals and clock-hour program withdrawals. The requirements for determining a student's withdrawal date, however, differ based on whether a school is required to take attendance or not. The withdrawal date is used to determine the point in time that the student is considered to have withdrawn so the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed by the student can be determined. The percentage of Title IV aid earned is equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed. If the day the student withdrew occurs when or before the student completed 60% of the payment period or period of enrollment, the percentage earned is equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment that was completed. If the day the student withdrew occurs after the student has completed more than 60% of the payment period or period of enrollment, the percentage earned is 100%. Part 1\u2014Withdrawal date The definition of a withdrawal date as outlined here is required for Title IV program purposes only\u2014including the withdrawal date that a school must report to the Department if Direct Loan Program funds were received. A school may, but is not required to, use these withdrawal dates for its own institutional refund policies. The definition of a withdrawal date is used in determining the amount of aid a student has earned. Do not confuse it with the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew , discussed in Chapter 1 and used for other purposes in the R2T4 process. Withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from a school that is required to take attendance The goal of the R2T4 provisions is to identify the date that most accurately reflects the point when a student ceases academic attendance, not the date that will maximize Title IV aid to the institution or to the student. Generally, the most precise determination of a student's withdrawal date is one that is made from institutional attendance records. If a school is required to take attendance, a student's withdrawal date is always the last date of academic attendance as determined by the school from its attendance records. This date is used for all students who cease attendance, including those who do not return from an approved LOA, those who take an unapproved LOA, and those who officially withdraw. For information on what qualifies as academic attendance, see Academic attendance and attendance at an academically related activity later in this chapter.Withdrawal date at schools required to take attendance 34 CFR 668.22(b)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-51 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Schools required to take attendance A school is required to take attendance not only when it is required to take attendance by an outside entity (such as the school's accrediting agency or a state agency) that has a requirement that the school take attendance , but also when: the school itself has a requirement that its instructors take attendance, or the school or an outside entity has a requirement that can only be met by taking attendance or a comparable process, includ - ing but not limited to requiring that students in a program demonstrate attendance in the classes of that program or a por - tion of that program. These regulations describe when a school is considered to be required to take attendance for Title IV purposes; they do not require schools to take attendance. Again, a school is considered to be required to take attendance only when a school either requires the taking of attendance or is required by an outside entity to take attendance. A requirement that a student self-certify attendance directly to an outside entity does not make a school one that is required to take attendance. For example, a Veterans' Administration requirement that benefit recipients self-report attendance would not result in a school being considered one that is required to take attendance unless the school is required to verify the student's self- certification. When a school has a requirement for taking attendance If a school does not require faculty to take attendance but a faculty member chooses to take attendance, then the school is not considered a school required to take attendance. If, however, a school requires its faculty to take attendance, whether at the program, department, or institutional level, then those attendance records must be used by the school in determining a student's date of withdrawal. Schools that do not require the taking of attendance and are not required to take attendance by an outside entity are not prohibited from using individual faculty members' attendance records in determining a student's date of withdrawal. The Department encourages schools to use the best information available in making this determination. Example of Taking Attendance Ten students at Peabody University receive assistance from the state. The state requires the school to take attendance for the recipients of the state's education benefits. Peabody University is not required by any other outside entity to take attendance for any of its other students. Seven of the 10 students who receive state benefits are also Title IV program recipients. If any of those seven students withdraw from the school, the school must use the state required attendance records to determine the withdrawal date as required for institutions required to take attendance. For all other Title IV program recipients at Peabody University who withdraw, the school must determine the withdrawal date in accordance with the requirements for students who withdraw from a school that is not required to take attendance. When a School Requires Faculty to Provide an LDA for Students Who Receive All \"F\" Grades A requirement that faculty provide a last date of attendance for students who receive all \"F\" grades to determine whether a student with failing grades has unofficially withdrawn does not make the school one that is required to take attendance. Only if the school requires its faculty to collect or record information about whether a student was in attendance is the school considered to be one that is required to take attendance. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-52 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL A school is responsible for ensuring that it is in compliance with the requirements for schools that are required to take attendance even if some faculty do not comply with the school's attendance-taking policy. For students enrolled in classes taught by faculty who fail to take attendance, a student's withdrawal date will be the last date of academic attendance from the attendance records taken by the faculty that did take attendance. If, at a school required to take attendance, no records of a student's academic attendance exist, the student is considered not to have begun attendance for Title IV program purposes and never to have established eligibility for the Title IV program funds . Title IV program funds received by a student who failed to establish eligibility must be handled by the school in accordance with the procedures describe d in Chapter 1 under When a student who fa ils to begin attendance in all the courses he or she was scheduled to attend withdraws . Requirements that can only be met by taking attendance The Department is looking at the substance of the information that is available rather than the way that information is described or portrayed by the school or outside entity. If the school is required to collect or record information about whether a student was in attendance during a payment period, or during a limited period of time during a payment period, that information should be used to determine if the student ceased attendance during that period. For schools that are required to measure the clock hours a student completes in a program, the Department believes that this is, in substance, a requirement for those schools to take attendance for those programs since they satisfy both the requirement of determining that a student is present and that the student is participating in a core academic activity. Monitoring Students Who Log Into Online Classes The monitoring of whether online students log into classes does not by itself result in a school being a school that is required to take attendance for Title IV purposes. If, however, the monitoring of student activity is tracking academic engagement, then the school would be a school that is required to take attendance for Title IV purposes. Schools required to take attendance DCL GEN-11-14, July 20, 2011Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-53 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Attendance taking requirements for some students If a school is required to take attendance by an outside entity (for example, a state Workforce Development Agency) for only some students, the school is required to use those attendance records to determine a student's withdrawal date (the last date of academic attendance) for those students. The school would not be required to take attendance for any of its other students or to use attendance records to determine the withdrawal dates of any of its other students unless the school is one required to take attendance for those students by its own rules or another outside entity. When a school takes attendance for one day or a limited period If a school is required to take attendance or requires that attendance be taken on only one specified day to meet a census reporting requirement, the school is not one required to take attendance. If a school is required to take attendance or requires that attendance be taken for a limited period, the school must use its attendance records for that limited period to determine a withdrawal date for a student. Students in attendance at the last time attendance is required to be taken during the limited period who subsequently stop attending during the payment period, but subsequent to the limited period of attendance taking, will be treated as students for whom the school was not required to take attendance. Unless a school demonstrates that a withdrawn student who is not in attendance at the end of the limited period of required attendance taking attended after the limited period, the student's withdrawal date would be determined according to the requirements for a school that is required to take attendance. That is, the student's withdrawal date would be the last date of academic attendance, as determined by the school from its attendance records. If the school demonstrates that the student attended past the end of the limited period, the student's withdrawal date is determined in accordance with the requirements for a school that is not required to take attendance. So, for a student the school has determined attended past the limited period and has unofficially withdrawn, the student's withdrawal date is the midpoint of the payment period or period of enrollment unless the school uses a last date of attendance at an academically related activity. The school, therefore, has the option to document a student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity, but a school is not required to take attendance past the end of the limited period of attendance taking.Census dates in programs offered in modules For a program that is offered in modules, a school may require that attendance be taken on a single specified day in each module (i.e., have one census date per module) without the school being considered one that is required to take attendance. Taking attendance for one day as opposed to a limited period If a school is taking attendance to determine whether each student attended at least once during a period of time (for example, the first two weeks of a term) but does not continue to monitor attendance for a student after the one day of confirmed attendance, it is not a school that is required to take attendance for Title IV program purposes. However, if a school takes attendance throughout a period to determine when students are and are not present, then the school is taking attendance for a limited period, and the school is one that is required to take attendance for Title IV program purposes for that limited period. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-54 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When attendance taking is required only for some classes A school is required to take attendance if attendance taking is required in all classes in the program for a period of time. For example, if a school requires that attendance be taken in all core classes but not elective classes, when the core classes in the program are taken in isolation, for the period of time that students are taking only core classes, the program is one for which the school is required to take attendance. If core and elective classes are taken at the same time and attendance taking is not required for the elective classes, then for the period of time that core and non-core classes are taken together, the school is not one that is required to take attendance for that program. Determining a student's withdrawal date at a school that is not required to take attendance If a school is not required to take attendance, the determination of a withdrawal date varies with the type of withdrawal. The withdrawal date for the various types of withdrawals, as well as the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew for each type of withdrawal is provided in the chart Withdrawal Dates for a School that is Not Required to Take Attendance at then end of this chapter. Official notification A student may provide official notification of his or her intent to withdraw by following the school's withdrawal process. In this case, the withdrawal date is the date the student begins the school's withdrawal process. A student may also provide official notification in other ways. If a student otherwise provides official notification (as explained later), the withdrawal date is the date notification was provided. These withdrawal dates apply even if a student begins the school's withdrawal process or otherwise notifies the school of his or her intent to withdraw and projects a future last date of attendance. However, a school that is not required to take attendance may always use a last date of attendance at an academically related activity as a student's withdrawal date (this is discussed in detail later). Therefore, a school could use a later last documented date of attendance at an academically related activity if this date more accurately reflects the student's withdrawal date than the date the student begins the school's withdrawal process or notifies the school of his or her intent to withdraw. When a Student Officially Withdraws After the End of a Limited Period of Required Attendance Taking Consider a student who is not in attendance in her classes on the last day of a two-week period of required attendance taking. The student begins the school's official withdrawal process two weeks after the end of the two- week period of required attendance taking. The school must demonstrate that the student was in attendance after the two-week attendance taking period to use the date the student begins the school's official withdrawal process as the withdrawal date. If it cannot, the student's withdrawal date is the last date of academic attendance during the period of attendance taking, as determined by the school from its attendance records. Official notification 34 CFR 668.22(c)(1)(i) and (ii) Official notification defined A notice of intent to withdraw that a student provides to an office designated by the institution. 34 CFR 668.22(c)(5)(i) Notification Example For example, if on May 5, a student provided notification of his or her intent to cease attending the school beginning on May 10, the withdrawal date is May 5. However, the school may use May 10 as the student's withdrawal date if the institution documents May 10 as the student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title Calculation5-55 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL School's withdrawal process The beginning of the school's withdrawal process must be defined. The individual definition is left up to the school. Schools are required to make available to students a statement specifying the requirements for officially withdrawing from the school. While the institution's officially defined withdrawal process might include a number of required steps, and though the institution might not recognize the student's withdrawal (for purposes of determining an institutional refund) until the student has completed all the required steps, for the purpose of calculating the return of Title IV funds, the date the student began the institution's withdrawal process is the withdrawal date for Title IV purposes. Otherwise provides official notification Official notification to the school occurs when a student notifies an office designated by the school of his or her intent to withdraw. In its written description of its withdrawal procedures, a school must designate at least one office for this purpose. For example, a school could designate a dean's, registrar's, or financial aid office. If a student provides notification to an employee of that office while that person is acting in his or her official capacity, the student has provided official notification. Official notification from the student is any official notification that is provided in writing or orally to a designated campus official acting in his or her official capacity in the withdrawal process. Acceptable official notification includes notification by a student via telephone, through a designated website or orally in person. The responsibility for documenting oral notifications is the school's. However, the school may request, but not require, the student to confirm his or her oral notification in writing. If a student provides official notification of withdrawal to the institution by sending a letter to the designated office stating his or her intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date is the date that the institution receives the letter. Notification is not provided to an institution until the institution receives the notification. Note that an institution always has the option of using the date of a student's last participation in an academically related activity as long as that participation is documented by a campus official.Otherwise provides official notification 34 CFR 668.22(c)(5)Consumer Information on a School's Withdrawal Process A school is expected to identify the beginning of its process as a part of the school's consumer information regarding withdrawal (see Volume 2 ). A school should be able to demonstrate consistent application of its withdrawal process, including its determination of the beginning of that process.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-56 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Intent to withdraw means that the student indicates he or she has either ceased to attend the school and does not plan to resume academic attendance or believes at the time he or she provides notification that he or she will cease to attend the school. A student who contacts a school and only requests information on aspects of the withdrawal process, such as the potential consequences of withdrawal, would not be considered a student who is indicating that he or she plans to withdraw. However, if the student indicates that he or she is requesting the information because he or she plans to cease attendance, the student would be considered to have provided official notification of his or her intent to withdraw. When a student triggers both dates A student might both begin the school's withdrawal process and otherwise provide official notification to the school of his or her intent to withdraw. For example, on November 1, a student calls the school's designated office and states his or her intent to withdraw. Later, on December 1, the student begins the school's withdrawal process by submitting a withdrawal form. If both dates are triggered, the earlier date, November 1 in this case, is the student's withdrawal date. Remember that a school that is not required to take attendance is always permitted to use the last date of an academically related activity that the student participated in as the student's withdrawal date. So, if a student continues to attend class past the date the student provides notification, and the school chooses to do so, the school may document and use the student's last day of attendance at an academically related activity as the student's withdrawal date in the R2T4 calculation. Official notification not provided by the student A student who leaves a school does not always notify the school of his or her withdrawal. There are two categories of these unofficial withdrawals for purposes of this calculation. First, if the school determines that a student did not begin the withdrawal process or otherwise notify the school of the intent to withdraw due to illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other circumstances beyond the student's control, the withdrawal date is the date the school determines that the student ceased attendance because of the aforementioned applicable event. Informal Contact with A School Employee If the student provides notification to an employee of a designated office while that person is not acting in his or her official capacity (for example, the student runs into her financial aid officer at the grocery store), we would expect the employee to inform the student of the appropriate means for providing official notification of his or her intent to withdraw. When a student triggers both dates 34 CFR 668.22(c)(2)(ii)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-57 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a School Grants a Retroactive Withdrawal to a Student Who Experienced an Event Beyond the Student's Control If a student has experienced an event beyond the student's control a school sometimes grants a retroactive withdrawal to the student. On those occasions, after the school has performed the R2T4 calculation and returned the funds required, the school may find itself holding a credit balance that is composed of both Title IV and non-Title IV funds. In the case of a retroactive withdrawal of a student who has outstanding Direct Loans, if the school is unable to locate the student, in order to provide the greatest benefit to the student, the school may return both the Title IV and non-Title IV funds in the student's credit balance using G5. All returns through G5 must be offset by a downward adjustment in student's Direct Loan record in COD of the entire amount (the sum of the Title IV and non-Title IV funds) the school is returning. A school should never return more through G5 than the outstanding balance on the student's Direct Loan.The second category of unofficial withdrawals encompasses all other withdrawals where official notification is not provided to the school. This rule applies only to schools that are not required to take attendance. For these withdrawals, commonly known as dropouts, the withdrawal date is the midpoint of the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, or the last date of an academically related activity in which the student participated. Withdrawal without student notification due to circumstances beyond the student's control There are two circumstances in which a special rule applies that defines a withdrawal date for a student who withdraws due to circumstances beyond the student's control. They apply when (1) a student who would have provided official notification to the school was prevented from doing so due to those circumstances; and (2) a student withdrew due to circumstances beyond the student's control and a second party provided notification of the student's withdrawal on the student's behalf. A school may determine the withdrawal date that most accurately reflects when the student ceased academic attendance due to the circumstances beyond the student's control. This date would not necessarily have to be the date of the occurrence of the circumstance. For example, if a student is assaulted, he or she may continue to attend school but ultimately not be able to complete the period because of the trauma experienced. Because the student's withdrawal was the result of the assault, the withdrawal date would be the date the student actually left the school, not the date of the assault. A school should document that the student left at the later date because of issues related to the assault. If a school administratively withdraws a student (e.g., expels, suspends, or cancels the student's registration) who has not notified the school of his or her intent to withdraw, the last possible date of withdrawal for the student is the date the school terminates the student's enrollment. However, an institution may not artificially create a withdrawal date for such a student that is beyond the midpoint of the period by simply choosing to withdraw the student after the midpoint. Of course, if the school can document that the student continued his or her attendance past the midpoint, the school may use a later date. Withdrawal due to circumstances beyond the student's control 34 CFR 668.22(c)(1)(iv) TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Withdrawal date when a student dies If a school that is not required to take attendance is informed that a student has died, it must determine the withdrawal date for the student under 34 CFR 668.22(c)(1)(iv). This section provides that if the institution determines that a student did not begin its withdrawal process or otherwise provide official notification of his or her intent to withdraw because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, the withdrawal date is the date that the institution determines is related to that circumstance. The withdrawal date can be no later than the date of the student's death. For an institution that is required to take attendance, the withdrawal date for a student who has died is the last date of attendance as determined from the school's attendance records. The school must maintain the documentation it received that the student has died and determine an appropriate withdrawal date. (For more information on how the death of a student affects the R2T4 process, see the discussion under When a student receiving Title IV aid dies during the payment period or period of enrollment later in this chapter. For complete information on how a school should proceed when a student dies see, Appendix D of the Handbook.) All other withdrawals without student notification For all other withdrawals without notification at an institution not required to take attendance by an outside entity, unless the institution chooses to use the last date of an academically related activity in which the student participated as the withdrawal date, the withdrawal date is the midpoint of the payment period or the period of enrollment, as applicable.Withdrawal Date for Administrative Withdrawals A school may not artificially create a withdrawal date for a student that is beyond the \"trigger point\" that causes the school to administratively withdraw the student. If, for example, a school can document that it has a uniform policy of withdrawing students after a specified (and reasonable) number of absences that applies throughout the payment period/period of enrollment, then the date that a student exceeded that number of absences would be the date that the school would normally use as the withdrawal date. In a slightly different scenario, if a school administratively withdraws a student because all of the student's instructors report that the student has ceased attendance as of a certain date (e.g., a census date) then the last possible date of the withdrawal for that student is that (census) date. If a school administratively withdraws a student for some reason other than excessive absences, it similarly will have to determine the date of the event that caused the school to make that decision to withdraw the student. If a school can show that a student participated in an academically related activity after the date of the event that caused the school to terminate his/her enrollment (but still before the school withdrew the student), the school could use the date of the academically related activity as the last date of attendance. Also see sidebar on administrative withdrawals under Withdrawals from programs offered in modules later in this chapter.TIP ClarificationChapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-59 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Time frame for the determination of a withdrawal date for an unofficial withdrawal A school may not know that a student has dropped out (unofficially withdrawn) until the school checks its records at the end of an academic period. However, to ensure that Title IV funds are returned within a reasonable period of time, a school must determine the withdrawal date (for a student who withdrew without providing notification) within 30 calendar days from the earlier of (1) the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, (2) the end of the academic year, or (3) the end of the student's educational program. A school must develop a mechanism for determining whether a student who began attendance and received or could have received an initial disbursement of Title IV funds unofficially withdrew (ceased attendance without providing official notification or expressed intent to withdraw) during a payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable. Section 34 CFR 668.22(j)(2) requires that a school have a mechanism in place for identifying and resolving instances where a student's attendance through the end of the period cannot be confirmed. That is, institutions are expected to have procedures for determining when a student's absence is a withdrawal. The school must make that determination as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of: the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, the academic year, or the program. When students fail to earn a passing grade in any class An institution must have a procedure for determining whether a Title IV recipient who began attendance during a period completed the period or should be treated as a withdrawal. We do not require that an institution use a specific procedure for making this determination. If a student earns a passing grade in one or more of his or her classes offered over an entire period, for that class, an institution may presume that the student completed the course and thus completed the period. If a student who began attendance and has not officially withdrawn fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course offered over an entire period, the institution must assume, for Title IV purposes, that the student has unofficially withdrawn, unless the institution can document that the student completed the period. Note : A \"system generated\" default date is not acceptable documentation that a student began attendance.Testing the Use of a Grading Policy If a school uses its grading policy to determine whether students with failing grades have unofficially withdrawn, during compliance audits and program reviews, student records might be examined to determine whether the grades assigned accurately represent the students' attendance.When a student fails to earn a passing grade DCL GEN-04-03 Revised, November 2004Time frame for the determination 34 CFR 668.22(j)(2) All other withdrawals 34 CFR 668.22(c)(1)(iii)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of a Grading Policy That Could Be Used to Determine Whether a Student Unofficially Withdrew F (Failing) Awarded to students who complete the course but fail to achieve the course objectives. I-U (Incomplete-Unauthorized) Awarded to students who did not officially withdraw from the course but who failed to participate in course activities through the end of the period. It is used when, in the opinion of the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. To serve as documentation that a student who received all \"F \" grades had not withdrawn, such a grading policy would have to require instructors to award the \"F\" (or equivalent grade) only to students who completed the course (but who failed to achieve the course objectives). In addition, the policy would have to require that instructors award an alternative grade, such as the \"I-U\" grade, to students who failed to complete the course. If the system allows an instructor to indicate the date the student last participated in course activities, this date would be helpful if an institution chose to use attendance at an academically related activity as a student's withdrawal date. At a school using such a grading policy, if a student received at least one grade of \"F\", the student would be considered to have completed the course and, like a student who received at least one passing grade, would not be treated as a withdrawal. A student who did not officially withdraw and did not receive either a passing grade or an \"F\" in at least one course must be considered to have unofficially withdrawn. As noted previously, when a student unofficially withdraws from an institution that is not required to take attendance, the institution may use either the student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity or the midpoint of the period as the student's withdrawal date.In some cases, a school may use its policy for awarding or reporting final grades to determine whether a student who failed to earn a passing grade in any of his or her classes completed the period. For example, a school might have an official grading policy that provides instructors with the ability to differentiate between those students who complete the course but failed to achieve the course objectives and those students who did not complete the course. If so, the institution may use its academic policy for awarding final grades to determine that a student who did not receive at least one passing grade nevertheless completed the period. Another school might require instructors to report, for all students awarded a non passing grade, the student's last day of attendance (LDA). The school may use this information to determine whether a student who received all \" F\" grades withdrew. If one instructor reports that the student attended through the end of the period, then the student is not a withdrawal. In the absence of evidence of a last day of attendance at an academically related activity, a school must consider a student who failed to earn a passing grade in all classes to be an unofficial withdrawal. When a School Cannot Document Attendance for a Student Who Fails to Complete a Course If a student does not complete at least one course during a payment period and the school cannot document that the student attended at least one day during that payment period, the student must be treated as one who never began attendance for the payment period. In such a case, the regulations under 34 CFR 668.21 apply and Title IV aid disbursed to the student for the payment period must generally be returned.ReminderChapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-61 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Last date of attendance at an academically related activity A school that is not required to take attendance may always use a student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity, as documented by the school, as the student's withdrawal date, in lieu of the withdrawal dates listed previously. So, if a student begins the school's withdrawal process or otherwise provides official notification of his or her intent to withdraw and then attends an academically related activity after that date, the school would have the option of using that last actual attendance date as the student's withdrawal date, provided the school documents the student's attendance at the activity. Similarly, a school could choose to use an earlier date if it believes the last documented date of attendance at an academically related activity more accurately reflects the student's withdrawal date than the date the student began the school's withdrawal process or otherwise provided official notification of his or her intent to withdraw. Please note that a school is not required to take class attendance to demonstrate academic attendance for this purpose. For more information on what qualifies as academically related activity, see the discussion under Academic attendance and attendance at an academically related activity. Withdrawals after rescission of official notification A student may provide official notification to the school of the intent to withdraw and then change his or her mind. To allow a student to rescind his or her intent to withdraw for purposes of this calculation, the school must obtain a written statement from the student stating his or her intent to remain in academic attendance through the end of the payment period or period of enrollment. If the student subsequently withdraws after rescinding an intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date is the date the student first provided notification to the school or began the school's withdrawal process, unless the school chooses to document a last date of attendance at an academically related activity. For example, Dave notifies his school of his intent to withdraw on January 5. On January 6, Dave notifies the school that he has changed his mind and has decided to continue to attend the school, and provides the required written statement to that effect. On February 15, Dave notifies the school that he is withdrawing and actually does. The school has a record of an exam that Dave took on February 9. The school may use February 9 as Dave's withdrawal date. If the school could not or did not choose to document a last date of attendance at an academically related activity for Dave (in this case, the record of the exam), his withdrawal date would be January 5, the date of Dave's original notification of his intent to withdraw, not February 15. Last date of attendance at an academically related activity 34 CFR 668.22(c)(3) Withdrawals after rescission of official notification 34 CFR 668.22(c)(2)(i)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Counting Excused Absences As Days in Attendance A school may only count as days in attendance excused absences that are followed by some class attendance. That is, a school may not include as days attended any excused absences that occur after a student's last day of actual attendance.Academic attendance and attendance at an academically related activity For a school that is required to take attendance, the withdrawal date is always the last date of academic attendance as determined by the school from its attendance records. A school that is not required to take attendance may always use as a withdrawal date a student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity. Moreover, the school (not the student) must document that the activity is academic or academically related, and the student's attendance at the activity. Academically related activities include but are not limited to the following: physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students; submitting an academic assignment; taking an exam, completing an interactive tutorial, or partici - pating in computer-assisted instruction; attending a study group that is assigned by the school; participating in an online discussion about academic matters; and initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject studied in the course. A school that is required to take attendance may use the school's records of attendance at these activities as evidence of attendance, provided there is no conflict with the requirements of an outside entity that requires the school to take attendance or, if applicable, the school's own requirements. Academically related activities do not include activities where a student may be present but not academically engaged, such as: living in institutional housing, participating in the school's meal plan, logging into an online class without active participation, participating in academic counseling or advisement. Participation in academic counseling and advising are not considered to be academic attendance or attendance at an academically related activity.Academic Attendance 34 CFR 668.22(l)(7)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-63 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Documenting attendance when students are enrolled in distance education courses In a distance education context, documenting that a student has logged into an online class is not sufficient, by itself, to demonstrate academic attendance by the student. A school must demonstrate that a student participated in class or was otherwise engaged in an academically related activity, such as by contributing to an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a course-related question. Examples of acceptable evidence of academic attendance and attendance at an academically-related activity in a distance education program include: student submission of an academic assignment, student submission of an exam, documented student participation in an interactive tutorial or computer-assisted instruction, a posting by the student showing the student's participation in an online study group that is assigned by the institution, a posting by the student in a discussion forum showing the student's participation in an online discussion about academic matters, and an email from the student or other documentation showing that the student initiated contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject studied in the course. Documentation of a withdrawal date A school must document a student's withdrawal date and maintain that documentation as of the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew. A school must determine the attendance records that most accurately support its determination of a student's withdrawal date and the school's use of one date over another if the school has conflicting information. The determination of a student's withdrawal date is the responsibility of the school. A student's certification of attendance that is not supported by institutional documentation is not acceptable. If a school is required to take attendance, it is up to the school to ensure that accurate attendance records are kept for purposes of identifying a student's last date of academic attendance. As with other Title IV program records, documentation must be retained and available for examination in accordance with the regulatory provisions for recordkeeping (34 CFR 668.24).Documenting a student's withdrawal date 34 CFR 668.22(b)(2) 34 CFR 668.22(c)(4) Determining a student's withdrawal date at a school that is not required to take attendance 34 CFR 668.22(c) Maintaining Records A school must determine and maintain the records that most accurately support its determination of a student's withdrawal date and the school's use of one withdrawal date over another if the school has conflicting information. At a school that is not required to take attendance, but is using a last date of attendance at an academically related activity as a withdrawal date, it is up to the school to ensure that accurate records are kept for purposes of identifying a student's last date of academic attendance or last date of attendance at an academically related activity.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-64 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Withdrawals from programs offered in modules Under the October 29, 2010, final regulations, for all programs offered in modules, a student is considered to have withdrawn for Title IV purposes if the student ceases attendance at any point prior to completing the payment period or period of enrollment, unless the school obtains written confirmation from the student at the time of the withdrawal that he or she will attend a module that begins later in the same payment period or period of enrollment. In addition, for a student in a nonterm or nonstandard-term program offered in modules, a student is considered to have withdrawn from the program if the student is not scheduled to begin another course within the payment period or period of enrollment for more than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending, unless the student is on an approved leave of absence. So, for a student in a nonterm or nonstandard-term program offered in modules who ceases attendance, the student is considered to have withdrawn for Title IV purposes unless the school obtains written confirmation from the student at the time of the withdrawal that he or she will attend a module that begins later in the same payment period or period of enrollment, provided the later module the student will attend begins no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending. If a school obtains a written confirmation of future attendance but the student does not return as scheduled, the student is considered to have withdrawn from the payment period or period of enrollment. The student's withdrawal date and the total number of calendar days in the payment period or period of enrollment are the withdrawal date and total number of calendar days as of the student's last day of attendance (those that would have applied if the student had not provided written confirmation of future attendance). As discussed in Chapter 1 und er Treatment of students who withdraw from clock-hour programs, nonterm credit hour programs, and nonstandard term credit-hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal (and in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length), and then transfer to a new school or reenter the same school in a similar program, if a student who withdraws from a clock-hour or nonterm credit hour program returns to the same program at the school within 180 calendar days, the student is treated as though he or she did not cease attendance. Similarly, if a student enrolled in a term-based credit-hour program offered in modules who withdrew without confirming an intent to return to a module later in the payment period or period of enrollment reenters the same program prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, the student is treated as if he or she did not cease attendance. Withdrawal from programs offered in modules DCL GEN-11-14, July 2011 When an Administrative Withdrawal Is Mandated by School Policy If a school has a policy to administratively withdraw a student who fails to begin attendance in another course within a period of time that is less than the 45- day period, the student is considered a withdrawal for Title IV purposes, and the school must determine the student's withdrawal date in accordance with the requirements for administrative withdrawals. For a school that is required to take attendance, a student's withdrawal date is always the last date of academic attendance as determined by the school from its attendance records. At a school that is not required to take attendance, an administrative withdrawal is considered to be a withdrawal without student notification due to circumstances beyond the student's control, and the withdrawal date is the date that the school determines is related to that circumstance. (34 CFR 668.22 (c)(1)(iv)) The last possible date of withdrawal for a student that is administratively withdrawn due to a period of nonattendance for a specified period is the date that started the period of nonattendance (i.e., the beginning of the period of nonattendance that triggered the administrative withdrawal). Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-65 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Determining if a program is offered in modules A program is offered in modules if, for a payment period or period of enrollment, a course or courses in the program do not span the entire length of the payment period or period of enrollment. The determination of whether a program is offered in modules is made on a payment period by payment period or period of enrollment by period of enrollment basis, as appropriate, and is student specific. So, while some payment periods or periods of enrollment in a student's program may be considered to be offered in modules, others may not. If all the courses in a program for a particular payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, span the entire length of the period, the program is never considered to be offered in modules for that period for any student who withdraws during the period. Conversely, if none of the courses in a program for a particular payment period or period of enrollment span the entire length of the period, the program is always considered to be offered in modules for that period for a student who withdraws during the period. If some courses in the program for a particular payment period or period of enrollment span the entire length of the period but some do not, the program is considered to be offered in modules only for a student who is scheduled to attend at least one course that does not span the entire length of the period and who withdraws during the period. For example, an institution offers a credit-hour program in semesters with two optional summer sessions. All the courses in the fall and spring semesters span the entire length of the semester. The two summer sessions are offered sequentially and are each seven weeks long. The institution chooses to combine the summer sessions into one term. Students have the option to enroll in either session or both sessions. The fall and spring semesters are never considered to be offered in modules for any student who withdraws because all classes span the entire length of the payment period (the term). However, for the summer sessions, where the payment period is the term comprising both sessions, all students who withdraw are considered to be withdrawing from a program offered in modules (with each session being a module) because none of the courses offered span the entire length of the payment period. If, for the summer term, the institution also offered courses that were 14 weeks in length (i.e., spanned the entire length of the payment period) and a student who withdrew was scheduled to attend only these 14-week- long courses, the program would not be considered to be offered in modules for purposes of determining the applicability of the return of Title IV funds requirements to that student's withdrawal.How Determinations Are Made A specific program might be classified as one that a school offers in standard terms, nonstandard terms, or even as a nonterm program. However, determinations about which format a student is attending are made on a student-by-student and semester-by-semester basis. Consider a student enrolled in a program offered predominantly in standard terms without modules. However, the third semester of the program is composed of clinical coursework offered in modules. If a student withdraws during the third semester, the student would have to be treated as one who withdrew from a modular program.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-66 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL How To Determine Whether a Student In a Program Offered in Modules Has Withdrawn Schools can determine whether a student enrolled in a series of modules is a withdrawal by asking the following three questions. 1. After beginning attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, did the student cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend? If the answer is no, this is not a withdrawal. If the answer is yes, go to question 2. 2. When the student ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend, was the student still attending any other courses? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal; however, other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may apply. If the answer is no, go to question 3. 3. Did the student confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period (for nonterm and nonstandard- term programs, this must be no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending)? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal, unless the student does not return. If the answer is no, this is a withdrawal and the return of Title IV Funds requirements apply. Note: See the discussion under If a student remains enrolled only in non-Title IV-eligible courses in Chapter 1 for more information about a student in a term-based module program who remains enrolled only in non-Title IV-eligible courses.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return Aid Calculation5-67 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of Using the Three Questions to Determine Whether a Student Who Is Scheduled to Complete Two Courses in Each of The First Two of Three Modules Within a Payment Period Has Withdrawn Scenario 1 The student begins attendance in both courses in the first module but ceases to attend both courses after just a few days and does not confirm that he will return to any courses in modules two or three. The student is a withdrawal because he or she ceased to attend courses he or she was scheduled to attend (Yes to question 1); was not still attending any other courses (No to question 2); and did not confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period (No to question 3). Scenario 2 If, however, the student begins attendance in both courses in the first module but drops just one of the courses after just a few days, the student is not a withdrawal. Although the student ceased to attend a course he or she was scheduled to attend (Yes to question 1), the student was still attending another course (Yes to question 2). Of course, the student's eligibility must be recalculated. Scenario 3 If the student completes both courses in the first module but officially drops both courses in the second module while still attending those courses, the student is not a withdrawal. Because the student officially dropped both courses in module two before they began, the student did not cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend.(No to question 1). However, because the student did not begin attendance in all courses, other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may apply.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of 2018-20195-68 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student who has withdrawn returns within a payment period or period of enrollment If a withdrawn student returns to the school within the same payment period or period of enrollment for a term-based program offered in modules, or within 180 calendar days for a clock-hour or nonterm credit- hour program, the student is treated as though he or she did not cease attendance and the school must \"undo\" the R2T4 calculation. As with a student who reenters a clock hour or nonterm credit-hour program within 180 days, for a student who returns to a term-based credit hour program offered in modules within the same payment period or period of enrollment, the school must restore the student's original Title IV program funds award to the original amounts, with no adjustments required for partial attendance of a module. However, if a student did not attend an entire module he or she was originally scheduled to attend during the time the student was away from the school, the school must adjust the student's original Title IV fund amounts to take into account that the student never began the courses in that module. The regulations require that funds be returned to the Department or delivered or offered to a student due a post-withdrawal disbursement within a specified period of time, and a school is expected to begin the R2T4 process immediately upon its determination that a student has withdrawn in order to perform any required actions in a timely manner. (See the chart Return of Title IV Funds Requirements and Deadlines near the end of this chapter for a description of all time-limited actions.) Therefore, once it has determined that a student has withdrawn, a school may not delay performing an R2T4 calculation to see if the student will return later in the payment period or period of enrollment. For further treatment of this topic, please see the discussion under Treatment of students who withdraw from clock-hour programs, non-term credit hour programs, and nonstandard term credit-hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal (and in which no term is less than 9 weeks in length), and then transfer to a new school or reenter the same school in a similar program in Chapter 1.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-69 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Written confirmation of future attendance A student is not considered to have withdrawn if the school obtains a written confirmation from the student at the time of the withdrawal that he or she will attend a module that begins later in the same payment period or period of enrollment. This confirmation must be obtained at the time of withdrawal, even if the student has already registered for subsequent courses. \"At the time of the withdrawal\" means close to the date that the student actually ceased attendance and before the time when the school was required to return Title IV funds, offer any post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, or take any other action under the R2T4 requirements. Without confirmation of future attendance, a school must assume a student who has ceased attendance is a withdrawal and begin the R2T4 process. A school is expected to begin the R2T4 process immediately upon its determination that a student has withdrawn in order to perform required actions in a timely manner and may not delay the R2T4 process, in case a student might return. Of course, because the notice must confirm attendance in a module that begins later in the same payment period or period of enrollment, the notice must always be obtained prior to the beginning of the module in which the student is confirming attendance. A student who has provided written confirmation of his or her intent to return is permitted to change the date of return to a module that begins even later in the same payment period or period of enrollment, provided that the student does so in writing prior to the return date that he or she had previously confirmed, and, for nonterm and nonstandard- term programs, the later module that he or she will attend begins no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending. Online Confirmation of Attendance An online confirmation of future attendance from a student may constitute written confirmation that the student will attend a module that begins later, provided that the confirmation is a timely positive confirmation of future attendance. A school may not assume a student will be returning for a later module in which he or she was registered before the student ceases attendance. Rather, the school must ensure that the online confirmation requires the student to reaffirm attendance in a module that begins later in the period if that attendance is the basis for the future attendance. Of course, if at the time of the withdrawal, the student enrolled in a course in a later module in the same payment period or period of enrollment (that the student was not previously scheduled to attend), the newly added course would count as positive confirmation of future attendance for Title IV program purposes. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-70 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Why a Student Who Ceases Attendance Between Modules is Considered Withdrawn A student who ceases attendance between modules that he or she was scheduled to attend is considered to have withdrawn because: (1) the student has not completed all the days in the payment period that he or she was scheduled to complete (\u00a7668.22(a)(2)(i)(A)); and (2) his or her Title IV aid was based on attendance in all the modules he or she was originally scheduled to attend. For example, a student enrolls in two three-credit courses in the first module (35 days in the module) and one three-credit course in the second module of a semester (35 days in the second module), comprising three modules of five weeks each. The student completes the two courses in the first module but never begins attendance in the second module and does not provide written confirmation of future attendance in the payment period (the semester). The student is considered to have withdrawn because the student was scheduled to complete, but did not complete, the days in the second module. Under the regulations, completion of one course in one module in a term- based credit-hour program no longer results in a student not being counted as a withdrawal; therefore, the institution would make a determination that the student earned 50% of his or her Title IV, HEA program funds (35 days \u00f7 70 days = 50%). When a student drops all future classes betw een modules Unless a student provides written confirmation of future attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, a student who drops all the future classes that he or she was scheduled to attend between modules (when the student is not attending classes) is considered to have withdrawn, and an R2T4 calculation is required. Adjustments to a student's enrollment status made after the student has ceased attendance have no bearing on the R2T4 requirements. Therefore, if a student who is scheduled to attend all three modules in a payment period or period of enrollment drops all future classes (the two remaining modules) during the period between the first and second module (when the student is not attending any classes), the days in modules two and three are included in the total number of calendar days in the payment period or period of enrollment. The days in the remaining modules are included whether the student ceased attendance during or completed the first module. The days in the remaining modules are included in the number of days in the payment period or period of enrollment whether the student's future enrollment is cancelled by the student or by the school (for example, because the school cancels the class or drops the student from the class because the school determines that the student's grades in prior classes do not allow the student to progress to the next class). When a student drops classes on the same day the student withdraws If a student drops classes (or is administratively dropped by a school) on the same day the student withdraws, the student's enrollment status is not adjusted to reflect the dropped classes for R2T4 purposes. Classes dropped on the same day that the student withdraws have no bearing on the R2T4 requirements. A school must perform an R2T4 calculation that includes those classes in the days in all modules the student was scheduled to attend. Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-71 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student enrolled in modules within a term drops all future courses on the last day of a completed module If a student drops all future classes in a payment period or period of enrollment on the same day the student completes a module, the student is not considered a withdrawal. For example, if a student who is enrolled in modules one and three of a three-module term drops all classes in module three on the last day of module one, the student is not considered to have withdrawn and no R2T4 calculation is required. However, the student's eligibility for Title IV aid must be recalculated based on a revised cost of attendance (COA) and enrollment status. If the student fails to begin classes in the next scheduled term, in its next NSLDS enrollment status report the school must report the student's status as \"W\" with the day of the completed module as the student's last day of attendance. In addition, if the student initially had a Direct Loan with a loan period that spanned more than one semester, the school must adjust the loan period in COD so that it ends on the last day of the first semester. (DCL GEN-13-13.).ReminderClarification Recalculation Schools should review the recalculation guidelines in Volume 3. Note that a school that performs a Return of Title IV funds calculation on a period of enrollment basis for a student enrolled in a program offered in modules may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with a future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-72 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Withdrawal date from a program offered in modules For a school that is required to take attendance, a student's withdrawal date is always the last date of academic attendance as determined by the school from its attendance records (34 CFR 668.22(b) (1)). For a school that is not required to take attendance, the withdrawal date is determined in accordance with the requirements of section 34 CFR 668.22(c). The withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from a school that is not required to take attendance when the student does not provide official notification to the school of his or her withdrawal (i.e., unofficially withdraws) is the midpoint (the 50% point) of the payment period or period of enrollment. To determine the midpoint of the payment period or period of enrollment for a student who withdraws from a program offered in modules, a school must first determine the length of the payment period or period of enrollment (i.e., the total number of calendar days in the period) as discussed under Determining the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed for a student who withdraws from a program offered in modules later in this chapter. Consider a student who, after completing the first module, withdraws on day 20 of the second module of a period comprising two eight-week modules with a four-day break in between. The total number of calendar days in the payment period or period of enrollment includes all days in the payment period or period of enrollment, excluding days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence and scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days when the student is not scheduled to attend a module or other course offered during that period of time. Because there are no scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days during or between the modules, the total number of calendar days in the period would be the total number of days in each module (8 weeks x 7 days = 56 days in each module; 56 days x 2 modules = 112 days in the modules) plus the four days between the modules (112 days in the modules + 4 days between modules) for a total of 116 calendar days in the period. Therefore, the midpoint and, thus, the withdrawal date, would be day 58. Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-73 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Determining the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed for a student who withdraws from a program offered in modules In determining the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed for a student who withdraws from a program offered in modules, the school includes in the denominator (the total number of calendar days in the payment period or period of enrollment) all days within the period that the student was scheduled to complete (including those completed by the student) prior to ceasing attendance, excluding days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence and excluding any scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days when the student was not scheduled to attend a module or other course offered during that period of time. For nonterm credit-hour programs offered in modules, a school must take into consideration any credits that a student has attempted, but not successfully completed before withdrawing, as well as whether the program is self-paced when determining the total number of calendar days in the period. For more information, see Credit hour programs under Percentage of Title IV aid earned for withdrawal from a credit- hour nonterm program later in this chapter. The numerator includes the number of the total days in the payment period or period of enrollment that the student has completed. Adjustments to a student's enrollment status made after the student ceases attendance have no bearing on the R2T4 requirements. Thus, if a student enrolled in three modules completes one module and drops the two remaining modules after ceasing attendance, the total number of calendar days in this student's payment period or period of enrollment would include the days in all three modules, except for any scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days when the student is not scheduled to attend a module or other course offered during that period of time, and days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence. However, if the student drops the classes in the two remaining modules prior to ceasing attendance (necessitating a recalculation of the student's eligibility for Title IV funds), the total number of calendar days in the student's payment period or period of enrollment would include only the days in the first module, except for any scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days and days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence. Note that scheduled breaks include both those within and between modules. So, breaks of less than five consecutive days, including those that take place between modules, are included in the total number of days in the period, and breaks longer than five days within or between modules are not. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-74 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a Student Who Failed Hours in the Payment Period Withdraws From a Non-Term Credit Hour Program Offered in Modules, the Payment Period Must Be Extended When a student who failed hours in the payment period withdraws from a nonterm credit hour program offered in modules, the total number of calendar days in the period must reflect the actual days the student would have had to attend to successfully complete all the hours the student was originally scheduled to complete in the period. The regulations (34 CFR 668.22(f)(2)) provide that the total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of enrollment include all days within the period that the student was scheduled to complete, except that scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days and days on which the student was on an approved leave of absence are excluded from the total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of enrollment and the number of calendar days completed in that period. DCL GEN- 04-03 Revised (November 2004) provides that, for nonterm credit-hour programs, if the student has not successfully completed any courses in the payment period, the payment period must be extended to reflect the number of days in the failed courses that the student did not successfully complete. The regulations (34 CFR 668.4(c)) also define how payment periods are determined for nonterm credit-hour programs. Completion of a payment period occurs when a student successfully completes the hours and weeks of instructional time in the period. Section 34 CFR 668.4(h) provides that a student successfully completes credit hours if the institution considers the student to have passed the coursework associated with those hours. If a student has not passed all the coursework associated with the hours in the payment period (in addition to completing the weeks of instructional time), the student has not completed the payment period. When performing an R2T4 calculation for a student who did not pass all the coursework associated with the hours in the payment period, a school must add to the total number of calendar days in the payment period the number of additional days beyond the original end date of the payment period that it would have taken for the student to complete the credits associated with the courses the student did not pass and that ended prior to the student's withdrawal. If more than one course must be added for successful completion of the hours in the payment period and those courses could have been taken concurrently by the student had he or she remained enrolled, then the payment period would be extended by the days necessary to take the courses concurrently. However, if the only way the student could have taken the courses was consecutively, then the added days must reflect the days it would have taken to complete the courses consecutively. If prior to a student's withdrawal, the student has added a course or courses to complete within the original payment period hours previously failed, the payment period would reflect the original end date. (Guidance issued 9/14/2012.)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-75 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a Student Who Was Enrolled in a Module Within a Term Withdraws from the Module, and the School Later Determines That the Student Failed to Begin the Term-Long Courses Consider a student enrolled in a credit-hour, term-based program. The student originally enrolls in courses that span the entire 16-week term AND an eight-week module that starts in week nine and ends in week 16. The student begins the eight-week module and withdraws. After the term ends, the registrar receives \"never attended\" F-grades for the student for the courses that spanned the term. The school must determine what days to use in the denominator of the R2T4 calculation for withdrawal from module 2. A school is required to have a system that allows the school to determine (within a reasonable amount of time) whether a student to whom it has disbursed Title IV funds has begun the classes upon which the student's Title IV aid was based. Because the school failed to make the determination that the student did not begin the 16-week semester and change the student's enrollment status before the student started and withdrew from the modular course, the school must use the number of days in the entire 16-week term in the denominator of the R2T4 calculation. (Adjustments to a student's enrollment status made after a student has ceased attendance have no bearing on the R2T4 requirements .) Before performing the required R2T4 calculation, the school must recalculate the student's eligibility for Pell Grant and Campus-Based funds based on a revised cost of attendance and enrollment status (that do not include any costs associated with the classes the student failed to begin), and return any Title IV funds the school received that were based on the student's enrollment in the term-long courses. The school then performs an R2T4 calculation using the student's revised award. If the school made a first disbursement of Direct Loan funds, those funds are included in the R2T4 calculation as Aid that could have been disbursed as an inadvertent overpayment. If the student received a second disbursement of Direct Loan funds (which could happen up to 10 days before the start of the next payment period) and the student never began enrollment at least half time, the disbursement is not permitted under the regulations. The school must return the entire amount of the second Direct Loan disbursement, and should not include those funds in the R2T4 calculation.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Aid to include in an R2T4 calculation If a student withdraws before beginning attendance in the number of credit hours for which the Federal Pell Grant and Campus-Based funds were awarded, before performing the required R2T4 calculation, a school must recalculate the student's eligibility for Pell Grant and Campus-Based funds based on a revised cost of attendance and enrollment status (34 CFR 690.80(b)(2)(ii)). The school then performs an R2T4 calculation using the student's revised award. For such a student, a change in enrollment status to less than half time as a result of the failure to begin attendance in all subsequent modules would not affect the student's eligibility for any federal education loan funds previously received because at the time the previous disbursements were made, the student was still scheduled to attend on at least a half-time basis. (Of course, a student may not receive as a late disbursement any second or subsequent disbursement of the loan.) A school may not disburse the proceeds of a Direct Loan to an ineligible borrower. Therefore, if a student who was enrolled in a series of modules withdraws before beginning attendance as a half-time student and the student had not received the first disbursement of Title IV loan before withdrawing, the school may not make the first disbursement because the school knows the student was never enrolled on at least a half-time basis. Title IV program funds are disbursed to a student on the presumption that he or she will attend the hours for which aid has been awarded. Therefore, a school is not required to delay the disbursement of Title IV program funds until a student has attended enough hours to qualify for the enrollment status for which the funds were awarded. However, if the student has withdrawn and has not begun attendance in enough courses to establish a half-time enrollment status, the presumption is no longer valid. Thus, the school may not make a first disbursement of a Direct Loan to such a student. Section 668.164(j)(3) (iii), which permits a school to make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan for costs incurred to a student who did not withdraw but ceased to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, does not apply because the student never really was a half-time student. Recalculation for Students Withdrawing From Nonterm Programs Offered in Modules Any time a student enrolled in a nonterm program offered in modules changes his or her enrollment status before beginning all of the classes on which the student's eligibility for Title IV aid was calculated, the school must recalculate the student's COA to determine if the student's eligibility for Campus-Based funds has changed. The school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. The school does not have to recalculate the student's eligibility for Pell Grants because Pell Grant eligibility for a student enrolled in a nonterm program (and a clock-hour program) is always based on the full-time enrollment schedule. A school does not have to recalculate a student's eligibility for Direct Loans as long as the student has begun at least one class. When a student enrolled in a nonterm program offered in modules withdraws, a school that calculates returns of Title IV aid on a period of enrollment basis may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days. A school that calculates returns of Title IV aid on a period of enrollment basis may not include in an R2T4 calculation as Aid that could have been disbursed aid associated with a subsequent payment period for which the student would not be eligible after the recalculation.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-77 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL For example, take a credit-hour program where each semester comprises three modules of five weeks each. If a student enrolls in one three-credit course in the first module and one three-credit course in the second module, the student will not begin attendance in six credit hours, the school's minimum half-time enrollment status, until starting the course in the second module. The school is not required to, nor should it, delay the disbursement of the student's Direct Loan Program funds until the student begins the course in the second module. However, if the student withdraws during the first module and the school has not made the first disbursement of a Direct Loan to the student prior to the withdrawal, the school may not make that first disbursement of the Direct Loan to the student at this point (although the loan would be included as Aid that could have been disbursed).Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Part 2\u2014Percentage of Aid Earned Percentage of payment period or period of enrollment completed Once a student's withdrawal date is determined, a school needs to calculate the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed. The percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed represents the percentage of aid earned by the student. This percentage is determined differently for students who withdraw from credit-hour programs and students who withdraw from clock-hour programs. Scheduled breaks Institutionally scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days are excluded from the R2T4 calculation as periods of nonattendance and, therefore, do not affect the calculation of the amount of Title IV aid earned. This provides for more equitable treatment of students who officially withdraw near either end of a scheduled break. In those instances, at institutions not required to take attendance, a student who withdrew after the break would not be given credit for earning an additional week of funds during the scheduled break but would in - stead earn funds only for the day or two of training the student com - pleted after the break. If a scheduled break occurs prior to a student's withdrawal, all days between the last scheduled day of classes before a scheduled break and the first day classes resume are excluded from both the numerator and denominator in calculating the percentage of the term completed. (If the withdrawal occurs prior to a scheduled break, the days in the break are excluded only from the denomina - tor.) If a student officially withdraws while on a scheduled break of less than five days, the date of the student's notification to the institution is the student's withdrawal date (Withdrawing during a scheduled break of less than five days does not affect the date the school uses as the date of withdrawal in an R2T4 calculation.) The beginning date of a scheduled break is defined by the school's calendar for the student's program. In a program where classes only meet on Saturday and/or Sunday, if a scheduled break starts on Monday and ends on Friday, the five weekdays between the weekend classes do not count as a scheduled break because the break does not include any days on which classes are scheduled. Therefore, the five days would not be excluded from the numerator or denominator in Step 2 of an R2T4 calculation.Percentage of payment period or period of enrollment completed 34 CFR 668.22(f) Scheduled breaks 34 CFR 668.22(f)(2)(i) and (ii)(B) Determining the Length of a Scheduled Break 1. Determine the last day that class is held before a scheduled break\u2014 the next day is the first day of the scheduled break. 2. The last day of the scheduled break is the day before the next class is held. Where classes end on a Friday and do not resume until Monday following a one- week break, both weekends (four days) and the five weekdays would be excluded from the R2T4 calculation. (The first Saturday, the day after the last class, is the first day of the break. The following Sunday, the day before classes resume, is the last day of the break.) If classes were taught on either weekend for the programs that were subject to the scheduled break, those days would be included rather than excluded. Weekend Classes and Scheduled Breaks If a community college offers regular classes on Saturday and Sunday and its academic calendar says that a scheduled break starts on a Monday and resumes with classes the following Monday, that break is seven days long.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-79 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of Withdrawal Date When a Student Withdraws During a Scheduled Break of Five or More Days If a student officially withdraws while on a scheduled break of five consecutive days or more, the withdrawal date is the last date of scheduled class attendance prior to the start of the scheduled break. For example, the institution's last date of scheduled class attendance prior to spring break is Friday, March 7. Spring break at the institution runs from Saturday, March 8, to Sunday, March 16. If the student contacts the institution's designated office on Wednesday, March 12, to inform the institution that he will not be returning from the institution's spring break, the student's withdrawal date is Friday, March 7, which was the institution's last day of scheduled class attendance. However, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew is March 12, the date the student actually informed the institution that he would not be returning. The date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew is used as the starting date for institutional action, such as the requirement that an institution return Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after this date. Institutionally Scheduled Breaks of At Least Five Consecutive Days Institutionally scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days between courses/ modules in the same payment period or period of enrollment are excluded from an R2T4 calculation. If a student takes an \"unscheduled break in attendance, \" thereby deviating from the student's original attendance plan, the school either must treat the student as a withdrawal or place the student on an \"approved leave of absence\" as described under Breaks in attendance for students enrolled in programs measured in credit hours without academic terms , in Chapter 1. The length of a payment period can never be less than the originally scheduled length. If a student is progressing more rapidly than originally planned and the required projection calculation results in an end date that creates a shorter payment period, the school must use the original \"end date\" in the R2T4 calculation.TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Credit-hour programs credit-hour program, the percentage of the period complet - ed is determined by dividing the number of calendar days completed in the payment period or period of enrollment, as of the day the student withdrew, by the total number of calendar days in the same period. The number of calendar days in the numerator or denominator includes all days within the period, except for institutionally sched - uled breaks of five or more consecutive days . Days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence would also be excluded. The day the student withdrew is counted as a completed day. Percentage of Title IV aid earned for withdrawal from a credit-hour nonterm program The regulations provide that the percentage of Title IV aid earned by a student is equal to the percentage of the period completed by the student (except if that percentage is more than 60%, the student is considered to have earned 100% of the Title IV aid). For any credit- hour program, term-based or non-term-based, the percentage of the period completed is calculated as follows. Scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days and days in which the student was on an approved LOA are excluded from this calculation.Temporary Closures Beyond Control Of The Institution A school that temporarily closes due to weather, natural disaster, or other event outside the control of the institution should promptly contact its School Participation Team to discuss its situation. The Department will work with the school to review the effects of the temporary interruption and the impact of the temporary closure.

Therefore, for a student who withdraws from a credit-hour nonterm program in which the completion date of the period depends on an individual student's progress, an institution must project the completion date based on the student's progress as of his or her withdrawal date to determine the total number of calen - dar days in the period. (See the examples that follow.) If a student withdraws from a self-paced, nonterm credit-hour program before earning any credits, the institution must have a rea - sonable procedure for projecting the completion date of the period. To the extent that any measure of progress is available, the institution should base its determination on that progress (see examples 2 and 3 following this section ). For a school that offers credit-hour, nonterm programs in which the student does not earn credits or complete lessons as he or she progresses through the program, the institution must have a reason - able procedure for projecting the completion date of the period based on the student's progress before withdrawal. If the total number of calendar days in the period does not depend on the pace at which a student progresses through a program (the completion date is the same for all students) and the student has not failed any courses for which he or she was paid in the payment period, the total number of calendar days in the period will be the same for all students. Consider a nonterm credit-hour program offered in modules where some or all courses are offered sequentially and all students begin and end the modules at the same time. For a student who suc - cessfully completed all modules attempted up to the time the student withdrew, the completion date (and the corresponding number of days in the R2T4 calculation) will be the number of days between the start of the first module and the originally scheduled end of the last module. However, an institution must take into consideration any credits that a student has attempted but not successfully completed before withdrawing. (Those credits must be successfully completed before the student is considered to have completed the period.) To do this, the school must modify the denominator used in the R2T4 calcula - tion. The school must add to the number of days between the start of the first module and the scheduled end of the last module, the number of days the student spent in the failed courses/module(s) that the student did not successfully complete.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-82 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of Calculating a Completion Date for a Student Who Withdraws From a Non-Term Credit-Hour Program Example 1, lessons completed David enrolled in a program offered in a credit-hour nonterm format and withdrew before earning any credits, but has completed two lessons. The institution uses David's completed assignments as an interim measure of his progress and compares it to information from its records about other students who have completed the same program to determine an end date. Looking at the records of students who have completed the same program, the institution identifies other students who complete the two lessons in approximately the same amount of time as David. The school determines the number of days it took those students to complete the period. The institution uses the same number of days in the denominator of the R2T4 calculation for David. Example 2, nothing completed Danny enrolls in a program offered in a credit-hour nonterm format. Danny withdraws before earning any credits, completing any lessons, or providing any other measure of progress toward the course or program goals at the time he withdrew. The institution uses its records to identify the student who took the longest to complete the period to determine the number of days it took that student to complete the period. The institution uses the same number of days in the denominator of the R2T4 calculation for Danny.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-83 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of Calculating a Completion Date For a Student Who Withdraws From a Non-Term Credit-Hour Program (Continued) Example 3, percentage completed Barbara is enrolled in a 24 credit-hour nonterm program at an institution that calculates returns of Title IV aid on a payment period basis. Students in the program are expected to complete 12 credit hours each payment period in 15 weeks (105 days). When Barbara began classes, she received a Federal Pell Grant and a Direct Loan. She completed the 12 credit hours in the first payment period ( half of the number of credit hours ) in 120 days (more than half the weeks of instructional time in the program). When Barbara completed the first half of her program, she became eligible for the second disbursements of both her Federal Pell Grant and Direct Loan. Barbara withdrew from school on day 53 of the second payment period. At the time she withdrew, Barbara had completed only one-third of the work (four credits) in the payment period. If Barbara had continued to progress at her current pace of four credits earned every 53 days, Barbara would not complete the additional eight credit hours for another 106 days. She would not complete the 12 credit hours in the second payment period until day 159. For this student, therefore, the total number of days in the payment period (and the number used in the denominator of the R2T4 calculation) is 159. The percentage of the payment period Barbara completed before withdrawing is 33.3% (53 days completed divided by 159 total days in the payment period). In general, to calculate the number of days in the period, do the following: Determine the percentage of credits earned. Number of credits completed (4) = Percentage of credits earned (.333) Number of credits in payment period (12) Determine the number of days in the period. Number of days attended (53) = Number of days in the period (159) Percentage of credits earned (.333) The school enters \"159\" as the number of \"Total Days\" in Step 2, Box H of the R2T4 calculation.

Students in the program are expected to complete three modules of five credit hours each over the 15 weeks (105 days) in a payment period. (A student is expected to complete each five-credit module in five weeks' [35 days] time.) It takes Pixie seven weeks (49 days) to complete 100% of the lessons in the first module, and she did not earn a passing grade. Because Pixie is a withdrawal, the school must perform an R2T4 calculation. In addition, because Pixie was progressing more slowly than the rate expected, the school must project a new end date and a new number of \"total days\" to be used in the R2T4 calculation. Important: Because Pixie was progressing at a slower rate (it took her 49 days instead of 35) to complete 100% of the lessons in the first module, the school can not simply add the length of a scheduled (make- up) module (35 days) to arrive at the projected number of days in the payment period. The school must project the number of days in the period as follows. Determine the time it would have taken Pixie to complete the first module by dividing the number of days attended (49) by the percentage of the lessons completed. Number of days attended (49) Percentage of payment period completed (1.00) Project the number of days in the payment period by multiplying the number of days required for one module (49) by the number of modules in the payment period (3) and adding a module (1) for the student to make up the module failed.

Because only one payment period may be used in determining earned Title IV grant and loan funds for a student who withdraws and was disbursed or could have been disbursed aid under both payment definitions, the regulations now specify the payment period a school must use in the R2T4 calculation\u2014 the payment period that ends later. Any aid disbursed for payment periods that overlap the payment period used in the calculation must be attributed to the payment period that ends later. Note that this rule on multiple payment periods is only applicable to nonstandard term credit hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal in length. All other types of programs will only have one type of Title IV payment period.No Attribution Necessary If a student withdraws from a nonstandard term credit-hour program with terms that are not substantially equal in length and aid is disbursed aid or could have been disbursed aid using only one of the two payment period definitions, that is the payment period that is used for the calculation of earned aid, and no attribution of funds is necessary. ClarificationVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Performing an R2T4 Calculation for a Student Receiving Aid Under Two Payment Period Definitions, Example 1 The Ted Animal Institute (TAI) offers programs in nonstandard credit-hour terms that are not substantially equal in length. Pixie Marley enrolls for TAI's varmint retrieval program offered over 30 weeks in three terms of 10 weeks, 6 weeks, and 14 weeks, respectively. After attending classes for 50 days, Pixie decides that she could make a greater contribution if she studied home health care. Subsequently, she withdraws from TAI. TAI's Academic Year = 24 credit hours over 30 weeks of instructional time comprising the academic year. Term 1 = 8 credits over 10 weeks. Term 2 = 5 credits over 6 weeks. Term 3 = 11 credits over 14 weeks. Each scheduled payment period for Pixie's Direct Loans was one-half of the program's academic year or 12 credits and 15 weeks. Pixie was scheduled to receive three disbursements (one in each payment period [PP]) of her Pell Grant as follows: PP1 - at day 1 PP2 - at the completion of 8 hours and 10 weeks of instructional time PP3 - at the completion of 13 hours and 16 weeks of instructional time The scheduled disbursements and the withdrawal date are shown in the following graphic.

The school must have a reasonable method for determining the student's projected enrollment status for the next Pell Grant payment period (that the student had not yet attended). For example, the school could include a full-time Pell disbursement for a student who had indicated that she planned to attend full-time for the whole year. \"Pixie withdrew on the 50th day (in Pell Grant Period 1) after the start of classes. Her Direct Loan funds were disbursed for loan payment period 1 (the first half of the academic year). Her Pell Grant funds were disbursed for Pell Grant payment period 1 (the first term, which is 10 weeks in length). Direct Loan payment period 1, the payment period during which the student withdrew, ends later, so that is the payment period the school is required to use for the R2T4 calculation. As shown by the horizontal dashed line, the first two Pell Grant payment periods overlap with Direct Loan payment period 1, so aid that was disbursed or could have been disbursed for the Pell Grant payment periods one and two are attributed to loan payment period 1. All of Pell Grant payment period 1 falls within loan payment period 1, so all of the Pell Grant funds that were disbursed for Pell Grant payment period 1 are included in the calculation. Pell Grant payment period two of six weeks (42 days) overlaps with loan payment period 1 for five weeks (35 days). Therefore, those five weeks of Pell payment period two are attributed to Direct Loan payment period one. Direct loan period one of 105 days therefore includes the 70 days of Pell Grant payment period one and 35 days from Pell Grant payment period 2. To determine the amount of Pell Grant funds that could have been disbursed that are attributable to the five additional weeks, the school would take the full amount of Pell Grant funds for Pell Grant payment period two, multiply by 35, and divide by 42. Any funds from the Pell Grant payment period two are included in the R2T4 calculation as Aid that could have been disbursed .1 Note that before Pixie could receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of funds from Pell Grant payment period two she would have to complete the 8 hours and 10 weeks (70 days) of instructional time associated with Pell Grant payment period one and begin attendance in week 11 (the start of Pell Grant payment period two.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Performing an R2T4 Calculation for a Student Receiving Aid Under Two Payment Period Definitions, Example 2 Loan Payment Period 1 Loan Payment Period 2 Pell Grant Payment Period 1 8 Hours and 10 Weeks of Instructional Time (70 days)Pell Grant Payment Period 2 5 Additional Hours and 6 Weeks of Instructional Time (42 days)Pell Grant Payment Period 3 11 Hours and 14 Weeks of Instructional Time (98 days) Student withdraws at day 9812 Hours and 15 Weeks of Instructional Time (105 days) in loan period Day 9812 Hours and 15 Weeks of Instructional Time (105 days) in loan period Pixie withdrew on the 98th day after the start of classes. Her Direct Loan funds were disbursed for Direct Loan payment period one (the first half of the academic year). Her Pell Grant funds were disbursed for Pell Grant payment periods one and two, the first and second terms, which together are 16 weeks in length. Pell Grant payment period two, the payment period during which the student withdrew, ends later than Direct Loan payment period one, so Pell Grant payment period two is the payment period the school is required to use for the R2T4 calculation. The school includes only the Pell Grant funds from Pell Grant payment period two in the R2T4 calculation. Pell Grant payment period 2 overlaps with both Direct Loan payment periods. Therefore, the school will have to calculate the Direct Loan funds attributable to the Pell Grant payment period. When performing an R2T4 calculation, if a school must attribute some part of a Direct Loan to a Pell Grant payment period, the school must calculate the amount of the Direct Loan that is attributed to the payment period by calculating the amount loan from each Direct Loan payment period that overlaps the Pell Grant payment period from which the student withdrew. This approach is particularly useful when the Direct Loan funds attributed to the Pell Grant payment period comprise both aid that was disbursed, and aid that could have been disbursed. The payment period that is the basis for the R2T4 calculation (in this case, Pell Grant payment period 2) overlaps with Direct Loan payment period 1 for 35 days and Direct Loan payment period 2 for 7 days. To determine the amount of the Direct Loan funds from Direct Loan payment period 1 attributed to Pell Grant Payment period 2, the school would first divide the number of days in Direct Loan period 1 that are in Pell Grant payment period 2 by the total number of days in Direct Loan period 1 (35/105) and multiply that number by the net loan disbursed in Direct Loan period 1. That yields the amount of loan funds from Direct Loan period 1 attributable to Pell Grant payment period 2. As this aid was already disbursed to the student, this amount would be included in the R2T4 calculation as disbursed aid.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-89 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL To determine the amount of Direct Loan funds from Direct Loan payment period 2 attributed to Pell Grant payment period 2, in the second step, the school would divide the number of days in Direct Loan Period 2 that are in Pell Grant payment period 2 by the total number of days in Direct Loan Period 2 (7/105) and multiply that number by the net loan disbursed in Direct Loan Period 2. That yields the amount of loan funds from Direct Loan period 2 attributable to Pell Grant payment period 2. Because Pixie did not complete the 12 hours and 15 weeks of instructional time associated with Direct Loan payment period 1 and begin attendance in Direct Loan payment period 2, this amount would be included in the R2T4 calculation. Any amount attributable to the payment period that is the basis for the R2T4 calculation (in this case, Pell Grant payment period 2) that exceeds the amount previously disbursed should be included as Aid that Could Have Been Disbursed. Of course, before Pixie could receive a post-withdrawal disbursement of funds from Direct Loan period two she would have to complete the 12 hours and 15 weeks of instructional time associated with Direct Loan payment period 1 and begin attendance in week 16 (the start of loan payment period 2).Performing an R2T4 Calculation for a Student Receiving Aid Under Two Payment Period Definitions, Example 2 (Continued)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Clock-hour programs Only scheduled hours are used to determine the percentage of the period completed by a student withdrawing from a clock-hour program. For a clock-hour program, the percentage of the period completed is determined by dividing the number of hours the student was scheduled to complete in the payment period or period of enrollment, as of the day the student withdrew, by the total number of clock hours in the same period as follows: A student withdrawing from a clock-hour program earns 100% of his or her aid if the student's withdrawal date occurs after the point that he or she was scheduled to complete more than 60% of the scheduled hours in the payment period or period of enrollment. The scheduled clock hours used for a student must be those established by the school prior to the student's beginning class date for the payment period or period of enrollment, and the hours must have been established in accordance with any requirements of the state or the institution's accrediting agency. These hours must be consistent with the published materials describing the institution's programs. However, if an institution modified the scheduled hours in a student's program prior to and unrelated to his or her withdrawal in accordance with any state or accrediting agency requirements, the new scheduled hours may be used.number of clock hours the student was scheduled to complete in the period total number of clock hours in the periodClock-hour programs 34 CFR 668.22(f)(1)(ii)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-91 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student who received a loan with an abbreviated loan period withdraws As described in Chapter 1 under Loan principles applicable to reentry in and transfer to clock-hour programs, non-term credit hour programs, and nonstandard term credit-hour programs with terms that are not substantially equal (in which no t erm is less than 9 weeks in length) , when a student transfers to a new school and enters that type of program, and an overlap exists between academic years of the two schools, the new school may originate a loan for the remaining portion of the prior school's academic year. The abbreviated loan period \u2014as the shortened initial loan period at the new school is commonly referred to\u2014 at the new school ends on the calendar end date of the prior school's academic year without regard to the weeks of instructional time and credit- or clock-hours. (Note that the amount of the loan for the abbreviated loan period may not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the grade level applicable at the new school, and the borrower is not eligible for a new annual loan limit until the original academic year has ended.) If a student who has received a loan for an abbreviated period withdraws, there are special considerations for the student's R2T4 calculation. When an R2T4 calculation is performed on a payment period basis, the definition of a payment period in 34 CFR 668.4 is used. Those regulations define a payment period for clock-hour programs and nonterm credit hour programs as the time it takes a student to complete half the hours and the weeks of instructional time in the program or the defined academic year, whichever is shorter. An abbreviated loan period designed to complete a prior school's academic year does not meet the definition of a payment period and should not be used as a payment period for purposes of the R2T4 calculation. When determining what aid to include in Step 1 of an R2T4 calculation for a student who withdraws from a payment period or period of enrollment that includes an abbreviated loan period, a school follows the rules for Step 1 in R2T4 calculations described earlier in this chapter under Student's Title IV aid information, Title IV aid disbursed , and Title IV aid that could have been disbursed. In addition, when the loan period for a student does not correspond with the payment period as defined in 34 CFR 668.4 and used in the R2T4 calculation, the school must prorate the loan funds to determine the amount that should be attributed to the payment period from which the student withdrew. Proration for an Abbreviated Loan Period in a Nonterm Credit-Hour Program If a student with an abbreviated loan period was enrolled in a nonterm credit-hour program in which the completion date of the period depends on an individual student's progress, when performing the proration to determine the amount of loan funds to include in Step 1 of the R2T4 calculation, an institution may either use the original payment period and loan period end dates, or may project the end dates of the payment period and loan period based on the student's progress as of his or her withdrawal date using the same procedure as it uses to project the student's payment period completion date when it is determining the number of days in the payment period in Step 2 of the R2T4 calculation (see Percentage of Title IV aid earned for withdrawal from a credit-hour nonterm program). An institution also has the discretion to use the original payment period and loan period end dates or to project those end dates when performing this proration for a student who has withdrawn from a clock hour program . An institution must be consistent in its use of original end dates or projected end dates.ClarificationVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-92 HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of an R2T4 Calculation With an Abbreviated Loan and Overlapping Payment Periods Consider a one year credit-hour nonterm program that consists of 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time. The school's defined academic year for the program is also 24 semester hours and 30 weeks. The school performs its R2T4 calculations on a payment period basis. A student transfers into the program beginning on 8/24/18, but the academic year for the most recent Direct Loan the student received at the student's prior school ends on 10/9/18. Therefore, the student is awarded a Direct Subsidized Loan (DLP 1) of $1,000 (the difference between the annual loan limit at the new school and the loan amount received during the overlapping academic year period at the prior school) with an abbreviated loan period that begins on 8/24/18 and ends on 10/9/18. The student does not receive any other type of Title IV aid during that period. Remember that when an R2T4 calculation is performed on a payment period basis, the definition of a payment period for clock-hour programs and nonterm credit hour programs is the time it takes a student to complete half the hours and the weeks of instructional time in the program or the defined academic year, whichever is shorter. The student begins attendance in the program on 8/24/18. If the student stays on schedule with her coursework, her first Title IV payment period will end on 12/4/18. The student receives two disbursements of $500 each of Direct Loan funds from the DLP 1 (the $1000 loan awarded for the abbreviated loan period\u2014a first disbursement of $500 on 8/24/18 and a second disburse - ment of $500 on 9/19/18. On September 25, the school originated a second Direct Loan (DLP 2) for a total of $2,400 with a loan period that extends from 10/10/18 through 3/11/19 (the period during which the student is expected to complete the remaining portion of the program). The school must wait to make the first dis - bursement of the second loan until the student has completed the abbreviated loan period (the period of overlap with the academic year at her prior school). Due to a family emergency, the student officially withdraws on 9/29/18. 24 hours and 201 days 201 daysTitle IV Payment Period1(PP1) 8/24/18-12/4/18 12 Hours and 103 days of Instructional TimeTitle IV Payment Period 2(PP2) 12/5/18-3/11/19 12 Hours and 98 days of Instructional Time+ DLP1/ Abbreviated Loan Period 8/24/18-10/9/18 (47 days) First Disbursement 8/24/18 Second Disbursement 9/6/18DLP2 / Second Loan Period 10/10/18-3/11/19 (154 days) First Disbursement Scheduled for 10/10/18 Second Disbursement Scheduled for 1/11/19 56 day overlap between DLP2 & PP1Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of IV Aid Calculation5-93 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of an R2T4 Calculation With an Abbreviated Loan and Overlapping Payment Periods (Continued) When the school performs the R2T4 calculation for the student, it performs the calculation on a payment period basis and uses the payment period that began on 8/24/18 and was to end on 12/4/18. The school includes the $1,000 of Subsidized Direct Loan funds that was disbursed to the student as \"Aid disbursed. \" Because the school originated the second loan prior to the student's withdrawal and the first disburse - ment of that loan was scheduled to be made prior to the end of Title IV Payment Period 1 (12/14/18) the school must include as Aid that could have been disbursed , that portion of the proceeds from the loan for second loan period (LP2) prorated to the days that are part of the first Tile IV payment period (PP1). In the example above, the school may not make a post-withdrawal disbursement of funds from the second loan period because the student failed to complete the abbreviated loan period and begin the second loan period. If the student had completed Title IV Payment Period 1 and then withdrawn, the $1,536.00 of the proceeds of the second loan prorated for Title IV Payment Period 2 would be the basis for any required R2T4 calculation.(Days in Loan Period 2 that fall in PP1) 56 (Total Days in Loan Period 2) 154X2400 = $864.00Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of 2018-20195-94 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student receiving Title IV aid dies during the payment period or period of enrollment If a school determines that a student has died during a period, it must perform an R2T4 calculation. If the R2T4 calculation indicates that an institution is required to return Title IV funds, the school must return the Title IV funds for which it is responsible. The student's estate is not required to return any Title IV funds disbursed to the student. Therefore, an institution should neither report a grant overpayment for a deceased student to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), nor refer a grant overpayment for a deceased student to Debt Resolution Services. If an institution had previously reported a grant overpayment for a student who is deceased to Debt Resolution Services, it should inform Debt Resolution Services that it has received notification that the student is deceased. The regulations governing the Direct Loan Program provide for a discharge of a borrower's obligation to repay a Federal Direct Loan if the borrower dies (including a Direct PLUS Loan borrower's obligation to repay a Direct PLUS Loan if the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed dies). If a school is aware that a student who has died has any outstanding Title IV loan debt, the school should contact the student's estate and inform it of the actions it can take to have the student's Title IV loan debt cancelled. If a Title IV credit balance created from funds disbursed before the death of the student exists after the completion of the R2T4 calculation and the institutional refund calculations, the institution must resolve the Title IV credit balance in one of the following three ways: 1. In accordance with the cash management regulations, pay authorized charges at the institution (including previously paid charges that are now unpaid due to the return of Title IV funds by the institution). 2. Return any Title IV grant overpayments owed by the student for previous withdrawals from the present school (the school may deposit the funds in its federal funds account and make the appropriate entry in G5). If the institution has previously referred the grant overpayment to Debt Resolution Services, the institution should provide Debt Resolution Services with documentation that the student has died so that Debt Resolution Services can delete the over - payment from its records. 3. Return any remaining credit balance to the Title IV programs. Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-95 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL STEP 3: AMOUNT OF TITLE IV AID EARNED BY THE STUDENT The amount of Title IV aid earned by the student is determined by multiplying the percentage of Title IV aid earned (Box H on the worksheet) by the total of Title IV program Aid disbursed plus the Title IV aid that could have been disbursed to the student or on the student's behalf (Box G on the worksheet). STEP 4: TOTAL TITLE IV AID TO BE DISBURSED OR RETURNED If the student receives less Title IV aid than the amount earned, the school must offer a disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. This is called a post-withdrawal disbursement. If the student receives more Title IV aid than the amount earned, the school, the student, or both must return the unearned funds in a specified order. Part 1\u2014Post-withdrawal disbursements If a post-withdrawal disbursement (PWD) is due, a school stops at Step 4, Box J on the worksheet. A school may use the post-withdrawal Disbursement Tracking Sheet to track the handling of the post- withdrawal disbursement, or it may use a form developed by someone other than the Department. A school must maintain written records of its post-withdrawal disbursements. The requirements for a post-withdrawal disbursement are similar in many areas to the requirements under Subpart K \u2014 Cash Management of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. However, in some cases, the post-withdrawal disbursement requirements differ from the cash management requirements. Any post-withdrawal disbursement due must meet the current required conditions for late disbursements. For example, the Department must have processed a SAR or ISIR with an official expected family contribution (EFC) prior to the student's loss of eligibility. These conditions are listed in the chart Conditions and Limitations on Late Disbursements in Volume 4. A school is required to make (or offer as appropriate) post-withdrawal disbursements. A post-withdrawal disbursement must be made with in 180 days of the date the institution determines that the student withdrew. The amount of a post-withdrawal disbursement is determined by following the requirements for calculating earned Title IV aid and has no relationship to incurred educational costs.Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student 34 CFR 668.22(e)(1) Title IV aid to be disbursed or returned 34 CFR 668.22(a)(4) or (5) R2T4 Calculation Required For a student who withdraws after the 60% point in time, even though a return of Title IV aid is not required, a school may have to complete an R2T4 calculation to determine whether the student is eligible for a post- withdrawal disbursement.Post-withdrawal disbursements 34 CFR 668.22(a)(6) A school may not make a post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV funds to the account or estate of a student who has died.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-96 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Disburse grant before loan A post-withdrawal disbursement, whether credited to the student's account or disbursed to the student or parent directly, must be made from available grant funds before available loan funds. Available grant or loan funds refers to Title IV program assistance that could have been disbursed to the student but was not disbursed as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. The regulations do not address how a school should ensure that Title IV funds are disbursed to the proper individual. However, a school may not require a student who has withdrawn from a school (or a parent of such a student, for Direct PLUS Loan funds) to pick up a post-withdrawal disbursement in person. Because the student is no longer attending the school, he or she may have moved out of the area and may be unable to return to the school to pick up a post-withdrawal disbursement. Summary of actions a school must take before making a post-withdrawal disbursement The actions a school must take before it may disburse funds from a post-withdrawal disbursement vary depending on the source of the funds. A school must obtain confirmation from a student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, before making any disbursement of loan funds from a post-withdrawal disbursement. Because the COD system will not accept requests for other than whole dollars for the for the Direct Loan Program , the amount a school may be required to enter on the Post- Withdrawal Tracking Sheet may have to be rounded down to the next whole dollar.TIPDisburse Grant Before Loan \u2014Example If a student is due a post-withdrawal disbursement of $500, and the student has received $400 of $1,000 in Federal Pell Grant funds that could have been disbursed and $1,200 of the $2,000 in Federal Direct Loan funds that could have been disbursed, the available undisbursed funds are $600 in Federal Pell Grant funds and $800 in Direct Loan funds. Any portion of the $500 post-withdrawal disbursement that the school makes must be from the $600 in available Federal Pell Grant funds.Disburse grant before loan 34 CFR 668.22( 6)(i)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return Calculation5-97 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV grant funds A school is permitted to credit a student's account with the post- withdrawal disbursement of Title IV grant funds without the student's permission for current charges for tuition, fees, and room and board (if the student contracts with the school) up to the amount of outstanding charges. A school must obtain a student's authorization to credit a student's account with Title IV grant funds for charges other than current charg es. A school is permitted to use a student's or parent's authorization for crediting the student's account for educationally related expenses that the school obtained prior to the student's withdrawal date so long as that authorization meets the cash management requirements for student or parent authorizations. If the school did not obtain authorization prior to the student's withdrawal, the school would have to obtain authorization in accordance with the cash management requirements before the school could credit the student's account for other current charges or for educationally related activities. (See Volume 4 for more information on student and parent authorizations.) A school must credit the student's account with the post-withdrawal disbursement for current charges within 180 days of the date of determination. A school must disburse any amount of a post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds that is not credited to the student's account. Moreover, the school must make the disbursement as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew.School Activity Between Performing an R2T4 Calculation and Making a PWD An institution may not delay its disbursement processes while it ascertains whether a student wishes to receive the grant funds the student is entitled to. However, while the institution is processing the disbursement or notifying the student about his or her eligibility for a post- withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, the school may, at its discretion, notify the student that it may be beneficial to turn down all or a portion of the grant funds to preserve his or her grant eligibility for attendance at another institution. Of course, if a student should independently contact the institution and state that he or she does not wish to receive a grant disbursement, the institution is not required to make the disbursement. Time frame for post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds 34 CFR 668.22(a)(6)(ii)(B)(1)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV loan funds A school must notify a student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, in writing prior to making any post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, whether those loan funds are to be credited to the student's account or disbursed directly to the student (or parent). The information provided in this notification must include the information necessary for the student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, to make an informed decision as to whether the student or parent would like to accept any disbursement of loan funds and must be provided within 30 days of the date of a school's determination that a student has withdrawn. In addition, the notice must request confirmation of any post-withdrawal disbursement that the student or parent, as applicable, wishes the school to make. The notice must identify the type and amount of the loan funds the school wishes to credit to the student's account or disburse directly to the student or parent, and explain that a student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, may accept or decline all or a portion of the funds. The notice must also explain to the student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, the obligation to repay the loan funds whether they are disbursed to the student's account or directly to the borrower. The notice must also make clear that a student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, may not receive as a direct disbursement loan funds that the institution wishes to credit to the student's account unless the institution agrees to do so. If the student, or parent for a Direct Parent PLUS Loan, does not wish to accept some or all of the loan funds that the institution wishes to credit to the student's account, the institution must not disburse those funds. In the information a school provides to a student when the school informs the student that he or she is due a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, the school should include information about the advantages of keeping loan debt to a minimum. If a post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan proceeds, unless the recipient needs the funds to pay educational costs, the school might want to suggest that the student cancel the loan. With a student's permission, Title IV grant funds due a student in a post-withdrawal disbursement can be used to pay down a Title IV loan, thereby reducing any post-withdrawal disbursement made directly to the student. The school must document the result of the notification process and the final determination made concerning the disbursement and maintain that documentation in the student's file. Time frame for notification of eligibility for post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds 34 CFR 668.22(a)(6)(iii)(A) Cash management requirements for student and parent authorizations 34 CFR 668.165(b)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return Aid Calculation5-99 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If a school has completed post-withdrawal loan notification (described previously) and confirmed a student's desire for any Direct Loan funds included in the post-withdrawal disbursement, the school is permitted to credit a student's account with the post-withdrawal disbursement without additional permission from the student (or parent, in the case of a Direct PLUS Loan) for current charges as described earlier. A school may combine providing loan counseling, obtaining authorization to credit loan funds to a student's account for outstanding charges, and obtaining authorization to make a direct disbursement to the student. Once a school has received confirmation from a student, or parent in case of a Direct PLUS Loan, that he or she wants to receive the post- withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, a school must make the post- withdrawal disbursement of Title IV loan proceeds as soon as possible but no later than 180 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew. Separate authorization required for educationally related expenses A school is permitted to use a student's or parent's authorization for crediting the student's account for educationally related expenses that the school obtained prior to the student's withdrawal date so long as that authorization meets the cash management requirements for student or parent authorizations. If the school did not obtain authorization prior to the student's withdrawal, the school would have to obtain authorization in accordance with the cash management requirements before the school could credit the student's account for other current charges for educationally related activities. (See Volume 4 for more information on student and parent authorizations.) Crediting a student's account An institution should not request Title IV funds for a post- withdrawal disbursement unless and until it has determined that it can disburse any post-withdrawal disbursement within three business days of receiving the funds. The requirements for the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws reflect the cash management requirements for disbursing Title IV funds. An institution must obtain a student's authorization to credit a student's account with Title IV funds for charges other than current charges for tuition, fees, and room and board (if the student contracts with the school.) (See Volume 4 and Appendix F\u2014Institutional Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. )Outstanding Charges Example Consider a student who is due a post- withdrawal disbursement of $800. The institutional charges that the student was originally assessed by the school totaled $2,300. However, under the institution's refund policy, the institution may only keep $600 of those institutional charges. No funds had been paid toward the institutional charges at the time the student withdrew. In addition, the student owes $150 for a bus pass. The outstanding charges on the student's account that would be entered in Box 2 of the post- withdrawal Disbursement Tracking Sheet are $750 (the $600 in institutional charges plus the $150 owed for the bus pass). A portion of the $800 the institution must disburse under the post-withdrawal disbursement provisions may (with authorization if they are loan funds) be used to satisfy the outstanding balance. If the student has provided written authorization to credit Title IV funds to his account and use them for noninstitutional educational charges, the school may credit $750 to institutional charges and offer $50 to the student. If the student has not provided (and does not provide) written authorization to use the funds for noninstitutional educational charges, the school may only credit $600 to institutional charges and must offer $200 to the student.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Funds, 2018-20195-100 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Outstanding charges on a student's account are charges for which the institution will hold the student liable after the application of any applicable refund policy. These are the institutional charges, after any adjustment, that reflect what the student will owe for the current term after his or her withdrawal, any other current charges, plus any permitted minor prior year charges. A school may credit a student's account for prior award year charges in accordance with the cash management requirements (see Volume 4). Schools should make every effort to explain to a student that all or a portion of his or her post-withdrawal disbursement has been used to satisfy any charges from prior award years. Notice to a student offering a post-withdrawal disbursement\u2014flexibility in notifying students To avoid having to contact a student multiple times, a school may use one contact to: notify a borrower about his or her loan repayment obligations; obtain permission to credit loan funds to a student's account to cover unpaid institutional charges; obtain permission to make a post-withdrawal disbursement of grant or loan funds for other than institutional charges; and obtain permission to make a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds directly to a student. A school must send the notification as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date that the school determines the student withdrew . In the notification, the school must advise the student or parent that an institution may set a deadline of 14 days or more. Any deadline must apply to both confirmation of loan disbursements to the student's account and direct disbursements of a post-withdrawal disbursement. The notification must make it clear that if the student or parent does not respond to the notification within the time frame, the school is not required to make the post-withdrawal disbursement. However, a school may choose to make a post-withdrawal disbursement based on an acceptance received from a student or parent after the school's deadline.Deadline for responding to an offer of a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds 34 CFR 668.22(a)(6)( iii)(A)(5) Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return IV Aid Calculation5-101 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL A school that chooses to honor a late response must disburse all the funds accepted by the student or parent as applicable. The school cannot credit the student's account in accordance with the student's request, but decline to disburse post-withdrawal funds accepted as a direct disbursement. If a response is not received from the student or parent within the permitted time frame, or the student declines the funds, the school must return (or, in the case of grant funds, redisburse to another eligible student) any earned funds that the school was holding to the Title IV programs. If a student or parent submits a timely response accepting all or a portion of a post-withdrawal disbursement, per the student's or parent's instructions, the school must disburse the loan funds within 180 days of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. (For additional information, see the discussion under Date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew in Chapter 1.) Note that the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew is the same date that triggers the 30-day period that the school has for notifying the student or parent of any post-withdrawal disbursement available for direct disbursement. Consequently, the sooner a school sends the notification to a student or parent, the more time the school has to make any accepted post-withdrawal disbursement. If authorization from a student (or parent for a Direct PLUS Loan) is received after the deadline and the school chooses not to make a post- withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, the school must notify the student (or parent) that the post-withdrawal disbursement will not be made and why. This notification must be made in writing. If an authorization from the student (or parent for a Direct PLUS Loan) is never received, or if the school chooses to make a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds per the recipient's instructions on an authorization received after the deadline, the school does not need to notify the student.Student's Response to an Offer of a PWD A student's or parent's response to an offer of a direct disbursement of Title IV loan funds from a post-withdrawal disbursement does not have to be in writing. However, a school must document the response.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-102 HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Example of the Post-Withdrawal Disbursement Requirements Michael drops out of school on November 5. On November 10, the school becomes aware that Michael has ceased attending. The school determines that because Michael has earned $900 in Title IV Program assistance that he has not received, he is due a post-withdrawal disbursement of $900. When Michael withdrew, only $600 of the $1,000 in Federal Pell Grant funds that could have been disbursed had been disbursed. Of the $500 in Direct Loan funds that could have been disbursed, none had been disbursed. The school determines that Michael has $50 in outstanding tuition charges and $100 in outstanding library fines for the payment period. The school obtained permission from Michael at the beginning of the term (prior to his withdrawal) to credit his account for educationally related charges other than tuition, fees, and room and board. Because available grant funds must be used before available loan funds to make a post-withdrawal disbursement, the school credits Michael's account with $150 of his Federal Pell Grant funds. On November 12 (the last date school could have sent the funds was December 24th\u2014 45 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew), the school sends the remaining $250 in Pell Grant funds to Michael. On the same day (the last date the school could have sent the notification was December 9th\u201430 days after the school's determination that the student withdrew), the school sends a notification to Michael stating that: 1. He is due a post-withdrawal disbursement of $500 in Direct Loan funds to be disbursed directly to him. 2. Michael may accept all, a portion, or none of the $500 in Direct Loan funds. 3. Any Direct Loan funds that Michael accepts will have to be repaid. 4. The school is obligated to make a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds only if Michael accepts the funds by November 25, which is 14 days after the school sent the notification. Note that a school may allow more than 14 days for a response. Michael responds on November 19 and informs the school that he is accepting $250 of the $500 in Direct Loan funds. The school has until June 9 (180 days after November 10\u2014the date the school determined that the student withdrew) to make the disbursement (34 CFR 668.22(a)(6)(iii)(C)). The school must document the notification and the final determination pursuant to it (whether the student accepts a partial or full disbursement or declines the entire disbursement (34 CFR 668.22(a)(6)(iv)). Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of IV Aid Calculation5-103 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Part 2 \u2014Title IV aid to be returned If the student receives more Title IV aid than the amount earned, the school, the student, or both must return the unearned funds in a specified order. The amount of Title IV aid to be returned is determined by subtracting the amount of earned Title IV aid (Box I) from the amount of Title IV aid that was actually disbursed to the student (Box E). STEP 5: AMOUNT OF UNEARNED TITLE IV AID DUE FROM THE SCHOOL When a return of Title IV funds is due, the school and the student may both have a responsibility for returning funds. Funds that are not the responsibility of the school to return must be returned by the student. Although these requirements talk in terms of returning funds, a school is not required to actually return its share before the student. Rather, it is the R2T4 calculation of the amount of assistance the school is responsible for returning to the Title IV accounts that must be calculated first. Thus, the student's repayment obligation is determined after the school's share is calculated. The school must return the lesser of: the amount of Title IV funds that the student does not earn, or the amount of institutional charges that the student incurred for the payment period or period of enrollment multiplied by the percentage of funds that was not earned. The percentage not earned (Box M) is determined by subtracting the percentage of Title IV aid earned (Box H) from 100%. Aid disbursed to the student before institutional charges are paid Consider a case in which, to assist a student with living expenses, a school elects to disburse an anticipated credit balance to a student rather than pay itself for institutional charges from the first Title IV funds the school receives. Then, the student withdraws before the school receives anticipated aid from all the Title IV programs. The R2T4 calculations indicate the school must return funds, but the school had passed through all funds to the student. The school still must return the funds it is responsible for returning as a result of the R2T4 calculation. Title IV aid to be returned 34 CFR 668.22(a)(4) Disbursement Prohibited A school may not disburse the proceeds of a Title IV loan when it knows that the the loan will not repaid by the borrower. Therefore, a school may not disburse the proceeds of a Direct PLUS Loan taken out by a parent who has died, even though the student for whose benefit the loan was intended remains alive and otherwise eligible. If a school receives the proceeds of a Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent who has died, it must return the funds to the Department.Step 5: Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school 34 CFR 668.22(g) A school's policy and the R2T4 requirements Title IV funds are provided under the assumption that they are used to pay institutional charges ahead of all other aid. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-104 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Institutional charges Institutional charges are used to determine the portion of unearned Title IV aid that the school is responsible for returning. Schools must ensure the inclusion of all appropriate fees as well as applicable charges for books, supplies, materials, and equipment in Step 5, Part L of the R2T4 calculation. (See Institutional versus noninstitutional charges and Demonstrating a real and reasonable opportunity in Chapter 1.) Institutional charges do not affect the amount of Title IV aid that a student earns when he or she withdraws. If an institution enters into a contract with a third party to provide institutional housing, the institution must include the cost of housing as an institutional charge in an R2T4 calculation if a student living in the third-party housing withdraws. Use of institutional charges in determining a school's responsibility for return The institutional charges used in the calculation are always the charges that were assessed the student for the entire payment period or period of enrollment, as applicable, prior to the student's withdrawal. Initial charges may only be adjusted by those changes the institution made prior to the student's withdrawal (e.g., for dropping or adding a class or changing enrollment status). If, after a student withdraws, the institution changes the amount of institutional charges it assessed a student or decides to eli minate all institutional charges, those changes affect neither the charges used in the R2T4 calculation nor aid earned in the R2T4 calculation . (Please see Step 3\u2014Amount of Title IV aid Earned by the Student, for a further discussion of aid earned and institutional charges.) Institutional charges may not be reduced even if other sources of aid are used to pay those charges. For example, a school may not reduce institutional charges when an outside agency supplying aid requires that aid to be used for tuition. The R2T4 regulations presume Title IV program funds are used to pay institutional charges ahead of all other sources of aid. When an institution that offers courses in a nonterm credit-hour format calculates the aid for which the student is eligible, it does so using costs associated with the number of courses it expects the student to complete in the period for which aid is awarded. If the student later withdraws, the charges entered in Step 5 of the R2T4 calculation must include the charges for all the courses the student was initially expected to complete.Institutional charges 34 CFR 668.22(a) 34 668.22(g)(2)(ii) and DCL GEN-00-24 December 2000 Fees as noninstitutional charges Application fees are excluded from institutional charges because they are not an educational cost. (Federal Register, Volume 59, No. 82, April 29, 1994, page 22356.)Treatment of Work-Study Funds Federal Work-Study funds are not included in the calculation of earned Title IV funds when a student withdraws. This remains the case even if a student has granted permission for a percentage of the student's Federal Work-Study earnings to be credited to his or her account to pay educational charges. Effect of other assistance Federal Register, Volume 64, No. 210, November 1, 1999, page 59032 Administrative Fees Administrative fees are not excluded from Return of Title IV Funds calculations. If a student drops classes or a school drops a student's classes on the same day that the student withdraws, the dropped classes have no effect on institutional charges included in the R2T4 calculation. TIPChapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of IV Aid Calculation5-105 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Effects of a post-withdrawal reduction in charges If a student withdraws and, as a result of applying an institutional refund policy, the school reverses, reduces, or cancels a student's charges, the R2T4 requirements still apply. The statute mandates that an otherwise eligible student who begins attendance at a school and is disbursed or could have been disbursed Title IV grant or loan funds prior to a withdrawal earns a portion of those Title IV funds. If, as a result of the withdrawal, an institution adjusts or eliminates a student's institutional charges, or changes a student's enrollment status, the changes made by the institution have no bearing on the applicability of the requirements in 34 CFR 668.22. Moreover, the charges used in the R2T4 calculation are always the charges on the student's account prior to withdrawal. However, if a student's enrollment status changed prior to and unrelated to the withdrawal, the effect of that change on institutional charges should be reflected in any R2T4 calculation. Effects of waivers on institutional charges If your school treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees that have actually been charged to a student, then the waiver is considered a financial aid resource, and the full amount of the tuition and fees must be included in Step 5, Part L of the R2T4 calculation. On the other hand, if the student is never assessed the full charges, the waiver is not considered to be financial aid, and only the actual charges would be included in the R2T4 calculation. (See DCL GEN 00-24, December 2000, for a further discussion of waivers and the R2T4 calculation.)How the Cash Management Regulations Might Affect the Determination of Institutional Charges in an R2T4 Calculation The cash management regulations determine the amount of Title IV aid a school may retain for institutional charges for a payment period (See the discussion under Apportioning and prorating charges in Volume 4, Chapter 2 for a complete discussion.) The amount determined under those regulations must be used in determining institutional charges in an R2T4 calculation (Step 5, Part L). Although a school may not be allowed to retain the amount charged for books and supplies beyond what is attributed to the payment period, they may always exclude from institutional charges the documented cost to the school (what the school paid for the items) of unreturnable equipment and returnable equipment not returned in good condition (See the discussion under Institutional vs noninstitutional charges in Chapter 1 and, for an example, see Case Study 5 in Chapter 3 . Waiver Example An institution charges state residents $900 per semester. Out-of-state students are charged an additional $2,000 for a total of $2,900. However, the institution grants waivers of the out-of-state charges to out- of-state athletes. The waiver is considered a payment to those charges, and the full $2,900 would need to be included in any R2T4 calculation.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL STEP 6: RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS BY THE SCHOOL Order of return of Title IV funds A school must return Title IV funds to the programs from which the student received aid during the payment period or period of enrollment as applicable, in the following order, up to the net amount disbursed from each source: Unsubsidized Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Direct Loans Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants for which a return of Title IV funds is required FSEOG for which a return of Title IV funds is required TEACH Grants for which a return of Title IV funds is required Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, for which a return of Title IV funds is required. Time frame for the return of Title IV funds A school must return unearned funds for which it is responsible as soon as possible but no later than 45 days from the determination of a student's withdrawal. A school will be considered to have returned funds timely if the school does one of the following as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the date it determines that the student withdrew: deposit s or transfers the funds into the school's federal funds bank account, and then awards and disburses the funds to another eligible student; returns the funds to the Department electronically using the \"Refund\" function in G5; issues a check to the Department. A school is considered to have issued a check timely if the school's records show that the check was issued within 45 days of the date the school determined that the student withdrew and the date on the cancelled check shows that the bank endorsed that check no more than 60 days after the date the school determined that the student withdrew.Order of return of Title IV funds 34 CFR 668.22(i) Time frame for return of Title IV funds 34 CFR 668.22(j)(1) Return of Title IV Funds When a School Does Not Maintain a Separate Federal Bank Account The Department considers a school that maintains Title IV funds and general operating funds in the same bank account (commingles) to satisfy the requirement that it return unearned funds on a timely basis if: the school maintains subsidiary ledgers for each type of funds commingled in that account that clearly show how and when those funds were used and reconciled to its general ledger, the subsidiary ledger for each Title IV program provides a detailed audit trail on a student-by-student basis that reconciles to the amount of Title IV program funds received and disbursed by the school, and the school updates the relevant sub - sidiary ledger accounts in its general ledger no later than 30 days after it determines that the student withdrew. More specifically, the return of an unearned funds transaction should be recorded as a debit to a Title IV program fund subsidiary ledger account and a credit to the school's operating fund subsidiary ledger account. The date of the return is the date this transaction is posted to the school's general ledger.If a School Has Not Drawn Federal Funds If a school has not drawn down federal funds or has made disbursements that exceed the amount the school has drawn, the school does not need to deposit funds in its federal account. Of course, the school's accounting records must show that institutional funds were used to credit the student's account.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-107 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Downward adjustment of FSA grant disbursement records and Direct Loan disbursement records required Returns of FSA grant funds (except FSEOG and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants), other than funds that are being returned to stay in compliance with the excess cash requirements, must be offset by downward reductions to a student's record in COD. Likewise, all returns of Direct Loan funds must be offset by downward reductions to a student's record in COD. In addition, when all or a portion of a Direct Loan is cancelled (either because the borrower requested the cancellation within the regulatory time frames or to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements), the school must make the appropriate adjustment to the student's record in COD. All returns of FSA Grants and Direct Loan funds previously disbursed (unclaimed credit balances) should be made through the G5 system. Returning Direct Loan funds If a school is required to return Direct Loan funds to comply with a regulatory or statutory requirement, even if more than 120 days have elapsed since the disbursement date, the school must return Direct Loan funds through G5. The school returns Direct Loan funds to the Department following the same procedures the school follows when making other G5 refunds/returns. No de minimis Provision for Schools The de minimis provision that waives returns of grant funds from students when the original amount to be returned is less than $50.00 does not apply to schools. A school must return the full amount owed to any Title IV program that the school is responsible for returning. However, a school does not have to return amounts of less than $1.00.TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-108 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Returning funds after 240 days In all cases, a school will have to request permission to make a change to its Fiscal Operations Report (FISAP) after December 15 following the close of the award year. If FSA Grant funds (other than FSEOG and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants) must be returned after 240 days, a school must: enter the student's revised Pell Grant award in COD; return the funds to the Department through G5, if applicable; and make the appropriate change to the FISAP (see sidebar). Note that for Pell Grant funds from a prior award year, a school may not use the funds for an eligible student in the current year. If FSEOG funds must be returned after 240 days, a school must: enter the student's revised FSEOG award both in the individual student's account and the school's FSEOG ledger; either return the funds to the Department through G5 OR carry them forward to the next award year; and make the appropriate change to the FISAP (see sidebar). If Perkins Loan funds from a prior award year must be returned after 240 days, a school must: reimburse its Perkins Loan fund; report those funds as income in Part III, Section A of the FISAP; and reduce the student's Perkins Loan balance and make an accounting entry to tie that reduction to the journal entry for the aforementioned reimbursement of its Perkins Loan fund. The school should not make any changes to the student's Perkins promissory note. If a school cannot locate a student to whom it owes FWS funds the student has earned, the federal portion must be returned to the school's FWS account. If the student comes back or the school later locates the student, the school can recover the FWS funds as long as the account for that year is still open. If the account is closed, the school must pay the student (under the wage and hour laws) using its own funds.Amending a FISAP After the Close of an Award Y ear or After a School Has Submitted a Final FISAP for an Award Y ear To amend its FISAP, a school must log into COD and access the Campus-Based section from the School tab. From the FISAP Dashboard, select the correct FISAP for editing. After making and saving the appropriate updates, proceed to validate and submit. If the December 15 revision deadline has passed, schools will be prompted to submit a Change Request. In the explanation box, the school should provide the FISAP part, section number, and line number(s) on which the changes were made; the amount of the change; and a description of the conditions that re - quire the revision (e.g., to comply with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.22). After providing all of the required information, the school clicks the Submit button and then affirms that it wants to Continue to Submit . The Campus-Based staff will evaluate the school's submission. If a school's request is denied, the Campus-Based staff will inform the school why its request was denied. If the school's request is approved, the Campus-Based staff will notify the school by sending an email to the individual on record as the school's financial aid director (in Field 19) that the school's FISAP has been unlocked and that school has five days to submit the revised working copy as the final copy. For assistance with amending a previous year's FISAP, schools should call the COD School Relations Center at: 800-848-0978.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Calculation5-109 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL STEP 7: INITIAL AMOUNT OF UNEARNED TITLE IV AID DUE FROM THE STUDENT The statute specifies that a student is responsible for all unearned Title IV program assistance that the school is not required to return. The initial amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the student (or parent, for Direct PLUS Loan funds) (Box Q) is determined by subtracting the amount returned by the school (Box O) from the total amount of unearned Title IV funds to be returned (Box K). This is called the initial amount due from the student because a student does not have to return the full amount of any grant repayment due. Therefore, the student may not have to return the full initial amount due. STEP 8: REPAYMENT OF STUDENT LOANS The student loans that remain outstanding (Box R) consist of the loans disbursed to the student (Box B) minus any loans the school repaid in Step 6 (Box P). These outstanding loans are repaid by the student according to the terms of the student's promissory notes. STEP 9: TITLE IV GRANT FUNDS TO BE RETURNED BY A STUDENT The regulations limit the amount a student must repay to the amount by which the original overpayment amount exceeds 50% of the total grant funds disbursed to or that could have been disbursed to the student for the payment period or period of enrollment. The initial amount of unearned Title IV grant aid due from the student (Box S) is found by subtracting the loans to be repaid by the student (Box R) from the initial amount of unearned aid due from the student (Box Q). The amount of grant overpayment due from a student (Box U) is limited to the amount by which the original grant overpayment (Box S) exceeds half of the total Title IV grant funds disbursed and could have been disbursed to the student (Box T). Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-110 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL STEP 10: RETURN OF TITLE IV GRANT FUNDS BY THE STUDENT The student is obligated to return any Title IV overpayment in the same order that is required for schools. Grant overpayments may be resolved through: full and immediate repayment to the institution; repayment arrangements satisfactory to the school; or overpayment collection procedures negotiated with Default Resolution Group. A SCHOOL'S RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS BY THE STUDENT A school has responsibilities that continue beyond complet - ing the R2T4 calculation and returning the funds for which it is responsible. Here we discuss the institution's participation in the return of funds by the student. Grant overpayments The applicable regulations limit the amount of grant funds a student must repay to one-half of the grant funds the student received or could have received during the applicable period. Moreover, repayment terms for students who owe Title IV grant overpayments were established to ensure that students who could not immediately repay their debt in full had the opportunity to continue their eligibility for Title IV funds. Students who owe overpayments as a result of withdrawals initially will retain their eligibility for Title IV funds for a maximum of 45 days from the earlier of: the date the school sends the student notice of the overpay - ment, or the date the school was required to notify the student of the overpayment.Initial amount due from student 34 CFR 668.22(h) Return of Title IV funds by the student 34 CFR 668.22(h)(3)(i) and (ii) Grant overpayments, retaining eligibility 34 CFR 668.22(h)(4)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-111 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Within 30 days of determining that a student who withdrew must repay all or part of a Title IV grant, a school must notify the student that he or she must repay the overpayment or make satisfactory arrangements to repay it. In its notification, a school must inform the student of the following five items: 1. The student owes an overpayment of Title IV funds. 2. The student's eligibility for additional Title IV funds will end if the student fails to take positive action by the 45th day following the date the school sent or was required to send notification to the student. 3. There are three positive actions a student can take to extend his or her eligibility for Title IV funds beyond 45 days: a) The student may repay the overpayment in full to the school. b) The student may sign a repayment agreement with the school. Two years is the maximum time a school may allow for repayment. A school must have procedures in place that ensure the school immediately refers for collection (to the Default Resolution Group) any student who violates the terms of the repayment agreement (including failing to repay the full amount within two years). The Department may take enforcement action against schools that fail to refer students for collection as required by the regulations. c) The student may sign a repayment agreement with the Department. 4. If the student fails to take one of the positive actions during the 45-day period, the school will report th e student's overpay - ment to NSLDS and refer the student to the Default Resolution Group for collection. 5. The student should contact the school to discuss his or her options. If the student takes no positive action during the 45-day period, the school should both refer the student for collection AND report the overpayment immediately to NSLDS on the NSLDS Professional Access website under the AID tab, \"Overpayment List\" menu option after the 45-day period has elapsed. (Because making this change in the NSLDS system is a simple process, we expect an institution will complete making the change within a few days of the end of the 45-day period.) ReminderSatisfactory repayment arrangements 668.22(h)(4)(i)(B) & (C) Repayment arrangements with schools 34 CFR 668.22(h)(4)(iii) Two-year maximum 668.22(h)(4)(iii)(B)Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the 2018-20195-112 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student receives additional funds during the 45-day period of extended eligibility Students who owe overpayments as a result of withdrawals generally will retain their eligibility for Title IV funds for a maximum of 45 days from the earlier of (a) the date the school sends the student notice of the overpayment, or (b) the date the school was required to notify the student of the overpayment. A student who receives Title IV funds within that period of extended eligibility and then fails to return the overpayment or make repayment arrangements becomes ineligible for additional Title IV program funds on the day following the 45-day period. However, any Title IV program funds received by the student during the 45-day period were received while the student was eligible. Therefore, those Title IV funds do not have to be returned (unless the student withdraws a second time). A student who loses his or her eligibility for Title IV funds at the expiration of the 45-day period will remain ineligible for additional Title IV funds until the student enters into a repayment agreement with the Department. If, at any time, a student who previously negotiated a repayment arrangement fails to comply with the terms of his or her agreement to repay, that student immediately becomes ineligible for additional Title IV funds. Any Title IV program funds received by the student between the time the student negotiated the repayment arrangement and the time the student violated the agreement were received while the student was eligible. Therefore, those Title IV funds do not have to be returned (unless the student withdraws a second time). A student who violates the terms of a repayment agreement and loses eligibility remains ineligible for Title IV funds until the student has made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the Department. If, in either of the two aforementioned cases, the student withdraws a second time, any unearned funds from the disbursements that were made while the student was still eligible would have to be returned in accordance with the R2T4 requirements.45-Day Period Example On October 30, during the fall semester, a student withdraws and owes a grant overpayment. On November 29, the school notifies the student of the overpayment. The student has 45 days (until January 13) to repay the overpayment in full or to make arrangements with the institution or the Department to repay the overpayment. The spring semester begins on January 7, before the 45-day period ends, and the student receives Title IV aid for the spring semester on January 10. The student then fails to repay the overpayment in full or sign a repayment agreement by the end of the 45-day period\u2014January 13. The student is not required to return the Title IV funds received on January 10. However, the student becomes ineligible for additional Title IV funds on January 14 and remains ineligible until he or she enters into a repayment agreement with the Department.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-113 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Examples of the Relationship Between the Date of Notification and the Expiration of the 45-Day Period Example 1 \u2014A school sends notification to a student within the 30 days allowed. If a school sends notification to a student within the 30 days allowed, the 45-day period begins on the day after the school sends the notification to the student. If a school determines on August 20 that a student withdrew and owes a repayment and the school sends notification to the student on September 1 (within the 30 days allowed), then the first day of the 45-day period is September 2. Unless the student takes positive action to resolve the overpayment before the end of the 45-day period, the student loses his or her eligibility on the 45th day. Thus, in this case, the last day of the student's eligibility for Title IV funds is October 16. Example 2\u2014A school fails to notify the student or notifies the student after the 30 days allowed. If the school fails to notify the student or notifies the student after the 30 days allowed, the 45-day period begins on the day after the end of the 30-day period (the date by which the school should have sent the notification to the student). Consider a school that determines on August 1 that a student withdrew on June 15. The school should have sent the student a letter by July 15. Because it failed to do so, the first day of the 45-day period is the day after the end of the 30-day period (July 16). Unless the student takes action to resolve the overpayment, the last day of the student's eligibility for Title IV funds is August 29, the end of the 45-day period that began on July 16. If a student agrees to a repayment arrangement and then fails to meet the terms of that arrangement, the student's eligibility ends as of the date the student fails to comply with the terms of the repayment arrangement.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Student overpayments of $50 or less A student does not have to repay a grant overpayment of $50.00 or less for grant overpayments resulting from the student's withdrawal. As a result, a grant overpayment of $50.00 or less will not make the student ineligible to receive Title IV aid should the student return to school. A school is not required to attempt recovery of that overpayment, rep ort it to NSLDS, or refer it to Default Resolution Group. These de minimis amounts are program specific. That is, if an R2T4 calculation resulted in a student having to return $150.00 in Pell Grant funds and $40.00 in FSEOG funds, the student would have to return the Pell Grant funds, but the FSEOG funds would be considered de minimis and treated as described above. If a school is currently holding an overpayment resulting from a withdrawal for which the original amount (after the grant protection was applied) was less than $50.00, the school should delete the overpayment in NSLDS by following these steps: 1. On the NSLDS Professional Access website, go to the \" Aid Tab. \" 2. From the Overpayment List page, select the overpayment to be deleted by clicking on the blue number icon. 3. On the Overpayment Display page, verify that this is the over - payment you want to delete, and then click the Delete button. 4. On the Overpayments Delete Confirmation page, click the Confirm Button. This standard does not apply to remaining grant overpayment balances. That is, a student must repay a grant overpayment that has been reduced to $50.00 or less because of payments made. An overpayment for which the original amount was more than $50.00 that has a current balance of less than $50.00 may not be written off. Note: Default Resolution Group will not accept referrals for which the original amount was less than $25. This provision does not apply to funds that a school is required to return . A school must return the full amount owed to any Title IV program that the school is responsible for returning. However, a school does not have to return amounts of less than $1.00.Student overpayments less than $50.00 34 CFR 668.22(h)(3)(ii)Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return Aid Calculation5-115 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Payments on a student's behalf The grant protection always applies to the repayment of grant funds for which the student is responsible, regardless of who actually returns the funds. If an institution chooses to return all or a portion of a grant overpayment that otherwise would be the responsibility of the student to return, the grant protection still applies. If an institution returns a grant overpayment for a student, the student would no longer be considered to have a Title IV grant overpayment and, as such, no reporting to NSLDS is required and no referral to Default Resoluti on Group for collection is allowed. This would be true whether the institution simply returned the overpayment for the student or returned the overpayment and created a debit on the student's school account. Recording student payments and reductions in the Title IV grant programs For reductions and payments to awards, schools should record reductions and payments by entering a replacement value. If, through its R2T4 calculation, a school determines that a student has received an overpayment of Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, or TEACH Grant funds, the school should reduce the student's award/disbursements and return the funds. First, reduce the student's award/disbursements by entering a replacement value in the COD system. The replacement value will be the original values less only the amount the school has returned (the sum of: (a) that amount the school is responsible for returning, plus (b) any portion of the grant overpayment that otherwise would be the responsibility of the student but which the school has chosen to return for the student, plus (c) any portion of the grant overpayment the school has collected from the student). Do not reduce the award/disbursement by the amount the student must return unless the student has made a payment. If a school receives a payment for a current-year overpayment that has not been referred to Default Resolution Group, the school should NOT send the payment to Default Resolution Group. Instead, after you have reduced the student's disbursement in COD, return the unearned funds as follows: If your school has made repayment arrangements with a student and received a payment on a current-year overpay - ment, the school should deposit the funds in its Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, or TEACH Grant account and make the appropriate entry in the COD system.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-116 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If a student makes a payment on any previous year's Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, or TEACH Grant overpay - ment, a school makes the aforementioned COD system entry using the same software the school used to create the award. The school then returns the funds to the Department using the Electronic Refund function in G5 following the same pro - cedures the school follows when making other G5 refunds/ returns. If, through its R2T4 calculation, a school determines that a student has received an overpayment of FSEOG funds, the school must adjust its institutional ledgers, financial aid records, and the student's account by subtracting the amount the school must return (the FISAP filed for the year will reflect the net award to the student). If a student makes a payment on an FSEOG overpayment made in the current award year, the school should deposit the payment in its federal funds account and award the funds to other needy students. If the school collects an overpayment of an FSEOG for an award made in a prior award year , the funds recovered should be returned to the Department using the Electronic Refund function in G5. Payments should be applied to the award year in which the recovered funds were awarded. For information on handling student payments after you have referred an overpayment to Default Resolution Group, see the discussion under Accepting payments on referred overpayments later in this chapter.TIP A school should never make a downward adjustment in COD to reflect funds the school has referred to the Department for collection. Doing so will create a negative disbursement record.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-117 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Recording student payments and reductions in the Direct Loan Program If, through its R2T4 calculation, a school determines that a student has received an overpayment of Direct Loan funds, the school should reduce the student's award/disbursements by making a downward adjustment in COD. The school then returns the funds to the Department using the Electronic Refund function in G5 following the same procedures the school follows when making other G5 refunds/returns. The Department Stopped Accepting Paper Checks for Direct Loan Refunds of Cash in 2014 In an effort to increase efficiency and improve funds control, Federal Student Aid now requires schools to refund cash electronically via the G5 website. This method is faster and more secure than manual/paper processing, and is less likely to result in errors. On January 1, 2015, FSA stopped accepting Direct Loan refunds of cash sent manually via paper check. As a result, schools are required to update their processes to refund cash electronically via the G5 website at https://www.g5.gov. For additional information on refunding cash via G5, refer to the G5 website at https://www.g5.gov or call the G5 Hotline at 888-336-8930 or 202-401-6238 for assistance. For questions about refunding cash, contact the COD School Relations Center at 800-848-0978 or 571-392-3737 .

However, if a school reports a student overpayment (for which a student has not negotiated repayment arrangements) to NSLDS before the 45- day period has elapsed, the student will appear to be ineligible for Title IV aid. Since students retain their eligibility for 45 days, schools should provide students with every opportunity to repay their debt or negotiate repayment arrangements before reporting it to NSLDS and referring it to Default Resolution Group. Important: Default Resolution Group is unable to respond to a student-initiated request to negotiate a repayment arrangement until a school has referred the student's account for collection. In addition, Debt Resolution Services uses the information about the student in the NSLDS while conversing with a student. To ensure a student overpayment has been reported and referred to the Department, when the school is communicating with a student about making repayment arrangements with the Department, the school should make it clear that the student should contact the school before contacting the Department . Repayment agreements with the Department will include terms that permit students to repay overpayments while maintaining their eligibility for Title IV funds. Schools are encouraged to negotiate similar repayment agreements with students. However, schools' repayment arrangements with students must provide for complete repayment of the overpayments within two years of the date of the institutions' determination that the students withdrew.NSLDS DCL GEN-98-14, July 1998 You must use the NSLDS Professional Access website to report overpayments. To do so, your school must have Internet access, and your Primary Destination Point Administrator (DPA) must have signed up at least one user for Overpayment updates for NSLDS online services at https:// fsawebenroll.ed.gov. DCL GEN-04-08 gives the most recent technical specifications. The email address for NSLDS Customer Support is: NSLDS@ed.gov The phone number for ONLY is 1-800-999-8219Reporting Overpayments to NSLDS DCL GEN-98-14, July 1998 All new Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, and FSEOG overpayments and previously reported FSEOG overpayments for which a data element has changed must be reported. All data providers must meet all NSLDS reporting requirements as detailed in the appropriate operating manuals. NSLDS reference materials are available at: ifap.ed.gov/ifap/byYear.jsp?type=nsldsmaterialsReporting required If a student is determined to have withdrawn from a school, the student is no longer considered to be enrolled and in attendance. Therefore, the student is no longer eligible for an in-school status or in-school deferment, and the school must report the student as withdrawn in NSLDS Enrollment Reporting. 34 CFR 685.309 (b) Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-119 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL There are exceptions to the recommendation that a school wait the full 45 days before reporting a student overpayment through NSLDS. If, during the 45-day period, a student indicates that he or she cannot repay his or her debt in full and wishes to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Department, the school should immediately report the overpayment to NSLDS and refer the overpayme nt to Default Resolution Group. Likewise, if a student contacts a school that will not be offering institutional repayment agreements and indicates that he or she cannot pay the overpayment within the 45 days, the school should immediately report the overpayment to NSLDS and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group. Default Resolution Group will need time to receive and record an overpayment before it can respond to a student inquiry. Schools should advise students to wait at least 10 days before contacting Default Resolution Group. After a school has reported and referred a student's overpayment, the school should provide the student with the phone number and postal address for Default Resolution Group. A student can contact Default Resolution Group by calling 1-800-621-3115 or by writing Default Resolution Group at the following address: U.S. Department of Education Default Resolution Group P.O. Box 5609 Greenville, Texas 75403 Reporting and referring overpayments Referring overpayments for collection is a separate process from reporting overpayments to NSLDS. Reporting is the process of creating within NSLDS a record of a student's overpayment. Referring is the process of turning over a student's debt to Default Resolution Group. Students who pay their debts in full during the 45-day period should neither be reported to NSLDS nor referred for collection. A school reports overpayments to NSLDS via the NSLDS Professional Access website . A school sends referrals to Default Resolution Group \u2014through the U.S. Mail to the following address: Student Loan Processing Center\u2014Overpayments P.O. Box 415 Greenville, Texas 75403Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-120 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If a student who owes a repayment of a Title IV grant calls Default Resolution Group before Debt Resolution Services has received and recorded the student's overpayment, Default Resolution Group will examine the student's record in NSLDS. If a school has reported the overpayment to NSLDS correctly, the Default Resolution Group will inform the student that the overpayment is being processed and that the student should call back in 10 days for further information. If a student calls Default Resolution Group before a school has reported the student's overpayment to NSLDS, The Default Resolution Group will find no record of the overpayment and will tell the student to contact the school to resolve the discrepancy. A student who does not take positive action during the 45-day period becomes ineligible for Title IV funds on the 46th day from the earlier of (1) the date the school sends a notification to the student of the overpayment; or (2) the date the school was required to notify the student of the overpayment. The student will remain ineligible until the student enters into a satisfactory repayment agreement with the Department. An overpayment resulting from a student's withdrawal remains an overpayment until it is repaid in full. Though a student may regain Title IV eligibility by negotiating and satisfying the requirements of a satisfactory repayment arrangement, the information on the student's NSLDS account will continue to reflect the status of the overpayment until the debt is repaid in full. If a school enters into a repayment arrangement with a student who owes an overpayment, the school should immediately report the repayment arrangement using the online NSLDS Professional Access website . The school should report the status (Indicator field) of an overpayment for which it has entered a repayment agreement as \"Satisfactory Arrangements Made .\" After the information is reported to NSLDS, any future output from the CPS (SARs and ISIRs) will show that the student owes a repayment of a Title IV grant and that the student has negotiated a satisfactory repayment arrangement with the school. As long as the student fulfills his or her commitment under the repayment arrangement, the NSLDS overpayment status of \"Satisfactory Arrangements Made \" will indicate that, though the student owes an overpayment, the student remains eligible for Title IV funds. If, at any time, a student fails to comply with the terms of the student's agreement to repay, or if the student fails to complete repayment in the two years allowed, the school must immediately update the student's overpayment status (Indicator field) to \"Overpayment.\" From that point on, NSLDS will inform schools that the student is not eligible for Title IV funds.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-121 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Required referrals A school must refer to the Department /Default Resolution Group a student who does not satisfy the requirements of a repayment agreement with the school; fails to contact the school during the 45-day period; fails, during the 45-day period, to pay his or her overpayment in full or enter into a repayment arrangement; or fails to complete repayment in the two years allowed. If a school is referring to Default Resolution Group a student overpayment previously reported to NSLDS, the school must also update the information previously reported to NSLDS by changing the Source field from \"School\" to \"Transfer.\" If a school is referring a student who has failed to satisfy the terms of his or her repayment agreement, the school should also change the status code (indicator field) from \"Satisfactory Arrangement Made\" to \"Overpayment.\" If a school is referring for collection a student not previously reported to NSLDS, the school must report the account to NSLDS as a referred overpayment, enter \"TRF-Transfer\" as the initial source in the Source field and \"Overpayment\" as the overpayment status (indicator field). To refer student overpayments for collection, schools should use a format similar to the one found in the Appendix to this volume as Information Required when Referring Student Overpayments to Default Resolution Group and send the document to the address at the bottom of that page. Each referral must be typed or printed and must be submitted on school letterhead. To avoid creating a double record for a single overpayment, the school must enter for the Dates of Disbursements the exact same dates the school used when it created the NSLDS record. In addition, for Award year , a school must ensure that it enters the year the disbursement was made. Once Default Resolution Group has accepted a referred student overpayment, Default Resolution Group will transmit the information to NSLDS and \"EDR Region\" will replace \"Transfer\" as the appropriate contact source for information about the overpayment. On its Overpayment Referral, schools must provide their school's Pell Grant Identification Number. S chools should not enter their Routing Identifier. If your school does not have a Pell Grant ID If you are referring a TEACH Grant to Default Resolution Group for collection and your school does not have a Pell Grant ID, on the \" Overpayment Referral Form , \" under \"School Information, \" you must provide your OPEID. All referrals to Default Resolution Group must be made on institutional letterhead. Remember to include your school's Reporting Pell Grant Identification Number on the referral.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Funds, 2018-20195-122 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL If the student whose overpayment case has been accepted by the Department wishes to establish a repayment schedule, the student should contact Default Resolution Group by calling: 1-800-621-3115 A student can c ontact us by going to: https://myeddebt.ed.gov/borrower and selecting \" Contact Us .\" Summary If, during the 45-day period, a student repays his or her debt in full to the institution, the institution should neither report the overpayment in NSLDS nor refer the student to Default Resolution Group. If, during the 45-day period, a student signs a repayment agreement with the institution, the institution should im - mediately (within a few days) make the appropriate entries in NSLDS using the online NSLDS Professional Access screens. If, during the 45-day period, a student indicates that he or she will not or cannot repay the overpayment and wishes to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Department, the school should immediately (within a few days) report the over - payment on the NSLDS Professional Access website , and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group. If the institution will not be offering institutional repayment arrangements to students and, during the 45-day period a student indicates that he or she cannot repay the debt in full, the institution should immediately (within a few days) report the overpayment on the NSLDS Professional Access website and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group. If a student fails to take any positive action during the 45-day period, upon the expiration of that period, the institution should immediately (within a few days) report the overpayment on the NSLDS Professional Access website and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group. If a student signs a repayment agreement with an institution and, at any time, then fails to fulfill the terms of that agree - ment, the institution should immediately (within a few days) report the overpayment on the NSLDS Professional Access website and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group.Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-123 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Accepting payments on referred overpayments A school may continue to accept payment on a Title IV grant overpayment after the overpayment has been referred to the Department. (Before accepting the funds, the school should verify the Department has accepted the debt by examining the \"Source\" field on the NSLDS Professional Access Overpayment List screen) . A school that accepts a check made out to the Department on an overpayment that has been referred to Default Resolution Group must : 1. note the student's name and Social Security Number (SSN) on the check; 2. indicate that the payment is for an overpayment of a Title IV grant; and 3 forward the payment to Default Resolution Group National Payment Center at: National Payment Center P.O. Box 105028 Atlanta, Georgia 30348-5028 If a school accepts a cash payment from one or more students who owe overpayments and who have been referred to Default Resolution Group, the school should write its own check to the Department and attach a letter indicating that the check is for a Title IV grant overpayment. The school must submit a separate letter for each student. A school may not include multiple students in a letter because the letters are imaged to borrower's accounts. T he school must include in its letter for each student who made a payment, the student's name, Social Security number, and amount paid. If a school receives a payment for an overpayment previously referred to Default Resolution Group, and if the overpayment was made in the current award year and the payment will retire the student's debt in full, t he institution must take the following three steps: 1. Deposit the payment in its appropriate institutionally maintained federal funds account. 2. Make the appropriate entry in the COD system (the replacement value). 3. Send a letter or fax to Default Resolution Group identifying the student and indicating that the student's overpayment has been completely repaid. This will allow the Department to properly update its records in both the Default Resolution Group system and NSLDS. The fax number ( this process cannot be performed via email ) for this purpose and school use only is: 903-454-2312Payment In Full Any time a school receives a payment (including the application of a Title IV credit balance) that will repay an overpayment in full, the school must also update its original submission to NSLDS by changing the entry on the \"Overpayment Update Screen\" for the Indicator Field to \"Repaid.\"TIPVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-124 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL In the fax or letter, a school must include the following six items: 1. award year of the overpayment (current award year only); 2. student's Social Security number; 3. student's last name, first name, and middle initial; 4. student's date of birth; 5. type of overpayment\u2014Federal Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, FSEOG, or TEACH Grant; and 6. the disbursement date the institution used to create the over - payment record in NSLDS. Corrections or recalls of referred overpayments If you determine that a student you referred to Default Resolution Group does not owe an overpayment or that the amount you referred was incorrect, you should fax a letter on college/university letterhead explaining the situation to Default Resolution Group at: 903-454-2312 Important: You should not send a revised referral form when making changes or corrections. The letter must include the following: student's last name, first name and middle initial; student's Social Security number; award year of the overpayment; disbursement date the institution used to create the overpay - ment record in NSLDS; amount originally referred; and description of the issue and the requested action. Default Resolution Group will cease collection efforts and change the record in NSLDS so that the overpayment will be shown as \"Repaid.\" The phone number for Default Resolution Group is: 1-800-621-3115Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Aid Calculation5-125 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL When a student loses eligibility at a former school while receiving aid at a second school If a student who owes a Title IV overpayment due to a withdrawal from one school receives additional Title IV aid at another school (based upon the student's having entered into an agreement with either Default Resolution Group or the first school) and then fails to meet the requirements of the agreement, Default Resolution Group or the school, as appropriate, will update NSLDS to show that the stude nt is no longer eligible due to his or her violation of the agreement. The NSLDS postscreening process will then cause a new ISIR record to be created and sent to all schools listed in the CPS record. As noted previously under When a student receives additional funds during the 45-day period of extended eligibility, the student loses eligibility as soon as he or she fails to meet the terms of the repayment agreement. The second school is not liable for any aid it disbursed after the student became ineligible but prior to being notified of the ineligibility via the NSLDS postscreening process. As provided for in previous guidance (GEN-96-13, Q&A 13 and 15), once the school receives a record from NSLDS showing that a student is not eligible, it may no longer disburse Title IV aid to the student and must assist the Department in requiring the student to repay any funds he or she was not eligible to receive. If a student who is receiving Title IV aid at an institution with which he or she has entered into a repayment agreement for a previous overpayment resulting from a withdrawal violates the terms of that agreement, the institution must immediately cease disbursing Title IV aid to the student. The school must immediately update the NSLDS record and refer the overpayment to Default Resolution Group.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of IV Funds, 2018-20195-126 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Withdrawal Dates for a School That is Not Required to Take Attendance Date of the Institution's Determination That the Student Has WithdrawnStudent's Withdrawal Date 1 Circumstance Withdrawal Type The date the student begins the school's withdrawal pro - cess, or The date that the student otherwise provides the notification (If both circumstances occur, use the earlier withdrawal date.)Official NotificationThe student begins the school's withdrawal process, or The student otherwise provides official notification to the school of intent to withdraw.The student's withdrawal date or the date of notification, whichever is later The date that the school determines is related to the circumstance beyond the student's control The midpoint of the payment period or period of enrollment, as applicableOfficial notification not provided by the student because of circumstances beyond the student's control All other instances where student withdraws without providing official notificationThe date that the school becomes aware that the student has ceased attendance2 Official Notification Not Provided The earlier of the dates of the end of the leave of absence or the date the student notifies the school he or she will not be returning to that school (In the case of an unapproved absence, the date that the student began the leave of absence)The date that the student began the leave of absenceThe student does not return from an approved leave of absence, or The student takes an unapproved leave of absence.Leave of Absence Related The date the school becomes aware that the student did not, or will not, complete the payment period or period of enrollmentThe student's original with - drawal date from the previous official notificationThe student withdraws after rescinding a previous official notification of withdrawal.Withdrawal After Rescission of Official Notification 1.

For a student who withdraws without providing notification to the school, the school must determine the withdrawal date no later than 30 days after the end of the earliest of the (1) payment period or period of enrollment (as appropriate), (2) academic year, or (3) educational program. Chapter 2\u2014 The Steps in a Return of Title IV Aid Calculation5-127 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL Sample Summary of the Requirements of 34 CFR 668.22 (To Provide to Students as Part of Consumer Information) Treatment of Title IV Aid When a Student Withdraws The law specifies how your school must determine the amount of Title IV program assistance that you earn if you withdraw from school. The Title IV programs that are covered by this law are Federal Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, TEACH Grants, Direct Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOGs). Though your aid is posted to your account at the start of each period, you earn the funds as you complete the period. If you withdraw during your payment period or period of enrollment (your school can define these for you and tell you which one applies to you), the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula. If you received (or your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount that you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds. If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/ or you. The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period or period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% of the payment period or period of enrollment, you earn all the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that period. If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school must get your permission before it can disburse them. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don't incur additional debt. Your school may automatically use all or a portion of your post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees, and room and board charges (as contracted with the school). The school needs your permission to use the post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other institutional charges. If you do not give your permission (some schools ask for this when you enroll), you will be offered the funds. However, it may be in your best interest to allow the school to keep the funds to reduce your debt at the school. There are some Title IV funds that you were scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements. For example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have not completed the first 30 days of your program before you withdraw, you will not receive any Direct Loan funds that you would have received had you remained enrolled past the 30th day. If you receive (or your school or parent receive on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, your school must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of: 1. your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or 2. the entire amount of excess funds. The school must return this amount even if it didn't keep this amount of your Title IV program funds. If your school is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-128 FSA HB November 2018CFR Glossary DCL For any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a Direct PLUS Loan) repay in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time. Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment. The maximum amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive. You do not have to repay a grant overpayment if the original amount of the overpayment is $50 or less. Y ou must make arrangements with your school or the Department of Education to return the unearned grant funds. The requirements for Title IV program funds when you withdraw are separate from any refund policy that your school may have. Therefore, you may still owe funds to the school to cover unpaid institutional charges. Your school may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that the school was required to return. If you don't already know your school's refund policy , you should ask your school for a copy. Your school can also provide you with the requirements and procedures for officially withdrawing from school. If you have questions about your Title IV program funds, you can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FEDAID (1-800-433-3243). TTY users may call 1-800-730-8913.

School Profile Everyone Should Have an Education Community College (ESECC) is a two- year, public, semester-based institution that measures academic progress in credit hours. Academic Year (AY)/Program 2 semesters 32 weeks Period 16 weeks 110 calendar days Period Start Date August 23 Institutionally Scheduled Break None Required to Take Attendance No The school's AY is 32 weeks and 24 semester hours.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-133FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile Penny Jones is a first-year student in Virginia. Charges to her account for the first semester are as follows: Tuition and Fees $ 1,000.00/16-week semester Technology Fee $ 100.00/16-week semester Books and Supplies $ 400.00/16-week semester Health Insurance $ 200.00/academic year Charges remaining on Penny's account after the withdrawal: Tuition $ 100.00 School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Penny's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 Direct Subsidized Loan $ 3,500.00 State Grant $ 500.00 College Grant $ 200.00 Discussion On the first day of the fall semester, August 23, Penny received the following disbursements to her student account: Pell Grant $ 1,000.00 Net Direct Subsidized Loan $ 0.00 State Grant $ 500.00 College Grant $ 100.00 Although Penny is grateful for the assistance, she is concerned about meeting her living costs for the year. On October 8, Penny came to the Financial Aid Office to advise that she doesn't think she is doing very well and is considering dropping out prior to November 1, the last day to withdraw from classes without academic penalty. To help her make a decision, she requests information on the withdrawal process. You are fairly certain that Penny is having a hard time adjusting to college life and want to encourage her to hang in until the end of the semester, December 10. After you provide her preliminary information, you ask her if it is her intent to withdraw. Penny says that she needs some time to think it over and makes a follow-up appointment for October 13.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-134 FSA HB November 2018When Penny comes to see you on October 13, she indicates that the last class she attended was on September 30. Because she doesn't see how she can get caught up on the work she's missed, she is adamant about withdrawing, so you give her instructions on completing the college's official withdrawal process and advise her where she can get the appropriate forms. Penny picks up the forms from the registrar on October 14. She turns the completed forms in on October 15. Let's review some basic information about Penny as well as our learning objectives for this case. Penny attended a two-year community college, which was on the semester system. Students earned academic credits based on credit hours taken. Before withdrawing, Penny received her Pell Grant disbursement but not her Direct Loan. The first thing we'll need to do is to decide on the date of the school's determination that Penny withdrew. Then, we'll complete Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information, which includes: Title IV aid disbursed, and Title IV aid that could have been disbursed. Solution The date of the institution's determination is the date you were advised by Penny that she had decided to withdraw (October 13). On the earlier date, October 8, she was only thinking about withdrawing. Date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew = October 13. Note that for a student who provides notification to the institution of his or her withdrawal, the date of determination is the student's withdrawal date, or the date of notification of withdrawal, whichever is later (34 CFR 668.22(l)(3)(i)). In this case, the dates are identical, October 13. The withdrawal date for Title IV purposes, October 13, is described in Step 2 . Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. Title IV grants aid disbursed Pell Grant $ 1,000.00 A. = $ 1,000.00 Box B . Net Title IV loans disbursed = $ 0.00 Box C. Title IV grants that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-135FSA HB November 2018Box D. Penny's Direct Loan had not been disbursed yet. But, she was eligible for the disbursement. Net Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 1,700.00 D = $ 1,700.00 Box E. Although Penny also received disbursements of state and institutional aid, only Title IV aid is considered in the return of funds calculation. Title IV aid disbursed = $1,000.00. E = $ 1,000.00 Box F. Box F is equal to the $1,000.00 from Box A plus $0.00 from Box C. Box F = $1,000. F = $ 1,000.00 Box G. Both the disbursed Pell (Box A) and undisbursed Direct Loan (Box D) are included in Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed plus Title IV aid that could have been disbursed = $2,750. Pell Grant (Box A) $ 1,000.00 Net D irect Subsidized Loan (Box D) $ 1,700.00 Total Title IV aid disbursed plus could have been disbursed (Box G) $ 2,700.00 G = $ 2,700.00 Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned 1. Payment period start date = August 23 2. Payment period end date = December 10 3. Withdrawal date = October 13 Note: Since ESECC does not take attendance and is not required by an outside entity to take attendance, the withdrawal date is the date Penny began the official school withdrawal process. Since the school includes the financial aid office as one of those places where the student can begin the withdrawal process, Penny's withdrawal date is October 13. Although the school's refund policy is that the withdrawal date is the date a student turns in the signed withdrawal forms\u2014which she did on October 15\u2014that date is superseded for a student receiving Title IV aid by the federal requirement to use the date the student begins the withdrawal process or otherwise provides official notification (October 13). Although Penny stopped attending classes on September 30, she didn't notify the school (begin the official withdrawal process) until October 13. When she came to see you on October 8, she was only thinking about withdrawing. Of course, the school could have documented a last date of attendance at an academically-related activity and used that as her withdrawal date if it so chose.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-136 FSA HB November 2018Box H. Percentage of payment period completed Since the student attended a credit-hour school, the percentage of aid completed is calculated by dividing the number of calendar days completed by the total number of calendar days in the payment period. Number of calendar days completed in payment period = 52 (August 23-October 13). Because the semester does not include a scheduled break of five or more consecutive days, all of the calendar days in the period from August 23 to December 10 are counted. Number of calendar days in payment period = 110. Note: Days in a period are counted as follows: 1. the first day of the payment period is the first scheduled day of academically related activity; 2. the last day of the payment period is the last scheduled day of academically related activity; 3. the school must count the date of withdrawal as a date of attendance. 52 days \u00f7 110 days = .4727, rounded to .473, or 47.3%. Percentage of payment period completed = 47.3%. Because this percentage is less than 60%, the percentage of Title IV aid earned, H. = 47.3% Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 47.3% (Percentage of Title IV aid earned from Bo x H) X $ 2,700.00 (Total Title IV aid disbursed plus Title IV aid that could have been disbursed from Box G) = $1,277.10. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student (Box I) = $1,277.10. I. = $1,277.10 Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to Be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total aid earned (Box I) is greater than the total aid disbursed (Box E), Penny is due a post-withdrawal disbursement . $1,277.10 (Box I) - $1,000.00 (Box E) = $277.10. post-withdrawal disbursement (Box J) = $277.10. J. = $277.10 If a post-withdrawal disbursement is due the student, you stop here on the worksheet. Your next step is to begin compiling the information a school must maintain in its files when a student is eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement (ESECC has chosen to use FSA's Post-withdrawal T racking Sheet), and providing the required notifications to the student. Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-137FSA HB November 2018THE POST-WITHDRAWAL DISBURSEMENT TRACKING SHEET The FAO performed the Return calculation on October 15 and determined that Penny was eligible for a post- withdrawal disbursement o f $277.10 (Step 4, Box J) . However, the COD system will not accept requests for other than whole dollars (no cents) for the Direct Loan Program. Therefore, the school must round down to, request, and disburse $277.00. Because the post-withdrawal disbursement would be composed entirely of loan funds, the school could not credit any funds to Penny's account or disburse any funds to her directly without sending Penny written noti - fication advising her of her responsibility to repay the funds and obtaining Penny's confirmation that she still wanted them. Therefore, on October 20, the school sent Penny a letter explaining that: she was eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement of Subsidized Direct Loan funds in the amount of $277.00 ; she could accept some or all of the funds; Penny was obligated to repay any loan funds she accepted; if she accepted the disbursement, $100 would be credited to her account for unpaid charges and that Penny could not receive that $100; if she accepted the disbursement, the school would make a direct disbursement directly to her of $177.00 ; and she has until November 13 (24 days from the day the school mailed the letter)1 to accept the disbursement, and that if her response was received after that date, the school did not have to make the disbursement. On November 13, the school received confirmation from Penny that she accepted all of the funds. On November 15, the school drew down $277.00 in Subsidized Direct Loan funds through G5, credited the $277.00 to Penny's account, took $100 for unpaid charges and sent Penny a check for the credit balance of $177.00. (Note that the school could have drawn down the funds, credited the student's account with $100.00, and sent the student the balance of $ 177.00, but we do not require a school to deviate from its normal cash management procedures and establish a different type of audit trail for post-withdrawal disbursements.) The FAO placed a record of all the aforementioned in Penny's permanent financial aid file. 1 The regulations now allow a school to set a deadline later than 14 days, provided the later deadline applies to both confirmation of loan disbursements to the student's account and direct disbursements of a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan disbursements to the student's account and direct disbursements of a post-withdrawal disbursement. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3. Or, the school may enter the last date of attendance at an academically related activity for the \"withdrawal date,\" and proceed with the calculation as instructed. For a student who officially withdraws, enter the withdrawal date.Monetary amounts should be in dollars and cents (rounded to the nearest penny). When calculating percentages, round to three decimal places. (For example, .4486 = .449, or 44.9%) STEP 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned If this percentage is greater than 60%, enter 100% in Box H and proceed to Step 3.

Learning Objectives Learn to complete Steps 1-10 of the Treatment of Title IV Funds When a Student Withdraws from a Credit-Hour Program worksheet and be able to: identify the basic information needed to complete the worksheet, including the withdrawal date and date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew for a student who officially with - draws; calculate the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment the student completed; calculate both the percentage and the amount of Title IV aid earned by the student; determine either that the student is due a post-withdrawal disbursement (PWD) of Title IV aid or that Title IV aid must be returned; determine the amount to be offered to the student or returned; apply the Title IV grant protection; and apply the de minimis grant repayment provision. School Profile West Coast Community College (WCCC) is a two-year public, credit-hour institution. Academic Year/Program: 2 semesters 32 weeks and 24 semester hours Period: 16 weeks 110 calendar days Period Start Date: January 8 Period End Date: May 4 Institutionally Scheduled Break: Yes, 7 days Taking Attendance Required: No Method for Matching FSEOG: Fund-specificChapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-141FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile Bob Ellison is a first-time freshman at WCCC. Charges to his account are as follows: Tuition and Fees: $ 1,000.00/16-week semester School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Bob's financial aid package includes the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 2,800.00 FSEOG $ 2,400.00 Discussion Bob Ellison enrolled as a first-time freshman at (WCCC) for the spring semester on January 8. On January 18, Bob got a call from the state treasurer informing him that the programming job he had applied for six months ago was his for the taking. That same day, Bob contacted the Financial Aid Office to: (1) advise it that he was withdrawing from WCCC, (2) begin WCCC's formal withdrawal process (11 calendar days into the semester), and (3) find out what to do next. All of his financial aid for the semester had been disbursed. Solution The date of the institution's determination that Bob withdrew is the day he contacted the Financial Aid Office to advise the school that he was withdrawing from WCCC: January 18. Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. Because WCCC uses the fund-specific method of matching FSEOG funds, 100% of Bob's FSEOG grant is used in the calculation. Title IV grant aid disbursed = $2,600.00. Pell Grant $ 1,400.00 FSEOG $ 1,200.00 A. = $ 2,600.00 Box B. Net Title IV loans disbursed = $ 0.00. Box C . Grants that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box D. Net Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-142 FSA HB November 2018Box E. Total Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period = A + B = 2,600.00 + 0.00 = $ 2,600.00. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + C = 2,600.00 + 0.00 = $ 2,600.00. Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + B + C + D = 2,600.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = $ 2,600.00. Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned 1. Payment period start date = January 8. 2. Payment period end date = May 4. 3. Date of withdrawal = January 18. 4. Percentage of payment period completed: Number of calendar days completed = 11 calendar days. Number of calendar days in payment period = 110 calendar days. 11 days \u00f7 110 days = .100. Percentage of payment period completed = 10.0%. Box H. Because this percentage is 60% or less, the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 10.0%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by Student Box I. Multiply 10.0% (Percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $2,600.00 (Total Title IV aid disbursed plus Title IV aid that could have been disbursed from Box G) = $260.00 Amount of Title IV aid earned by student = $260.00. I. = $260.00 Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = N/A. Box K. Because the total aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total aid earned (Box I), Title IV aid will need to be returned. $2,600.00 (Box E) - $260.00 (Box D) = $2,340.00. Title IV aid to be returned = $2,340.00.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-143FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. Institutional charges for the payment period or period of enrollment = $1,000.00. T uition and Fees $ 1,000.00 Box M. Subtract 10.0%, the percentage of Title IV aid earned (Box H), from 100% (100% - 10.0% = 90.0%). Percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 90.0%. Box N. First, calculate the unearned institutional charges. $1,000.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 90.0% (% Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $900.00. Amount of unearned institutional charges = $900.00. Box O. Then, compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount for Box O. Box K = $ 2,340.00 Box N = $ 900.00 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $900.00. Step 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. The student had no loans, so the total loans the school must return = $0.00 Box P = $ 0.00 The student's Pell Grant ($1,025.00) exceeds the amount the school must return ($900.00), so the school must return $900.00 to the Federal Pell Grant program. The school must return the funds as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days from the date it determined Bob withdrew. Step 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid that the school must return ($900.00 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($2,340.00 from Box K). $2,340.00 - $900.00 = $1,440.00. Initial amount of unearned Title IV aid due from student = $1,440.00. Step 8: Repayment of the Student's Loans Box R. The student had no loans, so the total loans the student must return = $0.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-144 FSA HB November 2018Step 9: Grant Funds to be Returned Box S. Initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return Subtract the amount of loans to be repaid by the student ($0.00 from Box R) from the initial amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the student ($1,440.00 from Box Q) to find the initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return. $1,440.00 - $0.00 = $1,440.00. Box T. Amount of grant protection Multiply the total of Title IV grant aid that was disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment ($2,600.00 from Box F) by 50%. Amount of grant protection = $2,600.00 X 50.0% = $1,300.00. Box U. Title IV grant funds for the student to return Subtract the protected amount of Title IV grants ($1,300.00 from Box T) from the initial amount of Title IV grants for student to return ($1,440.00 from Box S). Total grants for student to return = $1,440.00 - $1,300.00 = $140.00. Step 10: Return of Grant Funds by the Student Amount of Title IV grants for the student to return Subtract the amount the school had to return to the Federal Pell Grant program ($900.00) from the amount Federal Pell Grant disbursed to the student ($1,400.00). Remaining un - earned Pell Grant balance = $1,400.00 - $900.00 = $500.00. Since the $500 remaining in Pell Grant funds exceeds the $140.00 for the student to return, WCCC informs Bob that he must repay the $140.00 and that he has 45-days to make repayment arrangements or his overpayment. WCCC also informs Bob that if he fails to repay or make arrangements to repay the overpayment, he will be referred to the Department and will lose eligibility for additional Title IV funds.

School Profile The Ultra Large State University (ULSU) is a four-year, semester-based, public institution that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses the Fund Specific method for matching the school's FSEOG federal allocation with state grant funds. Academic Year/Program 2 semesters 30 weeks and 24 semester hours Period 15 weeks 100 calendar days Period Start Date September 1 Institutionally Scheduled Break None Required to Take Attendance No Method for Matching FSEOG Fund Speci fic Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-148 FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile Richard Sherman is a third-year student with a 3.5 cumulative GPA majoring in engineering. Tuition and fees $ 4,000.00/15-week semester Room $ 1,000.00/15-week semester Board $ 1,000.00/15-week semester Books and Supplies $ 500.00/15-week semester (credit voucher at school store) School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Richard's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 5,500.00 State Grant $ 1,000.00 FSEOG (Federal Portion) $ 4,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 4,000.00 All of Richard's financial aid for the first semester (i.e., one-half of his annual awards) was disbursed on the first day of classes. Discussion Richard is a brilliant computer engineering major in his third year at The ULSU. Over the summer between his second and third year, Richard developed and submitted to Gigantic Computer Corporation (GCC) an idea for a new memory chip. In October, Richard got a six-figure offer of employment from GCC. Richard was so excited by the offer that he packed his bags and headed for Seattle without telling anyone at the school that he was leaving. Instructors at The ULSU must report a last date of attendance (LDA) whenever they submit a non-passing grade, and those dates appear on a report of Title IV recipients who failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes that is provided by the Computer Center to the financial aid office at the end of each grading period. On December 16, after grades have been submitted for the fall semester, the Computer Center at The ULSU ran the program that identified Title IV recipients who failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes. When the aid office received and evaluated the report for the fall semester, it found that Richard's LDA was October 10. Because Richard did not provide official notification of his withdrawal, he is consid - ered an unofficial withdrawal.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-149FSA HB November 2018At the beginning of the semester, the following awards were posted to Richard's account at ULSU. Pell Grant $ 2,750.00 State Grant $ 500.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 Net S ubsidized Direct $ 1,930.00 Solution The date of the institution's determination that Richard withdrew is the date the aid office received and processed the report from the Computer Center. Date of institution's determination that the student withdrew = December 16. Note: For a student who withdraws without providing notification to a school that is not required to take attendance, the school must determine the withdrawal date no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of (1) the payment period or the period of enrollment (as applicable), (2) the academic year, or (3) the student's educational program. Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. ULSU enters the following data in Step 1. Title IV grant aid disbursed Pell Grant $ 2,750.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 A. = $ 4,750.00 Box B. Net Title IV loans disbursed, Subsidized Direct Loan = $ 1,930.00 Box C. Title IV grants that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box D. Net Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box E. Total Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period = A + B = 4,750.00 + 1,930.00 = $ 6,680.00. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + C = 4,750.00 + 0.00 = $ 4,750.00. Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + B + C + D = 4,750.00 + 1,930.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = $ 6,680.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-150 FSA HB November 2018Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned Because Richard did not officially withdraw from school and The ULSU does not take attendance and is not required to take attendance by an outside agency (other than for a one day snapshot for state census purposes), the school may use either the midpoint of the payment period or the last date of Richard's atten - dance in an academically related activity as the withdrawal date. The school elects to choose the midpoint of the period as Richard's withdrawal date. 1. Payment period start date = September 1 2. Payment period end date = December 9 3. Date of withdrawal = October 201 4. Percentage of payment period completed Number of calendar days completed = 502 Number of calendar days in the payment period = 100 50 days \u00f7 100 days = 0.5000. Percentage of payment period completed = 50.0% Box H. Because this percentage is 60% or less, the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 50.0%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 50.0% (Percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $6,680.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment from Box G) = $3,340.00. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $3,340.00. Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I), Title IV aid must be returned. $6,680.00 (Box E) - $3,340.00 (Box I) = $3,340.00. Title IV Aid to be returned = $3,340.00. Step 5: Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. Institutional charges for the payment period or period of enrollment = $6,500.00. 1, 2 The midpoint of the period, or 50 of 100 days.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-151FSA HB November 2018 T uition and fees $ 4,000.00 Room $ 1,000.00 Board $ 1,000.00 Books $ 500.00 Box M. Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (50.0%) from 100.0%. 100% - 50.0% = 50.0%. Percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 50.0%. Box N. Calculate the amount of unearned charges. $6,500.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 50% (% of Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $3,250.00. Amount of unearned institutional charges = $3,250.00. Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. Box K = $ 3,340.00 Box N = $ 3,250.00 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $3,250.00. STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. The only Title IV loan disbursement Richard received was a Subsidized Direct Loan disbursement of $1,930.00. Since $1,930.00 is less than the $3,250.00 (Box O) the school must return the entire $1,930.00. Box P = $1,930.00. After the school returns $1,930.00 to the Direct Loan program, $1,320.00 remains to be returned by the school ($3,250 (from Box O) - $1,930 (from Box P)). Richard received $2,000.00 in Pell Grant funds, so the school returns the $1,320.00 to the Pell Grant Program. STEP 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return ($3,250.00 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($3,340.00 from Box K) to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $3,340.00 - $3,250.00 = $90.00. STEP 8: Repayment of the Student's Loans Box R. Subtract the Total Loans the school must return ($1,930.00 from Box P) from the net loans disbursed to the student ($1,930.00 from Box B) to find the total of the loans the student must repay $1,930.00 - $1,930.00 = $0.00. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-152 FSA HB November 2018STEP 9: Grant Funds to be Returned Box S. Initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return Subtract the amount of loans to be repaid by the student ($0.00 from Box R) from the initial amount of unearned aid due from the student ($90.00 from Box Q) to find the initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return. $90.00 - $0.00 = $90.00. Box T. Amount of grant protection Multiply the total of Title IV grant aid disbursed or could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment ($4,740.00 from Box F) by 50.0%. $4,750 X 50.0% = $2,375.00. Box U. Title IV grant funds for the student to return Subtract the amount of grant protection ($2,375.00 from Box T) from the initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return ($90.00 from Box S) to find the Title IV grant funds for the student to return. $90.00 - $2375.00 = $0.001. 1 If this amount is less than or equal to $0.00, enter = NA, and stop here. Richard is not required to return any Title IV grant funds. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3. Or, the school may enter the last date of attendance at an academically related activity for the \"withdrawal date,\" and proceed with the calculation as instructed. For a student who officially withdraws, enter the withdrawal date.Monetary amounts should be in dollars and cents (rounded to the nearest penny).

It wasn't until January 26 that the school discovered Harry hadn't been attending classes and didn't plan on returning. The director of the program notified the aid office that Harry's last day of attendance was January 17 (through which time Harry was scheduled to have attended 45 hours), and the aid office began the withdrawal process and required calculations.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-157FSA HB November 2018Solution The date of the institution's determination that Harry withdrew (January 26) is the date the aid office received the information from the Director of Student Services. Because QTS is required to take atten - dance, Harry's withdrawal date is his last day of attendance at an academically related activity, January 17. At the beginning of the enrollment period, the following awards were posted to Harry's account at QTS. Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 1,700.00 Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. Title IV grant aid disbursed Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 A. = $ 2,000.00 Box B. Net Title IV loans disbursed Net Subsidized Direct Loan $ 1,700.00 B. = $ 1,700.00 Box C. Because QTS uses the period of enrollment as the basis for its Return calculation, the $2,000 in Pell funds Harry was scheduled to receive once he had completed the first 450 hours of his program is included as Title IV grants that could have been disbursed. C. = $ 2,000.00 Box D. Because QTS uses the period of enrollment as the basis for its Return calculation, the $1700.00 in Subsidized Direct Loan funds Harry was scheduled to receive once he had completed the first 450 hours and the calendar midpoint of his program of his program is included as Title IV loans that could have been disbursed. D. = $ 1,700.00 Box E. Total Title IV aid disbursed for the period of enrollment = A + B = 2,000.00 + 1,700.00 = $ 3,700.00. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the period of enrollment = A + C = 2,000.00 + 2,000.00 = $ 4,000.00. Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the period of enrollment = A + B + C + D = 2,000. 00 + 1,700.00 + 2,000.00 + 1,700.00 = $ 7,400.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-158 FSA HB November 2018Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned Because QTS is required to take attendance by an outside agency, the school must use the last date of Harry's attendance in an academically related activity as determined from its attendance records as the withdrawal date. Harry's last date of attendance was January 17. 1. Period of enrollment start date = January 8. 2. Period of enrollment end date = August 3. 3. Date of withdrawal = January 17. Box H. Percentage of period completed Only scheduled hours are used to determine the percentage of the period completed by a student withdrawing from a clock-hour program. The percentage of the period completed by a student is determined by dividing the number of hours the student was scheduled to complete in the payment period or period of enrollment as of the day the student withdrew by the total number of clock hours in the same period. Number of clock hours Harry was scheduled to complete by January 17 = 45. Number of clock hours in the period of enrollment = 900. 45 clock hours \u00f7 900 clock hours = 0.050. Percentage of period of enrollment completed = 5.0%. Because this percentage is 60% or less, the percentage of Title IV aid earned, Box H = 5.0%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 5.0% (Percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $ 7,400.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the period of enrollment from Box G) = $370.00. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $370.00. Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) Title IV aid must be returned. $ 3,700.00 (Box E) - $370.00 (Box I) = $3,330.00 . Title IV Aid to be returned = $3,330.00 .Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-159FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. Institutional charges for the period of enrollment = $8,500.00. T uition and fees $ 8,000.00 Books & Supplies $ 500.00 Box M. Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (5.0%) from 100.0%. 100% - 5.0% = 95.0%. Percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 95.0%. Box N. Calculate the amount of unearned charges. $8,500.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 95% (Percentage of Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $8,075.00. Amount of unearned institutional charges = $8,075.00. Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. Box K = $ 3,330.00 Box N = $ 8,075.00 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $3,330.00. STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. The only Title IV loan disbursement Richard received was a Subsidized Direct Loan disbursement of $1,700.00 . Since $ 1,700.00 is less than the $3,330.00 (Box O) the amount for school to return, the school must return the entire $ 1,700.00 to the Direct Loan Program. P = $ 1,700.00 After the school retu rns $1700.00 to the Direct Loan program, the balance to be returned by the school is $1,630.00 ($ 3,330.00 [ from Box O ] - $1700.00 [from Box P ]). Harry received $2,000.00 in Pell Grant funds, so the school returns the $1, 630.00 to the Pell Grant Program. The school must return any unearned funds within 45 days from the date of the institution's determination that Harry withdrew. STEP 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return ($3,330.00 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($3,330.00 from Box K) to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $3,330.00 - $$3,330.00 = $0.00 .Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-160 FSA HB November 2018STEP 8: Repayment of the Student's Loans Box R. Subtract the total loans the school must return ($ 1700.00 from Box P) from the net loans disbursed to the student ($ 1,700.00 from Box B) to find the total of the loans the student must repay $ 1,700.00 - $1,700.00 = $0.00. Since the amount from Box Q ($0.00) is equal to (or less than) the amount from Box R ($0.00), the calculation ends here. 5 0Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Clock-Hour Program Student's Name Social Security Number Date of school's determination that student withdrew H.

Learning Objectives Learn to complete Steps 1-8 of the Treatment of Title IV Funds When a Student Withdraws from a Clock-Hour Program worksheet, and be able to: determine withdrawal date for student who did not provide notification of intent to withdraw at a school required to take attendance; determine the scheduled clock hours; calculate the percentage of the payment period the student completed; calculate both the percentage and the amount of Title IV aid earned by the student; determine either that the student is due a post-withdrawal disbursement (PWD) of Title IV aid or that Title IV aid must be returned; prorate the student's charges to determine the correct amount of institutional charges for the payment period; decide whether the cost of unreturned equipment can be excluded; and determine the amount to be offered to the student or returned. School Profile Learn to Earn Technical School (LETS) is a proprietary school that measures academic progress in clock hours. Academic Year/Program/ 900 hours/26 weeks Period of Enrollment Payment Period 450 hours/13 weeks Payment Period Start Date April 3 Payment Period End Date June 30 Institutionally Scheduled Break None Required to Take Attendance Yes Period Used in Return Calculation Payment PeriodNEWNEWVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-164 FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile Jordan Aire enrolled at LETS for a 26-week program of study consisting of 900 clock hours offered over 26 weeks. The first payment period is 450 clock hours. Charges to Jordan's account are as follows: Tuition and fees $ 6,000.00/26-week program Room $ non-residential program Board $ non-residential program Books and Supplies $ 500.00/program School authorized to retain Title IV funds and credit account for other charges: Yes (all charges) Authorized to retain credit balance No Jordan's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 4,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 3,500.00 All of Jordan's financial aid for the first payment period (450 clock hours, i.e., one-half his annual awards) was disbursed on the first day of classes. Discussion On the first day of the perio d, April 3 , Jordan received the following disbursements to his student account: Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 Net Subsidized Direct Loan $ 1,700.00 On May 1, the Retention Specialist at LETS is informed by the director of Jordan's program that since April 20, Jordan has not been attending classes. The Retention Specialist contacts Jordan who tells him that he's been ill but plans on coming back to school during the next week. Since this falls within the time period for excused absences allowed by school policy, as well as absences allowed by the state and the school's accrediting agency, the school delays taking any action. However, on May 8 when the Retention Specialist follows up with the Program Director, he finds that Jordan has not returned to school. Since Jordan has now exceeded the number of absences allowed by school policy, L ETS must administratively withdraw Jordan from school. Note: Remember that institutions that are required to take attendance are expected to have a procedure in place for routinely monitoring attendance records to determine in a timely manner when a student withdraws. Except in unusual instances, the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew should be no later than 14 days after the student's withdrawal date. Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-165FSA HB November 2018 The institution is not required to administratively withdraw a student who has been absent for 14 days. However, after 14 days, it is expected to have determined whether the student intends to return to classes or has withdrawn. Moreover, the institution must return any unearned funds within 45 days of the date of the institution's determination that Jordan withdre w (May 4 ). As part of Jordan's enrollment agreement, LETS provided Jordan with a kit that included all the books and supplies that he would need throughout the program (the entire period of enrollment). The kit is returnable, but Jordan does not return the kit after he withdraws. Solution Jordan's withdrawal date is his last day of attendance as determined from the school's attendance records, April 20 . The school must use May 4 (14 days from the student's last day of attendance) as the date of the institu - tion's determination that the student withdrew. At the beginning of the payment period, the following awards were posted to Jordan's account at LETS. Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 Net Subsidized Direct Loan $ 1,700.00 Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. Title IV grant aid disbursed - Pell Grant $ 2,000.00 A. = $ 2,000.00 Box B. Net Title IV loans disbursed - Subsidized Direct Loan = $ 1,700.00 B. = $ 1,700.00 Box C. Title IV grants that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box D. Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box E. T otal Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period = A + B = 2,000.00 + 1,700.00 = $ 3,700.00. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + C = 2,000.00 + 0.00 = $ 2,000.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-166 FSA HB November 2018Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + B + C + D = 2,000.00 + 1,700.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = $ 3,700.00. Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned Because LETS is required to take attendance by an outside agency, the school must use the last date of Jordan's attendance in an academically related activity as determined from its attendance records as the withdrawal date. Jordan's last date of attendance was April 20. 1. Payment Period start dat e = April 3. 2. Payment Period end date = June 30 . 3. Date of withdrawal = April 20. Box H. Percentage of payment period completed Only scheduled hours are used to determine the percentage of the period completed by a student withdrawing from a clock-hour program. The percentage of the period completed by a student is determined by dividing the number of hours the student was scheduled to complete in the payment period or period of enrollment as of the day the student withdrew, by the total number of clock hours in the same period. Number of clock hours Jordan was scheduled to complet e by April 20 = 90 Number of clock hours in the payment period = 450 90 clock hours \u00f7 450 clock hours = 0.20 Percentage of payment period completed = 20.0% Because this percentage is 60% or less, the percentage of Title IV aid earned in Box H = 20.0%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 20 .0% (percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $3,700.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment from Box G) = $740.00. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $740.00. Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I), Title IV aid must be returned. $3,700.00 (Box E) - $740.00 (Box I) = $2,960.00 . Title IV Aid to be Returned = $2,960.00 .Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-167FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. Total institutional charges for the payment period Before entering data in Step 5, Part L, of the Return calculation a school that charges by the period of enrollment but performs its Return calculation on a payment period basis must determine whether it must enter: (a) the prorated amount of all institutional charges, or (b) the amount the school retained. To do this, first, the school prorates all institutional charges. Then, the school determines the amount actually retained. The school compares the two results and enters in Step 5, Part L, the greater of th e two amounts (per the provisions in 34 CFR 668.22(g)(3)(ii) ). LETS did not obtain an authorization to retain funds in excess of the prorated amount. Therefore, in this case the amount retained and the prorated amount are the same. The school enters $250.00 as the charge for books and supplies. Prorated Charges T uition and fees $3,000.00 Books & supplies $250.00 Total initial prorated institutional charges for the payment period = $3,250.00. Now, LETS determines whether it can exclude the cost of Jordan's kit from the amount it enters in Step 5, Part L. The equipment was returnable, but Jordan did not return it in good condition within 20 days of withdrawing . Since a school may exclude from institutional charges the documented cost to the school (what the school paid for the items) of unreturnable equipment and returnable equipment not returned in good condition , LETS can exclude the documented cost of the kit from Jordan's total i nstitutional charges for the payment period. When LETS originally purchased the kit, it documented that the kit cost $300.00, so LETS excludes $300 .00 from Jordan's i nstitutional charges, resulting in a n adjusted final total of $2,950 ($3,250.00 -300.00) that the school will enter in Step 5, Part L. L = $2,950.00 Box M. Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (20.0%) from 100.0%. 100% - 20.0% = 80.0%. percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 80.0%. M = 80.0% Box N. Calculate the amount of unearned charges. $2,950.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 80% (percentage of Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $2,360.00. N = $2,360.00TIP ClarificationVolume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-168 FSA HB November 2018Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. Box K = $2,960.00 Box N = $2,360.00 O = $2,360.00 STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. J ordan received a Subsidized Direct Loan disbursement of $1700.00 . Since $1,700.00 is less than the $2,360.00 (Box O) the school must return $1,700.00 to the Department. Box P = $1,700.00 . After the school returns $1,700.00 to the Title IV loan programs, the balance to be returned by the school is $660.00 ($2,360.00 [from Box O] - $1,700.00 [from Box P]). Jordan received $2,000.00 in Pell Grant funds, so the school returns $660.00 to the Pell Grant Program. The school must return any unearned funds within 45 days from the date of the institution's determination that Jordan withdrew (May 4). STEP 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return $2,360.00 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ( $2,960.00 from Box K) to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $2,960.00 - $2,360.00 = $600.00. Q = $600.00 STEP 8: Repayment of the Student's Loans Box R. Subtract the total loans the school must return ( $1,700.00 from Box P) from the net loans disbursed to the student ( $1,700.00 from Box B) to find the total of the loans the student must repay $1,700.00 - $1,700.00 = $0.00. R = $0 Box S.

Start End August 22 September 16 September 19 October 14 October 17 November 11 November 14 December 16 A scheduled break begins after the last class on Friday, November 18. Classes resume on Monday, November 28. The scheduled break is nine days long. Though it is not a school that is required to take attendance, LSDJ has a school policy of using a student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity as the withdrawal date when a student withdraws from a program offered in modules. Student Profile Thompson Hunter is an independent, third-year student enrolled at LSDJ for 12 credits offered in four modules. In each module, a student is enrolled in one course that begins and ends on a fixed date. In Thompson's case, each course is worth three credits. Charges to Thompson's account for the payment period are as follows: Tuition and fees $ 1,200.00/12 credits School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Thompson's financial aid package is based on the following academic year (9-month budget ): Tuition $ 2,400.00 Room $ 2,800.00 Board $ 1,600.00 Books $ 800.00 Personal Expenses $ 800.00 Travel $ 800.00Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-174 FSA HB November 2018Thompson's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 5,550.00 FSEOG $ 3,650.00 All of Thompson's financial aid for the first payment period (one-half his annual awards) was disbursed on the first day of classes. Discussion On the first day of the period, August 22, Thompson received the following disbursements to his stu - dent account: Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 1,825.00 On October 14, Thompson comes to see you. He tells you that his dog Gonzo has just had 10 puppies. He fears that if he's not around to help her, something terrible might happen to the puppies, and he doesn't want to deal with the self-loathing that would result. He feels it is best if he withdraws from the first semester now. When a student withdraws from one of a series of modules in a term-based program, a school must first determine whether or not the student must be treated as a withdrawal. In order to do so, the school must answer three questions: 1. After beginning attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, did the student cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend? If the answer is no, this is not a withdrawal. If the answer is yes, go to question 2. In Thompson's case, the answer to Question 1 is Yes; you go on to Question 2. 2. When the student ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in a course he or she was sched - uled to attend, was the student still attending any other courses? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal; (Note, however that other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may apply.) If the answer is no, go to question 3. In Thompson's case, the answer to Question 2 is No; you go on to Question 3. 3. Did the student confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal, unless the student does not return. If the answer is no, this is a withdrawal, and the Return of Title IV Funds requirements apply. In Thompson's Case, the answer is No; you must treat Thompson as a withdrawal.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-175FSA HB November 2018Therefore, though Thompson completed the first two modules in the semester, since he doesn't intend on returning to a module in this semester, the revised Return regulations require that LSDJ treat him as a withdrawn student. Because Thompson failed to begin attendance in all of the classes on which his Pell Grant was based, before performing the required Return calculation, LSDJ must recalculate Thompson's Pell based on his enrollment in just the two modules he began\u2014six credits or half time. Thompson's scheduled annual Pell award as a half-time student is $2,775. His revised first semester award is $1,388.00. LSDJ must return $1,387.00 (the difference between Thompson's initial Pell disbursement of $2,775.00 and his new award of $1,388.00), and include only his new award of $1,388.00 in the Return calculation. The school returns the $1,387.00 through G5 and reduces Thompson's Pell Grant in COD to $1,388.00. In addition, since Thompson was receiving Campus-Based aid (FSEOG), the school has to recalculate his eligibility for Campus-Based funds, eliminating the costs attributable to the modules that he did not begin attending to see whether a reduction of the Campus-Based aid is necessary. Based on a revised COA of $3,600.00 for the fall semester and revised Pell Grant of $1,388.00, Thompson's remaining first- semester need is $2,212.00. That is more than his FSEOG of $1,825.00. Therefore, LSDJ does not need to reduce Thompson's FSEOG award before performing the Return calculation. LSDJ performed a R2T4 calculation using Thompson's last day of attendance of October 14 as his with - drawal date (as per school policy); $1,388.00 as the amount of Pell Grant disbursed; and $1,825.00 as the amount of FSEOG funds disbursed. On October 24, LSDJ returned the funds for which it was respon - sible to the appropriate programs, and made the appropriate adjustments in COD.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-176 FSA HB November 2018Solution Per school policy, Thompson's withdrawal date is his last day of attendance at an academically related activity as determined from the school's attendance records, October 14. At the beginning of the semester, the following awards were posted to Thompson's account at LSDJ. Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 1,825.00 Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A .

Thompson's last date of attendance was |October 14. 1. Payment Period start date = August 22. 2. Payment Period end date = December 16. 3. Date of withdrawal = October 14. 4. Percentage of payment period completed Number of calendar days completed = 54 Number of calendar days in the payment period = 108 (117 - 9 day scheduled break) 54 days \u00f7 108 days = 0.50. percentage of payment period completed = 50.0% Box H. Because this percentage is 60% or less , the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 50.0%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 50.0% (percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $3,213.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enroll ment from Box G) = $1,606.50. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $1,606.50. Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J . Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I), Title IV aid must be returned. $3,213.00 (Box E) - $1,606.50 (Box I) = $1,606.50. Title IV Aid to be returned = $1,606.50.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-178 FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L.

Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (50.0%) from 100.0%. 100% - 50.0% = 50.0%. percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 50.0%. Box N. Calculate the amount of unearned charges. $3,400.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 50.0% (% of Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $1,700.00. Amount of unearned institutional charges = $1,700.00. Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. Box K = $ 1,606.50 Box N = $ 1,700.00 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $1,606.50. STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. Thompson received a recalculated Pell Grant disbursement of $1,388.00. Since $1,388.00 is less than the $1,606.50 (Box O) the school must return, the school must return the $1,388.00 to the Pell Grant Program and an additional $218.50 (1,606.50 - 1,388.00) to the FSEOG program through the G5 system. The school must also reduce Thompson's Pell Grant in COD to $0.00. The school must return any unearned funds within 45 days from the date of the school's determination that Thompson withdrew. Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-179FSA HB November 2018STEP 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return ($1,606.50 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($1,606.50 from Box K) to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $1,606.50 - $1,606.50 = $0.00. Box Q = $ 0.00 Because Box Q is $0.00, no further calculation is needed. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3.

Charges to Thompson's account for the payment period are as follows: Tuition and fees $ 1,200.00/12 credits School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Thompson's financial aid package is based on the following academic year (9-month budget ): Tuition $ 2,400.00 Room $ 2,800.00 Board $ 1,600.00 Books $ 800.00 Personal Expenses $ 800.00 Travel $ 800.00Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-184 FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile (Continued) Thompson's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 5,550.00 FSEOG $ 3,650.00 All of Thompson's financial aid for the first payment period (one-half his annual awards) was disbursed on the first day of classes. Discussion On November 11, Thompson Hunter (the student from Case Study 6) walks into your office with the news that his wife Barbara Ann has quit her acting job in LA and moved back to Las Vegas. Longing for a normal family life, Barbara Ann is more than happy to care for Gonzo and the puppies. Thompson would like to re-enter the program when the fourth module begins on November 14. When Thompson returns for module four, 34 CFR 668.22(a)(2)(iii)(A) applies. That regulation provides that, if a student withdraws from a term-based credit-hour program offered in modules and re-enters the same program prior to the end of the payment period, the student is treated as if he or she did not cease attendance for purposes of determining the student's aid awards for the period. The student is considered to be in the same payment period he or she was in at the time of the withdrawal and retains his or her original Title IV eligibility for that payment period, provided the student's enrollment status continues to support the same amount of those funds. To do this, the school must: recalculate Thompson's Title IV program eligibility based upon enrollment in modules 1, 2, and 4 and then re-disburse any Title IV , HEA program funds that had been disbursed and then returned under the Return of Title IV Funds provisions, adjusting, if necessary, for any change in his enrollment status; disburse any Title IV, HEA program funds for which Thompson was otherwise eligible that had not yet been disbursed at the time he withdrew, adjusting for the change in enrollment status; and cancel any Title IV overpayments assessed Thompson as a result of the prior withdrawal.. When Thompson returns in module four, the three credits for that module are added to the six credits that Thompson completed previously. Nine credits at LSDJ are the minimum number required for three-quarter-time enrollment status. Therefore, the school must recalculate Thompson's eligibility for Title IV assistance as a three- quarter time student. Thompson's scheduled annual Pell award as a three-quarter-time student is $4,163.00, and his one-semester award is $2,081.50. After recalculating Thompson's eligibility from full time to half time when he withdrew previously, the school re - turned $1,387.00 (the difference between Thompson's initial Pell disbursement of $2,775.00 and his half- time award of $1,388.00). The school then included only his new award of $1,388.00 in the Return cal - culation and returned the entire amount as a result of the calculation. The school also reduced his Pell award in COD to $0.00. When Thompson returns, the school must once again adjust his award in COD (this time to his three-quarter-time award of $2,081.50) and draw down and disburse $2,081.50 to his account.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-185FSA HB November 2018In addition, the school has to recalculate Thompson's eligibility for Campus-Based funds, adding the costs attributable to the additional module that he has begun attending, to see whether a modification of his Campus-Based aid is necessary. Based on a revised COA of $4,100.00 for the fall semester and revised Pell Grant of $ $2,081.50 , Thompson's remaining first-semester need is $2,018.50. That is greater than his initial FSEOG award of $1,825.00. Therefore, since it has not already awarded the $218.50 that it returned previously to another eligible student, the school re-awards and disburses the $218.50 in FSEOG funds to Thompson. When the aid officer reviews the results of the previous Return calculation, he finds that Thompson had not been required to return any Title IV funds; therefore, there are no student overpayments to cancel. On the first day of module four, November 14, LSDJ made the following disbursements to his student account: Pell Grant $ 2,081.50 FSEOG $ 218.50 (restoring his total to $1,825) After class on December 5, Thompson once again comes to see you. He says that his uncle Raoul (born in England under mysterious circumstances) has just discovered that he is in line to be the Duke of Marlboro. Raoul must go to England immediately to claim the title, and he's willing to cover the cost of Thompson's traveling with him to the investiture. Therefore, Thompson has decided to withdraw im - mediately. When a student withdraws from one of a series of modules in a term-based program, a school must first determine whether or not the student must be treated as a withdrawal. In order to do so, the school must answer three questions: 1. After beginning attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, did the student cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend? If the answer is no, this is not a withdrawal. If the answer is yes, go to question 2. In Thompson's case, the answer to Question 1 is Y es; you go on to Question 2. 2. When the student ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in a course he or she was sched - uled to attend, was the student still attending any other courses? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal. (Note, however, that other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may apply.) If the answer is no, go to question 3. In Thompson's case, the answer to Question 2 is No; you go on to Question 3. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-186 FSA HB November 20183. Did the student confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period? (If this were a non-standard term or nonterm program, this would have to be no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending.) If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal unless the student does not return. If the answer is no, this is a withdrawal, and the Return of Title IV Funds requirements apply. In Thompson's case, the answer is No; you must treat Thompson as a withdrawal. Thompson began attendance in all of the classes on which his Pell Grant was based (modules 1,2, and 4). Therefore, the school did not need to recalculate Thompson's revised Pell Grant. In addition, since Thompson began attendance in all of the classes on which his Campus-Based aid (FSEOG) was based, the school did not have to recalculate his eligibility for Campus-Based funds. Solution Per school policy, Thompson's withdrawal date is his last day of attendance at an academically related activity as determined from the school's attendance records, December 5. Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A. Since Thompson had begun all modules (classes) on which his Pell and Campus-Based aid was based, the Title IV grant aid disbursed was - Pell Grant $ 2,081.50 FSEOG $ 1,825.00 A. = $ 3,906 .50 Box B. Net Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box C. Title IV grants that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box D. Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box E. Total Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period = A + B = 3,906 .50 + 0.00 = $ 3,906 .50. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + C = 3,906 .50 + 0.00 = $ 3,906 .50. Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + B + C + D = 3,906 .50 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = $ 3,906 .50Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-187FSA HB November 2018Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned Though it is not a school that is required to take attendance, LSDJ has a school policy of using a student's last date of attendance at an academically related activity as the withdrawal date when a student withdraws from a program offered in modules. The total number of days in the payment period is the original 108 days. While the student did not begin module three, since module three was included in the original payment period or period of enrollment and used to determine the amount of Title IV, HEA funds eligibility, the days from module three are included in the denominator. The total number of completed calendar days in the period reflects the completed days in modules one, two, and four. From the previous Return calculation, we know that Thompson completed 54 days in mod - ules one and two. He completed 13 days in module 4 (22 days less the 9-day scheduled break). The total number of days completed (the days completed in modules one, two, and four) are the sum of the days completed during each period or 67 days (54 + 13). 1. Payment Period start date = August 22. 2. Payment Period end date = December 16. 3. Date of withdrawal = December 5. 4. Percentage of payment period completed Number of calendar days completed in modules one, two, and four = 67 Number of calendar days in the payment period = 108 (117 - 9-day scheduled break) 67 days \u00f7 108 days = 0.62. Percentage of payment period completed = 62.0% Box H. Because this percentage is greater than 60%, the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 100.0 %. Note that although no return is required, the school must complete Step 3 in order to deter- mine whether 100% of his aid has been disbursed or Thompson was due a post-withdrawal disbursement . Percentage of Title IV aid earned = 100.00% Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 100.0% (percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $3,843 .50. (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enroll- ment from Box G) = $3,843 .50. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $3,843 .50. Box J. When we subtract the amount of Title IV aid disbursed, $3,843 .50 (Box E) from the amount of Title IV earned, $3,843 .50 (Box I), the aid officer found that the answer is $0.00. Therefore, Thompson has received all the Title IV aid to which he was entitled and is not due a post-withdrawal disbursement. No further action is necessary. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3. Or, the school may enter the last date of attendance at an academically related activity for the \"withdrawal date,\" and proceed with the calculation as instructed. For a student who officially withdraws, enter the withdrawal date. LESS 9-DAY SCHEDULED BREAKMonetary amounts should be in dollars and cents (rounded to the nearest penny).

Start End August 1 August 26 August 29 September 23 September 26 October 21 October 24 November 18 Student Profile Eli Kraut is a dependent, fourth-year student enrolled at GSSM for 12 credits offered in four modules. In each four-week module, a student enrolls in one course that begins and ends on a fixed date. In Eli's case, each course is worth three credits. Charges to Eli's account for the payment period are as follows: Tuition and fees $ 3,200.00/12 credits School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Eli's financial aid package is based on the following nine month academic year cost of attendance (COA). Tuition $ 6,400.00 Room $ 3,200.00 Board $ 3,200.00 Books $ 1,600.00 Personal Expenses $ 3,200.00 Travel $ 800.00 Total COA $ 18,400.00Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-191FSA HB November 2018Discussion On the first day of the period, August 1, Eli received the following disbursements to his student account: Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 Net Subsidized Direct Loan $ 2,700.00 On August 25, Eli comes to see you. He tells you that his twin brother, Jake, has just won an all-ex - penses paid Mediterranean cruise for two and has invited Eli (the lucky dog) to accompany him on the cruise. Eli has decided not to miss this chance of a lifetime. He intends to drop modules two and three, and return for the fourth module on October 24. On August 26, Eli completes module one and with - draws. When a student withdraws from one of a series of modules in a nonterm-based program, a school must first determine whether or not the student must be treated as a withdrawal. In order to do so, the school must answer three questions: 1. After beginning attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, did the student cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend? If the answer is no, this is not a withdrawal. If the answer is yes, go to question 2. In Eli's case, the answer to Question 1 is Yes; you go on to Question 2. 2. When the student ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in a course he or she was sched - uled to attend, was the student still attending any other courses? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal. (Note, however that other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may apply.) If the answer is no, go to question 3. In Eli's case, the answer to Question 2 is No; you go on to Question 3. 3. Did the student confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period? For nonterm and nonstandard term programs, this must be no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending. Student Profile, Continued Eli's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 5,550.00 FSEOG $ 4,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 5,500.00 Federal Work Study (FWS) S 3,350.00 Except for his FWS award, all of Eli's financial aid for the first payment period (one-half his annual awards) was disbursed on the first day of classes.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-192 FSA HB November 2018 If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal unless the student does not return. If the answer is no, this is a withdrawal, and the Return of Title IV Funds requirements apply. Note : CFR 34 668.22(a)(2)(i)(C) provides that a student in a nonterm or nonstandard term program is considered to have withdrawn for Title IV purposes if the student is not scheduled to begin another course within a payment period or period of enrollment for more than 45 calendar days, unless the student is on an approved leave of absence. 34 CFR 668.22(a)(2)(ii)(A)(2) provides that, for a nonterm or nonstandard term program, an institution must treat as a withdrawal a student who ceases attendance in a module, notwithstanding a student's confirmation of attendance in a future module in the payment period or period of enrollment if that module does not begin within 45 days of the end of the module the student ceased attending. (For additional information see Withdrawals from programs offered in modules in Chapter 2.) The module in which Eli will be returning (module 4) does not start until October 24. That is 59 days from August 26, the end of the first module. Therefore, in Eli's case, the answer to Question 3 is No; you must treat Eli as a withdrawal. Because Eli failed to begin attendance in all of the classes on which his Title IV aid was based, be - fore performing the required Return calculation GSSM must recalculate Eli's eligibility for Title IV funds based on his enrol lment in just the one module he began \u2014three credits , or less than half time. Note : Pell Grant awards for students in clock-hour programs and programs without terms are always based on the Payment Schedule for Determining Full-Time Awards . Therefore, a school does not have to recalculate a Pell Grant when a student attending a nonterm program or clock-hour program withdraws. The school does have to recalculate Eli's eligibility for Campus-Based aid (FSEOG and FWS), eliminating the costs attributable to the modules that he did not begin attending, to see whether a reduction of the Campus-Based aid was necessary. After eliminating the expenses associated with the period of non-attendance, the school determined that the COA (for Campus-Based purposes) associated with Eli's enrollment in the one module was $2 ,600.00. The loan funds that Eli had already received (and for which his eligibility does not have t o be recalculated\u2014$ 2,700.00 ) plus his Pell Grant ($2,775.00), plus the $500.00 in FWS Eli has earned to date equal $5,975.00. Since $$5,975.00 exceeds Eli's revised COA of $2,500.00, the aid officer determined that Eli was not eligible for any FSEOG funds, so the school had to reduce Eli's FSEOG award to $0.00 and either award the $2,000.00 in FSEOG funds to another eligible student or return them to ED. Note that Pell Grants and earned FWS funds are never reduc ed to address an overpayment. Note : Any time a student enrolled in a clock-hour or nonterm program changes his or her enrollment status, the school must recalculate the student's COA to determine if the student's eligibility for Campus -Based funds has changed. The school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. Moreover, when a student enrolled in a clock-hour or nonterm program with- draws, a school that calculates Returns on a period of enrollment basis may not include costs associated with any future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days in the student's COA.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-193FSA HB November 2018GSSM performed a R2T4 calculation using Eli's last day of attendance of August 26 as his withdrawal date; $2,775.00 as the amount of Pell Grant disbursed; $0.00 as the amount of FSEOG funds disbursed; and $2,700.00 as the amount of Subsidized Direct Loan funds disbursed. On September 4, GSSM returned the funds for which it was responsible to the appropriate programs. Solution Eli's withdrawal date is his last day of attendance at an academically related activity as determined from the school's attendance records, August 26. At the beginning of the payment period, the following awards were posted to Eli's account at GSSM. Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 Net Subsidized Direct Loan $ 2,700.00 Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A.

Note that because Eli didn't drop modules two and three before withdrawing, the days in those modules are included in the number of days in the payment period. 1. Payment Period start date = August 1. 2. Payment Period end date = November 18. 3. Date of withdrawal = August 26. 4. Percentage of payment period completed Number of calendar days completed = 26 Number of calendar days in the payment period = 110 26 days \u00f7 110 days = 0.2363. Percentage of payment period completed = 23.6% Box H. Because this percentage is 60% or less , the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 23.6%. Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 23.6% (percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $5,525.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment from Box G) = $1,292.10. Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $1,292.10. I. = $1,292.10 Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) Title IV aid must be returned. $5,475.00 (Box E) - $1,292.10 (Box I) = $4182.90 . Title IV Aid to be returned = $4182.90 . K. = $4182.90.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-195FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. The institutional charges on Eli's account are the charges initially assessed for the payment period. Note that books and supplies are not included because Eli had an opportunity to purchase them elsewhere, and did. Tuition and fees $ 3,200.00 Room $ 1,600.00 Board $ 1,600.00 Box L = $ 6,400.00 Box M. Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (23.6%) from 100.0%. 100% - 23.6% = 76.4%. Percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 76.4%. M = 76.4% Box N. Calculate the amount of unearned charges. $6,400.00 (institutional charges from Box L) X 76.4% (% of Title IV aid unearned from Box M) = $4,889.60. Amount of unearned institutional charges = $4,889.60. N = $ 4,889.60 Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. Box K = $ 4182.90 Box N = $ 4,889.60 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $4182.90. O = $ 4,182.90 STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. T he amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school is $4192.90 (Box O), and Title IV loans are returned before Title IV grants. Since Eli received a Net Subsidized Direct Loan of $2,700.00, the school returns the entire $2,700.00 to the Direct Loan Program. The school also returns $1,482.90 ($4182.90. (Box 0) - $2,700.00 (Box P)) to the Pell Grant Program. Th e school must return any unearned funds within 45 days from the date of the institution's determination that Eli withdrew.

S ubtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return ($4,171.10 from Box O) from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($4,171.10 from Box K) to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $4,171.10 - $4,171.10 = $0.00. Q = $ 0.00 There is no unearned aid due from the student, so the Return calculation ends here. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3. Or, the school may enter the last date of attendance at an academically related activity for the \"withdrawal date,\" and proceed with the calculation as instructed. For a student who officially withdraws, enter the withdrawal date.Monetary amounts should be in dollars and cents (rounded to the nearest penny).

CU anticipates that Baker, as do most of the students at CU, will complete each of the modules in four weeks, and the payment period in 16 weeks. Charges to Baker's account for the payment period are as follows: Tuition and fees $ 6,000.00/12 credits School Authorized to Credit Account for Other Charges: Yes (all charges) Baker's financial aid package is based on the following eight-month academic year cost of attendance (COA). Tuition $ 12,000.00 Room $ 3,200.00 Board $ 3,200.00 Books $ 1,200.00 Personal Expenses $ 3,200.00 Travel $ 800.00 Total COA $ 23,600.00Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-201FSA HB November 2018 Student Profile, Continued Baker's financial aid package included the following annual awards: Pell Grant $ 5,550.00 FSEOG $ 4,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 5,500.00 Discussion On the first day of the period, January 9, Baker received disbursements totaling $9,550.00 in Title IV assistance from the following programs to his student account: Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 Net S ubsidized Direct Loan $ 2,700.00 Net Unsubsidized Direct Loan $ 2,025.00 On January 27, you are notified by the registrar that Baker has dropped module 2. Then, on February 3, after completing the last class in module 1, Baker comes to see you. He tells you that he's been offered a job as a researcher on a project studying the terrapin species native to the brackish coastal swamps of Maryland and other southeastern states. Baker has decided to withdraw from school in order to accept the job. When a student withdraws from one of a series of modules in a nonterm-based program, a school must first determine whether or not the student must be treated as a withdrawal. In order to do so, the school must answer three questions: 1. After beginning attendance in the payment period or period of enrollment, did the student cease to attend or fail to begin attendance in a course he or she was scheduled to attend? If the answer is no, this is not a withdrawal. If the answer is yes, go to question 2. In Baker' s case, the answer to Question 1 is Yes; you go on to Question 2. 2. When the student ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in a course he or she was sched - uled to attend, was the student still attending any other courses? If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal. (Note, however, that other regulatory provisions concerning recalculation may ap - ply.) If the answer is no, go to question 3. In Baker' s case, the answer to Question 2 is No; you go on to Question 3. 3. Did the student confirm attendance in a course in a module beginning later in the period? For nonterm and nonstandard term programs, this must be no later than 45 calendar days after the end of the module the student ceased attending. If the answer is yes, this is not a withdrawal, un - less the student does not return. If the answer is no, this a withdrawal, and the Return of Title IV Funds requirements apply. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-202 FSA HB November 2018In Baker's case, the answer is No, and therefore you must consider Baker as a withdrawn student. Because Baker failed to begin attendance in all of the classes on which his Title IV aid was based, before performing the required Return calculation, CU must recalculate Baker's eligibility for Title IV funds based on his enrollment in just the one module he began\u2014three credits, or less than half time. Note : Pell Grant awards for students in clock-hour programs and programs without terms are always based on the Payment Schedule for Determining Full-Time Awards . Therefore a school does not have to recalculate a Pell Grant when a student attending a nonterm program or clock-hour program withdraws. The school does have to recalculate Baker's eligibility for Campus-Based aid (FSEOG and FWS), eliminat - ing the costs attributable to the modules that he did not begin attending, to see whether a reduction of the Campus-Based aid was necessary. After eliminating the expenses associated with the period of non-atten - dance, the school determined that the COA (for Campus-Based purposes) associated with Baker's enroll - ment in the one module was $3 ,250.00. The loan funds that Baker had already received (and for which his eligibility does not have to be recalculated\u2014 $4,725.00 ) plus his Pell Grant ($2,775.00), plus the $400.00 in FWS Baker has earned to date equal $7,900.00 . Since $7,900.00 exceeds Baker's revised COA of $3,250.00, the aid officer determined that Baker was not eligible for any FSEOG funds, so the school had to reduce Baker's FSEOG award to $0.00 and either award the $2,000.00 in FSEOG funds to another eligible student or return them to ED. (Note that Pell Grants and earned FWS funds are never reduced to address an overpayment.) Note : Any time a student enrolled in a clock-hour, nonterm program, or nonstandard term program with terms that are not substantially equal changes his or her enrollment status, the school must recalculate the student's COA to determine if the student's eligibility for Campus-Based funds has changed. The school may not include in the student's COA costs associated with any classes the student failed to begin. Moreover, when a student enrolled in a clock-hour, nonterm program, or non standard term program with terms that are not substantially equal withdraws, a school that calculates Returns on a period of enrollment basis may not include costs associated with any future payment period for which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days in the Student's COA. CU performed a R2T4 calculation using Baker's last day of attendance of February 3 as his withdrawal date; $2,775.00 as the amount of Pell Grant disbursed; $0.00 as the amount of FSEOG funds disbursed; $2,700.00 as the amount of Subsidized Direct Loan funds disbursed; and $2,025.00 as the amount of unsubsidized loan funds disbursed. On February 17, CU returned the funds for which it was responsible to the appropriate programs.Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-203FSA HB November 2018Solution At the beginning of the semester, the following awards were posted to Baker's account at CU. Pell Grant $ 2,775.00 FSEOG $ 2,000.00 Subsidized Direct Loan $ 2,700.00 Unsubsidized Direct Loan $ 2,025.00 Step 1: Student's Title IV Aid Information Box A.

Title IV loans that could have been disbursed = $ 0.00. Box E. Total Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period = A + B = 2775.00 + 4,725.00 = $ 7,500.00. Box F. Total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + C = 2,775 .00 + 0.00 = $ 2,775 .00. Box G. Total Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period = A + B + C + D = 2,775.00 + 4,725.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = $7,500.00.Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals the of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-204 FSA HB November 2018Step 2: Percentage of Title IV Aid Earned For Title IV purposes, Baker's withdrawal date is February 3, the day he informed the aid office that he was withdrawing. 1. Payment Period start date = January 9. 2. Payment Period end date = April 27. 3. Date of withdrawal = February 3. 4. Percentage of payment period completed Note: Because Baker dropped one module (module 2) of the course before he withdrew, the days following the end of module 1 (February 4) through the day prior to the start of module 3 (March 4)\u201430 days\u2014are excluded from the total days used in determining the percentage of the period completed. Number of calendar days completed = 26 Number of calendar days in the payment period = 80 (The 110 days in the original period less the 30 days from February 4 through March 4) 26 days \u00f7 80 days = 0.3250. Percentage of payment period completed = 32.5% Box H. Because this percentage is 60% or less , the percentage of Title IV aid earned = 32.5%. H = Step 3: Amount of Title IV Aid Earned by the Student Box I. 32.5% (percentage of Title IV aid earned from Box H) X $7500.00 (Total of the Title IV aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the payment period or period of enrollment from Box G) = $2,437.50 Amount of Title IV aid earned by the student = $2,437.50 . I. = $2,437.50 Step 4: Total Title IV Aid to be Disbursed or Returned Box J. Because the total Title IV aid earned (Box I) is less than the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E), no post-withdrawal disbursement is due, and we proceed to Box K. Post-withdrawal disbursement = NA. Box K. Because the total Title IV aid disbursed (Box E) is greater than the total Title IV aid earned (Box I), Title IV aid must be returned. $7500.00 (Box E) - $2,437.50 (Box I) = $5,062.50. Title IV Aid to be returned = $5,062.50. K. = $5,062.50Chapter 3\u2014Case Studies in Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds5-205FSA HB November 2018Step 5: Amount of Title IV Aid Due from the School Box L. The charges used in a Return calculation are always the charges initially assessed by the school adjusted only for any courses or module the student dropped prior to the date the student withdrew Therefore, even though CU refunds the tuition Baker paid for the modules he did not start, the school must enter $4,500.00 in Step 5 of the Return calculation. (The $6,000.00 initially charged minus the $1,500.00 for module 2 that Baker dropped before withdrawing.) A $150.00 charge for books is included because Baker did not have the opportunity to purchase them elsewhere. Tuition and fees $ 4,500.00 Books $ 150.00 L. = $ 4,650.00 Box M. Subtract the percentage of Title IV earned from Box H (40.6%) from 100.0%. 100% - 32.5% = 67.5%. Percentage of Title IV aid unearned = 67.5%. M. = 67.5% Box N. Multiply the institutional charges from Box L ($4,650.00) by the percentage of unearned Title IV aid from Box M (67.5%) to find the amount of unearned charges $4,650.00 X 67.5% = $3,138.75. Amount of unearned = $3,138.75. N . = $ 3,138.75 Box O. Compare the amount of Title IV aid to be returned (Box K) to unearned institutional charges (Box N), and enter the lesser amount in Box O. K = $5,062.50 N = $3,138.75 Amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school = $ 3,138.75 . STEP 6: Return of Funds by the School B o x P. The amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the school is $3,138.75 (Box O). Since Title IV loans are returned before Title IV grants, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans are returned before Subsidized Direct Loans, the school returns $2,025.00 to the Direct Loan Program for crediting toward Baker's Unsubsidized Direct Loan an d $1,114.00 to the Direct Loan Program for crediting toward Baker's Subsidized Direct Loan (Because the COD system will not accept requests for other than whole dollars [no cents ] for t he Direct Loan Program). The school also cancels the second disbursement of both of his Direct Loans. The school must return any unearned funds within 45 days from the date of the institution's determination that Baker withdrew. Volume 5\u2014Withdrawals and the Return of Title IV Funds, 2018-20195-206 FSA HB November 2018STEP 7: Initial Amount of Unearned Title IV Aid Due from Student Box Q. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid the school must return ($3,138.75) from Box O from the total amount of Title IV aid that is to be returned ($5,062.50) from Box K to find the initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student. $5,062.50 - $3,139.00 = $1,923.50 . Q. = $1,923.50 The initial amount of Title IV aid due from the student, is $ 1,957.50 . STEP 8: Repayment of the Student's Loans Box R. Subtra ct the total loans the school must return ($3,138.75) from Box P from the net loans disbursed to the student ($4,725.00) from Box B to find the total of the loans the student must repay $4,725.00 - $3,139.00 = $1,586.00. R. = $1,586.00 Since the amount from Box Q ( $1,957.50 ) is greater than the amount from Box R ($ 1,636.25 ), you proceed to Step 9. STEP 9: Grant Funds to be Returned Box S. S ubtract the amount of loans to be repaid by the student in Box R ($1,586.00) from the initial amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the student Box Q ($1,923.50) to find the initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return $1,923.50 - $1,586.00 = $337.50. S. = $337.50 Box T. Multiply the total Title IV grant aid disbursed and could have been disbursed for the period in Box F ($2,775.00) by 50% to find the amount of grant protection $2,775.00 X 50% = $1,387.50. T. = $ 1,387.50 Box U. Subtract the amount of grant protection in Box T ($1,387.50) from the initial amount of Title IV grants for the student to return in Box S ($337.50) to find the Title IV grants for the student to return $337.50 - $1,387.50 = - $1,050.00. U. = - $1,050.00 Since the amount in Box U is less than or equal to zero, the student does not have to return any Title IV grant funds, and the calculation is complete. Treatment Of Title IV Funds When A Student Withdraws From A Credit-Hour Program A school that is not required to take attendance may, for a student who withdraws without notification, enter 50% in Box H and proceed to Step 3. Or, the school may enter the last date of attendance at an academically related activity for the \"withdrawal date,\" and proceed with the calculation as instructed. For a student who officially withdraws, enter the withdrawal date.Monetary amounts should be in dollars and cents (rounded to the nearest penny). When calculating percentages, round to three decimal places.

Alone the text herein does not provide schools with the guidance needed to satisfactorily administer the Title IV HEA programs . For more complete guidance, you should refer to the text in the chapters cited, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and the Higher Education Act (HEA) as amended. Throughout this volume, new information is indicated with the following symbol: When the text represents a clarification rather than a change, it is indicated with: When we believe that historically there might be some misunderstanding of a requirement, we indicate that with: If we want to point out a bit of helpful information, we indicate it with: Finally, if we want to draw your attention to something, we indicate it with: Notes on Active Links At the top of each page you will find links to the Federal Student Aid Glossary and Appendices (Glossary, the Code of Federal Regulations Federal Work-Study Program (FWS), the Federal Supplemental Educational Grant Program (FSEOG), and the Federal Perkins Loan Program (Perkins Loans). This volume provides the information that schools need to administer those programs.Major Changes This volume has been revised to reflect the winding down of the Perkins Loan Program. Schools that participated in the Perkins Program should review applicable sections thoroughly. Chapter 1\u2014The Campus-Based Programs We have changed the Fiscal Operations Report\u2014The Application to Participate signature requirements. We have replaced the eCB with Campus-Based Section of the COD Web Site (cod.ed.gov), and schools should now address questions about the Campus-Based Programs to the COD School Relations Center. Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program We have replaced the excess liquid capital process with the Distribution of Assets process. We explain the distribution of assets from schools' Perkins Loan revolving funds. We explain that when manual paper assignments are accepted, schools will receive a document identified as a Perkins Load Database Report (Acceptance Report) via email. We remind schools that once a Perkins Loan has been accepted for assignment by the Department, a school or servicer that has previously reported a borrower's loan to a credit reporting agency MUST report to that agency that the loan has been transferred. Chapter 5\u2014 Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default We explain that due to the expiration of the Perkins Loan Program schools are no longer able to claim the Administrative Cost Allowance (ACA), but that some billing and collection costs may still be charged to the fund. We have added a sidebar on the Assignment Procedures due to Total and Permanent Disability Discharge . 6-2 FSA CAMPUS-BASED PROGRAMS OVERVIEW A school must first enter into a Program Participation Agreement (PPA) with the Department of Education (the Department/ED) before it can participate and make awards of Federal Student Aid (FSA) funds in the Campus-Based Programs . Federal Perkins Loan Program The term Perkins Loans , includes Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans (NDSL Loans), and National Defense Student Loans. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program (FSEOG) The FSEOG provides assistance to exceptionally needy undergraduate students. Students are exceptionally needy if they have the lowest Estimated Family Contributions (EFCs). Awarding priority must be given to Pell Grant recipients. Schools selecting FSEOG recipients must use the selection criteria discussed in Volume 3. Federal Work-Study Program (FWS) The FWS provides part-time employment to undergraduate and graduate students who need the earnings to help meet their costs of postsecondary education. The FWS Program encourages students receiving FWS assistance to participate in community service activities. Related information The rules for awarding and packaging Campus-Based aid are discussed with the other FSA programs ( Volume 3 ). Program HB June 2018 PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT (PPA) When a school completes its Application to Participate (E-App) (or its recertification), the school has the opportunity to elect participation in one or more of the Campus-Based Programs. When a school's application is approved ( Volume 2 ), the Department sends an electronic notice to the president and financial aid officer notifying them that the school's PPA is available to print, review, sign, and return. In addition to the requirements generally applicable to the FSA programs contained in the PPA, there are requirements unique to the Federal Perkins Loan and FWS programs. Perkins PPA requirements The authority to make new Perkins Loans provided under the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 has expired. As long as a school has not liquidated and is continuing to service its Perkins Loan portfolio it is required to continue reporting annually its Perkins Loan Activity on its Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP). The agreement for the Federal Perkins Loan Program also requires the school to establish and maintain a fund and to deposit into the fund: any Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) the school receives for the program for each award year. (Congress has not authorized any FCC for the Perkins Loan Program since the 2004-2005 award year); the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) , including any ICC to match transfer of funds from other Campus-Based Programs; payments the school receives for repayment of loan principal, interest, collection charges, and penalty or late charges on loans from the fund; payments the school receives from ED for cancellations, such as teacher service cancellations (currently, no cancellation reimbursements are being appropriated by Congress) (see Chapter 4); any other earnings on fund assets, including net interest earnings on funds deposited in an interest-bearing account (total interest minus bank charges incurred on the account); and proceeds of any short-term, no interest loans made to the Fund by the school in anticipation of collections or receipt of FCC.Program participation requirements The basic list of PPA requirements is found in 34 CFR 668.14. Under the PPA, the school agrees to use the funds it receives solely for the purposes specified in the regulations for that program and to administer each program in accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended, and the General Provisions regulations. PPA requirements for Perkins 34 CFR 674.8 PPA requirements for Federal Work-Study 34 requirements for FSEOG 34 CFR 676.8 Short-Term Loans Schools may make short-term loans to the fund to cover shortfalls in their collections and then reimburse themselves from the fund. Generally, short-term means not more than a year.TIPCFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-5FSA HB June 2018 The institution shall use the money in the Fund only for capital distributions provided for in section 466 of the Higher Education Act (HEA); litigation costs (see \u00a7 674.47); other collection costs, agreed to by the Secretary in connection with the collection of principal, interest, and late charges on a loan made from the Fund (see \u00a7 674.47); and repayment of any short-term, no interest loans made to the Fund by the institution in anticipation of collections. Federal Work-Study PPA requirements Under the PPA, schools participating in the FWS Program must make FWS employment reasonably available, to the extent of available funds, to all eligible students; award FWS employment, to the maximum extent practicable, that will complement and reinforce each recipient's educational program or career goals; assure that FWS employmen t is use d to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities; and inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community service and consult with local nonprofit, government, and community-based organizations to identify those opportunities. FSEOG PPA requirements Under the PPA, schools participating in the FSEOG Program must use the funds they receive solely to award grants to financially needy students to help those students pay their educational costs. A student at an institution of higher education is eligible to receive an FSEOG for an award year if the student meets the relevant eligibility requirements contained in 34 CFR 668.32; is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as an undergraduate student at the institution; and has financial need as determined in accordance with part F of Title IV of the HEA. FSEOG PPA requirements 34 CFR 676 Agreement 34 CFR 676.8 Student eligibility 34 CFR 676.9 Determining Student Eligibility Each Campus-Based Program has individual eligibility criteria. However, before applying the individual program criteria, a school must determine that a student satisfies the general criteria for receiving Title IV funds. To be eligible to receive Title IV funds, a student must be enrolled as a regular student in an eligible program at an eligible institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential offered by that institution and meet the applicable eligibility criteria specified in 34 CFR 668.32. through 668.34. (34 CFR 668.32(a)(1) (i)) Enrolled -The status of a student who\u2014 (1) Has completed the registration requirements (except for the payment of tuition and fees) at the institution that he or she is attending; or (2) Has been admitted into an educational program offered predominantly by correspondence and has submitted one lesson, completed by him or her after acceptance for enrollment and without the help of a representative of the institution. (34 CFR 668.2) Regular Student -A person who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential offered by that institution. (34 CFR 600.2) Educational Program -(1) A legally authorized postsecondary program of organized instruction or study that: (i) Leads to an academic, professional, or vocational degree, or certificate, or other recognized educational credential, or is a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program, as described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart O. Eligible Institution -An institution that\u2014 (1) Qualifies as\u2014 (i) An institution of higher education, as defined in \u00a7600.4; (ii) A proprietary institution of higher education, as defined in \u00a7600.5; or (iii) A postsecondary vocational institution, as defined in \u00a7600.6; and (2) Meets all the other applicable provisions. of FWS in 90/10 calculation FWS funds recovered by the school are excluded from revenues in the 90/10 calculation, unless the school used those funds to pay for a student's institutional charges. (See Volume 2 for discussion of the 90/10 calculation.) First-Time Campus-Based Program applicants A school that has applied to participate in the Campus-Based Programs for the first time should submit a FISAP by the deadline even if the school has not been certified to participate in the programs. The Department will calculate a funding level for the school and put the funding on \"hold\" status until the school has been approved to participate. See \"Allocation of Campus-Based Funds\" later in this chapter for more information.THE FUNDING PROCESS Fiscal Operations Report\u2014The Application to Participate (FISAP) The FISAP is divided into three main parts: Part I - identifying Information, Certifications, and Warnings; Part II - the Application to Participate in the three Campus-Based Programs in the upcoming award year; and Parts III-V - the Fiscal Operations Report, in which schools provide information on any Campus-Based expenditures made during the award year just completed. Any school that wants to obtain Campus-Based Program funds for an upcoming year and all schools that have received Campus-Based Program funds for the reporting year must complete the FISAP. All schools that complete a FISAP must provide the information requested in the Identifying Information, Certifications, and Warning section. A school that wishes to apply for Campus-Based Program funds for the coming year must complete The Application to Participate section of the FISAP. A school that received Campus-Based Program funds for the award year that just ended must complete The Fiscal Operations Report portion of the FISAP. The Department uses the information your school provides in the FISAP to determine the amount of funds your school will receive for the FWS and FSEOG programs. The Department uses your Fiscal Operations Report data to manage the Federal Perkins Loan Program and monitor expenditures in the Campus-Based Programs. For program review and audit purposes, you must retain accurate and verifiable records for three years following the end of the award year in which the FISAP is submitted. For example, the award year in which you will submit the FISAP due on October 1, 2018 ends on June 30, 2018 (Award year = July 1, 2017-June 30, 2018). You must retain all records used in the creation of the FISAP due on September 29, 2017 until June 30, 2021 (three years from June 30, 2018\u2014the end of the award year in which the FISAP is submitted).CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-7FSA HB June 2018 The important dates in the FISAP award process are August 1 \u2014ED must make the FISAP software available to all participating schools.

February 1 \u2014ED sends tentative award notifications to all eligible schools. April 1\u2014 ED sends final award notifications to all eligible schools (if appropriations have been finalized). You will find additional information on the Fiscal Operations Report later in this chapter. FISAP on the Web Schools submit the FISAP through the Common Origi - nation and Disbursement (COD) website, available at: cod.ed.gov. The FISAP is available for completion on the COD website by August 1 of each year. It must be completed no later than October 1 of the same year. (The deadline will be earlier if October 1st falls on a weekend.) A list of all Campus-Based submission dates is posted on the FISAP on the website. Schools may also make FISAP corrections on the website. For more information on amending previous submissions, see Volume 5. Certifications on the FISAP Part I of the FISAP includes two required certifications: 1. Form 80-0013, Certifications Regarding Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters. 2. Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (should only be completed if a school expends funds for lobbying activities). See Volume 2 for more information on these requirements.

All forms must be signed and submitted by the appropriate deadline date. FISAP Signature Requirements The Department will only accept the FISAP signature form manually . The eSignature process has been discontinued. To submit a manual signature for the FISAP , you must print the combined certification and signature pages for your FISAP submission, obtain the CEO's signature, and mail these documents (with the original signature) to the address on the previous page. Annual Campus-Based Deadlines The Campus-Based Deadline dates Federal Register (FR) notices are listed by year at ifap.ed.gov/ifap/cbp_deadlines.jsp Allocation of Campus-Based funds The Department allocates funds for the Campus-Based Programs directly to schools each award year, indicating the amount of funding for each program the school is authorized to receive from the Department for the award year. Using the information on the FISAP, the Department calculates the allocation amount using statutory formulas and the amount of funds appropriated by Congress for the program(s). A school will not receive an allocation that is in excess of its request. Due to the expiration of the Federal Perkins Loan Program, schools will no longer receive a Level of Expenditure on their Auto Statement of Accounts. Schools will be permitted to claim collections costs as prescribed in the regulations. A school can receive two types of Campus-Based fund allocations\u2014 initial and supplemental. Initial Allocation \u2014the amount that the Department first al - locates to each participating school for an award year from new funds appropriated by Congress, according to statutory alloca - tion formulas. An eligible school receives an initial allocation for each Campus-Based Program in which the school partici - pates. Supplemental Allocation \u2014an additional amount of Campus- Based funds from the Department that is reallocated from the amount of unused Campus-Based funds returned from the previous award year by participating schools. Criteria for distributing these funds for each program are established in ac - cordance with the statute and regulation. NEWCFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-9FSA HB June 2018 Allocation schedule If your school submits the FISAP by the deadline (October 1), the Department will provide your school with tentative allocation information and your worksheet by February 1 of the following year and with final allocation information and worksheets by April 1 for the upcoming award year. In an Electronic Announcement (EA), the Department notifies participating schools that they can view the methodology used for final award figures. You can find the final funding worksheets for your school, your Electronic Statement of Account (ESOA), and your final award at cod.ed.gov. To access your school's final funding level worksheets and individual school awards, log in to the COD website and select \"Campus-Based\" from the School Tab, then select Self-Service from the left navigation menu. The Final Funding Worksheet shows the data that was used to determine a school's allocation for each Campus-Based Program in which it participates and how each final allocation was determined. It is important that schools review their tentative allocations and the supporting worksheets so they can address any concerns before the final allocations are determined. If your school doesn't receive its final allocation by April 1, it may mean that your school lost its eligibility to participate in FSA programs; your school is a new applicant for the FSA programs and/or for the Campus-Based Programs and its participation hasn't been approved yet; the Department has not received the FISAP signature/ certification form with the required original signature of the school's CEO; or Congress has not yet appropriated funds for the year. If the reason(s) for holding the school's final allocation is/are resolved, the Department will release the school's final allocation. The worksheet shows the actual numbers that were used to determine a school's allocation for each Campus-Based Program in which it participates and how each final allocation was determined. If your school is awarded a Supplemental Allocation, the Department will inform you before the end of September of the award year.Release of tentative and final funding levels HEA 462(a) 34 CFR 673.4 Your school's funding levels and corresponding worksheets will be posted in the \"Self-Service\" area on the COD website at cod.ed.gov. Your school's Campus-Based contact person will be notified by email when the tentative and the final funding levels are issued. Review your final funding levels on the COD website, and if you feel they are not correct, you contact the COD School Relations Center at 800-848-0978. Reduction and reallocation 34 CFR 673.4(d)(3) Releasing unexpended funds 34 CFR 673.4(d)(3)Releasing and reallocation of funds If a school does not use its total allocation during an award year, it can release the unexpended portion of the allocation of federal funds to the Department during August following the award year. These released funds can be reallocated to schools that need additional funds for the upcoming award year. This return of unexpended funds is called releasing Campus-Based funds. Each year in July, the Department posts an EA at ifap.ed.gov that asks schools to release any previous award year funds that they have not expended and offers schools the opportunity to request supplemental FWS funds for community service. The Reallocation Form for schools wishing to return funds or request supplemental FWS funds can be found in the Forms and Waivers page of the Campus-Based Section of the COD website (cod.ed.gov). You must complete the Campus-Based Reallocation Form if you did not spend your entire allocation in any of the Campus- Based Programs, or want to request supplemental FWS funds to pay students in community service jobs (based on the criteria discussed later in this section). A school may request supplemental FWS funds if it has spent at least 5% of its total FWS funds for the award year to compensate students employed as reading tutors of children or in family literacy activities as part of its community service activities, and an FWS fair share shortfall as shown on the school's final fund - ing worksheet, provided with the final allocation letter. After schools release their unexpended allocations, ED reallocates both the FWS and FSEOG funds to schools that have met the criteria for receiving a supplemental allocation. Criteria for distributing these funds for each program are established in accordance with the HEA and the Campus-Based Program regulations.NEWCFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-11FSA HB June 2018 Underuse Penalty and Waiver If a school returns more than 10% of its allocated funds for a given award year in any one of the Campus-Based Programs, the Department may reduce the school's allocation for the second succeeding award year by the dollar amount returned unless the Department waives this provision. For example, if the school returns more than 10% of its 2017- 2018 allocation, its 2019-2020 allocation may be reduced by the dollar amount returned for 2017-2018. The Department may waive this penalty provision for a school if it finds that enforcement would be contrary to the interests of the program. To request a waiver, a school must submit an explanation with its FISAP by the deadline that shows that the school returned more than 10% of its allocation due to circumstances beyond its control and that are not expected to recur. ED explains the process a school must use to request a waiver in the FISAP instruction booklet. To request a waiver, a school must submit an explanation of the circumstances with its FISAP. ED explains the process a school must use to request a waiver in the FISAP instruction booklet and in an annual EA. PAYMENT METHODS AND CONDITIONS Before requesting and disbursing FSA program funds, schools must meet certain conditions. These conditions vary depending on the way ED provides funds to schools. For more detail about the methods and conditions through which ED provides funds, see Volume 4. A school should not request funds in excess of the actual disbursements it has made or will make to students within the timeframe allowed. CFR 1095 [HEA section 488] Matching of Transferred Funds If a school transfers Federal Perkins Loan funds to either FSEOG or FWS before depositing those funds in the school's Federal Perkins Loan fund, the school provides the match required by the FWS or FSEOG programs.TRANSFER OF CAMPUS-BASED FUNDS To help meet their students' need, schools may transfer funds from certain Campus-Based Programs into certain other Campus-Based Programs. The Department's permission is not required. A school's future allocations for the Campus-Based Programs are not affected by past transferring of funds between programs. Several general rules apply to the transfer of funds between Campus- Based Programs: Y ou must award transferred funds according to the requirements of the program to which they are transferred. Y ou must report the transfer of funds on the Fiscal Operations Report portion of the FISAP . You may not transfer funds from one program to another unless you have awarded funds to students in the program from which you are transferring in the same award year. Any transferred funds that are unexpended must be transferred back to the original program at the end of the award year. All transfers must be reported on the FISAP. The G5 system does not permit moving funds between programs or years. Schools report the transfer of Campus-Based funds on the FISAP only. Adjustments are NOT made in the G5 payment system. In the G5 system, all funds must remain in the original program award identifier (P033AxxXXXX for FWS and P007AxxXXXX for FESOG) and in the year received. Descriptions of individual program fund transfers follow. FSEOG A school may transfer up to 25% of its FSEOG allocation to its FWS allocation. (A school must have an FWS and FSEOG allocation for any year it wants to transfer funds from FSEOG to FWS.) Also, you may not transfer FSEOG funds to FWS unless you have awarded FSEOG funds to students in the same award year that you intend to make the transfer. A school may not transfer funds carried forward or back from other award years to a different Campus-Based program. A school must match any FWS funds transferred to FSEOG at the matching rate of that FSEOG program, but the match doesn't have to be made until the transfer has occurred. CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-13FSA HB June You may not transfer FWS funds to FSEOG unless you have an allocation in both programs and have made awards to students from both programs for the award year. A school may transfer up to 25% of the sum of its initial and supplemental FWS allocations for an award year to its FSEOG Program. The total transfer cannot exceed 25% of the FWS allocation . Please note that FWS supplemental funding may not be transferred to another Campus-Based program. All FWS supplemental funding must be spent in community service. Funds carried forward to the next year or carried back to the previous year do not change the basis for the 25% maximum transfer. You must match any FWS funds transferred to FSEOG at the matching rate of the FSEOG Program, but the match doesn't have to occur until after the transfer has occurred. Perkins The authority to make Perkins Loans has expired. Since schools will no longer be receiving a Level of Expenditure for the Perkins Program, schools are no longer permitted to transfer Perkins funds into the other Campus-Based programs. FSEOG AND FWS CARRY FORWARD/CARRY BACK Your school may spend up to 10% of its initial and supplemental FWS authorizations, or 10% of its initial and supplemental FSEOG authorizations in the following award year (carry forward). Before a school may spend its current year's allocation, it must spend any funds carried forward from the previous year. Your school is also permitted to spend up to 10% of its current initial and supplemental FWS authorizations, or 10% of its initial and supplemental FSEOG authorizations for expenses incurred in the previous award year (carry back). Supplemental funding must be spent on community service in the award year in which the supplemental funding is awarded. Your school must match FWS or FSEOG funds carried forward or carried back in the award year that they are spent. A school's future FWS or FSEOG program allocation is not affected by carrying forward or carrying back funds between award years.General Principles The official authorization letter for a specific award period is the school's authority to transfer funds across years or to other Campus-Based Programs. A school may not carry forward or carry back FWS funds to any award year in which there is no specific FWS allocation, and the same requirement holds for FSEOG funds. Clarification G5: Funds Carried Forward/Back Any Campus-Based funds carried forward or carried back between award years must be entered in G5 as an expenditure against the original program award in the year from which the funds were taken\u2014 not the authorization for the award year in which the funds were used. Carry forward/carry back 34 CFR 675.18(b)(c)(d)(e) Carry back funds for summer FWS employment and FSEOG awards You may carry back FWS funds for summer employment that is part of the prior award year. That is, you may use any portion of your school's initial and supplemental FWS authorizations for the current award year to pay student wages earned on or after May 1 of the previous award year but prior to the beginning of the current award year (July 1). This summer carry back authority is in addition to the authority to carry back 10% of the current year's FWS allocation for use during the previous award year. Also, your school may spend any portion of its current award year's initial and supplemental FSEOG allocations to make FSEOG awards to students for payment periods that began on or after May 1 of the prior award year but ended prior to the start of the current award year ( carry back for summer ). This carry-back authority for summer FSEOG awards is in addition to the authority to carry back 10% of the current award year's FSEOG allocation for use during the previous award year.Carry Forward/Carry Back 2017-2018 Allocation Rule: A school may transfer up to 10% of its current year i nitial plus supplemental authorizations for FWS and FSEOG , and up to 10% of its current year initial plus supplemental FSEOG authorization, forward to the next award year, or back to the previous award year.10% 10%2018-2019 Allocation2019-2020 Allocation Questions about Transferring Funds or Carrying Them Forward or Back If you have questions regarding Campus- Based Program fund adjustments, transferring funds between Campus-Based Programs, or the carry forward and carry back authority for Campus-Based funds, contact the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978. Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. (ET). You may also email the center at CODSupport@ed.gov.NEWCFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-15FSA HB June 2018 FWS limitations on use of funds carried forward or back Schools are not permitted to add funds that are carried forward or back to the total FWS allocation for an award year when determining the maximum percentage of available funds that may be used in that award year for any of the following purposes transferring FWS funds to FSEOG, providing the federal share of wages in private for-profit sector jobs, the Job Location and Development (JLD) Program. For example, if a school carries $10,000 forward from 2015-2016 to 2016-2017, it may not include the $10,000 in the total 2016-2017 allocation for these three purposes. For these purposes, the 2016-2017 percentage is based on a school's total 2016-2017 FWS initial allocation for the 2016-2017 year. Reporting funds carried forward and back On the FISAP, you must report FWS or FSEOG funds that your school carries back and carries forward. For example, if a school carried forward 10% of its FWS 2017-2018 allocation to be spent in 2018-2019, the school must report this amount on the FISAP in Part V of the Fiscal Operations Report for 2018-2019 due October 1, 675.26 and 675.33(b) 34 CFR 676.21 Job Location & Development A school may use up to 10% or $75,000 of a school's FWS allocation for its JLD Program. The federal share of allowable costs in carrying out the JLD Program may not exceed 80% of such costs. (See Chapter 2.) Wages from Federal Agency The portion of the FWS wages contributed as the school share by a federal off- campus agency is not considered part of the \"federal share.\" Thus, a federal agency may provide the required share of student compensation normally paid by off- campus agencies plus any other employer costs that they agree to pay.FEDERAL AND NONFEDERAL SHARES (MATCHING) The amount that a school may spend in a Campus-Based Program is composed of both federal and nonfederal funds. With the exception of certain schools (see below), schools that participate in the Campus-Based Programs must provide nonfederal funds as a match for the federal funds they receive. The specific matching requirements for each Campus-Based Program are different. For more detail on the requirements of federal and nonfederal shares for each program, see the program-specific sections later in this chapter. Federal share of FWS In general, the federal share of FWS wages paid to a student may not exceed 75% of the student's total wages. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule. 1. If the student is working for a private for-profit organization, the federal share of the student's wages may not exceed 50%. 2. A school may use the federal share to pay up to 100% of the FWS wages if the work performed by the student is for the school itself and the school is an excepted institution or a federal, state, or local public agency, or for a private nonprofit organization. The student must be employed as a reading tutor for preschool-age children or elementary school children, employed as a mathematics tutor for children in elementary school through ninth grade, performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project that provides services to families with preschool or elementary age children, or employed in community service activities and is per - forming civic education and participation activities in community service projects. A school is not required to ask the Department for a waiver of the FWS nonfederal share requirement to receive the 100% federal share authorization for an FWS student employed in one of these jobs. Instead, the school should use 100% federal dollars to pay such a student and then show on its FISAP that it did so. CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-17FSA HB June 2018 3. A school may use the federal share of FWS wages to pay up to 90% of a student's wages if all the following conditions are met: The student is employed at a private nonprofit or - ganization or a federal, state, or local public agency. (Employment at the school itself is not eligible.) The school does not own, operate, or control the organization or agency. To satisfy this requirement, your school must keep a statement in the school's file, signed by both the agency and the school, stating that they have no such relationship. The school selects the organization or agency on a case-by-case basis. This requirement is satisfied when the school selects the agency through its normal pro - cess of selecting potential employers. The organization or agency must be unable to pay the regular nonfederal share. To satisfy this requirement, the school must keep in its file a signed letter from an official of the agency stating that the agency cannot afford to pay the regular nonfederal share. The 90% federal share is limited to no more than 10% of the students paid under the FWS Program. For purposes of this calculation, the school must use the total number of FWS students paid during the current award year. The 10% limit on the number of students paid with the 90% federal share does not include stu - dents whose FWS wages have been exempted from the full nonfederal share requirement due to being em - ployed as a reading or mathematics tutor, performing family literacy activities, or performing civic educa - tion and participation activities in community service projects. The federal share can be 100% for a school designated as an eligible institution under Title III or Title V of the HEA. (See discussion under Title III and V Non-Federal Share Requirement Waiver for the FSEOG and FWS Programs June 2018 Federal share of Perkins Federal funds allocated to a school in an award year under the Federal Perkins Loan Program were called the Federal Capital Contribution (FCC), and the matching share was called the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC). Congress did not authorized new FCC after the 2004-2005 award year, and will not since the authority to make new Perkins Loan has expired. Federal share of FSEOG In general, the federal share of FSEOG awards made to students may not exceed 75% of the total FSEOG awards made by the school. The federal share can be 100% for a school designated as an eligible institution under Title III or Title V of the HEA. (See the discussion under Title III and V Non-Federal Share Requirement Waiver for the FSEOG and FWS Programs later in this chapter.)CFR of FWS The nonfederal share of a student's FWS wages must be at least 25% each award year, except as noted in the previous section. Your school may use any resource available to pay its share of FWS compensation except federal funds allocated under the FWS Program (or any other program funds where this use is prohibited). The school's share may come from its own funds, from outside funds (such as from an off-campus agency), or from both. However, if a student is employed by a private, for-profit organization, that organization must provide the nonfederal share. Your school may also pay the institutional share with noncash contributions. If the school's noncash contribution is less than the remaining 25%, the school must make up the difference in cash. Funds from programs sponsored by federal agencies (such as the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health) may be used to pay the nonfederal share, as long as the programs have the authority to pay student wages. A school should contact the appropriate federal agency to see if the program in question does have this authority. Nonfederal share of FSEOG The school must ensure there is a nonfederal match of 25% of the total FSEOG awards. The nonfederal share of FSEOGs must be made from the school's own resources. These resources may include institutional scholarships and grants; waivers of tuition or fees; the nonfederal portion of state scholarships and grants; and funds from foundations or other charitable organizations. The nonfederal share requirement is 25% of awards to students. In the following discussion of these methods, you should note that for a student to meet the definition of an FSEOG recipient, some portion of the grant awarded the student must have come from the FSEOG federal dollars. Note that the federal share can be 100% for a school designated as an eligible institution under Title III or Title V of the HEA. (See the discussion under Title III and V Non-Federal Share Requirement Waiver for the FSEOG and FWS Programs later in this chapter.) The HEA provides that the Federal share of awards made to students under the FSEOG Program may not exceed 75%. The 25% nonfederal share of FSEOG awards must come from an institution's own resources, including institutional scholarships and grants, tuition or fee waivers, state scholarships and grants, and foundation or other charitable organization funds. Nonfederal share of FWS 34 CFR 675.27 Nonfederal Greater than Minimum Nonfederal Share of FWS An employer can choose to contribute more than the minimum required nonfederal share. For example, if a school has a large demand for FWS jobs from its various departments, it may contribute more than the usual 25% to allow for additional employment. However, schools should not report any contributions over the 25% requirement on the FISAP. Use of State Grants in FSEOG Matching All state scholarships and grants (including state vocational rehabilitation grants) are eligible funds that may be used to meet the nonfederal share requirement for the FSEOG Program. Note that if a state grant includes any federal funds, those federal funds may not be included in the match.CFR 2018 By the time the FSEOGs are disbursed (regardless of when in the award period the disbursements are made), the required match must have been accomplished; that is, the school's own resources must have been disbursed before or at the time the federal dollars are disbursed. However, outside resources (such as state grants, foundation, or other charitable organization funds) can be used to match FSEOGs even if the funds are received at a later date, provided that the school has written information about funds that the noninstitutional agency or organization is awarding to the student involved. The written information must be kept on file at the school. Types of nonfederal FSEOG matching Individual recipient basis The school ensures that the nonfederal match is made to each individual FSEOG recipient together with the federal share in such a way that every student's FSEOG award consists of 75% federal funds and 25% qualified nonfederal funds. A school using this method calculates and documents on a student-by-student basis what portion of the student's FSEOG award comes from federal funds and what portion comes from nonfederal funds. Note that for the purpose of a Return of Title IV Funds calculation, only 75% of the funds are considered federal funds when a school uses this method of matching. Aggregate basis The school ensures that the sum of all funds awarded to all FSEOG recipients in a given award year consists of 75% federal dollars and 25% qualified nonfederal funds. A school using this method calculates and documents on an aggregate basis what portion of total federal and qualified nonfederal funds awarded to all FSEOG recipients comes from federal funds and what portion comes from nonfederal funds. For example, if a school awards a total of $60,000 to all FSEOG recipients in an award year, it must ensure that $45,000 comes from federally allocated funds and $15,000 comes from nonfederal funds. The school may meet this requirement by awarding qualified nonfederal funds to FSEOG recipients on a student-specific basis. For example, if the school makes a total of $60,000 in FSEOG awards to a total of 100 students, the entire nonfederal share may be met by awarding a total of $15,000 in nonfederal resources to only five FSEOG recipients. However, each of the 100 FSEOG recipients must receive some FSEOG federal funds. Note that for the purpose of a Return of Title IV Funds calculation, only 75% of the funds are considered federal funds when a school uses this method of matching.CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-21FSA HB June 2018 Fund-specific basis The school establishes an FSEOG account for federal program funds and deposits the required 25% qualified nonfederal matching share into the fund. The matching funds must be deposited at the same time the federal funds are deposited. Awards to FSEOG recipients are then made from this mixed fund. Schools using the fund-specific method must deposit their institutional match at the time they receive the federal share funds. For the purpose of a Return of Title IV funds calculation, 100% of the funds are considered federal funds when a school uses this method of matching. Nonfederal share of Perkins The nonfederal share that was required from the school's own funds for the Federal Perkins Loan Program was called the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC). Title III and V Nonfederal Share Requirement Waiver for the FSEOG and FWS programs Certain schools are eligible for a waiver of the nonfederal share requirements under 34 CFR 675.26(d) of the FWS regulations and 34 CFR 676.21(b) of the FSEOG regulations. To receive a waiver of the FWS and FSEOG nonfederal share requirement, the school must be designated by the Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education Institutional Service (OPE/IS) as an eligible Title III or Title V institution under the HEA. These waivers are granted for the year immediately following the year in which the institution receives the Title III or Title V designation. To qualify for a Title III or Title V waiver of the nonfederal share requirement, an institution (one having a unique six-digit OPEID with a two-digit extension of \"00\") must submit its own FISAP and qualify for Title III or V designation under its own OPEID. Note : Although an institution is granted a waiver, it may choose to continue providing an institutional share and to determine the amount of that share for one or both of the programs. It is important to note that the 50% federal share limitation for FWS wages paid to students employed by a private, for-profit organization and the 80% federal share limitation for the administration of the JLD Program are not waived under the Title III or Title V designations. The institutional share requirements for these two categories of FWS expenditures are never June 2018 Designation as an eligible institution for Title III or Title V programs The Department's Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) has instituted a process known as the Eligibility Matrix (EM) under which institutional data submitted to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is used to determine which institutions meet the basic eligibility requirements for programs authorized by Title III and/ or Title V of the HEA. OPE will review eligibility annually and make the information available on the OPE/IS website at https://hepis.ed.gov/title3and5/ Institutions that find they are ineligible for a Title III or Title V program have the option to complete the Application for Designation as an Eligible Institution by the deadline, and submit any additional documentation as requested by OPE for reconsideration. Institutions that do not appear in the EM as being eligible for a Title III or Title V program may apply for a waiver with OPE to be reconsidered. Availability of the EM and the Application for Designation as an Eligible Institution are published each winter in an EA on the Information for Financial Aid Professionals (IFAP) website at ifap.eg.gov/ifap/ , once the Federal Register notice and application deadline is posted on the OPE/IS website. Institutions currently receiving funding under a Title III or Title V grant A school that receives grant funding under Title III or Title V is eligible for the FWS and/or FSEOG nonfederal share waiver for the entire duration of its grant. In the event that the school does not appear on the EM as an eligible institution but is receiving a grant for the year in question, the school is not required to complete the Application for Designation as an Eligible Institution in order to receive the nonfederal share waiver as long as its grant funding can be verified by OPE. Questions About Title III or V Eligibility If you have questions about your school's eligibility for Title III or Title V, contact U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education Institutional Service 400 Maryland Avenue Washington, DC 20202 Christopher Smith Email: available on the OPE/ IS website: www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/ idues/eligibility.html General electronic announcements will be posted to IFAP regarding the Title III or Title IV process.

HBCUs and TCCUs automatically qualify for the nonfederal share waiver each year as long as the school maintains this designation. The Department will send an email to the financial aid administrator of the Title III or Title V designated school in early spring indicating that the nonfederal share waiver has been granted for the upcoming award year. ADMINISTRATIVE COST ALLOWANCE (ACA) A school participating in the Campus-Based Programs is entitled to an ACA for an award year if it provides employment under the FWS Program, or awards grants under the FSEOG Program to students in an award year. The ACA may be used to help offset administrative costs, such as salaries, furniture, travel, supplies, and equipment. The ACA can also be used for service fees that banks charge for maintaining accounts. Schools may use the allowance to help pay the costs of administering not only the Campus-Based Programs but the Federal Pell Grant Program as well. Administrative costs also cover expenses for carrying out the student consumer information services requirements. Schools are NOT permitted to claim an ACA for the Perkins Loan Program. The amount of the ACA is calculated as a percentage of the school's expenditures to students for an award year under the Campus-Based Programs. 5% of the first $2,750,000 of a school's Campus-Based expenditures to students + 4% of Campus-Based expenditures greater than $2,750,000 but less than $5,500,000 + 3% of Campus-Based expenditures greater than $5,000,000ACA calculation 34 CFR 673.7Reporting ACA on the FISAP Remember to report all ACA drawn for the award year on the FISAP prior to the December 15 deadline to submit FISAP corrections. No increases or additional claims to ACA will be permitted after that 2018 When a school calculates its ACA for the award year, the school is to include in its calculation the full amount of its FSEOG awards\u2014both the 75% federal share and the required 25% nonfederal share. However, a school that chooses to provide more than a 25% institutional share to FSEOG recipients may not include an FSEOG institutional share in excess of 25% in its FISAP or in the calculation of its ACA. If a school makes no match after receiving a waiver of its required institutional share for the FSEOG Program or the FWS Program, that school's ACA may be calculated only on the full federal portion of its awards for those programs. The school takes the ACA out of the annual authorizations the school receives for the FSEOG and FWS programs. It is not a separate allowance sent to the school. A school may draw its allowance from any combination of Campus-Based Programs, or it may take the total allowance from only one program, provided there are sufficient funds in that program. However, a school may not draw any part of its allowance from a Campus-Based Program unless the school has disbursed funds to students from that program during the award year. Since schools are no longer making Perkins loans, they may not request a Perkins ACA. Your school may use up to 10% of the ACA, as calculated previously, as attributable to its expenditures under the FWS Program to pay the administrative costs of conducting its program of community service. These costs may include developing mechanisms to assure the academic quality of a stu - dent's experience; assuring student access to educational resources, expertise, and supervision necessary to achieve community service objectives; and collaborating with public and private nonprofit agencies and programs assisted under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 in the planning, development, and administration of these programs. A school may choose not to claim an ACA so that all the funds can be used for student awards. CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-25FSA HB June 2018 FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS The general principle for all Campus-Based Programs is that the amount of funds available for awards is the federal share, plus the institutional match (unless otherwise waived), minus the ACA if the school chooses to claim ACA. No FSA grant, loan, or work assistance (or property traceable to that assistance) is subject to garnishment or attachment except to satisfy a debt owed to the Department. PROJECTING NEED The maximum amount of federal funds a school may draw down from each Campus-Based Program is based on the school's initial allocation and supplemental allocation for that program, as reported to the school in its Final Funding Authorization from ED. Unless a nonfederal share requirement waiver has been granted, each Campus-Based Program requires that awards made to students be a combination of both federal and nonfederal funds. To accurately determine immediate cash need for Campus-Based Programs, you must calculate the portion of disbursements from each program that may be made up of federal funds, including funds carried forward. The amount of funds drawn down represents the federal share only. You must deposit institutional matching funds at the time the federal funds are deposited into the account from which Campus-Based awards will be made. A school on the advance payment method must determine the amount of funds it needs before it transmits a request to draw down those funds through G5 payment system. The amount requested must be limited to the minimum amount needed to make disbursements, so excess funds do not exist after disbursements are made. For the Campus- Based Programs, the amount must be enough to meet the federal share of Campus-Based disbursements and the ACA when applicable. The following equation may be used to calculate projected immediate needs: A school should not draw down funds that exceed its immediate need. Anticipated Disbursements minus Balance of Cash on Hand minus Anticipated Recoveries minus ACH/EFT Cash in Transit equals Projected, Immediate FSEOG In the FSEOG Program, a school must time its drawdowns to coincide with the date it expects to disburse FSEOG funds to students. A school may draw down only the federal share of the FSEOG awards it will disburse to students within three business days of receiving the funds. FWS A school must time its FWS drawdowns to coincide with its payroll dates. A school must calculate the amount of federal funds needed to meet FWS payroll for a given pay period and draw down only the appropriate federal share of wages to be paid. Student wages must be paid within three business days of the date federal funds are received. Timing issues When a school initiates a drawdown from G5, a school should consider that processing requests within G5 typically takes one to three business days and whether the school is using ACH/EFT or FEDWIRE. Schools should also be aware of system downtime, federal holidays, and other delays in processing cash requests when determining immediate need.Deadline for making ACA accounting entries Campus-Based Program ACA accounting entries must be posted no later than June 30 of the award year for which expenditures for those costs were made. 34 CFR 673.7(g), June 2018 DRAWING DOWN FUNDS Schools use the G5 system to draw down Campus-Based funds. To begin drawing down funds, log in to G5 using the new two-factor authentication system. On the top panel, hover your cursor over the word Payments . From the options that appear, select Create Payments . The payment requests screen allows you to create, modify, and view payment requests. Once you have selected Create Payments, you will see a list of awards. The award(s) will populate with corresponding authorized and available balances from which drawdowns can be initiated. A school may use the Recipient Reference Field to identify the award type (i.e., FWS, FSEOG, etc.). An important step in creating payment requests is setting the Deposit Date. The default deposit date displayed is based on the method the school has selected for receiving funds (ED's transmission method). The default date assumes that you are going to disburse the funds within three business days of the deposit date. However, you may set a deposit date that is up to 30 days after the current date. For ACH payments, the default deposit date is the next business day if received prior to 3 p.m. Eastern time (ET), or two business days later if submitted after 3 p.m. For payments by FEDWIRE, the default deposit date is the current date if the request is submitted before 2 p.m. ET, or the next day if submitted after 2 p.m. After entering the request amount, click Continue . If you agree to the certification statement on the next screen, you will click Submit on the next page to complete the payment request. After you have created payment requests, G5 performs validations. If the G5 system encounters a problem, the payment will not post and you will be notified by email. If there's a problem with your request, you should contact the G5 Hotline for help in resolving U.S. Office of Management and Budget has mandated that all federal agencies implement increased cybersecurity capabilities to prevent unauthorized access to government systems. The U.S. Department of Education is implementing a more secure means for users of the G5 Grants Administration System to gain access, referred to as Two-factor Authentication (TFA). TFA is a security process in which the user provides two means of identification from separate categories of credentials. One is typically something that you know, such as a password; and the other is something that you have, such as a security code you download from your mobile device. The combination of these two security factors makes it more difficult for an unauthorized individual to gain access to government systems. Once both the first and second factors are validated, users are allowed into the G5 system. TFA was rolled out to G5 users in groups starting in mid-April 2016 and extending through the end of June 2016. You can find training on TFA at www. G5.gov under the HELP menu. You do not need to be a registered user to access the training materials. If you have any questions, please contact the G5 Hotline using one of the options below: Phone number: 1-888-336-8930 Email: edcaps.user@ed.gov Go to June 2018 Potential errors include but are not limited to deposit date that is not in the required format (MM/DD/YY); deposit date that is more than 30 days from the current date; deposit date that is earlier than the default date for the method of transmission selected in Pay By field; deposit date that is earlier than the award start date, or later than the last date to draw funds; request that is non-numeric or negative; request in which all fields are zero; and request that exceeds the available balance displayed in the available balance field. If no errors are encountered, G5 displays a confirmation window, to ensure that the user intends to submit the information. You must click Yes to certify that the funds will be expended within three business days for the purpose and condition of the grant. Once you have completed the process, you will receive an email confirming your payment request has been accepted.CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-29FSA HB June 2018 CAMPUS-BASED RECORDKEEPING A school must follow the recordkeeping requirements in the General Provisions (discussed in Volume 2 ) and those specific to the Campus- Based Programs. A school must keep financial records that reflect all Campus-Based Program transactions and must keep all records supporting the school's application for Campus-Based funds. This documentation includes the applications and records of all students who applied for Campus-Based assistance for a specific award year and were included on the school's FISAP for that award year. The school must also retain applications and records of students who applied for but did not receive aid, either because the school had no more funds to award or because the school determined that the student did not need funds. The school must keep general ledger control accounts and related accounts that identify each program transaction and must separate those transactions from all other institutional financial activity. Fiscal records must be reconciled at least monthly. The Campus-Based records a school must maintain include but are not limited to the Student Aid Report (SAR) or Institutional Student Infor - mation Record (ISIR) used to determine a student's eligibility for Campus-Based Program funds; application data submitted to the Department or the school on behalf of the student; documentation of the payment of any return of Title IV funds or overpayment to the FSA program fund or the Department; documentation of the amount of a Perkins Loan, FSEOG or FWS award; its payment period; and the calculations used to determine the amount of the loan, grant, or FWS award; documentation of each FSEOG or Perkins Loan disbursement and the date and amount of each payment of FWS wages; documentation of the school's calculation of any refunds or overpayments due to, or on behalf of, the student and the amount, date, and basis of the school's calculation; information collected at initial and exit loan counseling re - quired by Perkins Loan regulations; and reports and forms used by the school in its participation in a Campus-Based Program and any records needed to verify data that appear in those reports and forms.Retention of records General Provisions 34 CFR 668.24 2018 FSEOG recordkeeping In addition to following the fiscal procedures and records requirements mentioned earlier and in Volume 2, a school must meet the following requirements, which are included in the FSEOG regulations: A school must establish and maintain an internal control system of checks and balances that ensures that no office can both autho - rize FSEOG payments and disburse FSEOG funds to students. A school must establish and maintain program and fiscal records that are reconciled at least monthly. Each year, a school must submit a FISAP and other informa - tion the Department requires. The information must be accurate and must be provided on the form and at the time specified by the Department. FWS recordkeeping For schools administering FWS, you must also follow the procedures established in 34 CFR 675.19 for documenting a student's FWS work, earnings, and payroll transactions. You must establish and maintain an internal control system of checks and balances that ensures that no office can both authorize FWS payments and disburse FWS funds to students. If you use a fiscal agent for FWS funds, that agent may perform only ministerial acts. In school records, schools must distinguish expenditures for FWS compensation from other institutional expenditures. You should enter FWS compensation on a separate voucher or, if listed on the general payroll voucher, you should group FWS compensation separately from other compensation. If payrolls are handled on automatic data processing equipment, you should identify FWS with a special code. You must establish and maintain program and fiscal records that are reconciled at least monthly. The records must include a payroll voucher containing sufficient information to support all payroll disbursements; noncash contribution record to document any payment of the school's share of the student's earnings in the form of services and equipment; and certification by the student's supervisor (an employee of the school or off-campus agency) that each student has worked and earned the amount being paid. Y our school may use an electronic certification process. The school may still continue to have the FWS student's supervisor sign a paper certification. If the students are paid on an hourly basis, the certification must include or be supported by a time record showing the hours each student worked in clock time sequence or the total hours worked per day (see sidebar).Perkins Recordkeeping Perkins recordkeeping requirements are covered in Chapter 3 of this volume. Electronic Certification for FWS A school that uses an electronic certification must adopt reasonable safeguards against possible fraud and abuse. The school should provide a secure electronic certification through an electronic payroll system that includes password protection; password changes at set intervals; access revocation for unsuccessful logins; user identification and entry-point tracking; random audit surveys with supervisors; and security tests of the code access. See Volume 2 for more information about recordkeeping, privacy safeguards, and information security.CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-31FSA HB June 2018 RECORD RETENTION AND FORMATS Availability of records and period of retention Your school must make its records readily available for review by the Department or its authorized representative at an institutional location the Department or its representative designates. Generally, a school must keep records relating to the school's administration of a Campus-Based Program for three years after the end of an award year for which the aid was awarded and disbursed under that program. There are some exceptions to this requirement: The school must retain the FISAP containing reported expenditures and any records necessary to support the data contained in the FISAP , including \"income grid information, \" for three years after the end of the award year in which the FISAP is submitted. The school must keep the original signed promissory note and repayment schedule until all loans made on the promissory note or Master Promissory Note (MPN) are satisfied , accepted for assignment by the Department, or until the origi - nal note or MPN is needed to enforce loan collection . Only authorized personnel may have access to these records. If a promissory note or MPN was signed electronically, you must store it electronically for at least three years after all loans made on the promissory note or MPN are satisfied. (The Department recommends that the school maintain a certified copy of the signed promissory note, as well as a record of the full amount owed, in its records beyond the three-year record retention requirement.) Y ou must ensure that the promissory note or MPN can be retrieved in a coherent format. The school must keep repayment records for Perkins Loans, including records relating to cancellation and deferment requests, for at least three years from the date a loan is repaid, cancelled, or assigned to the Department. If a loan is assigned to the Department due to total and permanent disability, the school must retain any loan-related documentation that it does not submit for at least three years from the date the loan is assigned . In some instances, the Department may require schools to provide copies of repayment records, cancellation records, or deferment requests in order for the loan to be accepted for assignment. Records questioned in an audit or program review must be kept for three years after the end of the program year in which the program review or audit was finalized. Records readily available for review 34 CFR June 2018 Record formats, storage, etc. A school must keep its Campus-Based Program records in one of the following formats: The school must retain the original signed promissory notes and signed repayment schedules for Perkins Loans in a locked fireproof container. If a loan is assigned to ED, the school should keep copies of all the original documenta - tion submitted to the Department with the assignment. The school may not maintain only computer generated form(s) or microform(s). A school may keep other required records in hard copy or in microform, computer file, optical disk, CD-ROM, or other media formats, but all record information must be retrievable in a coherent hard copy format or in other media formats acceptable to the Department except that any document that contains a signature, seal, certification, or any other image or mark required to validate the authenticity of its information must be kept in its original hard copy or in an imaged media format. Any imaged media format used to keep required records must be capable of reproducing an accurate, legible, and complete copy of the original document, and, when printed, this copy must be approximately the same size as the original. THE FISCAL OPERATIONS REPORT The Fiscal Operations Report ( aka FISOP) is parts III, IV, V, and VI of the FISAP. If you participated in any Campus-Based Programs in an award year, you must report on your activities for those programs by completing the appropriate portions of the FISAP by the next filing deadline. Part III applies to the Perkins Loan Program. Part IV applies to the FSEOG Program. Part V applies to the FWS Program. Part VI applies to all of the Campus-Based Programs. In each program section, you will report how much of your school's total federal allocation was used and how much remained unexpended at the end of the award year. (Your school's unexpended authorization is equal to its final adjusted authorization amount minus its total expended authorization.) If this amount is a positive dollar figure, the amount of unexpended funds will be deducted from your school's G5 grantee account. You may not make negative entries on the FISAP.FISAP documents You can access all FISAP references at ifap.ed.gov/ifap/cbp.jsp.NEWCFR June 2018 FISAP \u2014Part III, the Federal Perkins Loan section You must complete Part III, if your school is continuing to service its loans in the Federal Perkins Loan Program; made Federal Perkins Loans to students during the recent award year; is liquidating its Federal Perkins Loan portfolio. (Y ou must do so every year until your final report shows that all outstand - ing loans have been assigned, fully retired, or purchased and that the federal share of cash on hand has been returned to ED and you have received the official liquidation completion letter from ED.) The Federal Perkins Loan section of the FISAP consists of the following sections: Section A is a historical/cumulative report of your school's Federal Perkins Loan fund activity from the beginning of the program through the end of the most recent award year. This section is the balance sheet for your Federal Perkins Loan fund, and it must balance. Section B is a report of the Federal Perkins Loan activity that took place at your school during the recently completed award year. Section C is a report of your school's cumulative repayment information as of the end of the reporting year. This summary includes all data from your school's initial participation in the program through the recently completed award year. In Section C you report the status of all borrowers as of June 30 of the reporting year. What you report in this section must match what your school has reported to the Department's National Student Loan Database (NSLDS) system. If the data does not match you must reconcile the data and correct all discrepancies. Note: Schools are required to report updated data on existing loans to NSLDS once a month on a schedule established by ED. Schools are encouraged to reconcile their entire loan portfolio at least twice a year.FISAP Campus-Based Programs 34 CFR 673.3 Requirement The FISAP must be signed by the person designated as the CEO in your school's Program Participation Agreement (PPA). With their signature, they are certifying the information submitted on the FISAP is true and accurate; no one managing the programs has been debarred or suspended; the school is a drug-free work place; and no federal funds are spent on lobbying June 2018 Sections D and E are used to calculate your school's cohort default rate. Y ou complete Section D if your school had 30 or more borrowers who entered repayment during the award year. Y ou complete Section E if your school had fewer than 30 or more borrowers enter repayment during the award year. For FISAP purposes, a cohort is defined as a group of borrowers that went into repayment during a particular year. The cohort moves up one year with each FISAP. Of the borrowers that went into repayment during the rel - evant year, the school reports how many were in default at the end of the following year. Schools that had fewer than 30 borrowers going into repayment use a three- year cohort.CFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-35FSA HB June 2018 FISAP\u2014Part IV, the FSEOG section Your school must complete Part IV if it received FSEOG Program funds during the most recent award year. The five sections in this part of the FISAP summarize your school's use of FSEOG funds during the previous year. The data you report in this section is used to determine underuse penalties in FSEOG; account for funds transferred across programs and across years during the reporting year; monitor the program (e.g., validate expenditure and balance totals by using the G5 \" Award History Report\"); and conduct year end close out of the FSEOG program funds. Matching requirement Remember, unless your school has a waiver of its nonfederal matching requirement, your school is required to contribute an additional amount equal to 25% of the awards to students, from your school's own resources. ( A school may choose to provide an additional institutional contribution from its own resources regardless of the waiver. ) So, unless your school has a matching waiver, when you report the total amount of FSEOG funds paid to recipients, the amount must include a nonfederal share of at least 25%. (See EA 2011-04-29 and the discussion earlier in this chapter under Nonfederal share of FSEOG.) Note: Any funds recovered on prior year awards should be returned to ED using existing G5 refund procedures. Refunds should be applied to the award corresponding to the funding year the recovered funds were awarded. In field 17, your school reports the expended FSEOG authorization. This amount must agree with the final FSEOG expenditures reported in FISAP\u2014Part V, the FWS section Your school must complete Part V if it received FWS Program funds during the most recent award year. The nine sections in this part of the FISAP summarize your school's use of FWS funds during the previous year. The data you report in this section is used to provide data for underuse penalties; account for and close out funds awarded in FWS for the Fiscal Operations Report year; monitor the program (e.g., validate expenditure and balance totals by using the G5 \" Award History Report\"); report program transfers made during the year; and provide data for community service requirements. When completing this section, it's important to remember that The institutional share includes amounts contributed by off-campus employers in addition to amounts contributed by the school itself. The amount reported should not include institutional expenditures for non-FWS employment. If your school has a Title III/V waiver, you will report this share as zero, unless your school chose to provide an institutional contribution. Any amount that your school spends for reading tutors of chil - dren/family literacy programs does not have to be matched. Note: In Section E of this part, you will report how much of your school's total federal FWS allocation was used and how much remained unexpended at the end of the award year. (Your school's unexpended FWS authorization is equal to its final adjusted FWS authorization amount minus its total expended FWS authorization.) If this amount is a positive dollar figure, the amount of unexpended FWS funds will be deducted from your school's G5 grantee account. You may not make negative entries on the FISAP.If the nonfederal share of student compensation was paid in kind (for example, as a tuition waiver or room and board), the in-kind compensation value must be converted to a cash amount and reported in this section of the FISAP as part of your matching funds. ReminderTIPCFR Glossary DCLChapter 1\u2014Campus-Based Programs Common Elements6-37FSA HB June 2018 FISAP\u2014Part VI, the Program Summary Your school must complete Section A of the Part VI, if your school made any awards to students from any Federal Campus-Based Program during the most recent award year. This data is used to provide statistical data for analysis. In Section A, you report these expenditures by \"Income Category\" and by \"Student Type.\" In Section B, an amount is calculated for the ACA your school can claim on the basis of its total Campus-Based Program expenditures, as reported in parts III, IV and V of the FISAP. FREQUENCY AND AMOUNT OF FSEOG DISBURSEMENTS If a student is awarded an FSEOG, you must pay the student a portion of this award in each payment period, even if you do not use standard academic terms. Within a payment period, a school may advance funds in whatever installments it determines will best meet the student's need. To determine the amount of each payment period's FSEOG disbursement, divide the total FSEOG award amount by the number of payment periods you expect the student to be enrolled. For a school that measures progress in credit hours and academic terms, a payment period is defined as a term (semester, trimester, quarter). The definition of a payment period for a school that does not have academic terms or a school that measures progress in clock hours is discussed in more detail in Volume 3 . Uneven costs/unequal disbursements If the student incurs uneven costs or receives uneven resources during the year and needs extra funds in a particular payment period, you may make unequal FSEOG disbursements. FSEOG Total Award Number of Payment Periods Payment CFR 676.16(a) Uneven costs/uneven payments 34 CFR 676.16(b) FSEOG Withdrawal and Return of Title IV Funds If a student ceases attendance after receiving a lump sum FSEOG payment (of less than $501, or after receiving a disbursement in a second payment period that includes funds for the previous period), only that portion of the FSEOG intended for the payment period in which the student was attending class should be included in the Return calculation. Payment periods 34 CFR 668.4 Single-Term FSEOG Awards A single-term FSEOG award is permissible if a student will only be enrolled for one term or only one term remains in the award year when the award is made. Moreover, the award would then be disbursed in a single disbursement. When the regulations were revised to prohibit a single disbursement for an FSEOG award of $501 or less, they did not prohibit single term awards. Fiscal procedures and records 34 CFR 676.19INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FSEOG PROGRAM\u2014 RECONCILIATION, FISCAL, AND PROGRAM RECORDS Your school must reconcile, at least monthly, your FSEOG draws recorded in G5 to the funds received in the bank account your school has designated to receive electro nic transfers. You must also reconcile monthly the amount drawn down and received to the amounts disbursed to students or returned to ED, and resolve all dis crepancies. In addition, you should examine your FSEOG program and fiscal records monthly. Did the fiscal records on which you based your anticipated need for FSEOG funds accurately predict your disbursements, or are you returning unused funds? Were your matching funds deposited at the same time you received your federal share? CFR Glossary DCLThis chapter covers issues specific to operating a Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, including Community Service, Job Location and Development (JLD), and Work-College programs. For student eligibility criteria relating to Campus-Based Programs, including FWS, refer to Volume 1. For information on selecting Campus-Based recipients, and calculating and packaging Campus-Based awards, see Volume JOBS AND EMPLOYERS A student may be employed under the FWS program by the school in which the student is enrolled (on campus). You may also arrange for your school's FWS recipients to be employed off campus by federal, state, or local public agencies; or certain private nonprofit or for-profit organizations. Off-campus FWS jobs with federal, state, or local public agencies or private nonprofit organizations must be in the public interest. Off-campus FWS jobs with private, for-profit organizations must be academically relevant to the maximum extent possible. Your school must use at least 7% of its FWS allocation to employ students in community service jobs with at least one FWS student employed as a reading tutor for children in a reading tutoring project or performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project. A school must make FWS jobs reasonably available to all eligible students at the school. To the maximum extent practicable, a school must provide FWS jobs that complement and reinforce each recipient's educational program or career goals. In assigning an FWS job, a school must consider the student's financial need, the number of hours per week the student can work, the period of employment, the anticipated wage rate, and the amount of other assistance available to the student. While there is no minimum or maximum award, the amount for each student should be determined based on these factors.Student eligibility for FWS 34 CFR AND NONFEDERAL SHARE OF WAGES In general, the federal share of FWS wages paid to a student may not exceed 75%. The 75% applies to expenditures for FWS wages and does not include any administrative cost allowance. Schools must provide at least 25% of a student's total FWS wages from nonfederal sources. For example, if a school wanted to spend $45,000 of its FWS federal funds for student wages, it would be required to provide at least $15,000 in non - federal funds. A total of $60,000 would then be available to pay student wages under the school's FWS Program. There are situations when the ratio of federal share to nonfederal share of 75% to 25% does not apply: Any school may provide more than the required minimum 25% nonfederal share. For example, if a school received $60,000 in federal funds and wished to spend a total of $100,000 for student FWS wages, it could spend $40,000 of nonfederal funds to do so. In this example, the federal share of students' total earned compensation under the FWS program expenditures would be 60%, while the nonfederal share would be 40%. For off-campus FWS jobs with private for-profit organizations, the federal share of wages paid to students is limited to 50%. The for-profit organization must provide a nonfederal share of at least 50%. The employer may contribute a nonfederal share that exceeds the required 50%. However, a school may use no more than 25% of its total current year initial allocations to pay wages to students employed with private for-profit organizations. The federal share of compensation paid to students may be 100% when 1. the student is employed as a reading or mathematics tutor for preschool age children or children who are in elementary school; or 2. the student is performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project that provides services to families with preschool age children or children who are in elementary school; or FWS federal share 34 CFR 675.26 for-profit organizations 34 share is CFR 675.26(a)(2) of institutional share and noncash contributions 34 CFR 675.16(e) TIP Community Service vs. Reading Tutors In order to be considered community service, the job has to be in an area that is open, accessible, and used by the community at large. Community service includes a whole host of jobs and is not limited to reading tutors. On the other hand, reading tutors may provide tutoring to some group that would not be considered part of the community. For example, a school population is not considered \"open, accessible, and used by the community at large,\" and therefore, in this context, is not considered a community. TIPChapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-41FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL 3. the student is employed in community service activities and is performing civic education and participation activities in a project as defined in 34 CFR 675.18(g)(4). The federal share can be as much as 90% (and the nonfederal share can be as little as 10%) for students employed at a private nonprofit organization or at a federal, state, or local public organization or agency under specific circumstances. Only organizations that are unable to afford the cost of this employment are eligible to pay a reduced nonfederal share. In addition, the school may not own, operate, or control the organization, and the school must select the organization or agency on a case-by-case basis. No more than 10% of a school's FWS students may benefit from this provision. The federal share of FWS wages paid to a student may be lower than 75% if the employer chooses to contribute more than the minimum required nonfederal share. For example, if a school has a large demand for FWS jobs from its various departments, it may contribute more than the usual 25% to allow for addi - tional employment. The federal share can be 100% for all FWS positions (except for those at private, for-profit organizations) at a school that is designated as a Title III or Title V eligible school as described under Title III and V Non-Federal Share Requirement Waiver for the FSEOG and FWS Programs in Chapter 1 . Note: The federal share of allowable costs in carrying out the JLD Program described later in this chapter may not exceed 80% of such A school can pay the nonfederal share from its own funds or other nonfederal sources such as outside funds from an off-campus employer. The school can also pay the nonfederal share in the form of documented noncash contributions of services and equipment such as tuition and fees, room and board, books, and supplies documented by accounting entries. When matching with cash, the school must deposit its share at the same time it receives the federal share. A school does not need the student's permission when making the match with services and/or equipment. A school paying in cash and crediting the student's account with a portion of the student's pay to cover institutional charges may not credit the student's account with FWS earnings without the student's permission. If a school receives more money under an employment agreement with an off-campus agency than the sum of (1) required employer costs, (2) the school's nonfederal share, and (3) any share of administrative costs the employer agreed to pay, the school must handle the excess in one of three ways: 1. Use it to reduce the federal share on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 2. Hold it in trust for off-campus employment during the next award year. 3. Refund it to the off-campus employer. Funds from programs sponsored by federal agencies (such as the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health) may be used to pay the nonfederal share, as long as the programs have the authority to pay student wages. A school should contact the appropriate federal agency to see if the program in question does have this authority.Nature and source of institutional share 34 CFR CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND LIMITATIONS All FWS work, whether on campus or off campus, has certain conditions and limitations. FWS employment must be governed by those employment conditions, including the rate of pay, that are appropriate and reasonable according to the type of work performed, the geographic region, the employee's proficiency, and any applicable federal, state, or local law, including state or locally established minimum wage rates. FWS employment must not displace employees (including those on strike) or impair existing service contracts. Also, if the school has an em - ployment agreement with an organization in the private sector, the orga - nization's employees must not be replaced with FWS students. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Therefore, replacing a full-time employee whose position was eliminated (for any reason) with a student employee paid with FWS funds is prohibited. Moreover, this prohibition extends to instances where a school first replaces the full-time employee with a student position paid with college funds. FWS positions must not involve constructing, operating, or maintaining any part of a building used for religious worship or sectarian instruction. In determining whether any FWS employment will violate this restriction, a school should consider the purpose of the part of the facility in which the work will take place and the nature of the work to be performed. For example, if the part of the facility in which the student will work is used for religious worship or sectarian instruction, the work cannot involve construction, operation, or maintenance respon - sibilities. If that part of the facility is not being used for religious worship or sectarian instruction, the school should make sure that any work the student will perform meets general employment conditions and that other limitations are not violated. Neither a school nor an outside employer that has an agreement with the school to hire FWS students may solicit, accept, or permit the soliciting of any fee, commission, contribution, or gift as a condition for a student's FWS employment. However, a student may pay union dues to an employer if they are a condition of employment and if the employer's non FWS employees must also pay dues. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, prohibits employers (including schools) from accepting voluntary services from any paid employee. Any student employed under FWS must be paid for all hours worked.Replacement prohibited 34 CFR 675.20(c)(2)(ii)Eligible employers 34 CFR 675.20(a) Employment conditions and limitations 34 CFR 675.20(c) Academic credit and work study 34 CFR 675.20(d) Fees or commissions prohibited 34 CFR 675.27(b) FWS minimum wage Dear Colleague Letter CB-96-23 FWS wage rates 34 CFR 675.24 Paying Overtime in FWS Although there is no prohibition on paying overtime in the FWS Program (for example, someone working on a stage crew may have to work overtime during a produc - tion), FWS is a program designed to pro - vide part-time employment, and students should not often work in excess of 40 hours in a single week. Overtime and payment for overtime hours may not be used in a way that create an overaward in the student's financial aid package.Working During Scheduled Class Time Is Prohibited In general, students are not permitted to work in FWS positions during scheduled class times. Exceptions are permitted if an individual class is cancelled, if the instructor has excused the student from attending for a particular day, and if the student is receiving credit for employment in an internship, externship, or community work- study experience. Any such exemptions must be documented. Volume Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-44 FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL A student may earn academic credit as well as compensation for FWS jobs. Such jobs include but are not limited to internships, practica, or assistantships (e.g., research or teaching assistantships). However, a student employed in an FWS job and receiving academic credit for that job may not be paid less than he or she would be if no academic credit were given; paid for receiving instruction in a classroom, laboratory, or other academic setting; and paid unless the employer would normally pay a person for the same job. Disasters\u2014Flexible Use of Funds An eligible school located in any area affected by a major disaster may make FWS payments to disas - ter-affected students for the period of time (not to exceed the award period) in which the students were prevented from fulfilling their FWS obligations. The FWS payments may be made to disaster-affected students1 for an amount equal to or less than the amount of FWS wages the students would have been paid had the students been able to complete the work obligation necessary to receive the funds; and must meet the FWS matching requirements described in Chapter 1 , unless those requirements are waived by the Department. FWS payments may not be made to a student who was ineligible for FWS, was not completing the work obligation necessary to receive the funds, or had already separated from the student's employ - ment prior to the occurrence of the major disaster. 34 CFR 675.18(i) The term \"major disaster\" means: any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mud - slide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which, in the determination of the President, causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby. \u2014Section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disas - ter Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42) U.S.C. 5122(2) 1. * Disaster-affected student \u2014a student enrolled at an institution who 1) received an FWS award for the award period dur - ing which a major disaster occurred; 2) earned FWS wages from an institution for that award period; 3) was prevented from fulfilling his or her FWS obligation for all or part of the FWS award period because of the major disaster; and 4) was unable to be reassigned to another FWS job.TIPChapter JOB DESCRIPTIONS Job descriptions for all FWS positions should be a part of the control procedures included in your school's policies and procedures manual. A written job description will help you ensure that the position is one that qualifies under the FWS program regulations. In addition, a writ - ten job description provides students with the information they need to determine whether they qualify for the job, whether the job is related to their educational or career objectives, and whether the job is of inter - est to them. Moreover, by considering the rates of pay applicable to the position, the qualifications for each pay level, and the qualifications of a student applicant, a financial aid administrator can determine the hours a student will need to work in order to earn the funds specified in the stu - dent's FWS award. Finally, a written job description establishes a record to which all parties can refer. In addition, a written job description can help avoid disagreements and adjudication and provide a reference in such cases. If a student is employed with an agency or organization that provides community services, the school should, as with any other FWS position, have a job description that includes the duties and the responsibilities. Schools should use the job description to verify that the job meets the definition of community services in the FWS regulations (see the discus - sion under Community Service Jobs later in this chapter). In addition, for students performing reading tutoring or family literacy activities, the job description should support those jobs. Each FWS position should have a job description that includes the name of the position; classification of the position (e.g., reading tutor 1, reading tutor 2, laboratory assistant, library technician 1 or 2, etc.); name and address of the student's employer (the school, public agency, nonprofit organization, etc.); department or office in which the student will be employed; location where the student will perform his/her duties; name of the student's supervisor; purpose or role of the position within the organization; duties and responsibilities associated with the position and how they relate to the purpose or role;Volume of pay for the position (cross-referenced to the wage rates appearing in the school's policies and procedures manual); general qualifications for the position and the specific qualifications for the various levels or rates of pay associated with the position; the length of the student's employment (beginning and ending dates); procedures for determining a student's rate of pay when a posi - tion has multiple rates; and evaluation procedures and schedules. ESTABLISHING WAGE RATES Undergraduate students are paid Federal Work-Study (FWS) wages on an hourly basis only . Graduate students may be paid by the hour or may be paid a salary. Regardless of who employs the student, the school is responsible for making sure the student is paid for work performed. A school should determine the number of hours a student is allowed to work based on the student's financial need and on how the combina - tion of work and study hours will affect the student's health and academic progress. There are no statutory or regulatory limits on the number of hours per week or per payment period a student may work, provided no overaward occurs. FWS employers must pay students at least the federal minimum wage in effect at the time of employment. If a state or local law requires a higher minimum wage, the school must pay the FWS student that higher wage. (See sidebar for link to federal and state information.) In addition, a school may not count fringe benefits as part of the wage rate and may not pay a student commissions or fees. In determining an appropriate rate, the school must consider the following: the skills needed to perform the job; how much persons with those skills are paid in the local area for doing the same type of job; rates the school would normally pay similar non-FWS employ - ees; and any applicable federal, state, or local laws that require a specific wage rate.Wage rates 34 CFR 675.24 Minimum wage information The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, effective July 24, 2009. The Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor posts information about federal and state minimum wage laws at: www.dol.gov/whd State and local minimum wage laws The pay must meet the requirements of the state or local law. This means that when the state or local law requires a higher minimum wage, the school must pay the FWS student that higher wage. However, if the state or local law allows a wage that is less than the federal minimum wage, the FWS student must be paid at least the federal minimum wage. Sub-minimum wages The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 established a sub-minimum, or training wage, that is lower than the minimum wage. However, it is not permissible to pay the sub - minimum wage rate to students in FWS jobs. Wages from Federal Agency The portion of the FWS wages contributed as the institutional share by a federal off- campus agency are not considered part of the \"federal share.\" Thus, a federal agency may provide the required share of stu - dent compensation normally paid by off- campus agencies plus any other employer costs that they agree to pay.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal student's need places a limit on the total FWS earnings permissible but has no bearing on his or her wage rate. It is not acceptable to base the wage rate on need or on any other factor not related to the student's skills or job description. If a student's skill level depends on his or her academic advancement, the school may pay a student on that basis. For example, a junior or third-year lab student may be paid a higher rate than a sophomore or second-year lab student. However, in most cases, students performing jobs comparable to those of other employees should be paid comparable wages, whether the other employees are students at different class levels or are regular employees. Federal share may not be used to provide fringe benefits The benefit of paid leave time is considered a fringe benefit and this benefit cannot be part of FWS compensation paid. A school is not permitted to use either the federal or the institutional share to provide fringe benefits such as sick leave, vacation pay, or holiday pay, or employer's contributions to Social Security, workers' compensation, retirement, or any other welfare or insurance program. These restrictions on the federal share apply even when the Department authorizes a federal share of 100% of FWS wages. A school is permitted, however, to pay fringe benefits from an account not related to FWS funds. must adequate timesheets or records of hours worked for FWS students. These timesheets must show, separately for each day worked, the hours a student worked, and the total hours worked during the job's payment cycle (i.e., twice a month, every week, every two weeks, etc., but not less than once a month). These amounts and hours recorded must match the hours for which the student is paid. FWS timesheets must be certified by the student's supervisor. Students working for your school must have their timesheets certified by either their supervisor or an official at the school. Students working in off-campus jobs must have their timesheets certified by an official at the off-campus site. If a school requires off-campus employers to maintain paper timesheets and the school allows those timesheets to be submitted by Fax, the off-campus employer must provide the original copies of those timesheets to the school . Original copies should be mailed or hand delivered to the school at the first opportunity. A school that uses electronic processes to record the hours worked by students must ensure that all signatures obtained in the certification of the hours worked satisfy the standards of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. For more information about using electronic processes in your school's administration of the Title IV pro - grams, please see the discussion under The E-sign Act and Information Security in Volume 1 . FWS records are used to compile the data submitted by schools on the Fiscal Operations Report section of the FISAP. Therefore, a school must maintain those original FWS records for as long as it is required to maintain its FISAP data.FWS timesheets and DCL PAYROLL VOUCHERS Your school must provide payroll vouchers that contain sufficient information to support all payroll disbursements. At a minimum, a school's payroll vouchers should include the school's name and address; identify the starting and ending dates of the payroll period; include the student's name; identify the student's work-study position; include the number of hours the student worked during the pay period; for undergraduate students, specify the student's hourly rate of pay; for a graduate student, identify the student's hourly rate of pay or the student's salary; include the student's gross earnings; itemize any compensation withheld for federal, state, county, or city taxes, and other deductions; include identification of any noncash payments made to the student for work during the period, and point to an auditable record of that contribution; include the student's net earnings; include a check number, duplicate receipt, or other auditable payment identification; and identify and itemize any overtime earnings (a student may be paid overtime with FWS A student's FWS compensation is earned when the student performs the work, and the school must pay the student that FWS compensation at least once a month. Regardless of who employs the student, the school is responsible for ensuring that the student is paid for work performed. Before a school may make an initial disbursement of FWS compensa - tion to a student for an award period, the school must notify the student of the total amount of FWS funds the student is authorized to earn, and how and when the FWS compensation will be paid. Except when a school's institutional share is paid from noncash sources (tuition, services and equipment, room and board, and books), the school must pay the student its share of his or her FWS compensation at the same time it pays the federal share. If the school pays a student its FWS share for an award period in the form of noncash sources, it must pay that share before the student's final payroll period. If a school pays its FWS share in the form of prepaid tuition, fees, services, or equipment for a forthcoming academic period , it must give the student a statement before the close of his or her final payroll period list - ing the amount of tuition, fees, services, or equipment earned. A school may pay a student after the student's last day of attendance for FWS compensation earned while he or she was in attendance at the school. A school must pay FWS compensation to a student by issuing a check or similar instrument that the student can cash on his or her own endorsement; or initiating an electronic funds transfer (EFT) to a bank account designated by the student ; or crediting the student's account at the school (after obtaining written authorization ). Records of noncash contributions There are two cases under which students may not receive the net FWS earnings identified on their payroll voucher. In the first, a student who has FWS earnings at a school that provides its FWS institutional match with cash has provided written permission for the school to credit part of the student's earnings to the student's account. A school must ob - tain a separate written authorization from a student before any part of the student's FWS cash earnings may be credited to the student's account at the school. The school must maintain that authorization in the student's file. In addition, the school must provide a clear audit trail showing that the student received credit on the student's account for any earnings not paid directly to the student.Payments to students 34 CFR 675.16 Earnings applied to cost of attendance 34 CFR 675.25Student Exception to FICA Tax FICA (Social Security and Medicare, including old age, survivors, and disability insurance tax [ OASDI}) taxes do not apply to service performed by students employed by a school, college or university where the student is pursuing a course of study. Whether the organization is a school, college or university depends on the organization's primary function. In addition, whether employees are students for this purpose requires examining the individual's employment relationship with the employer to determine if employment or education is predominant in the relationship. Treasury Decision 9167: Final regulations published December 21, 2004. Revenue Procedure 2005-11: Safe harbor standards that colleges and universities can apply in determining if an employee is eligible for the student FICA exception. Background Information: Background in - formation on the final regulations and rev - enue procedure providing guidance on the student FICA exception (section 3121(b) (10) of the Internal Revenue Code). DCL The second case involves schools that provide part (or all) of their FWS institutional match with credit for tuition, fees, services, or equip - ment. A school that provides its institutional match with tuition, fees, services, or equipment does not need to obtain a student's permission. However, before employing a student, this type of school must provide the student with a written explanation of this procedure, including the specific percentage of the student's earnings that the student will receive in credit for tuition, fees, services, or equipment. Moreover, before the close of the student's final scheduled payroll period, the school must give the student a statement that itemizes the total amount of tuition, fees, services, or equipment credited to the student's account from the student's FWS earnings. In addition the school's records must provide a clear audit trail showing that the student received credit on the student's account for any earnings not paid directly to the student. AUTHORIZATION Except when a school's institutional share is paid with noncash sources (tuition, services and equipment, room and board, and books), a school must obtain a separate written authorization from the student if the student is paid FWS compensation by crediting the student's account at the school. Except for schools that receive funds from the Department through heightened cash management, a school that obtains a written authoriza - tion from a student, may hold FWS funds as part of a student's Title IV credit balance on the student's account. In obtaining the student's written authorization, a school may not require or coerce the student to provide that authorization; must allow the student to cancel or modify that authorization at any time; and must clearly explain to the student how it will carry out the activity authorized. If a student modifies the written authorization, the modification takes effect on the date the school receives the modification notice. If a student cancels a written authorization, the school may use the FWS compensa - tion to pay only those authorized charges incurred by the student before the school received the cancellation notice. See Volume 4 for a complete discussion of authorizations to hold students' funds.Written authorization 34 CFR 675.16(b) & (d) If a school is not subject to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements described in Volume 4 , it may make direct deposits by EFT once the student provides his or her banking informa - tion. However, if a student fails to provide this information, the school must find some other way to pay the student any income earned. 668.164(d)(1)(i)Volume STUDENT ACCOUNTS With a student's permission, a school may credit the student's account at the school to satisfy current award year charges for tuition and fees; board, if the student contracts with the school for board; room, if the student contracts with the school for room; and other institutionally provided educationally related goods and services. In addition, a school may credit a student's account to pay prior award year charges if these charges are not more than $200. If a school pays a student FWS compensation by crediting the stu - dent's account, and the result is a credit balance, the school must pay the credit balance directly to the student as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the balance occurred on the account. HOLDING FWS FUNDS A school receiving funds under the reimbursement payment method (see Volume 4 ) may not hold FWS funds for students. Other schools may, if authorized by the student, hold FWS funds that would otherwise be paid directly to the student. If a school holds excess FWS funds, the school must identify the amount of FWS funds the school holds for each student in a subsidiary ledger account designated for that pur - pose; maintain, at all times, cash in its bank account in an amount at least equal to the amount of FWS funds the school holds for the student; and pay any remaining balance to the student by the end of the in - stitution's final FWS payroll period for an award period. If a student cancels the authorization to hold FWS funds, the school must pay those funds directly to the student as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the school receives the cancellation.Payments to student's account and resulting credit balances 34 CFR 676.16(c) Earnings applied to cost of attendance 34 CFR 676.25 Holding FWS funds 34 CFR 675.16(d)(5)Please see the discussion under Crediting FWS Funds to Students Accounts and Paying Credit Balances on the last page of this chapter for additional details on Paying Students.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-53FSA HB June RECORDS AND REPORTING IN THE FWS PROGRAM For reporting and accounting purposes, FWS expenditures must be distinguishable from other institutional expenditures. FWS compensa - tion should either be entered in a separate sub-ledger, or, if listed on the general payroll ledger, should be grouped separately from other expendi - tures. If payroll records are maintained electronically, a special cost center, object class, or program identifier must be used for FWS payments to students. EARNINGS FOR THE NEXT PERIOD OF ENROLLMENT Many FWS students must pay the bulk of their education costs be - fore they have had a chance to earn FWS wages. To provide students with the opportunity to earn wages in time to pay more of their educa - tion costs, the Department allows students to earn FWS wages to cover expenses associated with the next period of enrollment offered by the school. The student must be planning to enroll (or to reenroll) and must demonstrate financial need for that next period of enrollment. (The next period of enrollment is usually the next term, including a summer period, or in the case of summer earnings, the next full academic year.) A stu - dent may earn FWS funds for the next period of enrollment during any period of enrollment, including a period of enrollment that is comprised, in whole or in part, of mini-sessions. A student may also earn FWS wages towards the next period of enrollment during a period of nonattendance. Volume FOR PERIODS OF NONATTENDANCE A student may be employed through the FWS programs during a period of nonattendance, such as a summer term, an equivalent vacation period, the full-time work period of a cooperative education program, or an unattended fall or spring semester. A student must be planning to enroll (or to reenroll) and must have demonstrated financial need for the next period of enrollment. The student's FWS (net earnings minus taxes and job-related costs) during this period of nonattendance must be used to cover expenses associated with his or her financial need for the next period of enrollment. A student whose eligibility for summer FWS employment during a period of nonattendance is based on his or her anticipated enrollment in the next period of enrollment may fail to attend the school. When a student fails to attend for the next period of enrollment, the school that employed the student must be able to demonstrate that the stu - dent was eligible for employment and that the school had reason to be - lieve the student intended to study at that school in the next period of enrollment. At a minimum, the school that employed the student must keep a written record in its files showing that the student had either registered for classes or accepted the school's offer of admittance for the next period of enrollment. A student in an eligible program of study abroad may be employed during a period of nonattendance preceding the study abroad if he or she will be continuously enrolled in his or her domestic school while abroad and if the student's courses abroad are part of the domestic school's program. In such a case, a student may be employed in a qualified position in the United States, at the home school's branch campus in a foreign country, at a U.S. government facility abroad, or in a U.S. company abroad. EARNINGS DURING MINI-SESSIONS If a school combines a series of mini-sessions or modules into one term (e.g., three summer mini-sessions into one summer semester), an FWS student attending any of the mini-sessions may earn FWS wages at any time throughout that term. The school may apply those earnings toward the student's financial need for the mini-session(s) attended and/ or the next period of enrollment. The school must base the student's financial need for attending the summer term on the period of time for which the student is actually enrolled in the mini-sessions. The amount of FWS wages a student may earn at any given point in time in the term does not depend on whether or not the student is enrolled in a mini-session at that point in time. The school or student may choose how to distribute the hours worked throughout the summer term.Mini-Session Example Bowen University has a summer term made up of three mini-sessions. Ted enrolls in classes for the June and Au - gust mini-sessions but does not enroll in any classes for the July mini-session. Ted has a financial need of $500 for his attendance in two of the summer mini-sessions. Ted also plans to enroll in the following fall semester and has a remaining need of $250 for that semes - ter. Ted is given a $750 FWS award in the summer ($500 for the two summer mini-sessions and $250 for the fall semester). Ted knows his June mini-session courses will be very demanding, and he will not have time to work. So, Ted earns $500 during the July mini-session when he has no classes. Ted has classes again in August, but his academic workload is lighter. In August, Ted earns $250 toward his education costs in the upcoming fall semester.Earnings for periods of nonattendance 34 IS PROHIBITED FWS earnings are not subject to garnishment or attachment except to satisfy a debt owed to the Department. A student's FWS wages may be garnished only to pay any costs of attendance that the student owes the school or that will become due and payable during the period of the award. Schools must oppose any garnishment order they receive for any other type of debt. By law, FSA funds may only be used for educational purposes. If your school is not the employer in an off-campus employment arrangement, it must have an effective procedure to notify off-campus employers that garnishment of FWS wages is not permissible. PAYMENT FOR FWS TRAINING AND/OR TRAVEL A student may be paid for training for any FWS employment or for a reasonable amount of time for travel that is directly related to a commu - nity service job. Because every job requires some type of training, whether formal or inform al, the Department al lows FWS students to be paid wages during a training period that is conducted for a reasonable length of time. This applies regardless of the type of FWS job the student has. A reasonable training period is one that occurs immediately before the student begins the regular duties of the FWS employment and does not exceed approxi - mately 20 hours. Students also may be compensated for a reasonable amount of time to perform ongoing activities (for example, preparation and evaluation time) needed to accomplish their FWS jobs. Schools may pay students for a reasonable amount of time spent for travel that is directly related to employment in community service activi - ties. Time spent for travel should be reported on the student's FWS time record in the same way hours actually worked are currently reported. Schools should provide their students with a form on which students can record travel time separately from time spent working.Training and travel 34 CFR 675.18(h) Garnishment and attachment IN THE FWS PROGRAM\u2014 RECONCILIATION, FISCAL, AND PROGRAM RECORDS Your school must reconcile, at least monthly, your FWS draws recorded in G5 to the funds received in the bank account your school has designated to receive electronic transfers. You must also reconcile monthly the amount drawn down and received to the amounts disbursed to students or returned to the Department, and resolve all discrepancies. In addition, you should examine your FWS program and fiscal records at the start of the year and monthly: Do you have a method for verifying that the rate of pay re - corded in the payroll system corresponds to the position and experience level in the school's policies and procedures? Do you have a system that records the maximum a student may earn in FWS wages and alerts you if a student approaches that amount? Do you periodically evaluate your rate of expenditures to determine, if that rate continues, whether you will expend less than, the same as, or more than the amount you have budgeted for FWS expenditures? Are your matching funds consistently deposited at the same time you received your federal share? Has your institution drawn just enough funds from G5 for FWS to cover payrolls made? In the FWS program, your requests for funds should always be for a payroll for which data has been entered. Do you often find yourself requesting additional funds or returning unused funds? Do you have a process in place to ensure that students are working the hours reported\u2014that timesheets are accurate? Do you frequently audit payrolls to test whether hours recorded in the payroll system match the hours reported on student timesheets?Fiscal procedures and records 34 CFR USE OF FWS ALLOCATED FUNDS Community service requirements There are three community service expenditure requirements that a school must meet. 1. A school must use at least 7% of its FWS federal allocation for an award year to pay the federal share of wages to students employed in community service jobs for that year. 2. In meeting the 7% community service requirement, one or more of the school's FWS students must be employed in a reading tutoring project that employs one or more FWS students as reading tutors for children who are preschool age or are in elementary school; or family literacy project that employs one or more FWS students in family literacy activities. A school that requests and receives supplemental FWS funds must spend 100% of the supplemental amount in community service positions. A school that fails to meet any of these FWS community service requirements will be required to return FWS federal funds in an amount that represents the difference between the amount a school should have spent for community service and the amount it actually spent. Further, a school that is not compliant with the FWS community service requirements may be subject to a Limitation, Suspension, and Termination (L, S, and T) proceeding, through which the school could be denied future participation in the FWS Program and possibly other FSA programs and/or subject to a substantial fine. A school may request a waiver of either of these requirements by the annual deadline. The school should include detailed information that demonstrates that the requirement would cause a hardship for students at the school. See the section later in this chapter for more information on waivers. Grants for off-campus community service The HEOA authorizes (but does not fund) grants to schools to supplement off-campus and community service employment. Grant funds would be used to recruit and compensate students performing off- campus community service (including compensation for time spent in training and for travel directly related to the community service). This program is not currently funded and cannot be implemented until funding is provided by Congress. HEOA section 446 HEA section 447(b)Definition of community service The definition of community service has been extended to include the field of emer - gency preparedness and response. HEOA 441(2) Effective August 14, 2008. *Remember that in meeting the commu - nity service minimum requirement, one or more of the school's FWS students must be employed as a reading tutor for children in a reading tutoring project or performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project.Community service 34 Waivers of the community service and/or math and reading tutor requirements A school may request a waiver of the community service and tutor requirements; the request must be submitted electronically before the annual deadline using the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) website. The fact that it may be difficult for the school to comply with these requirements is not, in and of itself, a basis for grant - ing a waiver. The school's waiver request must specify whether the school is requesting a waiver of the 7% community service requirement, the read - ing tutors of children or family literacy project requirement, or both. The waiver must also include detailed information to demonstrate that complying with the requirement(s) would cause hardship for the school's students. If a school has any questions about the community service expenditure requirements or waiver procedures, the school can contact the COD School Relations Center at 1-800-848-0978 . Schools will be re - minded about the waiver process through communications posted to the IFAP website. See the graphic Community Service Waivers later in this chapter for more information. Effect of supplemental FWS awards on minimum community service expenditures When a school receives supplemental/reallocated FWS funds, the minimum amount of FWS federal funds the school must expend on community service jobs for an award year is one of the following two amounts, whichever is greater: 7% of the sum of your original FWS allocation, plus your FWS supplemental allocation, minus any amount of FWS federal funds you returned through the reallocation process or earlier OR 100% of your FWS supplemental allocation.FWS community service waiver request EA, March 23, 2018. Deadline Dates The Campus-Based Deadline Dates for the upcoming year can be found on the IFAP webpage. ifap.ed.gov/ifap/cbp_deadlines.jspTIPClarificationChapter Glossary DCL COMMUNITY SERVICE JOBS Community service jobs can be either on campus or off campus. Nonprofit agencies can qualify as community service employers if the work performed meets the definition of community services in the regulations. See the list of programs and activities that are recognized as appropriate work in community services in the graphic the end of this section. (Note that private, for-profit organizations do not qualify as em - ployers for community service under the FWS Program.) Employing an FWS student in these positions serves the needs of the community and gives the FWS student an enriching and rewarding experience. Schools must inform students of FWS community service opportunities available in the local community. The PPA also requires your school to work with local nonprofit, governmental, and community- based organizations to identify community service opportunities, including those that assist supportive services to students with disabilities. Schools should promote these opportunities to students by notifying each student individually or via general means such as campus websites or publications. More information Community service DCL CB-07-08 Family literacy project DCL CB-98-6 Community Service 34 CFR 675.18(g) Civics, emergency response, and other teaching projects In meeting the 7% community service ex - penditure requirement, students may be employed to perform civic education and participation activities in projects that teach civics in schools, raise awareness of govern - ment functions or resources, or increase civic participation. To the extent practicable, a school must give priority to the employment of students in projects that educate or train the public about evacuation, emer - gency response, and injury prevention strategies relating to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other emergency situations; and ensure that the students receive appro - priate training to carry out the educa Service Opportunities, Y outh Corps Programs, Other Programs, and Activities The definition of community services for FWS includes work in \"service opportunities\" or \"youth corps, \" as defined in Section 101 of the National and Community Service Act of 1990: Service opportunity. A program or project, including a service learning program or project, that enables students or out-of-school youth to perform meaningful and constructive service in agencies, institutions, and situations where the application of human talent and dedication may help meet human, educational, linguistic, and environmental community needs, especially those relating to poverty. Youth corps program. A program, such as a conservation corps or youth service program, that offers full-time, productive work (to be financed through stipends) with visible community benefits in a natural resource or human service setting and that gives participants a mix of work experience, basic and life skills, education, training, and support services. The definition of \"community services\" also includes service in agencies, institutions, and activities that are designated in Section 124(a) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990. These include the following conservation corps and human services corps programs, as well as programs that encompass the focus and services of both. Conservation corps programs Conservation corps programs that focus on conservation, rehabilitation, and the improvement of wildlife habitat, rangelands, parks, and recreation areas; urban and rural revitalization, historical and site preservation, and reforestation of both urban and rural areas; fish culture, wildlife habitat maintenance and improvement, and other fishery assistance; road and trail maintenance and improvement; erosion, flood, drought, and storm damage assistance and controls; stream, lake, waterfront harbor, and port improvement; wetlands protection and pollution control; insect, disease, rodent, and fire prevention and control; the improvement of abandoned railroad beds and rights-of-way; energy conservation projects, renewable resource enhancement, and recovery of biomass; reclamation and improvement of strip- mined land; forestry, nursery, and cultural operations; and making public facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities.Human services corps programs Human services corps programs that include service in state, local, and regional government agencies; nursing homes, hospices, senior centers, hospitals, local libraries, parks, recreational facilities, child and adult daycare centers, programs serving individuals with disabilities, and schools; law enforcement agencies and penal and probation systems; private nonprofit organizations that primarily focus on social service such as community action agencies; activities that focus on the rehabilitation or improvement of public facilities; neighborhood improvements; literacy training that benefits educationally disadvantaged individuals; weatherization of and basic repairs to low-income housing, including housing occupied by older adults; energy conservation (including solar energy techniques); removal of architectural barriers to access by individuals with disabilities to public facilities; activities that focus on drug and alcohol abuse education, prevention, and treatment; and conservation, maintenance, or restoration of natural resources on publicly held lands; and any other nonpartisan civic activities and services that the commission determines to be of a substantial social benefit in meeting unmet human, educational, or environmental needs (particularly needs related to poverty) in the community where volunteer service is to be performed. See 34 Sec 443(b)(2)(A) 34 CFR 675.18(g) The Department, in the past, has approved a limited number of waivers of the community service requirements for schools that have demonstrated that enforcing these requirements would have caused a hardship for their students. Examples of waiver requests include the following: Case Study #1\u2014Small FWS allocation The school had a very small FWS allocation. The supporting information submitted by the school noted that 7% of the school's allocation only provided enough funds for a student to work for a short period of time. Therefore, the school was unable to find placement for a student in community service. Case Study #2\u2014Rural area The school was in a rural area that was located far away from the types of organizations that would normally pro - vide community service jobs. The school provided information that showed its students lacked the means of trans - portation to get to the town where the community jobs were located. In a similar waiver request in which trans - portation did exist, a school provided documentation that showed that the transportation costs were extremely high for the students.Community Service Waivers Case Study #3\u2014Specialized program The school offered only a single program of specialized study that required its students to participate in extensive curriculum and classroom workloads. The school provided infor - mation that demonstrated this special - ized educational program prevented the students from performing community service jobs at the time those work op - portunities were available. These examples are not the only circumstances that may result in approval of a waiver request; however, you must always submit a justification of your request. The Department posts an annual announcement to the IFAP website describing the electronic waiver process and giving the deadline date for that year. A school must submit its waiver request to the Department electronically via the COD website at COD.ed.gov For more detail, see the E-Announce - ment referenced at the beginning of Jobs Step #2: Research Y our Students' Interest in Community Service Research your FWS students' degrees or certificate programs, interests, and skills to determine which recipients might find com - munity service jobs appealing. Step #3: Promote Community Service Jobs Devise a plan to market community services under the FWS Program to eligible student employers and the community. Obtain a listing of potential commu - nity service agencies. Ask to be a presenter at various organizations' meetings. Engage in networking activities. Hold and attend job fairs. Host a financial aid office \"open house. \" Visit local agencies.Step #1: Identify Potential Jobs and Employers Identify jobs Brainstorm types of jobs that would meet the community ser - vice requirement. What jobs do your students currently hold, on campus or off campus, that meet the community service definition? Communicate the community ser - vice requirements to your school's student employment office. Identify employers. Which local community service or - ganizations might be interested in employing your FWS students? Contact local nonprofit, govern - ment, and community-based organizations to assess their needs and determine what interest exists for employing FWS students. Talk to colleagues Talk to colleagues at other schools to get ideas on implementing, locating, and developing the community service jobs.In contacting potential community service agencies, schools should place a priority on jobs that will meet the human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs of low-income individuals.* * There is no formal definition of \"low-income individuals\" for this purpose, and there is no statutory requirement that a particular number or proportion of the individuals must be low- income persons. Some examples of jobs that provide services to persons in the community who may not necessarily be low-income individuals are jobs that provide supportive services to individuals with disabilities or that prevent or control crime in the community.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-63FSA HB June What Is a Family Literacy Project? How Are Family Literacy Activities Defined? Research shows that children whose parents work with them on literacy skills during early childhood have a better chance of reading well and independently. The family literacy concept recognizes the family as an institution for education and learning and the role of parents as their children's first teachers. A family literacy program integrates four components. It provides literacy or pre-literacy education to children, literacy training for parents or other caregivers of children in the program, a means of equipping parents or other caregivers with the skills needed to partner with their children in learning, and literacy activities between parents or other caregivers and their children. This definition is consistent with the Even Start and Head Start definitions of Family Literacy programs. The Department does not define \"family literacy activities\" for purposes of the community service expenditure requirement or the waiver of the institutional share requirement. The Depart - ment gives schools reasonable flexibility to determine the job description and duties for an FWS student performing family literacy activities. Family literacy activities are not limited to just tutoring positions . For example, family literacy activities may include training tutors, performing administrative tasks such as coordinating the tutors, or working as an instructional aide who prepares the materials for the project. However, it would not be reasonable to include janitorial or building repair jobs as family literacy service jobs eligible for FWS Community services are defined as services that are identified by an institution of higher education through formal or informal consultation with local nonprofit, government, and community-based organizations, as designed to improve the quality of life for community residents, par - ticularly low-income individuals, or to solve particular problems related to their needs. These services include such fields as health care, child care, literacy training, education (including tutorial services), welfare, social services, transportation, housing and neighborhood improvement, pub - lic safety, crime prevention and control, recreation, rural devel - opment, community improvement, and emergency prepared - ness and response; work in service opportunities or youth corps under Ameri - Corps, and service in the agencies, institutions, and activities described later; support services for students with disabilities (including stu - dents with disabilities who are enrolled at the school1); and activities in which an FWS student serves as a mentor for such purposes as tutoring (see Employing FWS students as tutors later in this chapter), supporting educational and recreational activities, and counseling, including career counseling. To be considered employed in a community service job for FWS pur - poses, an FWS student does not have to provide a \"direct\" service. The student must provide services that are designed to improve the quality of life for community residents or to solve particular problems related to those residents' needs. A school may use its discretion to determine what jobs provide service to the community, within the guidelines provided by the statute, regulations, an d the Department. Note that th ere is a model need assessment at the end of this chapter that can be used with commu - nity service agencies. A university or college is not considered a community for the pur - poses of the FWS community service requirements. On-campus jobs can meet the definition of community services, provided the services are de - signed to improve the quality of life for community residents, or to solve problems related to their needs and that they meet the regulatory and statutory provisions pertaining to the applicable FWS employment limita - tions and conditions. 1. This is the only statutory exception to the requirement that community service be open and accessible to the community.Indirect Services The Department does not intend to indi - cate that certain activities are more impor - tant than others or that only jobs that have direct contact with community members are acceptable. For example, an FWS student working for the Meals on Wheels Program is performing community service when conducting research on where the program is needed, when recruiting or coordinating volunteers to distribute the meals, or when preparing meals for the program, despite having no contact with the community residents. Such indirect services are very important in meeting community needs.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-65FSA July 1997Employing FWS students as tutors In an effort to increase the reading and math proficiency of our na - tion's children, tutoring in these areas has become a federal priority. The FWS regulations authorize a 100% federal share of FWS wages earned by a student who is employed to perform civic education and participation activities, such as as a reading tutor for preschool-age through elementary school-age children; as a mathematics tutor for children in elementary school through ninth grade; or performing family literacy activities in a family literacy project that provides services to families with preschool-age children or children who are in elementary school. When employing students as reading tutors, schools must, to the maximum extent possible, give placement priority to schools that are participating in a reading reform project that: (1) is designed to train teachers how to teach reading on the basis of scientific research on read - ing; and (2) is funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 , as amended. The school must further ensure that reading tutors receive training from the employing school in the instructional practices used by the school .Reading tutors 34 CFR 675.18(g)(3) Reading and math tutors Dear Colleague Letter CB-97-12, dated July 1999 Dear Partner Letter CB-99-12, dated July requirements for a \"reading tutor\" or \"math tutor?\" The Department does not define \"tutor\" for the FWS Program. This gives schools flexibility in determining the job description and duties of a tutor. For example, a reading tutor could be an FWS student who reads to a group of preschoolers in a public library. An FWS student employed as a tutor does not have to meet certain statutory (for reading tutors) or regulatory (for reading and mathematics tutors) educational standards or qualifications for the school to receive an institutional-share waiver. However, an FWS reading or math tutor must have adequate reading or math skills, as appropriate, and the Department strongly recommends that the tutors be well trained before they tutor. The Department does not require background checks of FWS tutors. However, some state and local jurisdictions may require such checks. The requirements will vary according to the agency or organization involved. What is a preschool-age child? A preschool-age child is a child from infancy to the age at which his or her state provides elementary education. What is the definition of an elementary school? The definition of an elementary school varies from state to state. Because the Department does not wish to interfere with a state's determination of what constitutes children who are in elementary school, we will not provide guidance on the maximum grade level for elementary school for purposes of the institutional-share waiver for tutoring. In what setting must tutoring take place? Tutoring may be one-on-one or in a group. Tutoring sessions can take place in a school setting or another location, such as a public library or community center. Tutoring sessions can be held during regular school hours, after school, on weekends, or in the summer. Can FWS students tutor children in parochial schools? An FWS student can tutor a child in a parochial school under certain conditions: The parochial school must be classified as a private, nonprofit school by the Internal Revenue Service or a state taxing body. The work may not involve constructing, operating, or maintaining any part of a building used for religious worship or sectarian instruction. The FWS tutor may not use religious material to tutor the child. Should tutors be trained? The Department strongly recommends that the tutors be well trained before they tutor. When an FWS student receives training from a specialist or expert for sufficient duration and intensity, he or she is more likely to be successful with the child he or she is tutoring. Tutor training should emphasize the importance of the tutor's communication with the regular classroom teacher to maximize effectiveness. The amount and type of training will often vary, depending on the needs of the child being tutored and the subject being studied. (See Chapter 1 for information on using the administrative cost allowance to pay for the cost of training tutors.)Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-67FSA HB June 2018 Can students be paid while in training? Under limited circumstances, an FWS tutor can receive FWS wages while being trained, and these wages can qualify for a waiver of the institutional share. This training period must be only for a reasonable and limited length of time. The Department would not consider a training period of an academic term to be reasonable. The Department would consider a reasonable training period to be one that occurs before the student begins tutoring and that does not exceed approximately 20 hours. A school may not pay an FWS student to take an academic course the school developed to provide classroom training on tutoring children. An FWS student may take such a course as long as he or she is not paid for taking the course (34 CFR 675.18(h)). Can students be paid during preparation and evaluation activities? The preparation time and evaluation time worked by an FWS tutor qualify for a 100% federal share as long as the time spent for this purpose is reasonable. For example, the Department would consider attending evaluation and preparation meetings once a week for approximately one hour to be reasonable. The Department wants to give some flexibility because of the value of evaluation and preparation time. However, the goal is to spend funds for FWS students to interact with the children in family literacy programs, not for other activities. Will a tutoring job always satisfy the community service requirement? An FWS tutor job might qualify for a waiver of the institutional share (100% federal share) but not qualify as part of the 7% community service requirement. If, for example, a postsecondary school employs FWS students to tutor young children in its daycare center and the center is not open and accessible to the community, the job would qualify for the waiver but would not qualify as part of the 7% community service requirement. What if the FWS student is training tutors, performing related administrative tasks, or works another FWS job? The wages of an FWS student who is training tutors or who is performing administrative tasks related to supporting other people who are actually providing the reading or mathematics tutoring do not qualify for a federal share of up to 100%; rather, an institutional share is required. Remember that it is the FWS reading or mathematics tutor job, not the student working in the job, that qualifies for the institutional-share waiver. Thus, an FWS student who is working another FWS job in addition to the tutor job can be paid with 100% federal funds only for the time he or she is working as a tutor, not for time spent on the other job. If, for example, an FWS student spends only half of his or her time working as a reading tutor (including preparation and evaluation time) and the other half on non- tutoring tasks, the student may be paid 100% federal funds only for half the time, and the other half must be paid with a maximum of 75% federal funds and a minimum of 25% nonfederal funds. How can my school start placing FWS students as tutors? Your school may construct its own reading tutor program or join existing community programs. You may use the Job Location and Development (JLD) Program to locate or develop jobs for FWS students as tutors of children. However, you may not use JLD funds exclusively for this purpose because you would be in violation of the JLD statutory requirement to expand off-campus jobs for currently enrolled students who want jobs regardless of their financial need. Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-68 FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL WORK ON CAMPUS (SCHOOL IS EMPLOYER) A student may be employed on campus at any type of postsecondary institution, including at a proprietary school. The FWS regulations define institution of higher education as a public or private nonprofit institution, a proprietary institution or a postsecondary vocational institution. A school, other than a proprietary school, may employ a student to work for the school itself, including certain services for which the school may contract, such as food service, cleaning, maintenance, and security. Work for the school's contractors is acceptable as long as the contract specifies the number of students to be employed and specifies that the school selects the students and determines their pay rates. A proprietary school also may employ a student to work for the school itself with certain restrictions (discussed under \"Work for a Proprietary School\"). At any type of postsecondary institution, including proprietary schools, an FWS student may be assigned to assist a professor if the stu - dent is doing work the school would normally support under its own employment program. Having a student serve as a research assistant to a professor is appropriate, as long as the work is in line with the professor's official duties and is considered work for the school itself. On-campus employment 34 CFR 675.21 Employment in a Foreign Country Normally, employment in a foreign coun - try is not permissible under the law. How - ever, a school with an additional location in a foreign country may employ students under FWS if the branch has its own fa - cilities, administrative staff, and faculty. Students may also be employed by a U.S. government facility such as an embassy or a military base. A student may not be employed for a nonprofit organization in a foreign country.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-69FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL WORK FOR A PROPRIETARY SCHOOL A proprietary school may employ a student to work for the school itself, but only in jobs that meet certain criteria. If the jobs are in community service, they may be either on or off campus. Students employed by a proprietary school and performing community service do not have to provide student services that are directly related to their education . If the jobs are not in community service, they must be on campus and must provide student services that are directly related to the FWS student's training or education . To the maximum extent possible, the job must complement and reinforce the FWS student's educational program or vocational goals. The job may not involve soliciting potential students to enroll at the proprietary school. In general, jobs that primarily benefit the proprietary school are not student services. For example, jobs in facility maintenance or cleaning are never student services. See the sidebar for examples of jobs that do not provide student services. Again, this list is not exhaustive. Jobs in the admissions or recruitment area of a school are not acceptable student services because such jobs are considered to involve soliciting potential students to enroll at the school. The noncommunity service job must provide student services that are directly related to the FWS student's training or education. This does not mean that the FWS student must be enrolled in an academic program for that field. Instead, it means that the FWS student must be receiving work experiences that are directly applicable to the skills needed for his or her career path. For example, an FWS student enrolled in an air-conditioning repair program wants to work in the school's library. Although the stu - dent is not pursuing a career as a librarian, the student would still be able to work in the library. The job is directly related to his or her training because he or she is learning customer service and basic office functions that are applicable to work in an air-conditioning repair shop or dealer - ship. Similarly, a job in another student service office such as financial aid, registrar, and job placement would also be considered directly related to the FWS student's training.TIPProprietary school employment 34 CFR 675.21(b) A proprietary school also may employ a student to work for the school itself with cer - tain restrictions (see \"Work for a Proprietary School\" in this section). Student Services Student services may include jobs in financial aid, jobs in a library, peer guidance counseling, job placement, assisting an instructor with curriculum-related activities (e.g., teaching assistant), security, social and health services, and tutoring. Student services never include facility maintenance, cleaning, purchasing, and public relations. 34 CFR Student services are services that are offered to students. Students are persons enrolled or accepted for enrollment at the school. An FWS student who provides services only to the school's former students is not providing student services because the services are not offered to currently enrolled students. However, an FWS student who provides services to both current students and former students is providing student services because the services are offered to currently enrolled students. For example, an FWS student provides job placement assistance to current students and alumni of the school. The FWS student is con - sidered to be providing student services because his or her services are offered to current students and alumni. Student services do not have to be direct services or involve personal interaction with other students. Services are considered student services if the services provide a benefit either directly or indirectly to students. For example, an FWS student may work in assisting an instructor in the lab or in other work related to the instructor's official academic duties at the school. See the sidebar on the previous page for an expanded list of examples of jobs that provide student services. The list is not exhaustive. The fact that a job has some operational functions does not preclude it from being an acceptable FWS job as long as it furnishes student WORK OFF CAMPUS A postsecondary school (including a proprietary school) may use FWS funds to pay a portion of the wages of a student who is employed off campus by certain nonprofit agencies or private employers. Work off campus for nonprofit or government agency If a student is employed off campus by a federal, state, or local public agency or by a private nonprofit organization, providing jobs related to the student's academic or vocational goals is encouraged but not required. A private nonprofit organization is one in which no part of the net earnings of the agency benefits any private shareholder or individual. An organization must be incorporated as nonprofit under federal or state law. A school classified as a tax-exempt organization by either the federal or state Internal Revenue Service meets this requirement. Examples of private nonprofit organizations generally include hospitals, day care cen - ters, halfway houses, crisis centers, and summer camps. Work must be \"in the public interest\" Work performed off campus must be in the public interest. Work in the public interest is defined as work performed for the welfare of the na - tion or community rather than work performed for a particular interest or group. Work is not \"in the public interest\" if it primarily benefits the members of an organization that has membership limits, such as a credit union, a fraternal or reli - gious order, or a cooperative; involves any partisan or nonpartisan political activity or is as - sociated with a faction in an election for public or party office; is for an elected official unless the official is responsible for the regular administration of federal, state, or local government; is work as a political aide for any elected official; takes into account a student's political support or party affilia - tion in hiring him or her; or involves lobbying on the federal, state, or local level.Employment by a federal, state, or local public agency, or a private nonprofit organization 34 CFR 675.23Off-campus agreements 34 CFR 675.20(b) Work in the Public Interest: Examples In deciding whether work is in the public interest, schools must consider the nature of the work as well as that of the organiza - tion. For example, a private nonprofit civic club may employ a student if the student's work is for the club's community drive to aid handicapped children. If the student's work is confined to the internal interests of the club, such as a campaign for membership, the work would benefit a particular group and would not be in the public interest. As another example, a student may work for a private nonprofit membership organization, such as a golf club or swimming pool, if the general public may use the organization's facilities on the same basis as its members. If only members may use the facilities, FWS em - ployment is not in the activity, whether partisan or nonpartisan, does not qual - ify as work in the public interest. For example, a student is not consid - ered to be working in the public interest if working at voting polls\u2014even if he or she only checks off the names of those who came to vote and does not pass out flyers supporting a particular candidate. Also, a student is not considered to be working in the public interest if working to support an independent candidate. Another example of nonpartisan political ac - tivity is work for a city political debate. Working for an elected official as a political aide also does not qualify as work in the public interest. For example, a student could not represent a member of Congress on a committee. However, a student could be assigned to the staff of a standing committee of a legislative body or could work on a special committee, as long as the student would be selected on a nonpartisan basis and the work performed would be non - partisan. Under certain circumstances, work for an elected official respon - sible for the regular administration of federal, state, or local government may be considered to be in the public interest. \"Regular administration\" means the official is directly responsible for administering a particular function. Such a person would not create, abolish, or fund any programs but would run them. Working for a sheriff would be acceptable, as would working for an elected judge (because he or she has direct responsibility for the judicial system). As stated previously, any political activity would not be acceptable\u2014 raising funds for the official's re-election, for example. An FWS position that involves lobbying at the federal, state, or local level is not work in the public interest. FWS students are prohibited from working for the U.S. Department of Education due to the potential appearance of conflict of interest. Work off campus for private for-profit companies Schools also may enter into agreements with private for-profit companies to provide off-campus jobs for students; however, these jobs must be academically relevant, to the maximum extent practicable, to the student's program of study. (A student studying for a business administration degree could work in a bank handling customer transactions, for example.) Private for-profit organizations do not qualify as employers for community service under the FWS Program. TIP Work for private for-profits 34 in apprenticeships through the FWS Program A school may use its FWS Program funds to pay the training wages for otherwise eligible FWS students employed as apprentices, even when the apprenticeship is not part of the student's eligible academic program. The Department allocates FWS federal funds to institutions under a statutory formula that requires an institutional match. While the federal share of an FWS student's wages generally may not exceed 75% for a student employed by the school or by a public or nonprofit agency, the federal share may not exceed 50% for a student employed by a private for-profit entity. Moreover, a school may only use a maximum of 25% of its total FWS federal allocation to pay the wages of FWS students employed by private for-profit organizations. Any student enrolled at a postsecondary institution participating in the FWS program is eligible for FWS employment if the student meets all federal student aid eligibility requirements, including having financial need. Under certain conditions, and at the school's discretion, employment under the FWS Program may include employment in apprenticeships. If a school chooses to include one or more apprenticeships as part of its FWS Program, selected FWS eligible students may receive FWS wages for employment in the apprenticeship regardless of whether or not the apprenticeship comprises part of the student's educational program. Finally, FWS wages earned as part of apprenticeships are not used in determining the student's eligibility for federal student aid in the following year. A job under the FWS Program must be suitable to the scheduling and other needs of the student and must, to the maximum extent practi - cable, complement and reinforce the educational programs or vocational goals of the student. The wage rate and other conditions of FWS employment, including in an apprenticeship program, are determined by, among other things, minimum wage rules, the type of work performed, the geographic region, the student's proficiency, and any applicable federal, state, or local law. Financial aid administrators at postsecondary institutions are responsible for ensuring compliance with Federal laws and regulations regarding FWS employment, including employment in apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeship providers must coordinate with postsecondary institutions to ensure compliance with all relevant requirements.Clarification Apprenticeships and Federal Work Study DCL ID: GEN-14-22 Please review DCL GEN-14-22, December 18, 2014, for a complete discussion of Apprenticeships and the Federal Student Aid If school would like an off-campus organization to employ FWS students, your school must enter into a written agreement\u2014a contract\u2014with the off-campus organization. A written agreement is required with the off-campus organization even if your school is considered the employer of the FWS student. The school must make sure the off-campus organization is a reliable agency with professional direction and staff and that the work to be performed is consistent with the purpose of the FWS Program. Note that there is a model off-campus agreement at the end of this chapter. The model need not be followed exactly but serves as a guide. The agreement should specify what share of student compensation and other costs will be paid by the off-campus organization. For-profit organizations must pay the nonfederal share of student earnings. Any off-campus organization may pay the nonfederal share of student earnings; required employer costs, such as the employer's share of Social Security or workers' compensation; and the school's administrative costs not already paid from its Administrative Cost Allowance (ACA). The agreement sets forth the FWS work conditions and establishes whether the school or the off-campus organization will be the employer for such purposes as hiring, firing, and paying the student. The employer is generally considered to be the entity that will control and direct the work of the FWS students\u2014supervising them at the work site, regulating their hours of work, and generally ensuring that they perform their duties properly. However, the school is ultimately responsible for making sure that payment for work performed is properly documented and that each student's work is properly supervised. The agreement should define whether the off-campus organization will assume payroll responsibility and bill the school for the federal share of the students' wages, or whether the school will pay the students and bill the off-campus organization for its contribution. The school must make up any payments the off-campus organization does not make. It is the school's responsibility to ensure that FWS payments are properly documented, even if the off-campus organization does the payroll. To fulfill that responsibility, the school must keep copies of time sheets and payroll vouchers and keep evidence that the students were actually paid (usually copies of the canceled checks or receipts signed by the students). The school is also responsible for ensuring that each student's work is properly supervised. School officials should periodically visit each off- campus organization with which they have an off-campus agreement to determine whether students are doing appropriate work and whether the terms of the agreement are being fulfilled.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Work-Study Program6-75FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary The agreement must state whether the school or off-campus organization is liable for any on-the-job injuries to the student. The employer is not automatically liable. Federal FWS funds cannot be used to pay an injured student's hospital expenses. In determining whether to continue an off-campus agreement, many schools have found it helpful to require that students submit a formal evaluation of their work experience at the end of the assignment. The school may also use the evaluation to help off-campus agencies improve their work programs. Staff members of the off-campus organization must become acquainted with a school's financial aid and student employment pro - grams to better understand the school's educational objectives. The school must supply the off-campus organization with this information. If a school receives more money under an employment agreement with an off-campus agency than the sum of required employer costs, the school's nonfederal share, and any share of administrative costs the employer agreed to pay, the school must handle the excess in one of three ways: 1. Use it to reduce the federal share on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 2. Hold it in trust for off-campus employment during the next award year. 3. Refund it to the off-campus employer. Providing the federal share and billing for the employer's share If an off-campus agreement specifies that the off-campus organization will assume payroll responsibility and bill the school for the federal share of the students' wages, the school will be sending federal funds to the off-campus organization. The agreement with the school should include the procedures the off-campus organization must follow and the documents it must provide in order to be reimbursed for the federal portion of a student's salary. Your school should have written policies that describe the aforemen - tioned procedures, the documentation the off-campus organization must provide, and how the reimbursement process will be handled. Your accounting entries must completely track the payment of the federal share to the off-campus organization and must be backed by the original documents specified in your policies. Your school is liable for federal funds expended for which it does not have proper records or documentation.TIPVolume your agreement with the off-campus organization specifies that the school will pay the students and bill the off-campus organization for its share, the agreement should include the steps the school will take, the documentation the school will provide, and the time frame within which the off-campus employer will pay the school its share of the FWS com - pensation. Your school should have a system for ensuring that off-campus em - ployers are billed for their share of FWS wages in a timely manner. In addition, you should have a system for following up if bills remain unpaid after a reasonable period of time. Your accounting entries must com - pletely track the billing and receipt of the employer's share and must be backed by any original documents required (e.g., detail of the wages paid to students and calculation of the employer's share). JOB LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM The JLD Program is a part of the FWS Program. An institution is allowed to use part of the federal funds it receives under the FWS Program to establish or expand a JLD Program. The JLD Program locates and develops off-campus job opportunities for students who are currently enrolled in eligible institutions of higher education and who want jobs regardless of financial need. This means that jobs may be located and developed under the JLD Program for FWS and non-FWS eligible students. Under the JLD Program, your school must locate and develop off- campus jobs that are suitable to the scheduling and other needs of the employed student and must, to the maximum extent practicable, comple - ment and reinforce the educational program or vocational goal of the student. JLD jobs may be part-time or full-time, for either a for-profit or non - profit employer. JLD Program participation A school that participates in the FWS Program is also eligible to par - ticipate in the JLD Program. A school that has an executed PPA for the FWS Program may participate in the JLD Program without any prior contact with the Department and without any revision to its PPA. Under the PPA, the school agrees to administer the JLD Program according to the appropriate statutory and regulatory provisions. If the Department terminates or suspends a school's eligibility to par - ticipate in the FWS Program, that action also applies to the school's JLD Program.TIPJLD and Community Service The JLD Program encourages students to participate in community service activi - ties. Your school must inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community services and must develop and make available information about community service opportunities. The JLD Program uses the same definition of community services that the FWS Program employs. However, the JLD Program does not have a specific minimum community service requirement, as does the FWS Program.JLD Program 34 CFR 675 Subpart B JLD DCL Student eligibility Any student employed in a job developed under the JLD Program must be currently enrolled at the school placing him or her in a job. A school may place in JLD jobs both students who do not meet FWS stu - dent eligibility criteria and those who do meet those criteria. However, using JLD funds to find jobs only for FWS students would not satisfy the program purpose of expanding off-campus jobs for students who want jobs regardless of financial need. Use of FWS allocation for JLD Program When establishing or expanding a program to locate and develop off- campus jobs, including community service jobs, a school may use up to the lesser of 10% of its FWS allocation and reallocation, or $75,000. Use of JLD Program funds Your school may use federal JLD funds to pay for the cost of estab - lishing and administering the JLD Program. You may not use JLD funds to pay students whose jobs were located and developed through the JLD Program; locate and develop jobs at your school or other eligible schools; place students upon graduation; and displace employees or impair existing service contracts. A school is expected to generate total student wages exceeding the total amount of the federal funds spent under JLD. Federal share limitation You may use federal FWS funds to pay up to 80% of the allowable costs in the JLD program (listed under Allowable program costs ). Your school must provide the remaining 20% of allowable costs either in cash or in services. This requirement, unlike the institutional-share requirement for FWS earnings, cannot be waived. Your school's 20% share may be either (1) 20% of each allowable cost, or (2) varying percentages of allowable costs, as long as its total expenditures of institutional funds and/or provision of services equals at least 20% of the total allowable costs for the JLD Program. You must maintain records that indicate the amount and sources of your school's matching share. Procedures and records requirements for JLD are the same as those for all Campus-Based Programs.TIPUse of JLD funds 34 CFR 675.35(b)(3) Federal and institutional shares 34 CFR 675.33(b) & (c) Prohibition on using funds on campus 34 CFR 675.35(a)(3)(i) Maximum federal funds for JLD Programs 34 CFR 675.32 JLD limits Effective August 14, 2008, the amount of FWS funds institutions of higher education may use for the JLD Program increases to not more than 10% or $75,000 of their FWS allocations. HEOA section 445 section program costs Allowable costs of carrying out the JLD Program include staff salaries (and fringe benefits, if they are the same as those paid to other institutional employees in comparable positions and are not paid to a student employed through the FWS Program); travel expenses related to JLD activities; printing and mailing costs for brochures about the JLD Program; JLD telephone charges, including installation of a separate line for off-campus employers; JLD costs for supplies, equipment, and furniture; newspaper or other types of advertising that inform potential employers of the services JLD offers; and JLD workshops for students and employers. Costs that are not allowable are costs related to purchasing, constructing, or altering the facilities that house a JLD project. Indirect administrative costs also are not allowable. One example of an indirect administrative cost is a portion of the salary of someone who is not directly involved in the program, such as the JLD director's supervisor. Other examples of indirect administrative costs are lighting, heating, or custodial costs incurred as part of the normal operations of the facility in which the JLD program is administered, such as the financial aid or placement offices. Students as staff in the JLD Program office The prohibition against using JLD funds to locate and develop jobs at any school does not mean that your school is also prohibited from employing FWS and non-FWS students as staff in the JLD Program office. Your school may employ FWS and non-FWS students as staff in the JLD Program office as long as you do not use JLD funds to locate and develop these jobs. For example, your school could use the FWS Program to employ an FWS student as a staff member in the JLD Program office. If your school places an FWS student as staff in the JLD Program office, there are some important points to note. The statute and the FWS regulations prohibit the use of any funds allocated under the FWS Program from being used to pay the institutional share of FWS compensation to its students. Hence, your school may not use federal JLD funds to pay the institutional share of FWS wages earned by an FWS student working as staff in the JLD Program office. Instead, you must use your school's funds to pay the institutional share of these wages.Allowable costs 34 CFR 675.33(a) TIPCounting an Employee's Salary Toward a School's Institutional Match The portion of an employee's salary earned while performing activities in the JLD program may be considered part of the school's required institutional match. The amount of the employee's salary a school can apply toward its institutional match depends on the salary of the em - ployee and how much time he or she spends in developing qualifying jobs. For example, if the employee's salary were $50,000 and he or she spent one out of five days a week\u2014or 20% of his or her time\u2014in JLD activities, the maximum amount of the employee's salary that your school could apply toward your institu - tional match would be $50,000 X 20% = $10,000. Note that in a program review, a school could be required to document the time the employee worked developing new off-campus jobs; and in any year in which the school spent a portion of its federal funds toward developing new off-campus (including community service) jobs for students, some new qualifying jobs were actually created.Chapter 2\u2014The JLD Programs Your school may enter a written agreement with other eligible schools for those schools to establish and operate a JLD Program for its students. The agreement must designate the administrator of the program and must specify the terms, conditions, and performance standards of the program. Each school that is part of the agreement retains responsibility for properly disbursing and accounting for the federal funds it contributes under the agreement. For example, each school must show that its own students have earned wages that exceed the amount of federal funds the school contributed to locate and develop those jobs. This fiscal information must be reported on each school's FISAP. If your school uses federal funds to contract with another school, suitable performance standards must be part of that contract. Perfor - mance standards should reflect each school's philosophy, policies, and goals for the JLD Program. You may not develop performance standards, conditions, or terms that are inconsistent with the statute or regulations. In all cases, the performance standards should be clearly understandable, because they will be included in the formal written agreement that each party must observe as part of its responsibility within the particular ar - rangement. Use of JLD program funds to develop apprenticeship programs A school is permitted to use a portion of the FWS funds it allocates for locating and developing off-campus job opportunities to identify apprenticeship opportunities and help employers develop jobs that are part of apprenticeship programs\u2014regardless of whether the students are recipients of federal student aid. JLD Reporting on the FISAP If your school participates in the JLD Program during an award year, you must provide information about its JLD activities on the FISAP. You must report the total JLD expenditures, federal expenditures for JLD, institutional expenditures for JLD, number of students for whom jobs were located or developed, and total earnings for those students. Your school may not include student staff jobs in the JLD office on the FISAP in the JLD section for reporting the count of students and the earnings of students for whom jobs were located or developed through the JLD Program. However, if your school used its own funds to pay the in - stitutional share of wages for student staff jobs, you may count those funds in meet - ing the minimum 20% institutional-share requirement for Program is separate from the FWS Program and schools qualifying to participate in the Work-Colleges Program receive a separate Campus-Based funding allocation in addition to their FWS allocation. The term \"work college\" is defined as an eligible school that has been a public or private nonprofit, four-year, degree- granting institution with a commitment to community service; has operated a comprehensive work-learning-service program as described below for at least two years; requires resident students, including at least one-half of all students who are enrolled on a full-time basis, to participate in a comprehensive work-learning-service program for at least five hours each week, or at least 80 hours during each period of enrollment (except summer school), unless the student is engaged in a school-organized or approved study abroad or externship program; and provides students participating in the comprehensive work- learning-service program with the opportunity to contribute to their education and to the welfare of the community as a whole. A comprehensive student work-learning-service program is a student work-service program that is an integral and stated part of the institution's educational philosophy and program; requires participation of all resident students for enrollment and graduation; includes learning objectives, evaluation, and a record of work performance as part of the student's college record; provides programmatic leadership by college personnel at levels comparable to traditional academic programs; recognizes the educational role of work-learning-service supervisors; and includes consequences for nonperformance or failure in the work-learning-service program similar to the consequences for failure in the regular academic program.Additional citations The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 introduced the term \"work-learning- service\" and revised the definition of \"Work- Colleges.\" HEOA 447 HEA section 448Work-Colleges C Purpose 34 CFR 675.43 Definition 34 CFR 675.41 Application to participate Work-Colleges Program DCL Additional Rules and Requirements for Work Colleges Work Colleges must provide a minimum dollar-for-dollar institutional match for all jobs in the Work- Colleges Program. Unlike the FWS Program, there are no exceptions to this matching requirement. This includes (but is not limited to) those exceptions for the FWS Federal share discussed in Chapter 1. For example, a student performing reading tutor or family literacy activities under the Work- Colleges Program must still be paid with funds that are matched by the school on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Work Colleges may transfer up to 100% of their FWS (initial plus supplemental) to their Work-College allocation. All FWS funds transferred to the Work-College Program must be matched dollar for dollar. If a school transfers a portion or all of its FWS allocation into the Work-Colleges Program, the funds must be used for the purpose of carrying out the Work-Colleges Program to provide flexibility in strengthening the self-help-through-work element. A school may not transfer any of its Work-College allocation to the FSEOG Program. A school may carry forward and carry back up to 10% of its allocated Work-College funds. Work Colleges receive an allocation under the FWS Program and another allocation under the Work- Colleges Program. The school must set up two accounting records, one for each of these programs. (This is true even though the allocation for the FWS Program and the Work-Colleges allocation are in one G5 account.) If a school transfers a portion or all of its FWS allocation into the Work-Colleges Program, the accounting records for each program must clearly show that transfer. A school may only award and pay funds under the Work-Colleges Program to students who have a financial need. Students without financial need and students whose need has been met through other financial assistance must be paid with institutional funds only. Under the Work-Colleges Program, there is no limit for JLD activities. However, when performing JLD activities under the Work-Colleges Program the match is always on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Under both the FWS Program and the Work-Colleges Program, a school may receive the regular administrative cost allowance based on total compensation paid to eligible students (5% for the first $2,750,000 spent under campus-based, etc). However, in this case you may not claim funds twice by also using the separate Work-Colleges allowable administrative allowance to pay for the same costs. In their administration of a Work-College Program, schools must adhere to all of the applicable FWS regulations in 34 Allowable program costs Allocated program funds may be used to support the educational costs of students through self-help provided under the work-learning-service program within the limits of their demonstrated financial need; promote the work-learning-service experience as a tool of edu - cation and community service; carry out FWS and JLD program activities; administer, develop, and assess comprehensive work-learning- service programs; coordinate and carry out joint projects and activities to pro - mote learning through work-service; and conduct a comprehensive longitudinal study of academic prog - ress and academic and career outcomes.Allowable Model Off-Campus Agreement The paragraphs below are suggested as models for the development of a written agreement between a school and a federal, state, or local public agency or a private nonprofit organization that employs students who are attending that school and who are participating in the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. Institutions and agencies or organizations may devise additional or substitute paragraphs as long as they are not inconsistent with the statute or regulations. This agreement is entered into between ____________, hereinafter known as the \"Institution, \" and _______________, hereinafter known as the \"Organization, \" a (federal, state, or local public agency), (private nonprofit orga - nization), (strike one), for the purpose of providing work to students eligible for the Federal Work-Study [FWS] Program. Schedules to be attached to this agreement from time to time must be signed by an authorized official of the institution and the organization and must include the following: 1. brief descriptions of the work to be performed by students under this agreement 2. the total number of students to be employed 3. the hourly rates of pay 4. the average number of hours per week each student will work These schedules will also state the total length of time the project is expected to run, the total percent, if any, of student compensation that the organization will pay to the institution, and the total percent, if any, of the cost of employer's payroll contribution to be borne by the organization. The institution will inform the organization of the maximum number of hours per week a student may work. Students will be made available to the organization by the institution to perform specific work assignments. Students may be removed from work on a particular assignment or from the organization by the institution, either on its own initiative or at the request of the organization. The organization agrees that no student will be denied work or subjected to different treatment under this agreement on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or sex. It further agrees that it will comply with the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352; 78 Stat. 252) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-318) and the Regulations of the Department of Education that implement those acts. Two examples of off-campus agreements are included to provide additional guidance. Where appropriate, any of the following three paragraphs or other provisions may be included. 1. Transportation for students to and from their work assignments will be provided by the organization at its own expense and in a manner acceptable to the institution. 2. Transportation for students to and from their work assignments will be provided by the institution at its own expense. 3. Transportation for students to and from their work assignments will not be provided by either the institution or the organization.Volume Sample language to specify employer Whether the institution or the organization will be considered the employer of the students covered under the agreement depends upon the specific arrangement as to the type of supervision exercised by the organization. It is advisable to include some provision to indicate the intent of the parties as to who is considered the employer. As appropriate, one of the two paragraphs below may be included. Although the following paragraphs attempt to fix the identity of the employer, they will not necessarily be determinative if the actual facts indicate otherwise. Additional wording that specifies the employer's responsibility in case of injury on the job may also be advisable, since federal funds are not available to pay for hospital expenses or claims in case of injury on the job. In this connection, it may be of interest that one or more insurance firms in at least one state have, in the past, been willing to write a workers' compensation insurance policy that covers a student's injury on the job, regardless of whether it is the institution or the organization that is ultimately determined to have been the student's employer when the student was injured. 1. The institution is considered the employer for purposes of this agreement. It has the ultimate right to control and direct the services of the students for the organization. It also has the responsibility to determine whether the students meet the eligibility requirements for employment under the Federal Work-Study Program, to assign students to work for the organization, and to determine that the students do, in fact, perform their work. The organization's right is limited to direction of the details and means by which the result is to be accomplished. 2. The organization is considered the employer for purposes of this agreement. It has the right to control and direct the services of the students, not only as to the result to be accomplished, but also as to the means by which the result is to be accomplished. The institution is limited to determining whether the students meet the eligibility requirements for employment under the Federal Work-Study Program, to assigning students to work for the organization, and to determining that the students do perform their work. Sample language to specify responsibility for payroll disbursements and payment of employers' payroll contributions Compensation of students for work performed on a project under this agreement will be disbursed\u2014and all payments due as an employer's contribution under state or local workers' compensation laws, under federal or state Social Security laws, or under other applicable laws, will be made\u2014by the (organization) (institution) (strike one). If appropriate, any of the following paragraphs may be included: 1. At times agreed upon in writing, the organization will pay to the institution an amount calculated to cover the organization's share of the compensation of students employed under this agreement. 2. In addition to the payment specified in paragraph (1) above, at times agreed upon in writing, the organization will pay, by way of reimbursement to the institution, or in advance, an amount equal to any and all payments required to be made by the institution under state or local workers' compensation laws, or under federal or state Social Security laws, or under any other applicable laws, on account of students participating in projects under this agreement. 3. At times agreed upon in writing, the institution will pay to the organization an amount calculated to cover the federal share of the compensation of students employed under this agreement and paid by the organization. Under this arrangement, the organization will furnish to the institution for each payroll period the following records for review and retention: a) Time reports indicating the total hours worked each week in clock time sequence and containing the supervisor's certification as to the accuracy of the hours reported. b) A payroll form identifying the period of work, the name of each student, each student's hourly wage rate, the number of hours each student worked, each student's gross pay, all deductions and net earnings, and the total federal share applicable to each payroll.* and c) Documentary evidence that students received payment for their work, such as photographic copies of canceled checks. 1. * These forms, when accepted, must be countersigned by the institution as to hours worked and the accuracy of the total federal share to be reimbursed to the organization or agency.Chapter 2\u2014The Federal Nonprofit _____For-profit Description of Clients Served: _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ 3. _____Part-time paid staff _____Student employees _____Volunteers 6.

Has your agency hired students through the Federal Work-Study Program in the past? Crediting a student's account at the institution. (1) If the institution obtains the student's authorization described in paragraph (d) of this section, the institution may use the FWS funds to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy (i) Current year charges for (A) Tuition and fees; (B) Board, if the student contracts with the institution for board; (C) Room, if the student contracts with the institution for room; and (D) Other educationally related charges incurred by the student at the institution; and (ii) Prior award year charges with the restriction provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a total of not more than $200 for (A) Tuition and fees, room, or board; and (B) Other institutionally related charges incurred by the student at the institution. (2) If the institution is using FWS funds in combination with other Title IV, HEA program funds to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy prior award year charges, a single $200 total prior award year charge limit applies to the use of all the Title IV, HEA program funds for that purpose. (c) Credit balances. Whenever an institution disburses FWS funds by crediting a student's account and the result is a credit balance, the institution must pay the credit balance directly to the student as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days after the credit balance occurred on the account. (d) Student authorizations. (1) Except for the noncash contributions allowed under paragraph (e)(2) and (3) of this section, if an institution obtains written authorization from a student, the institution may (i) Use the student's FWS compensation to pay for charges described in paragraph (b) of this section that are included in that authorization; and (ii) Except if prohibited by the Secretary under the reimbursement or cash monitoring payment method, hold on behalf of the student any FWS compensation that would otherwise be paid directly to the student under paragraph (c) of this section.(2) In obtaining the student's authorization to perform an activity described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an institution (i) May not require or coerce the student to provide that authorization; (ii) Must allow the student to cancel or modify that authorization at any time; and (iii) Must clearly explain how it will carry out that activity. (3) A student may authorize an institution to carry out the activities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the period during which the student is enrolled at the institution. (4) ( i) If a student modifies an authorization, the modification takes effect on the date the institution receives the modification notice. (ii) If a student cancels an authorization to use his or her FWS compensation to pay for authorized charges under paragraph (b) of this section, the institution may use those funds to pay only those authorized charges incurred by the student before the institution received the notice. (iii) If a student cancels an authorization to hold his or her FWS compensation under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the institution must pay those funds directly to the student as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days after the institution receives that notice. (5) If an institution holds excess FWS compensation under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the institution must (i) Identify the amount of funds the institution holds for each student in a subsidiary ledger account designed for that purpose; (ii) Maintain, at all times, cash in its bank account in an amount at least equal to the amount of FWS compensation the institution holds for the student; and (iii) Notwithstanding any authorization obtained by the institution under this paragraph, pay any remaining balances by the end of the institution's final FWS payroll period for an award year.Crediting FWS Funds to Students' Accounts and Paying Credit Balances6-89 FSA HB June 2018Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program CHAPTERC 3 The Federal Perkins Loan Program included Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans (NDSLs), and National Defense Student Loans (Defense Loans). Perkins Loans were low-interest, long-term loans made through school financial aid offices to help needy under - graduate and graduate students pay for postsecondary education. CFR Glossary DCL THE FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM The Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins) Program included Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans (NDSLs), and National Defense Student Loans (Defense Loans). No new Defense Loans were made after July 1, 1972, but a few are still in repayment. Though no new Perkins Loans are being made, if an eligible undergraduate student borrower received a disbursement of a Perkins Loan after June 30, 2017, and before October 1, 2017 the student could have received subsequent disbursements of that Perkins Loan for the 2017-2018 award year. Level of expenditure (LOE) The Federal Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 prohibits making new Federal Perkins Loans after September 30, 2017. No disbursements of Federal Perkins Loans are permitted beyond June 30, 2018. Therefore, schools are no longer able to enter a request for an LOE on their school's FISAP. However, schools are permitted to charge allowable collection costs to the Perkins Revolving Fund as allowed under 34 CFR 674.47. EXCESS LIQUID CAPITAL Due to the wind-down of the Perkins Loan Program, the Department will not be collecting Excess Liquid Capital from a school's Perkins Loan Revolving Fund after the 2017-2018 award year. This process is being replaced by a similar process, the Distribution of Assets Process . Please refer to the section below for additional information regarding returning the federal share to the Department.The Federal Perkins Loan Program 34 CFR Part Glossary DCL DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS FROM THE FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN REVOLVING FUND The Extension Act amended HEA section 466(a). The HEA now requires each school participating in the Perkins Loan Program to return to the Department the Federal share of the school's Perkins Loan Revolving Fund (fund). The Department will begin collecting the federal share of schools' funds following the submission of the 2019-2020 FISAP. The process we will use to determine the federal share of the Perkins Loan Revolving Fund that must be returned to the Department and the institutional share, which must be removed and returned to the institu - tion, will be similar to the Excess Liquid Capital (ELC) process the Department currently has in place in accordance with HEA section 466(c). It is important to note that the upcoming Perkins Loan Revolving Fund asset distribution process accounts for changes in the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) matching requirements that have occurred over time, as well as any overmatching by the institution. We also take into consideration any Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) that has been previously returned by the institution to the Department, and any ICC that was previously returned to the institution. We will not take into con - sideration unreimbursed cancellation amounts in determining the federal share of the revolving funds to be returned to the Department because HEA section 465(b) prohibits the use of funds appropriated for FCCs from being used for cancellation reimbursement. Because schools may choose to continue servicing their Perkins Loans, the process of requiring the distribution of assets from the Perkins Loan Revolving Fund will continue on an annual basis, until such time as all of the outstanding Perkins Loans held by the school have been paid in full or otherwise fully retired, or assigned to and accepted by the Department. Schools that choose to continue servicing their outstanding Perkins Loan portfolios must continue to service these loans in accor - dance with the Perkins Loan Program regulations in 34 CFR part 674, and must also continue to report on their outstanding loan portfolio to the Department annually, using the FISAP. Because schools may no longer advance funds to students, they may no longer claim an administrative cost allowance against their school's Perkins Loan Revolving Fund.NEWChapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-91FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL To ensure accuracy in processing the payment made by a school, the school should follow the instructions for \"Returning Perkins Funds\" that are located on IFAP on the Campus-Based-Processing Information web - page: ifap.ed.gov/cbpmaterials/attachments/ InstructionsForReturningPerkinsFunds.pdf The Department strongly encourages institutions to return the federal share through the G5 miscellaneous refund functionality. For schools that have to submit payment by check, the school must follow the process and steps as written in the instructions that include sending an email to Perkinsliquid@ed.gov, notifying the Department that a check has been sent. MAKING A PERKINS LOAN Under the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015, the authority to make new Perkins Loans to eligible students expired on September 30, 2017. Schools were permitted to advance subsequent disbursements to borrowers for loans first disbursed between July 1, 2017, and September 30, 2017, through June 30, 2018. For questions regarding making a Perkins Loan prior to the deadlines specified in the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015, please refer to Volume 6, Chapter 3 of the 2017-2018 Federal Student Aid Handbook. PERKINS PROMISSORY NOTE The promissory note is the legally binding document that is evidence of a borrower's indebtedness to a school. The note includes in - formation about the loan's interest rate, repayment terms, and minimum rates of repayment; deferment, forbearance, and cancellation provisions; credit bureau reporting; and late charges, attorney fees, collections costs, and consequences of default. You must ensure that each Perkins Loan is supported by a legally enforceable promissory note. If the school does not have a valid note or other written evidence that would be upheld in a court of law, the school has no recourse against a borrower who defaults. Two examples of invalid notes are notes that have been changed after they were signed and notes without proper signatures or dates. If a school does not have a valid promissory note or other written records (disbursement records or other proof the borrower received the loan), it may have to repay to its Perkins Loan Fund any amounts loaned, as well as any Administrative Cost Allowance (ACA) claimed on those amounts. The school can seek to recover the amount repaid from the borrower.MPN Promissory Note 34 CFR 674.31 If an error is discovered in a promissory note, the school should ob - tain legal advice about what action it should take. The appropriate school official and the student should sign or initial all approved changes in the note. When the borrower has fully repaid the Perkins Loan, your school must either notify the borrower in writing, or mark the original note \"paid in full\" and return it to the borrower. Your school must keep a copy of the note for at least three years after the date the loan was paid in full. Remember, when a loan has been repaid, your school must update the loan's status in NSLDS. Single vs. multiyear use of the Master Promissory Note (MPN) The MPN for the Perkins Loan Program is a promissory note under which the borrower received loans for a single award year or multiple award years. Because the MPN was used to award Federal Perkins Loans on a mul - tiyear basis, there is no box for loan amount or loan period on the note. If you used the Federal Perkins MPN as a single award year promissory note, the borrower must have signed a new MPN each award year. When used as a multiyear note, the borrower should have signed the MPN only once\u2014before the first disbursement of the borrower's first Federal Per - kins Loan. While the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 prohibits any new loans after September 30, 2017, you may have made Perkins Loans un - der an MPN for up to 10 years from the date the borrower signed the MPN. However, the first disbursement must have been be made within 12 months of the date the borrower signed the MPN. If no disbursements were made within that 12-month period, the borrower must have signed another MPN before receiving a Perkins Loan. In addition, no further loans could have been made under an MPN after a school received written notice from the borrower requesting that the MPN no longer be used as the basis for additional loans, or after September 30, 2017.Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-93FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Retaining the electronic MPN (eMPN) If the student completed an eMPN, your school must maintain the original electronic promissory note, plus a certification and other supporting information regarding the creation and maintenance of any electronically-signed Perkins Loan promissory note or MP). Your school must provide this certification to the Department, upon request, should it be needed to enforce an assigned loan. Schools and lenders are required to maintain the electronic promissory note and supporting documentation for at least three years after all loan obligations evidenced by the note are satisfied . REIMBURSEMENT OF THE PERKINS LOAN FUND The Department may require your school to reimburse its Perkins Loan fund for any outstanding balance on an overpayment or a defaulted loan for which your school failed to record or retain the promissory note, record disbursements, or exercise due diligence. If your school is required to reimburse its fund, your school must also reimburse the Perkins Loan fund for the amount of the administrative cost allowance claimed on any reimbursed portion of a loan. You do not have to reimburse the Perkins Loan fund if your school can recover the defaulted loan or show the Department that the borrower would not have paid the loan even if your school properly exercised due diligence. Also, you should not reimburse the Perkins Loan fund for loans on which your school obtains a judgment. Required coordination process When a student ceases to be enrolled at least half time, he or she immediately enters grace or repayment. Your school must have a process for coordinating between the office that tracks enrollment status, the financial aid office, and the office that manages or coordinates the servicing of your Federal Perkins Loan portfolio. You must have a coordinating official who is responsible for ensuring that such information is shared among the offices that need it. For example, the office that tracks enrollment status must alert the coordinating official when a student's enrollment status drops below half time. The coordinating official then notifies the financial aid and business office. For a more detailed discussion of the coordinating official , see Volume 2.Reimbursement for overpayments or default 34 CFR & Requirement Schools and third-party servicers are required to report new loans or update data on existing loans to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) on a monthly basis . It is ultimately the school's responsibility to ensure that its required reporting to NSLDS (which includes Per - kins loan account detail) is completed timely and accurately. Schools that use a third-party servicer must communicate the reporting requirements to its third-party servicer and ensure that its servicer com - plies with timely and accurate reporting. It is important for schools to understand that they will be responsible for any non- compliance by the servicer. Perkins NSLDS reporting 34 CFR 674.1 6(j) You must report enrollment and loan status information to nsldsfap.ed.gov according to the schedule published in the NSLDS Reporting Guide. For NSLDS assistance call 1-800-999-8219 or send an email to NSLDS@ed.gov.Credit bureau reporting Your school or its servicer should have reported each Federal Perkins Loan to at least one of the three national credit bureaus (see sidebar) with which the Department has an agreement or to a local credit bureau that is affiliated with one of those three credit bureaus. You should have reported the following information: the amount and date of each disbursement; repayment information and collection of the loan until the loan is paid in full; and the date the loan was repaid, canceled, or discharged for any reason. You must continue to report changes to information previously reported to the same credit bureau(s) to which the information was originally reported until the loan is repaid, transferred, or otherwise satisfied. You must report those changes in the month that they occur. NSLDS reporting Schools with active Federal Perkins Loans (including National Direct Student Loans and National Defense Student Loans) are required to update data on existing loans to NSLDS once a month on a schedule established by the Department. Data providers must meet all NSLDS reporting requirements as detailed in the NSLDS Federal Perkins Data Provider Instructions (Version 8) at ifap.ed.gov/nsldsmaterials/attachments/FederalPerkinsDPInstructVer8.pdfChapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-95FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL PERKINS RECORDKEEPING Perkins Loan records a school must maintain include, but are not limited to the following: the promissory note; documentation of the amount of a Perkins Loan, its payment period, and the calculations used to determine the amount of the loan; documentation of the date and amount of each disbursement of Perkins Loan funds; and information collected during exit loan counseling as required by the Perkins Loan regulations. You must maintain the original promissory note signed by the student until the loan is satisfied. If the original promissory note is released for the purpose of enforcing repayment, the school must keep a certified true copy. To qualify as a certified true copy, a photocopy (front and back) of the original promissory note must bear a certification state - ment signed by the appropriate school official. A school must keep original paper promissory notes or original paper MPNs and repayment schedules in a locked, fireproof container. If your school uses an electronic Perkins Loan promissory note, it must maintain an affidavit or certification regarding creation and maintenance of the electronic note, including its authentication and signature processes. If a promissory note was signed electronically, the school must store it electronically and the promissory note must be retrievable in a coherent format. When the borrower has fully repaid a Perkins Loan, your school must either return the original or a true and exact copy of the note marked \"paid in full\" to the borrower, or otherwise notify the borrower in writing that the loan is paid in full. Your school must keep the original or a copy of the promissory note for at least three years after the date the loan was paid in full. An original electronically signed MPN must also be retained by the school for three years after all the loans made on the MPN are satisfied. A school must maintain records pertaining to cancellations of Defense, NDSL, and Federal Perkins Loans separately from its other Perkins records.Clarification Perkins Record Retention 34 CFR DCL EXIT COUNSELING Schools making Perkins Loans are required to conduct exit counseling. Your school should conduct exit interviews with borrowers either in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. (If you conduct exit interviews through interactive electronic means, you should take reasonable steps to ensure that each student bor - rower receives the materials and participates in and completes the exit interview.) Schools should conduct this interview shortly before the borrower graduates or drops below half-time enrollment (if known in advance). If individual interviews are not possible, group interviews are acceptable. Your school may employ third-party servicers to provide Perkins Loan borrowers with exit interviews. In the case of correspondence study, distance education, and students in the study-abroad portion of a program, you may provide written interview materials by mail within 30 days after the borrower completes the program. If you elect to conduct exit counseling through interactive electronic means, the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower receives the required materials and participates in and completes the exit counseling. Some of the material presented at the entrance counseling session will again be presented during exit counsel - ing. The suggested emphasis for exit counseling shifts, however, to more specific information about loan repayment and debt-management strate - gies. The financial aid or business office professional must emphasize the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the borrower is assuming, describing the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, litigation, and referral to a collection agency. The counselor must further emphasize that the borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower has not completed the program, is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissat - isfied with the school's educational or other services. If a borrower withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or fails to complete an exit counseling session, the school must provide exit counseling through either interactive electronic means or by mailing counseling material to the borrower at the borrower's last known address within 30 days after learning that the borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to complete exit counseling.Exit counseling requirements 34 CFR 674.42(b) HEA section 485(b)(1)(A) Exit Interviews for Students Enrolled in a Correspondence or Study-Abroad Program In the case of students enrolled in a correspondence program or a study- abroad program that your school ap - proves for credit, you may provide written counseling materials by mail within 30 days after the borrower completes the program.Exit interviews 34 CFR 674.42(b)Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-97FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Required elements of exit counseling Review terms and conditions of the loan including the current interest rate, the applicable grace period, and the approximate date the first installment payment will be due. Inform the student as to the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student's indebtedness or on the average indebtedness of students who have obtained Federal Perkins Loans for attendance at the school or in the borrower's program of study. We recommend giving the borrower a sample loan repayment schedule based on his or her total indebtedness. A loan repayment schedule usually will provide more information than just the expected monthly payment\u2014for instance, it would show the varying monthly amounts expected in a graduated repayment plan. Suggest debt-management strategies that would facilitate repayment. Stress the importance of developing a realistic budget based on the student's minimum salary requirements. It's helpful to have the student compare these costs with the estimated monthly loan payments and to emphasize that the loan payment is a fixed cost, like rent or utilities. Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the borrower is assuming. Provide a general description of the types of tax benefits that might be available to borrowers. Explain options the borrower has to change repayment plans. Explain the use of an MPN. Explain options the borrower has to prepay a loan without penalty. Provide information on forbearance provisions and a general description of terms and conditions under which the borrower may defer repayment of principal or interest or be granted an extension of the repayment period. Provide information on loan forgiveness and cancellation and the conditions under which the borrower may obtain full or partial forgiveness or cancellation of principal and interest.Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-98FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Describe the consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, federal offset, and litigation. We also recommend that you tell the borrower of the charges that might be imposed for delinquency or default, such as the school's collection expenses, late charges, and attorney's fees. Defaulters often find that repayment schedules for loans that have been accelerated are more stringent than the original repayment schedule. A defaulter is no longer eligible for any deferment provisions, even if he or she would otherwise qual - ify. Finally, a defaulter's federal and state tax refunds may be seized and wages garnished, and the borrower loses eligibility for any further funding from the FSA programs. Emphasize that the borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even if the borrower has not completed the program, is unable to obtain employment upon comple - tion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services that the borrower purchased from the school. Require the borrower to provide current information concerning name, address, Social Security number, references, and driver's license number; and the borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the borrower's expected employer. Remind the borrower that, in a timely manner, he or she must inform the school of any changes to the aforemen - tioned information. Remind the borrower of the existence and purpose of the FSA Ombudsman Group. The FSA Ombudsman Group is a resource for borrowers when other approaches to resolving stu - dent loan problems have failed. Inform the borrower of the availability of FSA loan information in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS at nslds.ed.gov). Review the opportunity for and effects of loan consolidation. Note: As part of the exit information, you must collect the name and address of the borrower's expected employer.Information on Consolidating Perkins Loans Consolidation offers a Perkins borrower options the borrower does not have under the Perkins regulations alone. During exit counseling, a school must also include information on the consequences of consolidating a Perkins Loan, including the effects of the consolidation on total interest to be paid, fees, and length of repayment; the effect on a borrower's underlying loan benefits, which includes grace periods, loan forgiveness, cancellation, and deferment; and the option the borrower has to prepay the loan or to select a different repay - ment plan .Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-99FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Disclosure of repayment information Either shortly before the borrower ceases at least half-time study or during the exit interview, schools must disclose critical repayment information to the borrower in a written statement. Most of the repay - ment terms that the school must disclose to the borrower already appear in the promissory note. The school must also provide the borrower with the information listed under Required elements of exit counseling earlier in this chapter . If your school exercises the minimum monthly payment option, you must inform the borrower that if he or she wants your school to coordinate payments with another school, he or she must request such coordination. If a borrower enters the repayment period without the school's knowledge, the school must provide the required disclosures to the borrower in writing immediately upon discovering that the borrower has entered the repayment period.Disclosure of repayment information 34 CFR 674.42(a)FSA Ombudsman The Ombudsman Group is a resource for borrowers to use when other approaches to resolving student loan problems have failed. Borrowers should first attempt to resolve complaints by contacting the school, company, agency, or office directly involved. If the borrower has made a reasonable effort to resolve the problem through normal processes and has not been successful, he or she should contact the FSA Ombudsman. U.S. Department of Education Phone: 202-377-3800 Glossary DCL Repayment Information a School Must Disclose Schools participating in the Perkins Loan Program must disclose the following information in a written statement provided to the borrower either shortly before the borrower ceases at least half-time study at your school or during exit counseling. If the borrower enters the repayment period without the institution's knowledge, your school must provide the required disclosures to the borrower in writing immediately upon discovering that the borrower has entered the repayment period. The repayment information must include the following: 1. the name and address of the school to which the debt is owed and the name and address of the official or servicing agent to whom communications should be sent; 2. the name and address of the party to which payments should be sent; 3. the current balance owed by the borrower; 4. the stated interest rate on the loan; 5. the repayment schedule for all loans covered by the disclosure including the date the first installment payment is due, and the number, amount, and frequency of required payments; 6. an explanation of any special options the borrower may have for loan consolidation or other refinancing of the loan, and a statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or part of the loan at any time without penalty; 7. a description of the charges imposed for failure of the borrower to pay all or part of an installment when due; 8. a description of any charges that may be imposed as a consequence of default, such as liability for expenses reasonably incurred in attempts by the Secretary or the institution to collect on the loan; 9. the total interest charges which the borrower will pay on the loan pursuant to the projected repayment schedule; 10. the contact information of a party who, upon request of the borrower, will provide the borrower with a copy of his or her signed promissory note; 11. an explanation that if a borrower is required to make minimum monthly payments, and the borrower has received loans from more than one institution, the borrower must notify an institution if he or she wants the minimum monthly payment determination to be based on payments due to other institutions. 34 CFR 674.42(a)Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-101FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Review the opportunity for and effects of loan consolidation.

Your school must return the Federal share of its Revolving Fund (distribution of assets process) annually as instructed by the Department. Note : The Excess Liquid Capital process was replaced by the distribution of Assets process beginning with the 2018-2019 award year. WHEN A FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN IS CONSOLIDATED If a student with an outstanding Federal Perkins Loan from your school applies to have that loan consolidated, the Direct Loan Consolidation System (DLCS) will send you a Loan Verification Certificate (LVC). You have 10 days from the date of receipt to complete the LVC and return it to DLCS. Loans that have been subject to a judgement may not be consolidated. If DLCS makes the consolidation loan, you will receive the amount you indicated on the LVC plus interest. You must deposit the funds in the account holding your Federal Perkins Revolving Fund, record the deposit in the appropriate ledgers ( and contra accounts) , and report the payment on your next scheduled FISAP. If the amount you receive from DLCS is more than what is owed on the loan, you must return the overpayment to DLCS. You may not distribute any funds to the borrower. If the amount you receive is less than what is owed on the loan you must request the underpayment from DLCS. You may not bill the student DCL ENDING PARTICIPATION IN THE PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM A school must liquidate its Perkins Loan portfolio when the school voluntarily withdraws from the Perkins Loan Program, or Title IV participation; has had its eligibility to participate in the Perkins Loan Program or Title IV participation terminated by the Department; has not been approved by the Department for continued participation in the Perkins Loan Program or Title IV programs during the school's recertification process; or is closing. If your school is closing, please see procedures and guidance provided by the ED's School Participation Team at ifap.ed.gov/ifap/helpContactInformationDetailedList. jsp?contactname=School%20Participation%20Division The wind-down of the Perkins Loan Program does not require schools to assign Perkins Loans to the Department or to liquidate their Perkins Loan Revolving Funds. However, schools may choose to assign any Perkins Loan to the Department or liquidate their Perkins Loan Revolving Fund at any time. Assigning loans to the Department is just one of several steps in the process a school must complete in order to liquidate its Perkins Loan portfolio and complete the closeout of the program. A school's Perkins Loan portfolio is not considered liquidated unless it has received an official letter of completion from the Department.ClarificationChapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-105FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Steps for Schools Ending Participation in the Federal Perkins Loan Program (For complete instructions, see the new Perkins Loan Assignment and Liquidation Guide on IFAP .) Schools must use the Campus-Based Programs System in COD to initiate the process for Perkins liquidation and follow it through to completion. The Campus-Based System in COD guides schools through the liquidation and closeout process. Once a school has satisfactorily completed the liquidation and closeout process, the Department will post a Liquidation Completion Letter on the school's self-service page. The Department will also notify the school's financial aid office electronically that a school has satisfactorily completed the liquidation and closeout process Before beginning the liquidation process, a school must decide what its relationship will be with all third-party servicers it has been employing in managing its Perkins Loan program; communicate with those third-party servicers how the servicers will be utilized going forward (A school's third-party servicer may be obligated or contracted to assist with the process of assignment, including providing initial notification to borrowers and compiling loan data that will be used in completing assignment forms); If a third-party servicer is assisting a school with liquidation of its portfolio, the servicer must adhere to the assignment and liquidation process procedures as outlined in the Assignment and Liquidation Guide as posted on IFAP . It is important that schools and/or its servicer check the Campus-Based Resources page on IFAP to ensure it is referencing the latest Guide and materials on the Perkins Liquidation process. See additional information about third-party servicers in Step 2 below. recall outstanding loans the school has placed with outside collection and litigation firms. Step 1. Notify the Department of Education of Intent to Liquidate A school must submit its intent to liquidate electronically using the COD website. A school can log into COD and be - gin the liquidation and closeout process at any point during the program year. Step 2. Notify Borrowers A school must notify borrowers of the pending assignment of their Perkins Loan(s) to the Department. Borrowers should be given at least 30 day's notice. Loans should be submitted to the Department no later than 45 days from the date the school submitted their intent to liquidate. Sample Notification Dear Federal Perkins, Direct, or Defense Loan Borrower: We are writing to inform you that [ school name ] intends to cease participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program. As part of this process, your Federal Perkins (or NDSL or Defense) loans(s) will be assigned to and transferred to the Department of Education. Once the assignment of your Federal Perkins Loan(s) to the Department has been completed, \"ECSI,\" the Federal Perkins Loan Servicer will provide you with information on where to send your payments and how contact them if you need assistance. Please continue to make your payments to [ school name or servicer name ] until you receive the notification from ECSI. IMPORTANT: This information pertains ONLY to Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans and National Defense Student Loans .ClarificationVolume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-106FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Steps for Schools Ending Participation in the Federal Perkins Loan Program (continued) Third-party servicers must continue to bill and process loans that are in repayment. When a loan is submitted for assignment to the Department, the servicer should continue to bill and collect from the borrower until the loan is officially accepted for assignment. Third-party servicers should not stop collecting on loans in repayment prematurely and instead must wait until loans have been officially accepted for assignment. Third-party servicers must also continue to report changes to credit reporting agencies monthly until a loan is repaid, transferred, or otherwise satisfied. It is important that schools ensure their servicers receive copies of all official Acceptance Reports. If a loan has been submitted for assignment but not yet accepted, funds collected on a loan should be deposited immediately into the school's Perkins Program Fund to await official notification of acceptance. Upon notification that the loan has been accepted for assignment, the school must issue a check to the Department, including the borrower and loan information so that the borrower's records can be updated to reflect payment. A school/servicer should have reported every Perkins Loan to at least one of the three national credit bureaus with which the Department has an agreement or to a local credit bureau that is affiliated with one of those three credit bureaus. Step 3. Assign Loans to the Department of Education When a school liquidates its Perkins Loan portfolio, it must assign the remaining loans with outstanding balances to the Department for collection. A school must ensure that its loans are properly accounted for and updated in NSLDS. The school should request a Reconciliation Report from NSLDS when it begins the assignment process and reconcile its records against the report to ensure its portfolio has been accurately reported to NSLDS. Schools can request a reconciliation file report (REC005) online at NSLDSfap.ed.gov . Ultimately, the total amount of loans and number of borrowers the Department has in NSLDS should reconcile with what the school reports on its final FISAP . Following the assignment process and updating of NSLDS, the system should show that no open loans remain at the school. Schools can complete and submit assignments either manually by paper or electronically by using the Department's Perkins Loan Assignment System (PLAS). Step 4. Purchase Loans (if applicable) A school may be required to purchase loans that the Department will not accept for assignment. The Department will not accept a loan for assignment if the promissory note is missing or unsigned. All accounts deemed unenforceable by the Department will be rejected for assignment and returned to the school for purchase.Chapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-107FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Steps for Schools Ending Participation in the Federal Perkins Loan Program (continued) Step 5. Update NSLDS A school must update Perkins loan records in NSLDS, and complete its NSLDS reporting requirements in accor - dance with the instructions in the NSLDS Reporting Guide . For the purposes of Perkins liquidation and closeout, schools must ensure that all outstanding Perkins Loans are properly accounted for and updated in NSLDS\u2014NSLDS must reflect that all borrower loan accounts for a liquidating school are retired, accepted for assignment by the Department, or purchased by the school. It is a school's responsibility to ensure the required reporting to NSLDS (which includes Perkins Loan account detail) is completed on time and accurately. A school must complete its NSLDS reporting requirements in accordance with the instructions in the NSLDS Enrollment Reporting Guide and the Perkins Data Provider Instructions. Schools that utilize a third party servicer for billing, collecting, and reporting should communicate these requirements to its servicer. Step 6. Perkins Closeout Audit The school must schedule the Perkins closeout audit and provide a copy of the audit to Department when completed. A Perkins closeout audit is required as part of the liquidation process. Step 7. Remit the Federal Share A school must remit the federal share of the remaining Perkins cash from its Perkins Fund to the Department. Any federal share of remaining capital should be refunded electronically via G5 (g5.gov), using the G5 Miscellaneous Refunds option. Step 8. Final FISAP Data A school must continue to file its FISAP annually until it can report all final activity. \"Final\" activity consists of assigning any remaining loans with outstanding balances to the Department or reimbursing the Fund for the purpose of purchasing any loans that are not accepted by the Department, and the distribution of the final Fund capital (current cash) has been made. Schools that have yet to receive an Official Liquidation Completion letter from the Department at the time that annual FISAPs are due to be submitted must report Perkins data on its annual FISAP . Schools may be directed to report final FISAP data using Phase 4 of the Perkins online closeout form through the Campus-Based Processing COD system.

Visit the following for additional information: ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/attachments/092115PerkinsLoanAssignmentSys temSystemAvailandUserAccessInfoAttach.pdf Schools assigning loans should keep in mind that All Perkins loans that have been accepted for assignment by the Department are assigned without recompense. Any funds collected by the Department on assigned loans are the property of the United States. (A school loses access to the nonfederal portion of those Perkins Loans it assigns to the Department.) The Department will not reimburse the school's Federal Perkins Loan Fund for those loans. All rights, authorities, and privileges associated with the loan are transferred to the United States. The school is relieved of incurring additional expenses in at - tempting to collect on the loan. Assignment of defaulted loans does not affect the calculation of the school's Perkins Loan cohort default rate. The Department recognizes that a school may have exhausted all of its available collection options on some of its defaulted Perkins Loans and encourages schools to assign these loans to the Department so additional steps can be taken to recover the loan funds. The Department has collection tools that are not available to schools, such as administrative wage garnishment, Treasury offset, and litigation by the Department of Justice. The Department recommends schools assess older, defaulted loans that have been reported on their FISAP for years, take any necessary action, and consider assigning these to the Department.Required Assignment Documents 1.

The Assignment and Liquidation Guide includes information about the assignment process and information about the required processes for the liquidation of a school's Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) portfo - lio and Perkins Loan Revolving Fund (Fund). The following two process - es can assist a school with the assignment and liquidation of its loans: 1. Perkins Loan Assignment System (PLAS)\u2014 allows schools to submit Perkins Loan assignments electronically. The system is found at efpls.com . There is a chart that summarizes support - ing documentation that schools must provide when assigning Perkins Loan to the Department in Chapter 5. 2. Online Perkins Liquidation Module in the eCampus-Based section of COD System\u2014 streamlines the Perkins Loan liquidation process for schools and provides an accessible track - ing system for both schools and the Department of Education (the Department) to view and track the eventual closeout process of a school's Perkins Loan Program. Schools must use the eCampus-Based section of COD System to notify the Department of their intent to liquidate their portfolio and Fund and begin the liquidation process. To get started, a school would log in to the eCampus-Based section of COD System and select \"Perkins Liquidation\" from the menu choices on the left. Click on \"Intent and Close-out Form\" and follow the on-screen instructions. Other key features of the Perkins Liquida - tion Module include the following: The determination of the Federal and Institutional shares of the remaining cash in the Fund is now calculated as part of the Perkins Liquidation Module. Schools are given the opportunity to update the cash on hand amount prior to the calculation. The calcula - tion may include a liability for any amount of loans a school must purchase. The eCampus-Based section of COD System will post the Federal share amount owed to a school's self- service page in the eCampus-Based section of COD System with instructions for remitting payment to the Department. Once the Federal share amount has been received by the Department, schools will submit final FISAP data for the Perkins Loan Program.Perkins Loan Assignment System EA 2015-04-22 Electronic Processing Op - tion for Perkins Loan Assignments EA 2015-09-21 Perkins Loan Assignment System Navigating to the Updated Guide From the IFAP website home page at ifap.ed.gov/ifap/ Click on the Processing Resources box, and then click on the Campus-Based Processing Information link.

Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. (ET). You may also email the center at CODSupport@ed.gov . Payments received before the loan has been accepted If the loan has been submitted but not yet accepted and the school receives a payment, the school should deposit the funds immediately into its Perkins Program Fund and await official notification of acceptance. Upon acceptance of the account, the institution must issue a check to the Department, including the borrower and loan information noted previously so that the borrower records can be updated to reflect payment. Loans accepted for assignment Official Notification of Acceptance Report \u2014 When manual paper assignments are accepted, the school will receive a document identified as a Perkins Load Database Report (Acceptance Report) via email. The Acceptance Report is sent securely as an attachment from the email address productionprocessing@efpls.com. The subject line of the email is \"Acceptance Report\" and the body states that the attached is the acceptance report for date of batch submission. A password is sent from the same email address separately in order to open the reports. This report provides borrower identification information, school identification information, and outstanding principal, interest and fees accepted for assignment by the Department. This is the official Acceptance Report notice and should be retained in the school's records. Reminder NEWChapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-111FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL Schools that utilize a third-party servicer to complete NSLDS monthly reporting must ensure that the Acceptance Reports reports are provided to those servicers, and that the servicers update the loan status of accepted loans in NSLDS. Hard copies of the acceptance notices (Perkins Load Database Reports) may be sent to the address provided in the school's program participation agreement. The school should ensure that its mail distribution staff becomes familiar with these notices and the offices to which they should be distributed. Note : Schools that use PLAS for electronic submission can access information about accepted and rejected assignments through PLAS. These reports can be viewed online or printed from PLAS. Notification to borrowers of assigned loans A school must notify borrowers of the pending assignment of their loan(s) to the Department at least 30 days prior to assignment of the loan. This notification may result in payments from borrowers who have been unwilling to make payments in the past. If a payment is received, the school or its servicer s hould deposit the funds immediately into its Per - kins Program Fund and await official notification that the loan has been accepted for assignment. Payments received after the loan has been accepted Any payment the school or its servicer receives from a borrower after the borrower's account has been submitted to the Department for assignment and accepted by the Department should be forwarded as soon as possible to Department of Education ECSI Federal Perkins Loan Servicer P.O. Box 105765 Atlanta, GA 30348-5765 The Borrower Customer Service telephone number is 866-313-3797. Note: Courier services do not deliver to postal boxes. Therefore, we recommend using United States Postal Service registered mail. Each payment submission must clearly identify the borrower's full name, Social Security number, and the type of loan to which the payment is to be applied. The school's name and OPEID should also be included and easily 2018-20196-112FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL A school should not contact the Department to request the return of a submission because a borrower has made a payment to the school. Once a loan is submitted and accepted for assignment, it becomes the property of the Department. If the Department refuses to accept the loan for assignment, the school should correct any deficiencies and resub - mit the complete loan package including the additional information for assignment. Collection agency fees If a collection agency has deducted fees from borrower payments after the account has been submitted and accepted by the Department, the institution may not charge these fees to the Perkins Loan Fund. The entire borrower payment must be forwarded to the Department. CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING ON LOANS ACCEPTED FOR ASSIGNMENT Once a Perkins Loan has been accepted for assignment by the Department, a school or servicer that has previously reported a borrower's loan to a credit reporting agency MUST report to that agency that the loan has been transferred. In Field 17A the school or servicer should report the two digit code 05 (Transferred) AND enter the Special Comment Code AL (Student Loan \u2014 Permanently Assigned to Government ). In addition, when a school or servicer reports code 05, the school or servicer MUST also report, Field 21 (Current Balance ), Field 22 (Amount Past Due ), and Field 17B (Payment Rating ). Field 21 and Field 22 must always be reported as 0 . The acceptable values for the Payment Rating a school or servicer must enter in Field 17B are: 0 = Current account 1 = 30 - 59 days past due date 2 = 60 - 89 days past due date 3 = 90 - 119 days past due date 4 = 120 - 149 days past due date 5 = 150 - 179 days past due date 6 = 180 or more days past due date.ReminderChapter 3\u2014 Participating in and Making Loans in the Perkins Loan Program6-113FSA HB June 2018 CFR Glossary DCL SCHOOLS CAN SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT DATA ELECTRONICALLY Schools can complete the Perkins Loan Assignment Form online using the new PLAS.

You can find additional information about PLAS in Appendix A to this volume and on the DCL RETURNING FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM FUNDS TO THE DEPARTMENT Schools that need to return Federal Perkins Loan Program Funds to the Department should follow the instructions below. The preferred method for returning Perkins funds to the Department is to use the Department's G5 website (g5.gov), which allows you to electronically refund the money directly to the Department using the Miscellaneous Re - funds option. Utilizing G5 reduces chances for human error and processing delays. Electronic process (G5) for returning Perkins Loan funds to the Department The process for returning Perkins Loan Funds is as follows: 1. Log in to G5 at g5.gov . 2. Click on Payments. 3. Click on Create Refunds. 4. Under Refunds Creation, click on the Miscellaneous Refunds tab and select Continue. 5. On the Create Miscellaneous Refunds tab, enter the required details below and click continue to submit: a. Refund Amount b. Bank Account Information to be debited c. Select Appropriate Refund Type Perkins Excess Cash\u2014Use this type when returning the Federal Share of the Excess Liquid Capital. Perkins Liquidation\u2014Use this type when closing out your Perkins Loan Fund and returning the Federal Share at the end of the school's liquidation of the Excess Liquid Capital. Important : Schools must use the Miscellaneous Refunds option and select the appropriate Refund Type when returning Perkins Loan funds to the Department. This ensures the funds are properly applied under the Program and will be identified for nonliquidating schools as ELC or liquidating schools as Liquidation in our system.

In addition, the Federal Perkins Loan Program offers borrowers a variety of forbearance, deferment, and cancellation options. Finally, there are a number of situations that allow a Perkins, National Direct, or Defense Loan to be discharged. All of these topics are addressed in this chapter. Grace period Definitions 34 CFR 674.2 Prepayment 34 CFR 674.31(b)(4) Less than half-time grace periods 34 CFR 674.32 Grace periods for NDSLs Note that repayment of an NDSL made on or after October 1, 1980, begins six months after the date that the borrower drops be - low at least half-time enrollment. GRACE PERIODS A grace period is the period of time before the borrower must begin or resume repaying a loan. There are two kinds of grace periods for Perkins Loans: Initial grace period \u2014a nine-month grace period that immediately follows a period of enrollment and immediately precedes the date repayment is required to begin for the first time . A borrower is only entitled to one initial grace period. Post-deferment grace period \u2014a six-month grace period that follows any subsequent period of deferment. Initial grace periods A Perkins borrower is entitled to an initial grace period of nine consecutive months after dropping below half-time enrollment. If the borrower returns to school on at least a half-time basis before the nine months have elapsed, the initial grace period has not been used. The borrower is entitled to a full initial grace period (nine consecutive months) from the date that he or she graduates, withdraws, or drops below half-time enrollment again. Post-deferment grace periods A post-deferment grace period is the period of six consecutive months that immediately follows the end of a period of deferment and precedes the date on which the borrower must resume repayment on the loan. Neither the deferment nor the grace period is counted as part of the 10-year repayment DCL Deferment During Initial Grace Period If a borrower requests a deferment to begin during the initial grace period, the borrower must waive (in writing) his or her rights to the initial grace period. The request for a deferment alone is not suffi - cient documentation for a school to waive the initial grace period; the borrower must also acknowledge in writing that he or she wants the waiver. Approved leaves of absence 34 CFR 668.22 (c)(1)(v) and (vi); 34 CFR 668.22 (d)Except for hardship deferments on loans made before July 1, 1993, all deferments for all loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program have post-deferment grace periods of six consecutive months. Applicable grace period when student is attending less than half time A borrower who is attending less than half time and who has no outstanding Perkins Loans must begin repaying a new loan nine months from the date the loan is made or nine months from the date the student enrolled less than half time, whichever is earlier. (This nine-month period includes the date the loan was made.) A borrower who is attending less than half time and who has an outstanding Perkins Loan or NDSL must begin repayment on an additional loan when the next scheduled installment of the outstanding loan is due; there is no formal grace period or in-school deferment on the new loan. Calculating the grace period A grace period is always day specific\u2014an initial grace period begins the day after the day the borrower drops below half -time enrollment. Similarly, a post-deferment grace period begins on the day immediately following the day on which an authorized period of deferment ends. If a borrower has received loans with different grace periods (and dif - ferent deferment provisions), the borrower must repay each loan according to the terms of its promissory note; the borrower must pay the minimum monthly payment amount that applies to each loan that is not in a grace or deferment period. Grace period when student doesn't return from leave of absence Students granted approved leaves of absence retain their in-school status for FSA loans. However, if a student does not return from an approved leave of absence, the student's grace period begins the date the student began the leave of absence. (If the school is required to take attendance, the grace period begins on the last date of academic atten - dance.) For a student who does not return from an approved leave of absence, this withdrawal date might result in the exhaustion of some or all of the student's grace period. Leaves of absence no longer qualify as approved leaves of absence for FSA purposes unless the school explains the effects that the student's failure to return from an approved leave of absence might have on the student's loan repayment terms, including the exhaustion of some or all of the student's grace period.TIPChapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-119FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Use of Initial Grace Period Example: Student returns before initial grace period elapses Fenriz takes out a Perkins Loan in the fall quarter at Sims School of Botany but drops out of school for the winter quarter. He reenrolls as a half-time student in the summer session before the nine-month grace period has expired. Therefore, Fenriz is entitled to a full initial grace period once he again leaves school or drops below half-time status. Example: Different grace period for earlier loans Steve took out several Perkins Loans while attending New Frontier Community College (NFCC) and began repaying them nine months after graduating. Later, he enrolled in a bachelor's degree program at Old Ivy College and was able to defer his older Perkins Loans. He took out two additional Perkins Loans at Old Ivy. When Steve graduates from Old Ivy, he is entitled to an initial grace period (nine months) for his Perkins Loans at Old Ivy but must resume repaying his older Perkins Loans (from NFCC) at the end of the six-month post-deferment period. Exclusion for Reservists on Active Duty If a borrower is a member of the Armed Forces Reserve, the initial grace period does not include any period (up to three years) during which the borrower is ordered to active duty for more than 30 days, including the period necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available enrollment period. The period necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available en - rollment period may not exceed 12 months. The borrower must notify you of the beginning and end dates of his or her service and the date he or she resumes enrollment. A borrower who enrolls in a different educational program after returning from active duty is entitled to the same grace period benefits. A borrower who is in a grace period when called or ordered to active duty is entitled to a new grace period upon conclusion of the excluded period.Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-120FSA HB and Less Than Half-Time Enrollment Example: Perkins received while enrolled less than half time Paula started school full-time in September. She did not have an outstanding Perkins Loan or NDSL. In January, Paula dropped to one-quarter-time and in March, she received a Perkins Loan. Since Paula dropped below half-time enrollment before the Perkins Loan was made, Paula must begin repayment nine months after the date she dropped below half-time enrollment\u2014her first payment will be due in October. Example: Second Perkins Loan received while first loan is in repayment Jason had been making monthly payments on Perkins Loan #1, which went into repayment nine months after he completed a one-year program at a career school. He subsequently enrolled in a new program at a community college and received Perkins Loan (#2) in September. He was only enrolled one-quarter-time at the community college, so he was not eligible for in-school deferment. Jason's next payment on Loan #1 is due October 15. Jason will begin repaying Loan #2 at the same time. Remember that the repayment status of the outstanding loan determines the repayment status of the second loan. If the borrower's Perkins Loans have a six-month grace period, you must contact that borrower at the 90-day and 150-day points in the grace period. If the bor - rower's Perkins Loans have a nine-month grace period, you must also contact the borrower at the 240-day point. First contact: 90 days after the grace period begins The school or servicer must remind the borrower of the responsibility to comply with the terms of the loan, inform the borrower of the total outstanding amount on the loan account, including the principal and interest accruing over the remaining life of the loan, and notify the borrower of the date and amount of the first requested payment. Contacts with Borrowers During Perkins Grace Period Second contact: 150 days after the grace period begins The school or servicer must remind the borrower of the date and amount of the first requested payment. Third contact (nine-month grace periods only): 240 days after the grace period begins The school or servicer must remind the borrower of the date and amount of the first requested pay - ment.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-121FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Precollection activities during the grace period Collection procedures on the part of a school or its servicer begin on the day a student ceases to be enrolled at least half time. By performing certain pre-collection activities, a school or its servicer can increase the likelihood that a student will begin satisfactory repayment on his or her Federal Perkins Loan. The school must perform and maintain documentation substantiat - ing that it has contacted the borrower. 1. For Federal Perkins Loans, the school shall contact the bor - rower three times within the initial grace period. 2. For loans with a six-month initial or post-deferment grace period, the school shall contact the borrower twice during the grace period. 3. The school or its servicer shall contact the borrower for the first time 90 days after the commencement of any grace period. The school shall, at this time, remind the borrower of his or her responsibility to comply with the terms of the loan and shall send the borrower the total amount remaining outstanding on the loan account, including principal and interest accruing over the remaining life of the loan; and the date and amount of the first required payment. 4. The school shall contact the borrower the second time 150 days after the commencement of any grace period. The school shall, at this time, notify the borrower of the date and amount of the first required payment. 5. The school shall contact a borrower with a nine-month initial grace period a third time 240 days after the commencement of the grace period and shall inform him or her of the date and amount of the first required payment.Prepayment A borrower may prepay all or part of a Perkins Loan at any time without penalty. If a borrower makes a payment during the academic year in which a loan was made, the school must use any amount repaid to reduce the original loan amount and not consider these amounts to be prepayments. If a borrower makes a payment during the academic year in which the loan was made and the initial grace period ended, only those amounts in excess of the amount due for any repayment period shall be treated as prepayments. If a borrower makes a payment in any academic year, other than the one in which the loan was made, that exceeds the amount due for any repayment period, the school must use the excess to prepay the principal unless the borrower designates it as an advance payment of the next regular installment. 34 CFR 674.31(b)(4) Payment Made During Initial Grace Period Example Shannon applies her yearly birthday check of $400 to her $1,000 Perkins Loan before the initial grace period ends. Then, the principal advanced to Shannon becomes $600. This is not considered a prepayment because payment was made before the end of the initial grace period.Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-122FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL ESTABLISHING A REPAYMENT PLAN A borrower must repay his or her loan, plus interest, in 10 years. This repayment period never includes authorized periods of deferment, forbearance, or cancellation. The repayment plan must be established and disclosed to the student before the student ceases to be enrolled at least half time. If a student receives loans from more than one school, the repayment of each loan is made to the school where the student received the loan. Calculating the repayment amount Schools may require the borrower to make payments on a monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly basis. Each of the borrower's payments must sufficiently cover the interest accruing between payments to ensure that the loan is repaid in 10 years. Schools calculate the correct payment amount by multiplying the principal by the appropriate constant multiplier (see table). Schools using the minimum monthly payment plan option may require the borrower to pay a minimum monthly amount of $40 instead. If the installment for all loans a school made to a borrower is not a multiple of $5, the school may round the installment payments to the next highest dollar amount that is a multiple of $5. If the last scheduled payment is $25 or less, the school may combine it with the next-to-last payment.Calculating Payment Amount Example Bernadine received a $2,500 Perkins Loan to attend Jordan College, which requires quarterly payments. To calculate Bernadine's quarterly payment, Jordan College multiplies the original principal by the constant multiplier for a quarterly payment frequency: $2,500 X .0319214 = $79.80 Principal \u00d7 Constant Multiplier = Payment Amount10-Y ear Repayment Table of Constant Multipliers Annual Payment Payments Total Constant Rate Frequency Per Y ear Payments Multiplier 5% Monthly 12 120 .0106065 5% Bimonthly 6 60 .0212470 5% Quarterly 4 40 .0319214Repayment plan requirements 34 CFR 674.33(a) Minimum monthly payments 34 CFR 674.33(b)When repayment begins 34 CFR 674.31(b)(2)(B)and (C) and 674.32Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, and Cancellation6-123FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Interest accrual Interest on a Perkins Loan made on or after October 1, 1981, must be computed at the rate of 5% per annum simple interest on the unpaid principal balance. Although interest accrues on a Perkins Loan, your school may not capitalize it. This means that your school may not add unpaid interest to the principal balance to increase the principal balance of the Perkins Loan. Instead, your school must track principal and interest as separate figures, adding accrued interest to the interest balance, not the principal balance. Generally, interest is computed from the date a payment is received rather than from the due date. However, there are exceptions. Interest charges may be computed to the nearest first-of-the-month, or they may be computed in accordance with the borrower's established schedule of payments of principal and interest if the borrower is making payments on a regular basis according to that schedule. For example, if a grace period expires in the middle of a month, interest may be computed to the beginning of the next month. Also, if a past-due payment is received before the next regularly scheduled payment, the interest may be computed according to the established payment schedule\u2014no adjust - ments are necessary. Incentive repayment program To encourage repayment, a school may reduce a loan's interest rate by up to 1% if the borrower makes 48 consecutive monthly payments; discount by up to 5% the balance a borrower owes on a loan if the loan is paid in full before the end of the repayment period; or with the Secretary's approval, establish any other repayment in - centive options that reduce default and replenish student loan funds. A school may not use federal funds or school funds from the Perkins Loan Revolving Fund to absorb the costs associated with repayment in - centives. On at least a quarterly basis, schools must reimburse the Perkins Loan Fund for income lost as a result of the discounts offered through the Incentive Repayment Program.Simple Interest Accrual Example Fred has been granted a hardship forbearance for a year. At the beginning of his forbearance period, Fred's loan balance is $1,000: Principal: $1,000 Interest: $0 Interest accrues throughout the forbearance period at a simple rate of 5% per annum. At the end of the year-long forbearance period, Fred's loan balance is $1,050: Principal: $1,000 Interest: $50 When Fred makes his first payment after the end of the forbearance, his payment is applied to interest first, then principal. Fred makes a payment of $25, reducing his balance to $1,025: Principal: $1,000 Interest: $25 Incentive repayment program 34 CFR 674.33(f)Interest Rate on Older Perkins Loans Older Perkins Loans have different inter - est rates. The interest rate is stated in the borrower's promissory note. The annual interest rate for loans made before July 1, 1981, was 3%; between July 1, 1981, and September 30, 1981, was 4%; on or after October 1, 1981, is Programs, 2018-20196-124FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Minimum monthly repayment amounts Schools may choose to include a minimum monthly repayment requirement in the Perkins Loan promissory note. The minimum monthly repayment amount is $40, unless the borrower on the date the new loan is made has an outstanding balance on a Perkins Loan made before October 1, 1992, that included a $30 minimum monthly repay - ment provision. (See sidebar.) To determine the minimum repayment for bimonthly and quarterly payment schedules, schools should multiply $40 by two (months) and three (months), respectively. Conditions for minimum monthly repayment A school may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly payment amount of $40 on a Perkins Loan if the promissory note includes a provision specifying a minimum monthly repayment of $40 and the monthly repayment of principal and interest for a 10-year repayment period (as calculated using a constant multiplier) would be less than $40; or the borrower has received Perkins Loans with different interest rates at the same school and the total monthly payment would otherwise be less than $40 (provided any of the promissory notes includes the minimum monthly repayment provision). Under no circumstances may a school require a minimum monthly repayment of more than $40. Multiple loans at same school If a borrower has multiple Perkins Loans from the same school, any of which include the minimum monthly payment provision, the school may require the borrower to make a minimum monthly payment if the borrower's total monthly payment on all the loans totals less than $40. A student's monthly payment amount may need to be higher than $40, of course, so that his or her debt is repaid by the end of 10 years. If the school exercises this option, the school must divide each monthly payment among all the loans proportionate to the amount of principal advanced under each loan. If the borrower's total monthly payment equals or exceeds $40 for all of the loans made at that school, the school may not exercise the minimum monthly payment on any loan. The school determines the minimum monthly repayment in this manner even if the Perkins Loans have different interest rates.Hardship Payment Reduction A school may reduce a borrower's sched - uled payments for up to one year at a time if the borrower is scheduled to pay the $40 minimum monthly payment and the school determines that the borrower is un - able to make the scheduled payments due to hardship, such as prolonged illness or unemployment.Minimum monthly repayment 34 CFR 674.33(b) Minimum Monthly Repayment Amount for Older Loans The minimum monthly repayment amount is $30 for NDSLs and Perkins Loans made before October 1, 1992, and Perkins Loans made after October 1, 1992, to borrowers who have an outstanding balance on a Perkins Loan, NDSL, or Defense Loan made before October 1, 1992, that included a $30 minimum monthly repayment provi - sion. The minimum monthly repayment amount is $15 for Defense Loans. If a borrower has both Defense and NDSL or Perkins Loans from one or more schools and the total monthly repayment is less than $30 and the monthly repayment on a Defense Loan is less than $15, the amount applied to the Defense Loan may not exceed $15.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-125FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL If the borrower has received Perkins Loans with different grace periods and deferments, the school must treat each note separately. The school still divides the minimum monthly payment proportionately among the loans. However, the borrower must pay each loan's portion when it is due. Loans from multiple schools A borrower may have received Perkins Loans from more than one school. If the borrower wants your school to coordinate minimum monthly payments with another school, he or she must request such coordination. If the total of the monthly payments is at least equal to $40, none of the lending schools may exercise the minimum monthly repayment requirement. less than $40, but only one school exercises the minimum monthly payment option, that school receives the difference between $40 and the repayment owed to the second school. less than $40 and each school exercises the minimum repayment option, the $40 minimum repayment is divided among the schools in proportion to the total amount of principal each has advanced. If the borrower requests that your school coordinate minimum monthly payment amounts with another school, you should ask the borrower for the names of all other schools to which the borrower owes funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program; the approximate amount borrowed from, and the current indebtedness to, each school; and any information that would help identify the loans\u2014for example, the loan number and the dates of loan advances. Using this information, the schools should contact each other and negotiate the amount each should receive from the borrower.Two Schools/Minimum Monthly Payment Amount Example Betsy has Perkins Loans from Heinz College and Elise University. Heinz does not exercise the minimum monthly payment option and receives from Betsy $25 a month (the amount due under its estab lished 10-year repayment plan). Elise exercises the $40 option and receives from Betsy $15, the difference between $40 and the amount of principal and interest paid to Heinz. Loans from multiple schools 34 CFR 674.33(b)(2) DCL ESTABLISHING REPAYMENT DATES Depending on the repayment schedule (monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly), the borrower's first payment is due one, two, or three months from the date the grace period expires. Repayment schedules must be adjusted (preferably on the first installment) so that the loan will be repaid within the normal 10-year period or as prescribed in the terms of the promissory note. For convenience, a school may establish standard repayment dates for borrowers who are on quarterly repayment schedules. The first repayment date may be the first day of the calendar quarter after the grace period has expired. Four standard repayment dates would be used: January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1. (See the chart above.) Alternatively, a school may adopt a \"rolling\" quarterly repayment schedule in which each borrower's first payment is due exactly three months after the date his or her grace period expires. For example, if a borrower's first grace period expires on May 17, the first installment payment is due August 18. Another borrower's grace period expires May 18, so the first installment payment on that loan is due August 19. Once the payment date is established, the borrower will owe principal and interest for any portion of a scheduled installment period not covered by a deferment. However, if the borrower is in deferment on a due date, any amounts owed are carried over and paid on the first due date on which the borrower is out of deferment.(with four standard repayment dates)Perkins Loan Quarterly Billing Example Borrower's Initial Nine-Month Installment Termination Date Grace Period Ends Due January 1 September 30 January 1 February 1 October 31 \" March 1 November 30 \" April 1 December 31 April 1 May 1 January 31 \" June 1 February 28 \" July 1 March 31 July 1 August 1 April 30 \" September 1 May 31 \" October 1 June 30 October 1 November 1 July 31 \" December 1 August 31 \" Use of Fixed Repayment Dates For collection and bookkeeping purposes, a fixed repayment date is preferred. Other - wise, if the borrower is entitled to a deferment, the school may have problems computing payments due. Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-127FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Extending repayment period for illness, unemployment, or low income A school may extend a repayment period if the borrower is experiencing a period of prolonged illness or unemployment. A school may also extend the repayment period for a Perkins Loan if, during the repayment period, the school determines that the borrower qualifies as a low-income individual based on total family income (see sidebar). In the case of low-income individuals, the repayment period may be extended up to 10 additional years. You must review the borrower's income status annually to determine whether he or she still qualifies as a low-income individual. If you determine that a borrower ceases to qualify for an extended repayment period, you must amend the borrower's repayment schedule. The amended repayment schedule may not exceed the number of months remaining on the original repayment schedule (not including any exten - sions of the repayment period). There are two other ways that a school may adjust the repayment schedule for a borrower who qualifies as a low-income individual: The school may require a borrower to pay a reduced amount for a limited time and then later increase the payment amount so the borrower catches up on payments. The repayment period does not have to be extended. For example, a school reduces the payment amount to $10 per month for six months and then increases it to $50 per month until the borrower catches up. The school may allow the borrower to pay $10 per month for a year and then resume normal payments. This type of adjustment extends the repayment period. Interest continues to accrue during an extension of a repayment period for any of these reasons.Repayment period extension 34 CFR 674.33(c) Low-Income Individual The school must use the Income Protection Allowance (published annually by ED in the Federal Register, usually in May) to determine whether a student is a low-income individual. Based on the most recent Income Protection Allowance tables (May 2017, applicable for 2018-2019) an unmarried borrower without dependents qualifies as a low-income individual if his or her total income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed $9,980. a borrower with a family that includes the borrower and any spouse or legal dependents qualifies as a low-income individual if his or her total family income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed the relevant amount below: Family of 2 $25,870 Family of 3 $32,210 Family of 4 $39,780 Family of 5 $46,940 Family of 6 $54,890 For each additional family member add $6,020. For more information, please see FR Vol. 82, No. 82/Monday, May Glossary DCL Payment processing Any payment a school receives must be applied in the following order: 1. collection costs 2. late charges (or penalty charges) 3. accrued interest 4. principal Past-due payments should be applied in the same order as other payments except that past-due payments must be applied to the \"oldest\" past-due dollars first. FORBEARANCE Forbearance is usually a temporary postponement of payments. Forbearance is available for all loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, regardless of when they were made. The borrower may alternatively request an extension of time allowed for making payments or the acceptance of smaller payments than were previously scheduled. Schools may grant forbearance to borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship or poor health, or for other acceptable reasons. For example, the Department strongly encourages schools to grant periods of forbearance to borrowers who are serving in AmeriCorps. Also, the Department may authorize periods of forbearance due to a national military mobilization or other national emergency. Borrowers must request forbearance and provide supporting documentation of the reason for forbearance. (Schools may now process forbearance requests based on a verbal request from a borrower.) The school and borrower must agree to the terms of the forbearance. The school confirms this agreement by notice to the borrower and by recording the terms in the borrower's file. Schools may grant the borrower forbearance for a period of up to one year at a time. The forbearance may be renewed, but the periods of for - bearance collectively may not exceed a total of three years. A school may apply an authorized period of forbearance to begin retroactively (that is, to begin on an earlier date than the date of the borrower's request) if the borrower requests that the school do so and if he or she provides ad - equate documentation to support the request. Schools may not include periods of forbearance in determining the 10-year repayment period.Forbearance 34 CFR 674.33(d) The HEOA eliminates the requirement that a forbearance request be in writing. HEOA 464 HEA 464(e) Reduction of payments during hardship 34 CFR 674.33(b)(5) & (6) Extension of repayment during hardship 34 CFR 674.33(c)(1) Extension of repayment for low-income individuals 34 CFR 674.33(c)(2) Paying Interest During Forbearance Period Unlike deferment, interest continues to accrue during any period of forbearance. The borrower may request to pay interest as it accrues during periods of forbearance, but the school may not require the borrower to do so. Peace Corps Deferment If the borrower is currently in economic hardship deferment for service in the Peace Corps, the school may grant deferment for the full term of the borrower's service, not to exceed three years, or for the remaining period of economic hardship deferment eligibility, if it is less than the remaining period of service.Forbearance Forms The Department has issued OMB- approved forbearance forms for use in the Perkins, Direct Loan, and FFEL programs. As of June 1, 2016, only the OMB- approved \"Mandatory Forbearance\" form may be provided to Perkins borrowers requesting forbearance due to student loan debt burden. As of July 1, 2016, only the OMB-approved \"General Forbearance\" form may be provided to Perkins borrowers requesting forbearance due to poor health or for other acceptable reasons. See DCL GEN-16-02 and DCL GEN-16-06.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Cancellation6-129FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Calculating Equivalent Monthly Payment (Hardship Forbearance) If the borrower's loan payments are due less frequently than monthly, a proportional share of the payments is used to determine the equivalent in total monthly payments. For example, if a payment is due quarterly, divide the amount by three (because the payment covers three months) to determine the equivalent monthly payment amount.Hardship A school must grant forbearance if the total amount the borrower is obligated to pay monthly on all FSA loans is equal to or greater than 20% of the borrower's total monthly gross income. Total monthly gross income is the gross amount of income received by the borrower from employment (either full-time or part-time) and from other sources. To receive forbearance for hardship, the borrower must submit at least the following documentation: evidence of the amount of the borrower's most recent total monthly gross income, and evidence of the amount of the monthly payments the borrower owes for the most recent month on his or her FSA loans. DEFERMENT Under certain circumstances, a borrower is entitled to have the repayment of a loan deferred. During deferment, the borrower is not re - quired to pay loan principal and interest does not accrue. After each deferment, the borrower is entitled to a post-deferment grace period of six consecutive months. In most cases, the borrower must request deferment unless the borrower is engaged in service that may qualify for loan cancellation or the school can determine that the borrower is enrolled at least half time at an eligible school. Borrowers are no longer required to request deferments in writing. However, a borrower who requests deferment must provide the school with supporting documentation on an OMB-approved deferment form by the school's deadline. Borrowers must immediately report any change in their deferment status to lending schools. You may grant a deferment, at the borrower's request, based on information from the holder of an FSA loan that a borrower has been granted a deferment for the same reason and the same time period on the borrower's Perkins, Direct, or FFEL Stafford or PLUS Loan. (Holders of federal student aid loans include another Perkins school, an FFEL lender, the Department of Education, or a guaranty agency.) This simplified de - ferment granting process is optional and only applies to in-school defer - ments, graduate fellowship deferments, rehabilitation training program deferments, unemployment deferments, economic hardship deferments, military service deferments, and active duty student deferments. If a borrower is currently in deferment, the school must reaffirm continued eligibility for deferment on at least an annual basis (except for Peace Corps service\u2014see sidebar on previous page). Schools may not in - clude periods of deferment in the 10-year repayment period.Deferment Forms The Department has issued OMB- approved deferment forms for use in the Perkins, Direct Loan, and FFEL programs. As of June 1, 2016, only the OMB-approved deferment forms may be provided to Perkins borrowers requesting the following deferments: In-school Graduate fellowship Rehabilitation training program Unemployment Economic hardship DCL GEN-16-02Must Be a \"Regular\" Student to Get a Deferment A Perkins borrower must be a \"regular student\" enrolled at least half time at an eligible school in order to qualify for an in-school deferment on a Perkins Loan. Students who are merely auditing classes are NOT eligible for in-school deferments. When courses are taken for academic credit, there is the potential that they could be applied to a degree or certificate program at some point or serve as required prerequisites for some future anticipated degree program. Students who are auditing classes are not usually subject to the same academic require - ments, receive neither credits or grades, and are not able to apply those courses toward a degree.Volume 6\u2014The deferment/cancellation Schools must automatically defer loans during periods when the borrower is performing service that will qualify him or her for loan cancellation. Borrowers do not need to apply for concurrent deferment. Schools may grant concurrent deferment for up to 12 months at a time. Concurrent deferment is available to all loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, regardless of disbursement date and contrary provisions on the promissory note. A borrower who receives concurrent deferment is also entitled to a post-deferment grace period of six consecutive months. Therefore, regardless of the length of time that the eligible service is performed, repayment is deferred during that period of service and does not resume until six months after the cessation of service. Deferment and default A borrower is not entitled to a deferment on a defaulted loan. If the borrower signs a new repayment agreement, however, a school may grant a deferment even if the school has \"accelerated\" the loan. The school would have to undo the loan acceleration before granting the deferment. A borrower must file for deferment by a deadline the school sets and provide satisfactory documentation that he qualifies for the deferment. Before granting a deferment on a defaulted loan, the school may require the borrower to pay immediately late fees, collection costs, and some or all of the amount past due as of the date on which the school determined that the borrower had demonstrated eligibility for a deferment. The Department encourages schools to require the borrower to do so, thus \"curing\" the default. A school is not required to grant deferments on loans in default. However, if a school does so, it is expected to calculate past due accrued interest. If a school believes this is too burdensome, it may deny deferments on defaulted loans.Concurrent deferment 34 CFR 674.34(c) 34 CFR 674.52(d) Deferments on defaulted loans The policy permitting deferments on defaulted loans applies to all requests for deferment received after February 3, 1988, regardless of the date the loan was made. Acceleration Loan acceleration is one of the penalties a school may impose on a defaulted loan. A loan that has been accelerated becomes due and payable immediately in one lump sum.

A borrower is entitled to a full initial grace period when he or she ceases half-time enrollment in the new program. The borrower may submit proof at any time\u2014even after a loan has been accelerated\u2014that he or she reenrolled at least half time before the initial grace period expired. Upon receipt of this proof, the school must recalculate the first date of repayment. The school must also deduct from the loan balance any interest accrued and any late charges added before the date the repayment period actually should have begun. Note that the bor - rower remains responsible for payments that would have been due under the recalculated repayment period and that the school is not obligated to grant a deferment for any payments past due under that period. If a Perkins borrower graduates or leaves school and reenrolls at least half time in an eligible postsecondary school after the initial grace period has expired, the student is no longer in in-school enrollment status. However, the student may be eligible for an in-school deferment (see next page). Keep in mind that a post-deferment grace period is only six months. Schools exercising the minimum monthly payment provision listed in the promissory note must cease doing so and grant a deferment to cover any period of qualifying service. The amount to be deferred and subsequently canceled must be calculated using the 10-year repayment period.Enrollment Reporting Process Perkins schools can receive student en - rollment information through the NSLDS Enrollment Reporting Process. Schools should be accurately reporting enrollment on a monthly basis. It is the school's re - sponsibility to make sure all loan statuses are reported accurately. Please refer to the NSLDS Reference Materials, Federal Perkins Technical Update dated 04-06-2012 at ifap.ed.gov/nsldsmaterials/ PK201201PerkinsTechUpdate.html Borrowers and students may also self- report their enrollment status by logging into the NSLDS student access website to inform NSLDS of their enrollment status. Volume and Defense Loans (34 CFR 674.34) The deferments that follow are available to all loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, regardless of disbursement date or contrary provisions in the promissory note. In-school deferment A borrower may defer repayment of a Perkins Loan if he or she is enrolled at least half time in an eligible school. To receive an in-school deferment for a Perkins Loan, the borrower must be enrolled as a regular student in an eligible institution of higher education or a comparable institution outside the United States approved by the Department for deferment purposes. A regular student is one who is enrolled for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate. (The eligible institution need not participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program.) If the borrower is attending at least half time as a regular student for a full academic year and intends to do so in the next academic year, he or she is entitled to a deferment for 12 months . This means that a school must continue to apply the in-school deferment through the summer session, even if the borrower does not attend classes during the summer session. In-school deferment ends on the day the borrower graduates or drops below half-time enrollment. Schools may grant in-school deferments to borrowers based on student enrollment information provided by third-party servicers or other schools. The enrollment information must establish that the borrower is enrolled as a regular student on at least a half-time basis. If a school grants deferment based on this information, the school must notify the borrower of the deferment and offer the option to cancel the deferment and continue repayment of the loan. If a borrower is attending a school that ceases to qualify as an institution of higher education, the borrower's deferment ends on the date the school ceases to qualify. Graduate fellowship A borrower may defer repayment if he or she is enrolled and in attendance as a regular student in a course of study that is part of a graduate fellowship program approved by the Department, including graduate or postgraduate fellowship-supported study (such as a Fulbright grant) outside the United States. To qualify for a deferment for study as part of a graduate fellowship program, a borrower must provide the lending institution with a statement from an authorized official of the borrower's graduate fellowship program certifying\u2014that the borrower holds at least a baccalaureate degree conferred by an institution of higher education; that the borrower has been accepted or recommended by an institution of higher education for acceptance on a full-time basis into an eligible graduate fellowship program; and the borrower's anticipated completion date in the program. An eligible graduate fellowship program is a fellowship program that provides sufficient financial support to graduate fellows to allow for full-time study for at least six months; requires a written statement from each applicant explaining the applicant's objectives before the award of that financial support; requires a graduate fellow to submit periodic reports, projects, or evidence of the fellow's progress; and, in case of a course of study at a foreign university, accepts the course of study for completion of the fellowship program.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-133FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Deferments for All Perkins Loans (continued) Rehabilitation training A borrower may defer repayment if he or she is enrolled in a course of study that is part of a Department-approved rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals. To receive this deferment, the borrower must provide the school with certification that the borrower is receiving, or is scheduled to receive, rehabilitation training from the agency; the agency is licensed, approved, certified, or otherwise recognized by a state agency responsible for programs in vocational rehabilitation, drug abuse treatment, mental health services, or alcohol abuse treatment; or by the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the agency provides or will provide the borrower rehabilitation services under a written plan that (1) is individualized to meet the borrower's needs (2) specifies the date that services will end and (3) is structured in a way that requires substantial commitment from the borrower. A substantial commitment from the borrower is a commitment of time and effort that would normally prevent the borrower from holding a full-time job either because of the number of hours that must be devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the rehabilitation. Seeking full-time employment A borrower may defer repayment on a Perkins Loan for up to three years, regardless of disbursement date and contrary provisions on the promissory note, if the borrower is seeking and unable to find full-time employment. Forms for requesting deferment are available at https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1606Attach.pdf. 34 CFR 674.34(g) Economic hardship A borrower is entitled to an economic hardship deferment for periods of up to one year at a time, not to exceed three years cumulatively, if the borrower provides the school with satisfactory documentation showing one of the following: the borrower has been granted an economic hardship deferment for either a Stafford or PLUS Loan for the same period of time for which the Perkins Loan deferment has been requested; the borrower is receiving federal or state general public assistance, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the borrower is working full-time1 and is earning a total monthly gross i ncome that does not exceed (1) the monthly earnings of someone earning the minimum wage, or (2) 150% of the poverty line2 for the borrower's family size; 1 A borrower is considered to be working full-time if he or she is expected to be employed for at least three consecutive months for at least 30 hours per week. 2 The poverty guidelines are published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. If a borrower is not a resi - dent of a state identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous states .Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-134FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL the borrower is serving as a volunteer in the Peace Corps. S chools may grant deferments for Peace Corps service for periods longer than one year at a time, but these periods must not collectively exceed three years.3 Note that the deferment provision for borrowers whose debt burden exceeds 20% of total monthly gross income has been eliminated. Determining maximum monthly gross income and 150% of poverty line (#3) Monthly gross income at minimum wage The current hourly minimum wage is available at dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage To find monthly gross income, multiply the minimum wage by the typical work hours in a year, and then divide this amount by 12 months. Determining 150% of the poverty line for the borrower's family size Annual poverty line guidelines, as defined by Section 673(2) of the Community Service Block Grant Act, are available at aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-research . Note that an unborn child may be included if that child will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size or for the period the borrower requests an economic hardship deferment. Military service deferment A borrower who is serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces or performing qualifying National Guard duty may defer repayment (principal or interest) on a Perkins Loan if the duty is in connection with a war, military operation, or national emergency. The deferment is extended 180 days for qualifying periods of service that include October 1, 2007, or that begin on or after that date. This additional period is available each time a borrower is demobilized at the conclusion of qualifying service. This additional 180-day deferment may not be granted without documentation supporting the borrower's claim of end-of-military-service date. A borrower may not be reimbursed for any payments made by or on behalf of a borrower during a period for which the borrower qualified for a deferment. 34 CFR 674.34(h) Deferments for All Perkins Loans (continued) 3 To qualify for a subsequent period of deferment that begins less than one year after the end of the deferment described in option three, the borrower must submit a copy of his or her federal income tax return if the borrower filed a tax return within the eight months preceding the date the deferment is requested.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, 2018CFR Glossary DCL 13-month post-active duty deferment Effective October 1, 2007, borrowers who are members of National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve, and members of the Armed Forces who are in retired status, are eligible for a 13-month period of deferment on repayment of their Perkins Loans following the completion of their active duty mili - tary service if they were enrolled in a postsecondary school at the time of, or within six months prior to, their activation. Reserve or retired members of the Armed Forces may qualify for both the post- active duty deferment and for the military service deferment, and may receive both deferments if eligible. If a student receives both deferments, the overlapping periods of deferment will run concur - rently. A borrower returning from active duty who is in a grace period is not required to waive the grace period to use the 13-month post-active duty student deferment. If the borrower reenrolls in post- secondary school (at least half time) prior to the expiration of the 13-month period, the deferment ends on the date the student reenrolls. Unlike the military service deferment described above, students receiving the active duty student deferment need not be activated in connection with a war, national emergency, or other military operation. For purposes of the post-active duty student deferment, \"active duty\" has the same meaning as in Section 101(d)(1) of Title 10, United States Code, but does not include active duty for training or attendance at a service school/academy. Members of the National Guard may qualify for this deferment for Title 32 full-time National Guard duty under which a governor is authorized, with the approval of the President to Secretary of Defense, to order a member to state active duty and the activities of the National Guard are paid for by federal funds; or for state active duty under which a governor activates National Guard personnel based on state statute or policy, and the activities of the National Guard are paid for by state funds. Active duty does not include a borrower who is serving full-time in a permanent position with the National Guard, unless the borrower is reassigned as part of a call-up to active duty service. 34 CFR 674.34(i)Deferments for All Deferments A Perkins borrower must be a \"regular student\" enrolled at least half time at an eligible school in order to qualify for an in-school deferment on a Perkins Loan. Note that a FFEL or DL borrower who is not enrolled in an eligible program can still get an in- school deferment as long as he or she is enrolled at least half time at an eligible school. Classes that a student is auditing may not be counted toward the student's enrollment status in determining whether the student is enrolled half time. For example, at a school where six credits is considered half time, a student who is enrolled in three credits for a grade and three credits as an audit would not be considered a half-time student for the purpose of an in-school deferment. Deferments for Older Perkins Loans (34 CFR 674.35, 674.36, and 674.37) For information on deferment provisions exclusive to loans made before October 1, 1980, see the 1994-1995 Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook or 34 CFR 674.37. For information on deferment provisions exclusive to loans made before July 1, 1993, see the 2015-2016 Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook. Definitions for Purposes of Military Service Deferments Active duty means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States, except that it does not include active duty for training or attendance at a service academy. Military operation means a contingency operation that is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or an opposing military force; or results in the call to or retention on active duty of members of the uniformed services. National Guard duty means training or other duty, other than inactive duty, when called to active ser - vice authorized by the President of the United States or Secretary of Defense (and paid for with federal funds) for a period of more than 30 consecutive days in connection with a war, national emergency, or other military operation.Deferments for All Perkins Loans (continued)Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-137FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL GENERAL CANCELLATION PROVISIONS Application for cancellation The following cancellation application procedures apply to any loan under this program. The borrower applies for cancellation of his or her loan by obtain - ing the appropriate cancellation form from the business or student loan office of the school that made the loan (or from the school's billing ser - vice if it uses one). The borrower submits the form to the school, along with any supporting documentation the school requests, by the dead - line the school establishes. A school must determine, based on the borrower's documentation, whether the borrower is entitled to have any portion of his or her loans cancelled. This responsibility cannot be delegate d. For information on documentation, see the appropriate cancellation category in this sec - tion. Concurrent deferment Schools must automatically defer loans during periods of service for which schools also grant loan cancellation. Borrowers do not need to apply for these automatic deferments. ED reimbursement to schools If funds are appropriated, the Department will reimburse each school every award year for the principal and interest cancelled from its Perkins Loan Fund for all of the cancellation provisions except for death, total and permanent disability, bankruptcy, and closed school discharge. If it receives reimbursement, a school must deposit the amount reimbursed in its Perkins Loan Fund. For more information and a full Q&A on reimbursing amounts cancelled, see Dear Colleague Letter CB-05-08. Note: Congress has not appropriated funds for Perkins cancellation reimbursement for a number of years.Perkins Cancellation 34 CFR 674 674.51 Procedures 34 CFR 674.52 When a borrower who is already receiving cancellation benefits becomes eligible for another type of cancellation Perkins borrowers who become eligible for an additional cancellation category continue along in the same cancellation progression if both categories are cancelled at the same rate. However, if a borrower becomes eligible for a cancellation category with a different rate of progression, the borrower \"begins at the year one cancellation rate\" for the new cancellation category. 34 Break in service due to a condition covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) A borrower who is unable to complete an academic year of eligible teaching service due to a condition covered under the FMLA may still qualify for a cancellation if the borrower completes at least one half of the academic year, and the borrower's employer considers the borrower to have fulfilled the contract requirements for the academic year for purposes of salary increases, tenure, and retirement. For a cancellation type that requires 12-consecutive months of eligible service, a borrower who is unable to complete the year of eligible service due to a condition covered under the FMLA may still qualify for the cancellation if the borrower completes at least 6 months of eligible service.

Schools may not refund payments made during a period for which the borrower qualified for a cancellation, unless the borrower made the payment because of the school's error. To reduce the chance of error, a school should keep the borrower informed of any new cancellation benefits. Defaulted loans A school may cancel a defaulted loan if the only reason for the default was the borrower's failure to file a cancellation request on time. If the loan has already been accelerated , only eligible service performed prior to the date of acceleration can be considered for cancellation. A borrower is not entitled to cancellation for any eligible service performed after the date of acceleration.

Eligibility for teacher cancellation is based on the duties presented in an official position description, not on the position title. To receive a cancellation, the borrower must be directly employed by the school system. To qualify for cancellation based on any of these three conditions, a borrower must teach full-time for a complete academic year or its equivalent. See the next page for exceptions covering special cases, such as illness or pregnancy. Cancellation for teaching in a low-income school or educational service agency A borrower qualifies for this cancellation by teaching full-time in a low-income public or other nonprofit elementary or secondary school, or by teaching full-time for an educational service agency (ESA) listed in the Teacher Cancellation Low-Income Directory (see sidebar). For cancellation purposes, a borrower employed by an ESA may be teaching at a location operated by the ESA (such as a stand-alone school that serves students from many different school districts), or in a conventional elementary and secondary school (such as a vocational education teacher employed by the ESA to teach courses in several different secondary schools). If a borrower is teaching at a school that is on the list one year but not in subsequent years, the borrower may continue to teach in that school and remain eligible to receive a cancellation for service in that school. BIA Schools All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) are considered to qualify as schools serving low-income families for the purpose of teacher cancellations of Perkins Loans. Elementary and secondary schools operated on reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with the BIA are also considered to qualify for this purpose. 34 CFR 674.53(a)(5)Cancellations for Teachers at Educational Service Agencies These cancellations are for Perkins, for eligible service that includes August 14, 2008, or begins on or after that date, re - gardless of whether the cancellation category appears on the borrower's promissory note. HEA section 465(a) Definition of educational service agency : A regional public multi-service agency authorized by state law to develop, manage, and provide services or programs to local educational agencies as defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. HEA sections 481(e) and Is a Teacher? A teacher is a person who provides students direct classroom teaching, classroom-type teaching in a non-classroom setting, or educational services directly related to classroom teaching (e.g., school librarian, guidance counselor). It is not necessary for a teacher to be certified or licensed to receive cancellation benefits. However, the employing school must consider the borrower to be a full-time professional for the purposes of salary, tenure, retirement bene - fits, and so on. In other words, to qualify, the borrower should accrue the same benefits as teachers who are licensed and/or certified. A supervisor, administrator, researcher, or curriculum specialist is not a teacher unless he or she primarily provides direct and personal educational services to students. Under certain conditions, a teacher's aide may be considered eligible for teacher cancellation. The teacher's aide must meet the definition of a \"full-time teacher. \" He or she must have a bachelor's degree and be a professional recognized by the state as a full-time employee rendering direct and personal services in carrying out the instructional program of an elementary or secondary school. Volunteer teachers are not professionally employed on a full-time basis and, therefore, are not eligible for teacher cancellation benefits. Teaching full-time for a full academic year The borrower must teach full-time for a full academic year or its equivalent. There is no requirement that a teacher must teach a given number of hours a day to qualify as a full-time teacher; the employing school is responsible for determining whether or not the individual is considered to be a full-time teacher. An \"academic year or its equivalent\" for teacher cancellation purposes is defined as one complete school year. Two half-years count as an academic year if they are complete, consecutive, from different school years (excluding sum - mer session), and generally fall within a 12-month period. A borrower who cannot complete the academic year because of illness or pregnancy may still qualify for cancellation if he or she has completed the first half of the academic year and has begun teaching the second half, as long as the borrower's employer considers the borrower to have fulfilled his or her contract for the academic year. Teaching part-time at multiple schools Schools must grant cancellation to a borrower who is simultaneously teaching part-time in two or more schools if an official at one of the schools where the borrower taught certifies that the borrower taught full-time for a full aca - demic year. For example: under a consortium agreement, a borrower may be employed by the consortium and teach at member schools; two or more schools, by mutual agreement, could arrange to have one school employ the borrower on a full-time basis and then hire out his or her services to the other school(s) involved in the agreement; or a borrower can be considered to have been a full-time teacher for an academic year if he or she can obtain appropriate certifications that he or she has taught in half-time teaching positions for a complete academic year in two elementary schools, two secondary schools, or a combination of the two school levels. A school may refuse cancellation for simultaneous teaching in two or more schools if it cannot easily determine that the teaching was full-time.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-143FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Who Is a Teacher? (Continued) Teaching in a private school A borrower may receive teacher cancellation for services performed in a private elementary or secondary school or academy, if the private school or academy has established its nonprofit status with the Inter - nal Revenue Service (IRS) and if the school or academy is providing elementary or secondary education according to state law. The school or academy does not necessarily need to be accredited for a borrower teaching there to qualify for teacher cancellation. Teaching in a school system To be eligible for cancellation, a borrower employed in a public or other nonprofit elementary or secondary school system or an educational service agency must be directly employed by the school system. Teaching in a preschool or pre-kindergarten program A borrower may receive teacher cancellation for teaching service performed in a preschool or pre-kindergarten program if the state considers the program to be a part of its elementary education program. A low-income-school-directory designation that includes pre-kindergarten or kindergarten does not suffice for a state determination of program eligibility. The school must check with the state superintendent of public instruction to determine whether these programs are part of the state elementary education program. Teaching both children and adults If the borrower teaches both children and adults, the majority of students must be children for the borrower to qualify for cancellation. Job Corps teachers Teaching service performed in a Job Corps project does not qualify for Perkins Loan cancellation unless the teaching is conducted in an elementary or secondary school or school system. How are low-income schools and ESAs selected? The Department selects elementary/secondary schools and educational service agencies (ESAs) for inclusion in the Teacher Cancellation Low-Income Directory in consultation with each state's educational agency based on these criteria: The school or ESA is in a school district that qualifies for \"Title I\" federal funding based on the large number of low-income families in the district. More than 30% of the school's or ESA's enrollment is made up of children from low-income families. 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-20196-144FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Cancellation for teaching in a teacher shortage field A school must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding balance on a borrower's Perkins Loan for a full-time teacher in a field of expertise that is determined by a state education agency to have a shortage of qualified teachers in that state. A borrower who is teaching in science, mathematics, foreign language, or bilingual education qualifies for cancellation even if the state has not designated the subject area in which he or she is teaching as a shortage area. For a borrower to be considered as teaching in a field of expertise that has a shortage of teachers, the majority of classes taught must be in that field of expertise. Cancellation for teaching in special education A school must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding balance on a borrower's Perkins Loan for a full-time special education teacher of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities. The teaching service must be performed in a public or other nonprofit elementary or secondary school system. A person performing one of the following services is considered a teacher if the service is part of the educational curriculum for handicapped children: speech and language pathology and audiology physical therapy occupational therapy psychological and counseling services recreational therapy To qualify for cancellation, the borrower must be licensed, certified, or registered by the appropriate state education agency for that area in which he or she is providing related special educational services.Teaching in a teacher shortage field by field of expertise 34 CFR 674.53(c) Teaching in special education 34 CFR 674.53(b) Defining Children and Y outh with Disabilities For children and youth from ages 3 through 21 who require special education and related services because they have disabilities as defined in Section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the Act), the Act defines a \"child with a disability\" as one (1) with mental retarda - tion, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and (2) who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services. For a child age three through nine, the term a \"child with a disability\" may in - clude, at the discretion of a state and local education agency, individuals (1) experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the state and as measured by appropriate instruments and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: physical development, cognitive devel - opment, communication development, social or emotional development, or adap - tive development; and (2) who, by reason thereof, require special education and related services.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-145FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL PUBLIC SERVICE CANCELLATIONS Nurse or medical technician cancellation Schools must cancel up to 100% of a Perkins Loan if the borrower has served full-time as a nurse or medical technician providing health care services.

For purposes of this cancellation, a nurse is a licensed practical nurse, a registered nurse, or other individual who is licensed by the appropriate state agency to provide nursing services. a medical technician is an allied health professional (working in fields such as therapy, dental hygiene, medical technology, or nutrition) who is certified, registered, or licensed by the appropriate state agency in the state in which he or she provides health care services; an allied health professional is someone who assists, facilitates, or complements the work of physicians and other specialists in the health care system. (See Dear Colleague Letter CB-08-14 for a more detailed discussion of the eligibility requirements for the medical technician cancellation.) A school may refuse a request for cancellation based on a claim of simultaneous employment as a nurse or medical technician in two or more facilities if it cannot determine easily from the documentation supplied by the borrower that the combined employment is full-time. However, it shall grant the cancellation if one facility official certifies that a nurse or medical technician worked full-time for a full year. Firefighter cancellation A school must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding balance on a borrower's Perkins Loan for service that includes August 14, 2008, or begins on or after that date, as a full-time firefighter .

The types of services a borrower may provide to qualify for a child or family service cancellation include child care and child development services; health, mental health, and psychological services; and social services. The Department has determined that an elementary or secondary school system, a hospital, or an institution of higher education is not an eligible employing agency. When reviewing child or family service cancellation requests, Perkins schools and their servicers should refer to Dear Colleague Letter GEN-5-15, which provides a more detailed discussion of the eligibility requirements for child or family service cancellations.Cancellation Rates With the exception of cancellations for Head Start, military, and volunteer ser - vice, the cancellation rate per completed academic year of full-time teaching or for each year of otherwise qualifying full-time service is 15% of the original principal loan amount\u2014plus the interest that accrued during the year\u2014for each of the first and second years; 20% of the original principal loan amount\u2014plus the interest that accrued during the year\u2014for each of the third and fourth years; and 30% of the original principal loan amount\u2014plus any interest that accrued during the year\u2014for the fifth year.

A local, state, or federal agency is an eligible employing agency if it is publicly funded and its activities pertain to crime prevention, control, or reduction , or to the enforcement of the criminal law. Such activities include but are not limited to police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals; activities of courts and related agencies having criminal jurisdiction; activities of corrections, probation, or parole authorities; and the prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency or narcotic addiction. Agencies that are primarily responsible for enforcement of civil, regulatory, or administrative laws are ineligible. However, because the activities of many divisions and bureaus within local, state, and federal agencies pertain to crime prevention, control, or reduction, or to the enforcement of criminal law, a sub-unit within a larger, non law enforcement agency may qualify as a law enforcement agency for purposes of a law enforcement cancellation. For the borrower's position to be considered essential to the agency's primary mission, he or she must be a full-time employee of an eligible agency and a sworn law enforcement or corrections officer or person whose principal responsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system and are essential in the performance of the agency's primary mission. The agency must be able to document the employee's functions. Examples of positions that are considered essential to a law enforcement agency's primary mission and that are unique to the criminal justice system include prosecuting attorneys whose primary responsibilities are to prosecute criminal cases on behalf of law enforcement agencies, forensic scientists, and latent fingerprint examiners. Individuals whose official responsibilities are supportive, such as those that involve typing, filing, accounting, office procedures, purchasing, stock control, food service, transportation, building, equipment, or grounds maintenance are not eligible for the law enforcement or correction officer loan cancellation, regardless of where these functions are performed.Law Enforcement Cancellation for Loans Prior to November 29, 1990 A school must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding loan balance on a Perkins Loan made prior to November 29, 1990, for law enforcement or correction officer service performed on or after October 7, 1998, if the cancellation benefits provided under this section are not included in the terms of the borrower's promissory note. The service must be full-time and be performed over 12 consecutive DEFENDER CANCELLATION Full-time attorneys employed in federal public defender organization s or community defender organizations (see sidebar), are eligible for public defender cancellations. For purposes of this cancellation, a community defender organization is a defender organization established in accordance with section 3006A(g)(2)(B) of Title 18, United States Code. a federal public defender organization is a defender organization established in accordance with section 3006A(g)(2)(A) of Title 18, United States Code. Cancellations are for eligible service that includes August 14, 2008, or begins on or after that date, regardless of whether information on the expansion of this cancellation category appears on the borrower's promis - sory note. MILITARY SERVICE CANCELLATION A school must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding balance of a Perkins Loan for a full year of active duty service in the U.S. Armed Forces in an area of hostilities or an area of imminent danger that qualifies for special pay (see sidebar). The \"U.S. Armed Forces\" are the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard. The borrower's commanding officer must certify the borrower's service dates. Active duty service for less than a complete year or a fraction of a year beyond a complete year does not qualify. A complete year of service is 12 consecutive months. Areas that qualify for hostile fire/imminent danger pay are listed on the Web (see sidebar). Note that the borrower does not have to serve the full 12 months of active duty service in such an area to qualify for the cancellation. If a borrower is on active duty in such an area for any part of a month, that month counts toward the borrower's eligibility for a military cancellation. The cancellation rate is the standard progression for up to 100% cancellation: 15% for the first and second year of qualifying service, 20% for the third and fourth year of qualifying service, and 30% for the fifth year of qualifying service. The year of qualifying service must include August 14, 2008, or begin on or after that date.

For the pre-kindergarten and child care program cancellation, the period of service must include August 14, 2008, or begin on or after that date. In order to qualify for cancellation, the early education program in which the borrower serves must operate for a complete academic year or its equivalent. The borrower's salary may not exceed the salary of a comparable employee working in the local educational agency of the area served by the early education program. The cancellation rate is 15% of the original loan principal, plus the interest on the unpaid balance accruing during the year of qualifying service for each complete academic year or its equivalent of full-time teaching service. An official of the early education program should sign the borrower's cancellation form to certify the borrower's service.Early Education Cancellations for Defense Loans Head Start. An institution must cancel up to 100% of the outstanding balance on a Defense Loan for service as a full-time staff member in a Head Start program per - formed on or after October 7, 1998, if the cancellation benefits provided under this section are not included in the terms of the borrower's promissory note.Early SERVICE CANCELLATION Schools must cancel up to 70% of a Perkins Loan if the borrower has served as a Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA (under Title I, Part A of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973) volunteer. An authorized official of the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA program must sign the borrower's cancellation form to certify the borrower's service. AmeriCorps volunteers do not qualify for this cancellation unless their volunteer service is with AmeriCorps VISTA. An AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer may only qualify for this cancellation if the AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer elects not to receive a national service education award for his or her volunteer service. The AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer must provide appropriate documentation showing that the volunteer has de - clined the AmeriCorps national service education award. Schools apply cancellation for volunteer service in the following increments: 15% of the original principal loan amount\u2014plus any interest that accrued during the year\u2014for each of the first and second 12-month periods of service, and 20% of the original principal loan amount\u2014plus any interest that accrued during the year\u2014for each of the third and fourth 12-month periods of service. For Peace Corps Volunteers, the 12-month periods of service include any pre-enrollment training the volunteer receives at the Peace Corps post.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-153FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL DISCHARGING PERKINS LOANS Discharge due to death A school must discharge the unpaid balance of a borrower's Defense, NDSL, or Federal Perkins Loan, including interest, if the borrower dies. The school must discharge the loan on the basis of the following: An original or certified copy of the death certificate An accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate An accurate and complete original or certified copy of the death certificate that is scanned and submitted electronically or sent by facsimile transmission Verification of the borrower's death through an authoritative Federal or State electronic database approved for use by the Department Under exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, the chief financial officer of the institution may approve a discharge based upon other reliable documentation of the borrower's death. Discharge for total and permanent disability (nonveterans) If a Perkins borrower contacts a school to request a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge, the school must tell the borrower to notify the Department of the borrower's intent to apply for a TPD discharge. The school must provide the borrower with the information needed for the borrower to contact the Department. When the borrower notifies the Department of the borrower's intent to apply for a TPD discharge, the Department provides the borrower with the information necessary to apply for the discharge. The Department identifies all FSA loans held by the borrower and notifies the holders of those loans of the borrower's intent to apply for a TPD discharge. The Department directs the loan holders to suspend collection activity on the borrower for a period not to exceed 120 days. The Department informs the borrower of the suspension of collection activity and tells the borrower that the suspension of collection activity will end after 120 days if the borrower does not submit a TPD discharge application within that time.Total and permanent disability loan discharge 34 CFR 674.61 DCL GEN 06-14 A TPD Discharge Based on Social Security (SSA) Disability For a borrower applying for a TPD dis - charge based on an SSA disability determi - nation, the documentation from the SSA must show that the borrower qualifies for SSA disability benefits and that the borrower's next SSA disability review will be within five to seven years. If the notification of eligibility for disability benefits that borrower received from the SSA doesn't contain a medical review period, the borrower can obtain this information by calling his or her local SSA office or by calling 1-800-772-1213 and requesting a Benefits Planning Query.TPD Discharge Application You can find additional information on TPD at disabilitydischarge.com/ You can find forms at disabilitydischarge.com/FormsDischarge for death of a borrower 34 borrower must submit to the Department a TPD discharge application certified by a physician who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice in a state. By signing the TPD discharge application, the physician certifies that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled, as defined in the Perkins Loan Program regulations (see sidebar). The borrower must submit the application to the Department within 90 days of the date the physician signed it. Alternatively, instead of having a physician certify the TPD discharge request, a borrower may provide the Department with documentation from the Social Security Administration (SSA) showing that the borrower qualifies for SSA disability benefits and that the borrower's next SSA disability review will be within fi ve to seven years. After the Department receives the TPD application, the Department notifies the borrower's FSA loan holders that the application has been received and directs the loan holders to maintain the suspension of collection activity while the Department reviews the application. During its review of the TPD application, the Department may ask the borrower to provide additional medical evidence and may arrange for an additional review of the borrower's condition by an independent physician at no expense to the borrower. If the Department determines that the borrower does not qualify for a total and permanent disability discharge, the Department notifies the borrower and the school resumes collection on the loan. If the Department determines that the borrower qualifies for a total and permanent disability discharge, it directs the school to assign the loan to the Department (see sidebar for ED servicers) within 45 days. After the Department receives the assignment, it discharges the loan and notifies the borrower and the school that the loan has been discharged. The notification to the borrower will explain to the borrower that the loan will be reinstated if, within three years of the date the Department granted the discharge, the borrower has annual earnings from employment that exceed 100% of the poverty guideline for a family of two. receives a new TEACH Grant or a new loan under the Perkins or Direct Loan programs, except for a Direct Consolidation Loan that includes loans that were not discharged. fails to ensure that the full amount of any disbursement of an FSA loan or TEACH grant received before the discharge date is returned to the loan holder or the Department, as applicable, within 120 days of the disbursement date. Definitions of \"Totally and Permanently Disabled\" Total and permanent disability is defined as The condition of an individual who\u2014 (1) Is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity * by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impair - ment that (i) Can be expected to result in death; (ii) Has lasted for a continuous period of not less than 60 months; or (iii) Can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 60 months; or (2) Has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected disability. 34 CFR 674.51(aa) * Substantial gainful activity is defined as \"a level of work performed for pay or profit that involves doing significant physical or mental activities, or a combination of both.\" 34 CFR 674.51Assignment Procedures due to Total and Permanent Disability Discharge Accounts submitted for assignment must be mailed via overnight or private courier service.

If your school receives payments from a borrower after the loan has been assigned to the Department, you must return the payments to the sender and notify the borrower that there is no need to make payments on the loan after it has been discharged due to TPD, unless the loan is reinstated or the Department directs the borrower otherwise. Discharge for service-connected disability (veterans) A veteran's Perkins Loan will be discharged if the veteran is unemployable due to a service-connected disability, as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Beginning July 1, 2013, to qualify for discharge of a Perkins Loan based on a disability determination by the VA, a veteran must submit a completed copy of the TPD discharge application to the Department. The veteran does not need to obtain a physician's certification or provide documentation of eligibility for SSA disability benefits with the application. Instead, the veteran must include documentation from the VA showing that the veteran is unemployable due to a service-connected disability. The veteran will not be required to provide any additional documentation related to his or her disability. If the Department determines that the documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs indicates that the veteran meets the conditions for a service-related disability discharge, the Department directs the school to discharge the loan. Schools are not required to assign the loan, because loans discharged based on VA disability documentation are not subject to the post-discharge monitoring period or to reinstate - ment. The school must return to the sender any loan payments received on or after the effective date of the determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the veteran is unemployable due to a service- connected disability. (Any such loan payments must be returned to the person who made them.) If the Department determines that the documentation from the VA does not indicate that the veteran meets the conditions for the dis - charge, the Department directs the school to resume collection on the loan. The Department also notifies the veteran that the TPD discharge re - quest has been denied and informs the veteran that even if he or she does not qualify for a service-connected disability discharge, the veteran may reapply for a TPD discharge if he or she meets the general definition of \"totally and permanently disabled\" (see previous topic). 2018-20196-156FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Closed school discharge Schools that close or otherwise lose Title IV eligibility are required to liquidate their Perkins portfolio and fund if they have an active portfolio (i.e., have not liquidated). Procedures for assignment and liquidation are posted on the Campus-Based Processing Information resources page on IFAP. FSA Collections may discharge a Perkins Loan made on or after Jan - uary 1, 1986, if the borrower is unable to complete his or her program of study due to the closure of the school. The Debt Management and Collections System (DMCS) must reimburse borrowers for payments made voluntarily or by forced collection. A borrower whose loan was in default and then discharged under this provision is not considered to have been in default and reestablishes FSA eligibility, provided he or she meets all other eligibility criteria. DMCS reports the discharge to the credit bureaus to which the previous loan status was reported. Note: A borrower is also eligible for a closed school discharge if the borrower withdrew from the school not more than 120 days before the school closed (or longer in exceptional circumstances). Discharge for spouses of victims of 9/11 attacks Schools must discharge the outstanding balance of a Perkins Loan that was made to the spouse of an eligible public servant who died or became permanently and totally disabled due to injuries suffered in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. An eligible public servant is a police officer, firefighter, or other safety or rescue personnel, or a member of the Armed Forces, who died or became permanently and totally disabled due to injuries suffered in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This discharge is only available on Perkins Loan amounts that were owed on September 11, 2001. The law doesn't authorize refunding of any payments made on a loan prior to the loan discharge date.Closed-School Discharge 34 CFR 674.33(g) ED may cancel a Perkins Loan when a borrower's other Title IV loans have been cancelled 34 CFR 674.33(g)(3) Right of recovery from third parties 34 CFR 674.33(g)(7) Discharge procedures 34 CFR 674.33(g)(8) Determining borrower qualification for discharge 34 CFR 674.33(g)(4) Discharge not available for fraudulently obtained loans 34 CFR 674.33(g)(5) Borrower must cooperate in enforcement actions on discharged loans 34 CFR 674.33(g)(6)Closed School Search Each week, the Department publishes a spreadsheet you can use to determine if one of your students has a loan from a school that might be eligible for a closed- school discharge.

For the best advice on how to proceed when a borrower files for bankruptcy protection, a school should consult its attorney. The school should ensure that the attorney is aware of the due diligence provisions that apply to school actions. If a school receives notice that a borrower has filed for bankruptcy protection, it must immediately stop collection efforts (outside of the bankruptcy proceeding itself). If the borrower has filed under Chapter 12 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, the school must also suspend collection efforts against any endorser. The school must file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding unless, in the case of a proceeding under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the notice of meeting of creditors states the borrower has no assets. Effective for bankruptcies filed on or after October 8, 1998, a borrower who receives a general discharge in bankruptcy does not, by that order, obtain a discharge of a loan that has been in repayment for seven years or more at the time of the bankruptcy filing. For these bankruptcies, a student loan is discharged by a general discharge order only if the borrower also obtains a court ruling that repayment of the loan would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents. Resuming or terminating billing and collection A school must resume billing and collection procedures after the borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 727, 11 U.S.C. or U.S.C. 1328(b) unless the court has found that repayment would impose an undue hardship. If the court has found that repayment would impose an undue hardship, the school must terminate all collection action and write off the loan. If a school receives a repayment from a borrower after a loan has been discharged, it must deposit that payment in its Perkins Loan Fund.Bankruptcy laws and regulations 11 U.S.C. 1307, 1325, and 1328(b) are laws applicable to bankruptcy cases in general, not just to Perkins Loan bankruptcy cases. 11 U.S.C. 1307 concerns the dismissal of a Chapter 13 case or the conversion of a case filed under Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7 proceeding. 11 U.S.C. 1325 concerns the confirmation by the court of a borrower's proposed repay - ment plan. 11 U.S.C. 1328(b) allows a debtor who fails to complete the payments required under the plan to obtain a discharge if conditions are met. A school should consult an attorney for the best advice in bankruptcy cases. DCL GEN-15-13 Bankruptcy and student eligibility See Volume 1 for a discussion of how bankruptcy affects a student's eligibility for aid. Bankruptcies filed before October 8, 1998 See previous editions of the FSA Handbook for discussion of bankruptcies filed before October 8, 1998. Chapter 13 bankruptcies 34 CFR 674.49(e) Resuming billing and collection Procedures Responding to complaint for determination of dischargeability Customarily, a borrower obtains a judicial ruling of undue hardship by filing an adversary proceeding\u2014a lawsuit within the bankruptcy proceeding\u2014in the bankruptcy court seeking to prove undue hardship. If a borrower files an adversary proceeding to prove undue hardship under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8), the school must decide, on the basis of reasonably available information, whether repayment under the current repayment schedule or under any adjusted schedule would impose undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents. If the school concludes that repayment would not impose an undue hardship, the school must then decide whether the expected costs of opposing the discharge would exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan (principal, interest, late charges, and collection costs). If the expected costs do not exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, the school must oppose the discharge and, if the borrower is in default, seek a judgment for the amount owed. If necessary, the school may compromise a portion of that amount to obtain a judgment. If the school opposes a request for determination of dischargeability on the ground of undue hard - ship, a school may also file a complaint with the court to obtain a determination that the loan is not dischargeable and to obtain a judgment on the loan. Schools that are state instrumentalities may, as an alternative, oppose an undue hardship claim by asserting their immunity from suit in bankruptcy. As with any other action in defending student loans in bankruptcy, the school should consult with counsel and should ensure that counsel is fully informed about recent changes in Department regulations to support this position. Procedures for responding to proposed Chapter 13 repayment plan Under Chapter 13, the borrower may generally obtain an adjustment in repayment terms of all of his/her debts. The borrower proposes a repayment plan that addresses whether and how each debt or class of debts will be paid. If the court approves the plan, creditors are bound to the terms of that plan for duration of the plan, typically three to five years. If the borrower's repayment plan proposes full repayment of the Perkins Loan, including all principal, interest, late charges, and collection costs on the loan, no response from the school is required. The school is also not required to respond to a proposed repayment plan that does not include any provision in regard to the Perkins Loan obliga - tion or to general unsecured claims. If the borrower proposes to repay less than the total amount owed and that the remainder be dis - charged, the school must determine, from its own records and court documents, the amount of the loan dischargeable under the plan. The school does this by subtracting the total proposed payments from the total amount owed. The school must also determine from its own records and court docu - ments whether the borrower's proposed repayment plan meets the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1325.Chapter 4\u2014Perkins Repayment Plans, Forbearance, Deferment, Discharge, and Cancellation6-159FSA HB June 2018CFR Glossary DCL Bankruptcy Procedures (continued) Two of those requirements are particularly relevant: First, the amount to be paid under the plan must at least equal the amount the school would receive if the debtor had filed under Chapter 7 rather than under Chapter 13. Second, to pay creditors under the plan, the debtor must use all income not needed to support himself or herself and his or her dependents. If the borrower's proposed repayment plan does not meet the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1325, the school must object to the confirmation by the court of the proposed plan, unless the cost of this action will exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan debt; if the cost will exceed one-third of the dischargeable debt, the school is not required to take this action. Also, when a borrower proposes to repay less than the total amount owed, the school must determine whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 for the school to move to have the Chapter 13 case either dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. Such grounds include a borrower's failure to (1) begin payments under the plan within the required time (usually 30 days from the date the plan is filed), (2) file a proposed plan in a timely manner, or (3) pay required court fees and charges. If the school determines that such grounds do exist, the school must move to dismiss or convert the Chapter 13 case to a Chapter 7 proceeding, unless the cost of this action will exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan debt. After a borrower's proposed repayment plan is confirmed by the court, the school must monitor the borrower's compliance with the repayment plan. If the school determines from its own records or court documents that the borrower either has not made the payments required under the plan or has filed for a hardship discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), the school must determine whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to dismiss the case filed under Chapter 13 or to convert the Chapter 13 case to a Chapter 7 proceeding or whether the borrower is entitled to a hardship discharge. If grounds do exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to dismiss or convert a Chapter 13 case, the school must move to convert or dismiss the case. If a borrower has not demonstrated entitlement to a hardship discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), the school must oppose the hardship discharge request, unless the costs of these actions, when added to those already incurred, would exceed one-third of the dischargeable debt.CFR Glossary DCL CHAPTERC 5 FSA HB June 2018 6-161 Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default When a Perkins Loan enters repayment, your school must follow the due diligence requirements of Subpart C of the Perkins regulation (34 CFR 674.41-50). You must afford a borrower maximum opportunity to repay a Federal Perkins Loan. Specific steps the school must take include (but are not limited to) billing the borrower, sending overdue notices, and conducting address searches if the borrower cannot be located. If billing procedures fail, a school must take more aggressive collection steps such as hiring a collection firm and/or litigating. Default in the Federal Perkins Loan Program is defined as \"the failure of a borrower to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note or written repayment agreement. \"COMMUNICATION WITH BORROWERS While billing and collection activities involve many steps, there are general requirements that your school must adhere to at all times. You must inform the borrower of all program changes that affect his or her rights and responsibilities. Your school must respond promptly to the borrower's inquiries. If a borrower disputes a loan and you cannot resolve the dispute, you must explain the services provided by the Department's Federal Student Aid (FSA ) Ombudsman Group. Keeping current information on a borrower makes it easier for the school to know when repayment must begin and where to send billing notices. The various offices at the school\u2014the admissions, business, alumni, placement, financial aid, and registrar's offices, and others, as necessary\u2014must provide any available information about the borrower that is relevant to loan repayment, including the borrower's current enrollment status; the borrower's expected graduation or termination date; the date the borrower officially withdraws, drops below half- time enrollment, or is expelled; and the borrower's current name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and driver's license number (if any).Communication requirements General due diligence 34 CFR 674.41(a) Coordination of information 34 CFR 674.41(b) Contact with borrower 34 CFR 674.42 Disclosure of repayment information 34 CFR 674.42(a) Exit counseling 34 CFR 674.42(b) Contact during initial and post-deferment grace periods 34 CFR 674.42(c) For information about maintaining billing and collection records, see Chapter 1 .CFR Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-162FSA HB June 2018 REQUIREMENTS AT END OF ENROLLMENT Exit interviews Contact with the borrower becomes even more important as the borrower's last day of attendance approaches. As described in Chapter 3, your school must conduct exit interviews with borrowers shortly before borrowers graduate or drop below half-time enrollment (if known in advance). Contact during grace periods A school must contact the borrower during both initial and post- deferment grace periods to remind him or her when repayment will begin or resume. Your school must contact the borrower three times during the nine- month initial grace period. The school must also contact the borrower twice during any six-month post-deferment grace period. The chart on the next page shows the length of initial and post-deferment grace periods for Perkins Loans. The first contact must be 90 days after any grace period (initial or post-deferment) begins. The school must remind the borrower that he or she is responsible for repaying the loan. The school must also inform the borrower of the amount of principal and interest, as projected for the life of the loan, and the due date and amount of the first (or next) payment. The second contact must be 150 days after any grace period begins, when the school must again remind the borrower of the due date and amount of the first (or next) payment. For six - month grace periods, the second contact should coincide with the first billing notice. These two notices may be combined. For nine-month grace periods, the school must make a third contact 240 days after the grace period begins to remind the borrower of the date and amount of the first payment. This contact should coincide with the first billing notice. Again, the school may combine the two notices.Grace period contact 34 CFR 674.42(c) When Payments Are Made Any funds collected as a result of billing the borrower are to be deposited in an account insured by the federal government, or secured by collateral of reasonable equivalent value, or invested in low-risk income-producing securities. Your school must exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary with regard to these deposits and investments.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-163FSA HB June 2018 Billing procedures 34 CFR 674.43 Procedures required when payments are overdue 34 CFR 674.43(b), (c), & (d) Optional late charge 34 CFR 674.31(b)(5)(i) & (ii) 34 CFR 674 Appendix E Schools are authorized but not required to assess a late charge for an overdue payment on a loan. Late charges may be assessed only during the billing process.BILLING PROCEDURES AND OVERDUE PAYMENTS Billing refers to that series of actions the school routinely performs to notify borrowers of payments due, remind them of overdue payments, and demand payment of overdue amounts. The school may choose a coupon payment system as its method of billing. The school must send the coupons to the borrower at least 30 days before the first payment is due when using a coupon payment system. If the school does not use a coupon system, it must, at least 30 days before the first payment is due, send the borrower a statement of account and a written notice giving the name and address of the party to which payments should be sent. The statement of account includes information such as the total amount borrowed, the interest rate on the loan, and the amount of the monthly payment. For subsequent payments, the school must send the borrower a statement of account at least 15 days before the due date of the payment. If the borrower chooses to make payments through electronic funds transfer, the school doesn't have to send the borrower a statement of account before each payment. However, the school must send the borrower an annual statement of account that lists the required amounts and dates of repayment, as well as any information tracking the status of any late charges.

In this notice, you must tell the borrower the amount of any late charge your school has assessed (see discussion under Late charges later in this chapter), and whether your school has added the charge amount to the principal amount as of the first day on which the payment was due, or demanded payment of the charge no later than the first day on which the next installment is due. You may skip the first two letters and send just the final demand letter within 15 days after a payment is overdue if the borrower's repayment history has been unsatisfactory or if you can reasonably conclude the borrower does not intend to repay the loan or to seek forbearance, deferment, or cancellation. A borrower is considered to have an unsatisfactory repayment history if he or she has failed to make payments when due; has failed to request deferment, forbearance, or cancellation on time; or has received a final demand letter. The final demand letter must inform the borrower that unless the school receives a payment or a request for forbearance, deferment, or cancellation within 30 days of the date of the letter, the school will refer the account for collection or litigation and will report the default to a credit bureau as required by law. If mail sent to a borrower is returned undelivered, or if the borrower fails to respond, you must take steps to locate the borrower. These steps must include reviews of borrower records in all appropriate school offices; reviews of telephone directories or inquiries to directory assis - tance at the borrower's last known address, and attempting to reach the borrower by phone; and attempting to locate and contact the borrower by electronic means.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-165FSA HB June 2018 Contacting the borrower by telephone If the borrower does not respond to the final demand letter within 30 days of the date the letter was sent, you must try to contact him or her by telephone before beginning collection procedures. As telephone contact is often very effective in getting the borrower to begin repayment, one call may avoid the more costly procedures of collection. You should make at least two attempts to reach the borrower on different days and at different times. If the borrower has an unlisted telephone number, you must make reasonable attempts to obtain it by contacting sources such as the borrower's employer or parents. If you are still unsuccessful, you should document the contact attempts in your files. Address searches The school must take the following steps to locate the borrower if communications are returned undelivered (other than unclaimed mail): 1. Review the records of all appropriate school offices. 2. Review printed or web-based telephone directories or check with information operators in the area of the borrower's last known address. If these methods are unsuccessful, you must continue efforts to locate the borrower, using either school personnel or a commercial skip-tracing firm. If you use school personnel, you must employ and document efforts comparable to commercial skip-tracing firms. If you still can't locate the borrower after taking these steps, you must continue to make reasonable attempts at least twice a year until the loan is recovered through litigation, the account is assigned to the Department, or the account is written off. Late charges The assessment of late charges on an overdue Perkins Loan borrower is optional. A school that adopts a policy of assessing late charges on an overdue Perkins Loan must impose them on all borrowers with overdue payments. The charge is based either on the actual costs the school incurs in taking steps to obtain the overdue amount or on average costs incurred in similar attempts with other borrowers. The charge may not exceed 20% of the installment payment most recently due. If a school opts to charge late fees, the school may charge late fees only during the billing process; a school may not charge late fees once the school begins collections procedures. Telephone contact required 34 CFR 674.43(f) Contacting the endorser\u2014loans Before July 23, 1992 For loans made prior to July 23, 1992, the school must also try to collect the amount owed from any endorser of the loan. It may help to send the endorser a copy of the final demand letter that was sent to the borrower and copies of all subsequent notices, including demand/collection letters. For loans made on or after July 23, 1992, an endorser is no longer required. Address search 34 CFR 674.44 charges June 2018 You may add a late charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the first day the payment was due. Alternatively, you may include the charge with the next payment that is scheduled after the date you notify the borrower that the charge must be paid in full by the next payment due date. You must inform the borrower of the late charge, preferably in the first overdue payment notice. For a borrower who repays the full amount of past-due payments, the school may waive any late charges that were imposed. Loan acceleration You may accelerate a loan if the borrower misses a payment or does not file for deferment, forbearance, or cancellation on time. Acceleration means immediately making payable the entire outstanding balance, including interest and any applicable late charges or collection fees. Because this marks a serious stage of default, the borrower should have one last chance to bring his or her account current. For that reason, if the school plans to accelerate the loan, it must send the borrower a written acceleration notice at least 30 days in advance. The notice may be included in the final demand letter or in some other written notice sent to the borrower. If the loan is accelerated, you must send the borrower another notice to inform him or her of the date the loan was accelerated and the total amount due. Remember that acceleration is an option, not a requirement. However, if you plan to assign the loan to the Department for collection, you must first accelerate the loan. Once a loan has been accelerated, the borrower loses all rights to deferment and cancellation benefits for qualifying service performed after the date of acceleration.Loan acceleration 34 CFR 674.31(b)(8) 34 CFR 674.43(e)CFR Collection, and Default 6-167FSA HB June 2018 DEFAULT REDUCTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM The Default Reduction Assistance Program (DRAP) assists schools in contacting defaulted Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) borrowers. A letter is sent from the Department of Education (the Department) on officia l letterhead to defaulted Perkins Loan borrowers. It explains the serious consequences of default including the inability to obtain other federally-supported financial assistance, withholding of federal and state income tax refunds, salary garnishment, and damage to credit history. It also encourages borrowers to contact the school to initiate repayment arrangements. Through DRAP , a school or its third party servicer can submit borrower information for letters to be printed and mailed; maintain borrower information; edit DRAP contact information without the Department's intervention; run a report that assists in monitoring the letters mailed to borrowers; run a report that assists in tracking the total number of letter requests submitted; and determine if a letter was returned to the Department as \"undeliverable\" and if an address has been determined to be invalid. Participation in the DRAP process is voluntary. There is no cost to the school. Timing The DRAP process is most effective when used during the 30-day period when the school is waiting for the defaulted borrower to respond to the final demand letter. Do not request default reduction assistance once the account has been referred to a collection agency.Perkins Loan Default Reduction Assistance Program (DRAP) EA November 15, 2013 Default The failure of a borrower to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note or written repayment Programs, 2018 Accessing and initiating the DRAP process All related functions of the DRAP process are accessed via the COD website. To access the DRAP section of the COD website, log in at https://cod.ed.gov , and from the School tab select Campus-Based and then \"DRAP.\" To initiate the process, a school or its third party servicer enters information about borrowers who have defaulted on their Perkins Loans. The information may be entered for each borrower or it may be uploaded from a file. Following submission of the information, a letter will be printed on the Department's letterhead and emailed to each borrower. The email encourages borrowers to contact the school in order to initiate repayment arrangements. A PDF copy of the email may also be downloaded and printed for mailing by the school or third party servicer. If a school or a third-party servicer that submits DRAP data on behalf of a school does not also provide Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) services for the school, the servicer must be granted DRAP-only access to the COD system by the school's Destination Point Administrator (DPA). Address information and undeliverable mail The Department will send only one DRAP email to each address provided by a school. Schools will need to log in periodically to review and print reports of undeliverable emails. Schools are encouraged to provide updated addresses. When an address is updated, a DRAP letter is sent to the new address. Contact information For additional information about DRAP, contact the COD School Relations Center at 800-848-0978 . Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. (ET).

You must make a first effort to collect using either your own personnel or hiring a collection firm. Before beginning collection procedures, you must attempt all of the required contact methods described previously. You must also report the borrower to at least one nationwide credit bureau. If the school's personnel or the collection firm cannot convert the account to regular repayment status by the end of 12 months (or if the borrower does not qualify for forbearance, deferment, or cancellation), you have two options\u2014either to litigate or to make a second effort to collect. A second effort to collect requires one of the following procedures: If you first attempted to collect by using your own personnel, you must refer the account to a collection firm unless state law prohibits doing so. If you first used a collection firm, you must attempt to collect by using your own personnel or by using a different collection firm, or the school must submit the account to the Department for assignment. If a collection firm (retained by a school as part of its second effort to collect) cannot place an account into regular repayment status by the end of 12 months (or if the borrower does not qualify for forbearance, deferment, or cancellation), the firm must return the account to the school. If you are unsuccessful in your effort to place the loan in repayment after a second collection effort, you must continue to make yearly attempts to collect from the borrower until the loan is recovered through litigation, the account is assigned to the Department, or the loan is written off.Collection procedures 34 CFR 674.45 Credit bureau reporting 34 CFR 674.45(a)(1) & (b) First effort to collect 34 CFR 674.45(a)(2) Litigation or second effort 34 CFR 674.45(c) Annual efforts to collect 34 CFR 674.45(d) Requirements after one year 34 CFR 674.45(c) Costs assessed to borrower 34 CFR 674.45(e) Treatment collected funds 34 CFR 674.43(g) 674.45(f) Preemption of 674.45(g) Ombudsman information 34 CFR 674.45(h) Use of contractors for billing and collection 34 CFR 674.48 School is ultimately responsible 34 CFR 674.48(a) & (b) School responsibilities when using contractors 34 CFR 674.48(c) & (d) Limitations on use of contractors 34 CFR 674.48(e) School requirements of contractors June 2018 Credit bureau reporting A school must report an account to credit bureaus as being in default when a borrower fails to respond to the final demand letter or the telephone contact. You must report the default to any one national credit bureau or to an affiliated credit bureau that transmits credit information to one of the three national credit bureaus with which the Department has an agreement (see box below). You must report any subsequent changes in the status of the borrower's account to the same national credit bureau, using the procedures required by that credit bureau. You must respond within one month to any inquiry received from any credit bureau about reported loan information. Finally, you must notify all credit bureaus to which you reported the default when a borrower makes consecutive, on-time monthly payments. Reporting all credit history is essential to ensure that current and future creditors have complete information regarding the credit obligations of the borrower. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a borrower may appeal the accuracy and validity of the information reported to the credit bureau and reflected in the credit report. You should be prepared to handle the appeal and make necessary corrections to the report as required by the provisions of the Act. National Credit Bureaus The Department has entered into an agreement with the three national credit bureaus listed below: Trans Union Corporation 1-800-888-4213 Experian (formerly TRW) 1-888-397-3742 Equifax 1-800-685-1111 National credit bureaus charge fees for their services. These fees differ from credit bureau to credit bureau. Credit bureaus affiliated with the above credit bureaus may have different fees from those of the national credit bureaus. The Department does not keep a list of these affiliated bureaus and their fees. The Privacy Act authorizes disclosure of a borrower's account information to creditors without the borrower's consent if the disclosure helps enforce the terms and conditions of the loan. You may also make such disclosures about loans that haven't defaulted and/or are being disbursed.Credit bureau reporting 34 CFR 674.45(a)(1) & (b)CFR Glossary 5\u2014Perkins and Default 6-171FSA HB June 2018 Ceasing collection A school may cease collection activity on defaulted accounts with balances of less than $200 (including outstanding principal, accrued interest, collection costs, and late charges) if the school carried out the required due diligence and if the account has had no activity for four years. Although interest will continue to accrue and may put the account over $200, you will not have to resume collection activity if you document that you ceased collection activity when the account was under $200. The borrower will remain responsible for repaying the account, including accrued interest . The borrower will still be in default and ineligible for FSA funds and the account will still be included in the school's cohort default rate, if applicable. ALTERNATIVES TO LITIGATION To avoid litigation, a school may offer to waive collection costs as incentive for repayment. You may waive all collection costs on a loan if the borrower makes a lump-sum payment of the entire amount outstanding, including principal and interest; a written repayment agreement is not required. You may also waive a portion of the collection costs on a loan if the borrower agrees to pay a corresponding portion of the loan within 30 days of entering into a written repayment agreement with the school. For example, if the borrower repays half of the outstanding balance on a loan within 30 days of the agreement, the school may waive half of the collection costs incurred through the date of that payment. The amount of waived collection costs may be charged to the Perkins Loan fund. You may compromise the repayment of a defaulted loan if you have fully complied with all due diligence requirements and the borrower pays, in a single lump-sum payment, at least 90% of the outstanding principal balance, plus all interest and collection fees. The federal share of the compromise repayment must bear the same relation to the school's share as the Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) bears to the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC). A borrower may rehabilitate a defaulted Perkins Loan by making nine consecutive, on-time, monthly payments. A rehabilitated Perkins Loan is returned to regular repayment status. (See Default Status and Perkins Eligibility later in this chapter.) A borrower may include his or her defaulted Perkins Loan in a Direct Consolidation Loan. The amount eligible for consolidation is the sum of the unpaid principal, accrued unpaid interest, late charges, and outstanding collection costs. A defaulted loan that is being repaid under a court order remains in default status until paid and is not eligible for consolidation.Ceasing collections cites Ceasing collections 34 CFR 674.33(e) Collection costs waiver 34 CFR 674.47(d) Consolidating defaulted Perkins Loans To get information about obtaining a Direct Consolidation Loan contact the Loan Consolidation Call Center at 1-800- 557-7392 or by visiting StudentAid.gov/ consolidation . Writing Off Accounts You may write off a defaulted account with a balance of less than $25 (including outstanding principal, accrued interest, collection costs, and late charges). You may also write off a defaulted account with a balance of less than $50 (including outstanding principal, accrued interest, collection costs, and late charges) if, for a period of two years, you have billed the borrower as required by 34 CFR 674.43(a) and 674.47(h). If you write off an account, the borrower is relieved of all payment obligations, and you must deduct the amount of the account from the Federal Perkins Loan fund. If you receive a payment from a borrower after you have written off the loan, you must deposit that payment into the Fund.CFR Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-172FSA HB June 2018 LITIGATION If the collection procedures prescribed in the regulations do not result in the repayment of a loan, the school must review the account for litigation once every two years. If all the conditions are met, the school must litigate. The conditions are the total amount owed, including outstanding principal, interest, collection costs, and late charges, on all the borrower's Perkins Loans at the school is more than $500; the borrower can be located and served with process; the borrower either has enough assets attachable under state law to cover a major portion of the debt or enough income that can be garnished under state law to satisfy a major portion of the debt over a reasonable period of time (defining a \"reasonable period of time\" is left to the school); the borrower does not have a defense that will bar judgment for the school; and the expected cost of litigation (including attorneys' fees) does not exceed the amount that can be recovered from the bor - rower. Even if all the above conditions are not met, your school may still choose to sue a defaulted borrower. If the borrower has a partial defense that may bar judgment for the school, you must weigh the costs of litigation against the costs of recovery based on the amount of the enforceable portion of the debt. No federal or state statute of limitation can apply to enforcement actions to collect Perkins Loans. Your school must attempt to recover from the borrower all litigation costs, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and other related costs, to the extent permitted by applicable state law. You are also required to try to recover all costs previously incurred in the collection of overdue payments if the borrower has not paid these collection costs; a percentage of these unrecovered costs may be charged to the fund as explained later in this chapter under Billing and Collection Costs . When a school has filed suit to collect a defaulted Perkins Loan and a judgment has been rendered on the loan, the borrower is obligated to repay only the amount of the judgment obtained on the loan. A defaulted loan that is being repaid under court order remains in default status until paid and is not eligible for consolidation. After a judgment is satisfied on the defaulted loan, the student is again eligible for future awards under these programs if all other eligibility criteria are met.Elimination of defense of infancy HEOA Section 486 Schools in the Perkins Loan Program are not subject to a defense raised by a borrower on the basis of a claim of infancy under state law. See General Provisions relating to student assistance. Deceased student and family estate HEOA section 486 | HEA section 484A Effective date: August 14, 2008 The HEOA of 2008 provides that a deceased student, a deceased student's estate, or the estate of such student's family does not have to repay any federal student aid, including interest, collection costs, or other charges. Litigation 34 CFR 674.46CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-173FSA HB June 2018 DEFAULT STATUS AND FSA LOAN ELIGIBILITY A borrower who is in default on an FSA loan is not eligible for any further FSA loans unless they have regained eligibility. (See Volume 1 for guidance on how a student may regain eligibility.) Regaining eligibility for federal student aid To the extent that he or she is otherwise eligible, a borrower who is in default on a Perkins Loan may regain eligibility for federal student aid by making satisfactory repayment arrangements on his or her defaulted loan. (See also Volume 1.) For purposes of regaining eligibility for federal student aid, a borrower who is in default on a Perkins Loan can regain eligibility for the remaining Title IV programs by making six on-time, consecutive, monthly payments on the defaulted loan. A borrower may regain eligibility only once in this way. After a bor rower has made six on-time, consecutive, monthly payments on the defaulted loan the school must appropriately update the borrower's loan status code in the NSLDS. Note that a borrower who makes six payments in the course of rehabilitating a defaulted loan but does not seek additional Title IV aid will not be considered to have used the one time opportunity to regain eligibility. Note that a borrower whose Perkins Loan is in default also can regain eligibility for federal student aid by consolidating his or her Perkins Loan. Perkins Loan rehabilitation Your school must establish a rehabilitation program and notify all borrowers with defaulted loans of the option to rehabilitate and the advantages of rehabilitation. A borrower may rehabilitate a defaulted Perkins Loan by making full m onthly payments , as determined by the school, each month for nine consecutive months and requesting rehabilitation . Borrowers may not rehabilitate loans on which the holder has obtained a judgment. However, your school may enter into an agreement with the borrower that provides the borrower with some of the benefits of rehabilitation. For example, your school could promise to vacate the current judgment and request the removal of the default from the borrower's cre dit report after the borrower makes nine consecutive payments and signs a new p romissory note.Rehabilitation of a Perkins Loan 34 CFR 674.39Involuntary Payments The term \"involuntarily\" includes payments obtained by income tax offset, garnishment, income asset execution, or pursuant to a judgment.On Time A rehabilitation payment is on time if it is a full monthly payment, as determined by the school, and made within 20 days of the due date. TIPCFR Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-174FSA HB June 2018 The rehabilitation payments should be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance on the loan within a 10-year repayment period. A school may not establish a loan rehabilitation policy that requires defaulted Perkins Loan borrowers to pay the full outstanding balance of the loan within the nine-month rehabilitation period, if such payments would create a hardship for the borrower. In most cases, such a policy would require a borrower to make excessively high monthly payments, and would, in effect, deny the borrower access to a statutorily mandated benefit of the Perkins Loan Program. Within 30 days of receiving the borrower's last on-time consecutive monthly payment, you must return the borrower to regular repayment status; treat the first of the nine consecutive payments as the first pay - ment in a new 10-year repayment schedule; and instruct any credit bureau to which the default was reported to remove the default from the borrower's credit history. After rehabilitating a defaulted loan and returning to regular repayment status, a borrower regains the benefits and privileges of the promissory note, including deferment and cancellation. If a borrower chooses to rehabilitate a defaulted loan and then fails to make nine consecutive on-time payments, the rehabilitation is unsuccessful, but the borrower may still make further attempts to rehabilitate the defaulted loan. Also, if a borrower successfully rehabilitates a defaulted loan and maintains good standing on the loan, the borrower may continue to attempt to rehabilitate other defaulted Perkins Loans. However, if the borrower successfully rehabilitates a defaulted loan, but the loan later returns to default, the borrower may not attempt to rehabilitate that loan again or any other defaulted Perkins Loan. Loans with judgments When a school has filed suit to collect a defaulted Perkins Loan and a judgment has been rendered on the loan, the borrower is obligated to repay only the amount of the judgment obtained on the loan. If the judgment is for less than the outstanding balance on the loan, the school may write off the portion of the loan not covered by the judgment. After a judgment is satisfied on the defaulted loan, the student is again eligible for aid from FSA programs if all other eligibility criteria are met. However, if a borrower has previously satisfied a defaulted student loan involuntarily (for instance, through wage garnishment), you should consider this as evidence of unwillingness to repay and should not approve further loan assistance to the borrower.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-175FSA HB June 2018 Previously defaulted Perkins Loans discharged for school closure A Perkins Loan made on or after January 1, 1986, may be discharged if the borrower is unable to complete his or her program of study due to the closure of the school that made the loan. A defaulted borrower whose loan is discharged under this closed school provision is eligible for additional federal student aid, provided that he or she meets all other eligibility criteria. (Schools that close must assign all Perkins Loans to the Department.) PERKINS COHORT DEFAULT RATES (CDR) Your school's cohort default rate is calculated for a particular year based on information you report in Part 3, Sections D and E, of the FISAP. For detailed information on how your school's cohort default rate is determined, see Part III of the FISA P Instructions available under \"Publications\" on the IFAP website. For detailed information on how your school's cohort default rate is determined, see Part III of the Draft FISAP Instructions Booklet available under \"Publications\" on the IFAP website. How the Perkins Loan default rate is calculated For any award year in which 30 or more borrowers enter repayment , the cohort default rate is the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment in that award year on loans received for attendance at that school and who default before the end of the following award year . For any award year in which fewer than 30 current and former students at the school enter repayment on a loan received at the school, the cohort default rate is the percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that school in any of the three most recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment. For purposes of the cohort default rate, a loan enters repayment only once in its life. This repayment begins the day after the end of the initial grace period or the day that the borrower waives his or her initial grace period. A borrower is included in determining the school's cohort default rate if the borrower's default has persisted for at least 240 consecutive days for a loan repayable monthly or 270 consecutive days for a loan repayable quarterly. Closed school discharge 34 CFR 674.33(g) Perkins CDR 34 CFR 674.5 CDR Calculation 34 CFR 674.5(b) Loans included in the cohort default rate 34 CFR 674.5(c)(1) & (2) Loans not included in cohort default rate 34 CFR 674.5(c)(3) CDR for Multiple Locations or Change of Ownership If a school has a branch or branches or has an additional location or loca tions, the school's cohort default rate applies to all branches and locations of the school as they exist on the first day of the award year for which the rate is calculated. The cohort default rate applies to all branches/ locations of the school from the date the Department notifies the school of the rate until the Department notifies the school that the rate no longer applies. For more information about the effect of changes of ownership and the treatment of multiple locations in the Perkins rate calculation, see 34 CFR June 2018 Perkins Loans that are not treated as defaults The following loans are not treated as defaults when reporting borrower status on Part III of the FIS AP: Loans on which borrowers have made six on-time, consecutive voluntary, full monthly payments Loans on which borrowers have \"voluntarily\" made all payments currently due Loans that borrowers have repaid in full Loans for which borrowers have received deferments or forbearance based on conditions that began prior to loans becoming 240/270 days past due Loans that have been rehabilitated Loans repaid in full under a compromise repayment agreement in accordance with 674.33(e. Loans that have been discharged due to death or total and permanent disability, bankruptcy, or a school closing Loans that have been assigned to the ED because of the total and permanent disability of the borrower Rules for calculating the number of days in default For purposes of reporting on Part III of the FISAP, a school should use the following rules to calculate the number of days a loan has been in default: The 240/270 consecutive days in default is determined by calculating the \"age\" of the account (that is, the number of consecutive days the oldest dollar is past due). A payment that a borrower makes on a past-due loan is applied to the oldest dollars first, effectively reducing the past-due status. A loan on which a borrower is past due and on which the borrower makes an occasional payment but never becomes current could be counted as a defaulted loan for the cohort default rate calculation despite the occasional payments. Because the delinquency is not being cured, the oldest past-due dollar could eventually become 240 days past due, making the loan count in the default rate calculation. However, if the borrower makes enough occasional payments to prevent the oldest past-due dollar from becoming 240 days old, the loan would not be counted as being in default.Perkins Cohort Default Rates Listing The Federal Perkins Loan Program Status of Default , known as the Orange Book, lists the cohort default rates for each school that participates in the Perkins program. The Orange Book can be found in the \"Publications\" area on the IFAP website. Adjusting Past-Due Status Example Marty's oldest dollar is 240 days past due. He files a request for a deferment based on the fact that he is attending school and the enrollment period began on the date that the loan became 90 days past due. The past-due status of the loan is reduced to 90 days, and the loan is given a deferment status. This loan is treated as if the 240-day threshold had never been reached. Therefore, it would not be counted in the school's cohort default rate.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-177FSA HB June 2018 An exception to the 240/270-day threshold will be granted in a case where a borrower (1) would have qualified for a deferment for a period beginning prior to the loan hitting the 240/270-day threshold and (2) failed to file a request for the deferment in a timely manner. For such a borrower, the loan's past-due status would be adjusted to reflect the deferment pe - riod beginning date. However, the borrower would need to pay any past-due amounts that were due prior to the beginning of the authorized deferment periods, if the deferment period be - ginning date does not eliminate the loan's entire delinquency. Penalties for high Perkins default rates If the school's cohort default rate is 25% or higher , and Congress appropriates funds, the school's FCC will be reduced to zero. 50% or higher for the three most recent years, the school is ineligible to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program and must liquidate its loan portfolio. A school may appeal a determination of ineligibility if the appeal is based on an inaccurate calculation of its cohort default rate or a low number of borrowers entering repayment. A school appeals a determination of ineligibility based on an inaccurate calculation by adjusting the cohort default rate data on the FISAP. BILLING AND COLLECTION COSTS Your school must assess charges against the borrower, for the cost of actions taken with regard to past-due payments on the loan (not routine billing costs). If your school cannot recover billing and collection costs from the borrower, you may charge the costs to the fund, provided the costs fall within the specifications described in the following paragraphs and then corresponding regulations. Schools are no longer able to claim the Administrative Cost Allowance (ACA) due to the expiration of the Perkins Loan Program. You must report the collection costs permitted in the regulations in the collections cost category on the FISAP. The only billing costs a school may charge the fund are the costs of telephone calls made to demand payment of overdue amounts not paid by the borrower. Even if the amount recovered from the borrower does not suffice to pay the amount of the past-due payments and the penalty or late charges, the school may charge the fund only for the unpaid portion of the actual cost of the calls.Billing and collection Billing and collection firms 34 CFR 674.48 Assessing costs 34 CFR 674.45(e) Charging costs to the fund 34 CFR 674.47 Perkins Loans and ACA 34 CFR 674.37(a)Penalty for 34 CFR 674.5(a) Reasonable collection costs 34 CFR 674.45(e)(3) For loans referred to a collection agency on or after July 1, 2008, collection costs charged the borrower may not exceed first collection effort-\u201430% of the principal, interest, and late charges col - lected; second and subsequent collection ef - forts\u201440% of the principal, interest, and late charges collected; for collection efforts resulting from litigation, 40% of principal, interest, and late charges collected, plus court Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-178FSA HB June 2018 A school may waive a percentage of the collection costs past-due on a loan if a borrower agrees to a written repayment arrangement. The percentage of collection costs that may be waived is equal to the percentage of the past-due balance paid by the borrower within 30 days of the date on which the borrower and the school enter into the written repayment agreement. A school may waive 100% of the collection coasts due on a loan in return for a lump-sum payment of the full amount of principal and interest outstanding. The following collection costs may be charged to the Perkins Loan Fund if the costs are waived or not paid by the borrower : Collection costs waived. If your school waives collection costs as incentive for repayment, the amount waived may be charged to the Fund. Cost of a successful address search. You may charge to the Fund a reasonable amount for the cost of a successful address search if you used a commercial skip-tracing service or employed your school's personnel to locate the borrower using comparable methods. (Defining a reasonable amount is left to the school.) Cost of reporting defaulted loans to credit bureaus. You may charge to the Fund the cost of reporting a defaulted loan to a credit bureau, reporting any change in the status of a defaulted account to the bureau to which the school had previously reported the account, and responding to any inquiry from a credit bureau about the status of a loan. Costs of first and second collection efforts. You may charge to the Fund collection costs not paid by the borrower if they do not exceed\u2014for first collection efforts\u201430% of the total principal, interest, and late charges collected and\u2014for second collection efforts\u201440% of the principal, interest, and late charges collected. The school must reimburse the Fund for collection costs initially charged to the Fund but subsequently paid by the borrower. Collection costs resulting from rehabilitation. Collection costs charged to the borrower on a rehabilitated loan may not exceed 24% of the unpaid principal and accrued interest as of the date following application of the ninth payment. Collection costs are not restricted to 24% in the event that the borrower defaults on the rehabilitated loan.Collection costs waiver 34 CFR Collection, and Default 6-179FSA HB June 2018 Costs of a firm performing both collection and litigation services. If a collection firm agrees to perform or obtain the performance of both collection and litigation services on a loan, the amount for both functions that may be charged to the Fund may not exceed the sum of 40% of the amount of principal, interest, and late charges collected on the loan, plus court costs specified in 28 U.S.C. 1920. Collection costs resulting from litigation, including attorney's fees . Collection costs resulting from litigation, including attorney's fees, may be charged to the Fund if not paid by the borrower but must not exceed the sum of court costs specified in 28 U.S.C. 1920; other costs incurred in bankruptcy proceedings in taking actions required or authorized under 34 CFR 674.49; costs of other actions in bankruptcy proceedings to the extent that those costs together with other costs incurred in bankruptcy proceedings do not exceed 40% of the total amount of judgment obtained on the loan; and 40% of the total amount recovered from the borrower in any other proceeding. Due diligence activities involving fixed costs (telephone contacts, credit bureau reporting, and bankruptcy procedures) may be charged to the Fund whether or not the actions are successful. Other activities, such as address searches, collection, and litigation (other than bankruptcy), are typically performed on a contingent-fee basis. If these activities are unsuccessful, there are no costs charged to the school and therefore no costs may be charged to the Fund. If these activities are successful , you may charge the associated allowable costs to the Fund. Assessing and documenting costs You may charge either actual costs incurred in collecting the borrower's loan or average costs incurred for similar actions taken to collect loans in similar stages of delinquency. Your school must assess all reasonable collection costs against the borrower despite any provisions of state law that would conflict with the above provisions. You must document the basis for the costs assessed. For audit purposes, a school must keep documentation supporting costs, including telephone bills and receipts from collection firms.TIPCFR Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-180FSA HB June 2018 ASSIGNING PERKINS LOANS A school may assign Perkins Loans (in repayment, in-school, defaulted or non defaulted) to the Department at any time during the program year. When a school as signs a loan to the Department, it is transferring all rights and responsibilities for collection to the United States government. A school relinquishes its rights to any share of funds collected after a Perkins Loan is assigned to and accepted by the Department. A school may assign defaulted Perkins Loa ns to the Department if it has not been able to collect despite having followed due diligence procedures (including at least a first level of collection); the total amount of the borrower's account to be assigned, including outstanding principal, accrued interest, collection costs, and late charges, is at least $25; and the loan has been accelerated. You may not assign a loan to the Department under the voluntary assignment procedures if the borrower has received a discharge in bankruptcy\u2014unless the bankruptcy court has determined that the student loan obligation is nondischargeable and has entered a judgment against the borrower or unless a court of competent jurisdiction has entered judgment against the borrower on the loan after the entry of the discharge order; your school has sued the borrower (unless the judgment has been entered and assigned to the United States); or the loan has been discharged because the borrower has died or become totally and permanently disabled, or because of a school closure. A school may be required to assign a Perkins Loan if it has knowingly failed to maintain an ac ceptable collection record with regard to the loan or chooses to stop servicing and collecting its Perkins Loans. Nonliquidating schools Schools are permitted to assign non defaulted loans to the Department at any time. The Department recognizes that schools may have exhausted all of their available collection options on some of their defaulted Perkins Loans. Because the Department has collection tools that are not available to schools, such as administrative wage garnishment, Treasury offset, and litigation by the Department of Justice , the Department encourages schools to assign those loans to the Department so additional steps can be taken to recover the loan funds.

Federal Perkins Loans assigned to the Department are now being serviced by ECSI Federal Perkins Loan Servicer in Warrendale, PA (NSLDS ED/ECSI Federal Perkins Servicer, ED Servicer Code 529). If a school has a question about a loan that has been submitted for assignment, it should contact the Client Support Team at ECSI. Contact information for ECSI can be found on the Loan Servicing Centers for Schools Contact Information page at https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/ helpContactInformationDetailedList. jsp?lsc=1 Federal interest on accelerated loans 34 CFR 674.17 Reporting \"Date(s) of First Disbursement\" on Loan Manifest You must report the date each assigned loan was disbursed (attached to the Institutional Certification page of the Perkins Assignment form). The dates listed must match the date of first disbursement initially reported by your school to NSLDS. Clarification Loans that May Be Assigned A school may assign both Perkins Loans that are in default and Perkins Loans that are not in default at any time. DCL GEN 17-10, October 6, 2017.TIPCFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-181FSA HB June 2018 Liquidating schools When a school liquidates its Perkins portfolio, it must assign all loans with outstanding balances to the Department for collection whether defaulted or non defaulted. Loans are assigned without recompense All loans a school assigns to the Department are assigned without recompense. The school is relieved of incurring additional expenses in attempting to collect on the loan. All rights, authorities and privileges associated with the loan are transferred to the Department, and the Department will not reimburse the school's Perkins Fund for any collections made on the assigned loans. Assignment of defaulted loans does not affect the calculation of the school's Perkins Loan cohort default rate. Required documentation A school may be required to submit the following documents to the Department for any loan it proposes to assign an original copy of the assignment form; the original promissory note or a certified copy of the original note; copies of all disbursement records or evidence supporting each disbursement including date and amount of every disbursement; a copy of the repayment record and a copy of the payment his - tory; copies of all approved requests for deferment and cancellation; a copy of the notice to the borrower of the effective date of acceleration and the total amount due on the loan; documentation that the school has withdrawn the loan from any firm that it employed for address search, billing, collection, or litigation services and has notified that firm to cease collection activity on the loans; copies of all pleadings filed or received by the school on be - half of a borrower who has filed a petition in bankruptcy and whose loan obligation is determined to be nondischargeable; and a certified copy of any judgment order entered on the loan. (Please see chart at the end of this chapter for specific informa - tion related to assignment loans that are under DCL Volume 6\u2014The Campus-Based Programs, 2018-2019 6-182FSA HB June 2018 If you assign loans made under the Perkins MPN, you must include copies of the disbursement records that document the principal amount when assigning the loan. The school should retain the original disbursement records until the loan is paid off or otherwise satisfied. For more details on Perkins Loan Portfolio Liquidation and Assignment, see the Federal Perkins Loan Program Assignment and Liquidation Guide available at https://ifap.ed.gov/cbpmaterials/attachments/ PerkinsAssignmentandLiquidationGuide.pdf Terms of assignment If the Department accepts the assignment of a loan, it will give the school written notice to that effect. By accepting the assignment, the Department acquires all rights, title, and interest in the loan. You must endorse and forward to the Department any subsequent payment(s) the borrower may make, as soon as possible. If the Department later determines an assigned loan to be unenforceable because of an act or omission on the part of your school or its agent, your school may have to compensate the Perkins Loan Fund in the amount of the unenforceable portion of the outstanding balance. Once the fund is reimbursed, the Department transfers all rights to the loan back to the school. A borrower whose loan has been assigned to the United States for collection continues to be in default on the loan and is ineligible for FSA funds until the borrower provides confirmation fro m the Department that he or she has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan. Schools that do not utilize PLAS (use a paper process) will receive an official notification of acceptance document identified as \"Perkins Loan Database Report\" via email. This report provides borrower identification information, school identification information, and outstanding principal, interest and fees accepted for assignment by the Department. This is the official acceptance notice and should be retained in the school's records.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-183FSA HB June 2018 Status of assignment Loans accepted Official Notification of Acceptance: When manual paper assignments are accepted, the institution will receive a document identified as \"Perkins Loan Database Report\" via email. This report provides borrower identification information, school identification information, and outstanding principal, interest and fees accepted for assignment by the Department. This is the official acceptance notice and should be retained in the school's records. Hard copies of the acceptance notices (Perkins Loan Database Reports) may be sent to the school's address provided in the school's program participation agreement. The institution should ensure that its mail distribution staff become familiar with these notices and the offices to which they should be distributed. Note: Schools that use PLAS for electronic submission can access information about accepted and rejected assignments through PLAS. These reports can be viewed online or printed from PLAS. Loans rejected For Perkins Loans rejected for assignment, the Department will provide the school with the reason(s) for rejection; if the school can resolve the issue(s) it may resubmit the loan for assignment. For most problems, this process may enable a school to correct the deficiencies and resubmit the rejected loans. The Department will work with the school to assist in resolving issues. CFR Glossary DCL Volume 6\u2014The ASSIGNMENT UNDER E-SIGNED OR PERKINS MPN If you assign loans that were made under an electronically signed promissory note, you must cooperate with the Department in all activities necessary to enforce the loan. You may be asked to provide an affidavit or certification regarding the creation and maintenance of electronic records of the loan. This affidavit or certification must establish that the records are created and maintained in a form appropriate to ensure admissibility of the loan records in a legal proceeding. The affidavit or certification must describe the steps followed by the borrower to execute the promissory note; include copies of screen shots that would have appeared to the borrower when the borrower signed the note electronically; describe field edits and other security measures used to ensure data integrity; describe how the promissory note has been preserved to ensure it has not been altered; include documentation supporting the school's authentication and electronic signature process; and provide any other documentary and technical evidence requested by the Department. The affidavit or certification may be executed in a single record for multiple loans provided that this record is reliably associated with the specific loans to which it pertains. An authorized official or employee of the school may have to testify to ensure admission of the electronic records of the loan or loans in the litigation or legal proceeding to enforce the loan or loans. Your school's most recent audit must assess how well your school's e-sign authentication process meets the Department's \"Standards for Electronic Signatures in Electronic Student Loan Transactions\" (as specified in DCL GEN-01-06).Reconciling NSLDS and School Data The amount of loans and number of borrowers in NSLDS must match what is reported by the school on its final FISAP. For the purposes of Perkins liquidation and closeout, schools must ensure that all outstanding Perkins Loans are properly accounted for and updated in NSLDS. The Department suggests schools request a reconciliation report from NSLDS to ensure its records are consistent with the NSLDS data, and to reconcile any discrepancies.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-185FSA HB June 2018 Liquidation and Assignment Information Complete information about Federal Perkins Loan Portfolio liquidation and assignment is available in the Federal Perkins Loan Program Assignment and Liquidation Guide on the Campus- Based Processing Information Page on the Information for Financial Aid Professionals (IFAP) website.

Your school may use a contractor for billing or collection, but it is still responsible for complying with due diligence regulations regarding those activities. For example, the school, not the billing or collection firm, is responsible for deciding whether to sue a borrower in default. The school is also responsible for decisions about cancelling or deferring repayment, granting forbearance, extending the repayment period, and safeguarding the funds collected. If you use a billing service, you may not use a collection firm that owns or controls the billing service or is owned or controlled by the billing service. In addition, you may not use a collection firm if both the collection firm and billing service are owned or controlled by the same corporation, partnership, association, or individual. Account protection: minimum bond/insurance amounts A school must ensure that its billing service and collection firm maintain a fidelity bond or comparable insurance to protect the accounts they service. At least once a year, the school must review the amount of repayments it expects to receive from billing or collection firms to ensure adequate bond or insurance coverage. A school using a law firm to collect must review the firm's bond or its insurance policy to determine whether the firm is protected against employee misappropriation. If the firm's malpractice insurance also covers misappropriation of funds, that policy is considered to provide coverage. If you don't authorize your collection firm to deduct its fees from borrowers' payments, the firm must be bonded or insured for at least the amount that you expect to be repaid over a two-month period on the assigned accounts. If you do authorize your collection firm to deduct its fees from borrowers' payments, you must ensure that if the amount you expect to be repaid over a two-month period is less than $100,000 \u2014the collection firm is bonded or insured for the lesser of (a) 10 times the amount the school expects to be repaid over a two-month period on assigned accounts; or (b) the amount the firm expects to collect in a two-month period on all accounts it has in its portfolio (not just the school's account). if the amount you expect to be repaid in a two-month period is $100,000 or more \u2014the collection firm has a fidelity bond or comparable insurance that names your school as the beneficiary and is bonded or insured for an amount not less than the amount of funds the school can reasonably expect to be repaid during that two-month period.CFR Glossary DCL Chapter 5\u2014Perkins Loan Billing, Collection, and Default 6-193FSA HB June 2018 Sources of Information on the Perkins Loan Program Perkins Loan Assignment Process and Other Financial Aid You can find detailed treatment of Federal Perkins Loan Program Assignment Procedures at ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/033016FedPerkinsLoanAssignLiquidGuideAvailOnIFAP .html Questions regarding the assignment process as it pertains to the rest of the student financial aid award process or questions concerning the management of student loans not assigned to the Department should be directed either in writing or by phone to the School Participation Team serving your region.

Academic attendance and attendance at an academically-related activity do not include activities where a student may be present, but not academically engaged. Academic Calendar The way in which a school structures its academic programs and measures progress over the program's length. For purposes of the FSA programs, there are three basic types of academic calendars: standard term, nonstandard term, and nonterm.Federal Student 2018-2019A-2FSA HB August 2018Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG) Program A previously offered grant program authorized by the Higher Education Act (HEA) under which grants were awarded during the first and second academic years of study to eligible financially needy undergraduate students who successfully completed rigorous secondary school programs of study. Academic Year For a program that measures program length in credit hours, \u008a a minimum of 30 weeks of instructionaltime; and \u008a 24 semester or trimester hours or 36 quartercredit hours. For a program that measures program length in clock hours, \u008a a minimum of 26 weeks of instructionaltime; and \u008a 900 clock hours. For purposes of defining an academic year, \u008a a week is a consecutive seven-day period; \u008a a week of instructional time is any week inwhich at least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs or, after the last scheduled day of classes for a term or payment period, at least one day of study for final examinations occurs; and \u008a instructional time does not include any vaca - tion periods, homework, or periods of orien - tation or counseling. Acceleration Demand for immediate repayment of the entire outstanding balance of a loan. Accepted Master Promissory Note (MPN) Once a borrower completes an MPN, it is examined in the Common Originations and Disbursement (COD) System for completeness. If, during processing, COD finds that all of the required fields on an MPN have been completed correctly, COD will accept the MPN. An accepted MPN is one of the criteria required for a loan to be booked. Access Device A card, code, or other means of access to a financial account, or any combination thereof, that may be used by a student or parent to initiate electronic fund transfers. Account A record in the general ledger that is used to collect and store similar information. For example, a school will have a cash account in which every transaction involving cash is recorded.

Control Activities Control activities are actions supported by policies and procedures that help ensure management directives are carried out properly and in a timely manner. Control activities can be classified either as preventive or detective. Preventive controls (e.g., approvals) attempt to deter or prevent undesirable events. Detective controls (e.g., reconciliations) attempt to detect undesirable events. Control Environment or Internal Control Environment The overall attitude, awareness, and actions of directors and management (i.e., \"those charged with governance\") regarding the internal control system and its importance to the entity.

If the result equals or exceeds a full-time academic load, the co-op student is considered full time regardless of how many credits are earned for the co-op work. Coordinating Official A capable individual responsible for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which a school participates and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other federal and nonfederal programs of student financial assistance. An individual is \"capable\" if certified by the state in which the school is located and the state requires certification of financial aid administrators. Other factors in determining capability include, but are not limited to, the individual's successful completion of Title IV program training provided or approved by the Secretary and previous experience and documented success in administering the Title IV programs properly.

Interaction between the instructor and student is limited, is not regular and substantive, and is primarily initiated by the student. Correspondence courses are typically self-paced. If a course is part correspondence and part residential training, the Department considers the course to be a correspondence course. Note: A correspondence course is not distance education. Correspondence Student Limitation The requirement that less than 50% of a school's regular students be enrolled in correspondence courses for the school to be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. This limitation may be waived for a school that offers a 2-year associate degree or 4-year baccalaureate degree program if it demonstrates to the Department that in that award year the students enrolled in correspondence courses receive no more than 5% of the total FSA program funds received by all of the school's students. FSA HB August 2018Cost The monetary value of resources used or sacrificed, or liabilities incurred to achieve an objective, such as to acquire or produce a product, or to perform an activity or service.

Pell Grant Payment and Disbursement Schedule (Pell Disbursement or Payment Schedule) A table showing the annual awards that three-quarter, half- time, and less-than-half-time students at term-based institutions using credit hours would receive for an academic year in the Pell Grant Program. This table is published annually by the Department and is based on \u008a a student's expected family contribution (EFC), as determined in accordance with Title IV, part F of the HEA; \u008a a student's attendance costs as defined in Title IV, part F of the HEA; and \u008a the amount of funds available for makingFederal Pell Grants. Pell Grant Pending Disbursement List This list is automatically generated by COD and sent to a school's SAIG mailbox. It produces a listing of anticipated disbursements (Disbursement Release Indicator (DRI) set to false) and actual disbursements ((DRI) set to true) with dates set 8 to 30 days in the future. The list can be used to monitor anticipated disbursements nearing disbursement dates to either set the DRI to true for confirmed eligible students, or to cancel the award for ineligible students. The list also can be used to monitor awards scheduled for upcoming disbursements to determine current eligibility. Pell Grant Reconciliation Report Sent annually by COD just prior to the close of the award year (September 30), the report provides a one-record per student summary of the total YTD Pell Grant disbursements in COD. Pell Grant Reconciliation Reports can also be ordered by a school through the COD web and are useful for both monthly and year-end reconciliation. Pell Grant Verification Status Report Provides a list of students selected by the CPS for verification who have either a blank or W verification status in COD. Students whose verification status is \"W\" must be updated to be reconciled. Students whose verification status is \"blank\" must be updated to be disbursed. COD automatically sends the report to the school's SAIG mailbox on a monthly basis through the last day of December for the award year ending on July 31. Pell Grant Year-to-Date (YTD) Record Contains detailed award and disbursement information at a transaction level. Pell Grant YTD Records are created only upon school requests. They can be requested on a per student, or all students, basis and they are a good tool for reconciling of student Pell data and rebuilding a school's corrupted data base. On an \"all student\" basis, the Pell Grant YTD Record shows the number of recipients at the school; the number of award and/ or disbursement records that were accepted, corrected, and rejected; and, for certain edit codes, the number of times a school received that specific edit code on a response document.

Withdrawing from one or more courses (e.g., reducing credit hours from 12 to 6) or programs but not entirely from the school does not meet the definition of a withdrawal. Instead, this action is considered a change in enrollment status. Schools seeking to participate in an FSA program for the first time must have an undergraduate withdrawal rate for regular students of no more than 33% during the last completed award year.

Updates include changes such as, but not limited to: name or address change, new location or program, increased level of offering, change of officials, or mailing address for publications. Find the e-App at: eligcert.ed.gov/ Training Officers and Institutional Improvement Specialists Training officers provide local, regional, and national training on a wide variety of Title IV topics. Training venues include financial aid associations, state organizations, Department of Education national conferences, Department of Education online training, and Fundamentals workshops for new schools and financial aid staff. In addition, training officers provide direct assistance to schools by answering questions, conducting research, and distributing information. Though training officers train on Federal statute and law and the Federal Student Aid (Title IV) programs, each training officer resides in and exclusively serves a particular region made up of specific states. Due to state and school system differences, concentration of certain types of institutions and general workload issues, we encourage schools to contact those training officers located within their region for assistance (see the School Participation Division link above). Institutional Improvement Specialists (IIS) are part of the regional School Participation Teams (SPTs). SPTs work with institutional eligibility, resolve institutional independent audits, review school financial statements, conduct TIV program reviews, and provide technical assistance. IIS assist schools within their regions that are beginning their participation in the federal student aid programs. They conduct technical assistance visits (on-site and off-site), provide one-on-one training, and answer general questions. In addition, an IIS might work closely with schools to resolve eligibility, audit, and/or financial concerns.FSATech Listserv By subscribing to this listserv, financial aid professionals can get answers to their technical questions about FSA's software or systems.

Here we describe how a school should proceed when a currently enrolled recipient of federal student aid dies, including discharge procedures and documentation requirements. AppendixCCWHEN A STUDENT (WHO HAS OUTSTANDING FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN OBLIGATIONS) DIES The regulations governing Perkins Loans (including Defense Loans and NDSL loans), FFEL program loans, and Direct Loans (including a Direct Unsubsidized Loan which results from the failure to complete the TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve) provide for discharge of a borrower's obligation to repay those loans if the borrower dies (including a Direct Parent PLUS Loan borrower's obligation to repay a Direct PLUS Loan if the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed dies). If a student has died, the school should contact the loan servicer to ensure the servicer has any relevant information in the school's possession. Unless the deceased has an outstanding Perkins Loan, a school is not responsible for gathering the information need to discharge a borrower's outstanding loans. However, many schools choose to take an active part in order to provide support to the borrower's family and remove the borrower from the school's cohort. If a school has information that a current or former student who has an current federal student loan obligation has died, the school may try to obtain an original or certified copy of the borrower's death certificate, or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate, and provide the death certificate to the holder of the student's loans. Returning loan funds when a student dies A school that has to return Direct Loan funds because a student has died should always return them using G5.Documentation required for discharge of a federal student loan when a student dies In order to discharge the unpaid balance of a Perkins Loan (including NDSL and Defense loans), FFEL program loan, or Direct Loan, except in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, the loan holder or servicer must obtain an original or certified copy of a death certificate or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate. 34 CFR 674.61(a) 34 HB Sep 2018 Enrollment Reporting When A Current Student Has Died If a school has obtained a copy of the death certificate for a current student, the school must update the student's status in NSLDS. If the school is due to perform its regular Enrollment Status Reporting within the next 14 days, the school may use that process to update the student's status. If the school's regular Enrollment Reporting is more than 14 days in the future, we recommend that the school manually update the student's enrollment status on the NSLDS Professional Access Web site at www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/nslds_FAP/ (under the Enrollment reporting tab) to a status of \"D.\"CPS Match with the U.S. Social Security Administration The Social Security numbers of applicants currently in Federal Student Aid's Central Processing System (for all award years currently being processed) are matched weekly against SSA records. If the Social Security number entered in Item 8 of the FAFSA matches that of a deceased person in the SSA records, the CPS will send a new ISIR to all schools indicated on the student's FAFSA. The new ISIR will include Comment Code 076 and the comment text: Social Security Administration (SSA) records indicate that the Social Security Number (SSN) that was provided in Item 8 belongs to a deceased person. If the SSN is correct, the applicant must contact the SSA at 1-800-772- 1213 or www.ssa.gov to resolve this problem. If the SSN is incorrect, the applicant must correct the SSN on a paper SAR or submit a new FAFSA online with the correct SSN. If a school receives an ISIR that contains Comment Code 076, it must treat the ISIR as conflicting information. WHEN A SCHOOL RECEIVES INFORMATION THAT A STUDENT HAS DIED If, during the school year, a school receives information that a current recipient of Title IV aid has died, the school must determine the validity of that information. Until the school has determined whether or not the student remains in attendance, the school may not make additional disbursements of Title IV aid to the student (including releasing any Title IV credit balance that might exist on the student's account. In order to properly document the claim (see the \"Documentation required for discharge...\" section below), and to avoid causing distress to a student's family and friends based on an inaccurate report of a student's death received by the school, the school should first make internal inquiries and consult public information sources when investigating a claim that a student has died. If there is no local newspaper report of a student's death, a school can conduct an online search of the student's hometown newspaper and the newspapers where the death was reported to occur. Internally, a school should get attendance reports from the faculty in whose classes the student is currently enrolled. If the student lives/ lived on campus, the school should contact the appropriate residence hall staff to see what information the staff possesses. Faculty members and residence hall staff should be told that if the student is present, it is critical the student call or visit the financial aid office to dispute the claim of being deceased. A school can also contact the vital records office for the student's home state (a list is available at www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm) and ask about the possibility of obtaining a death certificate and the steps for doing that; paying a fee is typically also required. The school should also write the student at the local USPS mailing address/residence of record and at any electronic address available (email and social media) to inform the student that it will not be making further disbursements of financial aid to the student until he or she calls or visits the financial aid office. A school should complete its internal attempt to resolve the report of the student's death within 30 days. After 30 days, if the school has not resolved the report of the student's death, a school should seek information from the student's family (named on the FAFSA if the student is dependent or married) and any references the student provided during entrance counseling (if the student is a recipient of a federal student loan).Appendix C\u2014Actions a School Should Take When A Current Student DiesC-3 FSA HB Sep 2018 A school that is unable to confirm a student's death must make a determination that the student is no longer in attendance (has withdrawn) 30 days after the end of the earlier of the: payment or enrollment period; academic year in which the student was enrolled; educational program in which the student was attending. A school must return any Title IV funds required under 34 CFR 668.22 as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the date school determined student withdrew. For more details on the procedures and requirements of returning aid, see the FSA Handbook, Volume 5, Chapter 1. Withdrawal date when a student dies If a school that is not required to take attendance is informed that a student has died, it must determine the withdrawal date for the student under 34 CFR 668.22(c)(1)(iv). This section provides that if the institution determines that a student did not begin its withdrawal process or otherwise provide official notification of his or her intent to withdraw because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, the withdrawal date is the date that the institution determines is related to that circumstance. The withdrawal date can be no later than the date of the student's death. For an institution that is required to take attendance, the withdrawal date for a student who has died is the last date of attendance as determined from the school's attendance records. The school must maintain the documentation it received that the student has died (see the \"Documentation required...\" section below for specific requirements) and determine an appropriate withdrawal date.Discharge when a student dies Defense, CFR 686.42(a) When a student fails to fulfill their TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve, their TEACH Grant converts into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. A deceased student has their TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve discharged, or, if their grant has already been converted to an Unsubsidized Direct Loan, the Direct Loan is discharged.Federal Student Aid Handbook Appendices, 2018-2019 C-4 a deceased student has earned FWS income A school may deliver any FWS income earned by a deceased student to the student's estate. Clarification Documentation required for discharge of a fede ral student loan w hen a student dies In order to disch arge the unpaid balance (including interest) of a Perkins Loan (including NDSL and Defense loans), FFEL program loan, or Direct L oan, the loan ho lder or servicer must obtain: an original or certified copy of the death certificate or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate for the person who has died; an accurate and complete original or certified copy of the death certificate for the person who has died that is scanned andsubmitted electronically or sent by facsimile transmission; or verification of the borrower's death through an authoritative Federal or State electronic database approved for use by theDepartment. Note: On a case-by-case-basis, in exceptional circumstances, the Chief Financial Officer of the institution may approve a discharge based upon other reliable documentation of the borrower's death. Obtaining a death certificate or an acceptable copy of a death certificate If your school confirms that a current recipient of Title IV aid has died, you must try to obtain an original or certified copy of the recipient's death certificate, or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate. The families of deceased persons have primary responsibility for notifying local and national authorities when a family member dies. Though doctors, other medical professionals, and mortuaries often perform this function, the responsibility remains with the deceased's family. If you can determine from a notice of death or news report that a medical professional or mortuary was involved, you should request a copy of the student's death certificate from them. Schools may also be able to obtain death certificates from the local government record offices where the death occurred or the local government offices where the student's permanent residence was located. For example, you can contact the vital records office for the student's home state (a list is available at www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm) and ask about the possibility of obtaining a death certificate and the steps for obtaining it; paying a fee is typically also required.Default Resolution Group U.S. Department of Education Default Resolution GroupP.O. Box 5609Greenville, TX 75403-5609 Default Resolution Group903-259-3915Appendix C\u2014Actions a School Should Take When A Current Student DiesC-5 FSA HB Sep 2018 Since individual state rules for documenting the death of an individual and obtaining a copy of an individual's death certificate differ widely, a school should consult with its attorney to establish procedures for obtaining the required documentation from local authorities in your state. When a student who has died is due a post-withdrawal disbursement You may not make a post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV funds to the account or estate of a student who has died. If you determine that a student has died during a period in which the student was receiving Title IV aid, you must perform a Return calculation (see the FSA Handbook, Volume 5 ). If the Return calculation indicates that an institution is required to return Title IV funds, your school must return the Title IV funds for which it is responsible. A deceased student's estate is not required to return any Title IV funds disbursed to the student. Therefore, an institution should neither report a grant overpayment for a deceased student to NSLDS, nor refer a grant overpayment for a deceased student to Default Resolution Group. If an institution had previously reported a grant overpayment for a student who is deceased to Default Resolution Group, it should inform Default Resolution Group that it has received notification that the student is deceased. The regulations governing the Direct and Federal Perkins Loan programs provide for a discharge of a borrower's obligation to repay a Federal Direct or Federal Perkins Loan if the borrower dies (including a Direct PLUS Loan borrower's obligation to repay a Direct PLUS Loan if the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed dies). If a school is aware that a student who has died has any outstanding Title IV loan debt, the school should contact the student's estate and inform it of the actions it can take to have the student's Title IV loan debt cancelled. If a Title IV credit balance created from funds disbursed before the death of the student exists after the completion of the Return calculation and the institutional refund calculations, the institution must resolve the Title IV credit balance as follows: 1. In accordance with the cash management regulations, pay - ing authorized charges at the institution (including previously paid charges that are now unpaid due to the Return of Title IV funds by the institution).Federal Student Aid Handbook Appendices, 2018-2019 C-6 FSA HB Sep 2018 2. Returning any Title IV grant overpayments owed by the student for previous withdrawals from the present school (the institution may deposit the funds in its federal funds account and make the appropriate entry in G5). If the institution has previously referred the grant overpayment to Default Resolution Group, the institution should provide Default Resolution Group with documentation that the student has died so that Default Resolution Group can delete the over - payment from its records. 3. Returning any remaining credit balance to the Title IV programs. TREATMENT OF CREDIT BALANCES IN OTHER CASES OF A WITHDRAWAL BEYOND CONTROL OF A STUDENT If a student has experienced an emergency beyond the student's control, a school may grant a retroactive withdrawal to the student. On those occasions, the school may find itself holding a credit balance that is composed of both Title IV and non-Title IV funds. If your school has lost contact with a student who is due a credit balance, you must use all reasonable means to locate the student. If you still cannot find the student, your school must return the Title IV portion of the credit balance to the appropriate FSA program(s) and/or lender. The FSA regulations do not set specific rules for determining which funds created a credit balance. We encourage schools to return FSA funds to loan programs first to reduce the borrower's loan balance. In the case of a retroactive withdrawal of a student who has outstanding Direct Loans, if the school is unable to locate the student, in order to provide the greatest benefit to the student, the school may return both the Title IV and non-Title IV funds in the student's credit balance using G5. All returns through G5 must be offset by a downward adjustment in the student's Direct Loan record in COD of the entire amount (the sum of the Title IV and non-Title IV funds) the school is returning. The school must complete two separate procedures. 1. The school must return the Title IV funds through G5. 2. The return must be offset by a downward adjustment in stu - dent's Direct Loan record in COD. A school should never return more through G5 than the outstanding balance on the student's Direct Loan.The FSA AssessmentsD-1 FSA HB Sep 2018AppendixCD In collaboration with financial aid professionals, Federal Student Aid has designed the FSA Assessments to help schools with compliance and improvement activities. The Assessments contain links to applica - ble laws and regulatio ns, and help explain how your school should ad - minister the FSA programs. The FSA Assessments FAQ page provides guidance on how to navigate a nd begin using the FSA Assessments. The FSA Assessments Chart (see website below) can help you find the FSA Assessment(s) most relevant to your concerns. Although the FSA Assessments are not based on a single award year, each assessment w ill be listed and ar chived by the closest award year to its publication, in the iLibrary on IFAP. Currently, you can find the FSA Assessments at: https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/FSAAssessments.jsp There a re twelve subjects covered in the FSA Assessments mod - ules.

Both reporting requirements are Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements. The first of these requirements is for your school to provide the 1098 E or T form to certain aid recipients, and the second is to generate a 1042-S for each student who is a nonresident alien and who receives taxable income other than wages. We will discuss each requirement in greater detail below. IRS FORM 1098 There are two variations of IRS form 1098 relevant to awarding Title IV aid: IRS Form 1098-E IRS Form 1098-T. IRS Form 1098-E Schools must provide IRS Form 1098-E, Student Interest Statement , to all individuals who paid student loan interest of $600 or more on loans held by your school during a calendar y ear. To access the form and more information for students about filling out and filing the form, go to the IRS website: https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-1098-e-student-loan-interest- statement . IRS Form 1098-T Your school must provide Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, for each student enrolled for credit unless: 1. the student is a nonresident alien (unless requested by the stu - dent);IRS 1098 Cites 26 CFR Parts 1, 301, and 602 26 U.S.C. 6050S Federal Register: April 29, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 82) Preamble to Notice of Proposed Rule Making Federal Register, December 19, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 244) Preamble to Final Rules E-1 FSA HB 2018-20192. the student's qualified tuition and related expenses are entirely waived, or entirely paid with scholarships or grants; or 3. the student's qualified tuition and related expenses are entirely covered by a formal billing arrangement between the school and the student's employer or a government agency such as the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense. The instructions for Form 1098-T do not specify what a school should do if: a student's qualified tuition and related expenses are entirely covered by a combination of scholarships, grants, and formal billing arrangement between the school and the student's em - ployer or a government agency; or only a part of a student's qualified tuition and related expenses are covered by a formal billing arrangement between the school and the student's employer or a government agency. The pr eamble to the Final Regulations states that \"... a taxpayer cannot claim the education credit for education expenses paid with amounts that are excludable from gross income. Educational expenses paid through a formal billing arrangement between an institution and a government entity such as the Veteran's Administration, often are excludable from the gross income of the individual student.\" (Federal Register, December 19, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 244) page 77680). We encourage schools to seek guidance from their in-house counsel and the IRS on how to complete IRS Form 1098-T when the student falls into one of the aforementioned categor ies. To access the form and more information for students about filling out and filing the form, go to the IRS website: https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-1098-t-tuition-statement . IRS FORMS 1042 AND 1042-S Pell Grants and other Title IV need-based grants are tax free to the extent they are used to pay for qualified tuition and course-related expenses during the grant period. Qualified tuition and course-related expenses are defined as tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required for courses attempted by a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential candidate at an educational institution. To qualify, fees, books, supplies, and equipment must be required of all students in the course of instruction. Amounts paid from Pell Grants and other Title IV need-based gran ts which are used for purposes other than for qualifying tuition and fees are taxable. This includes amounts paid for room and board, travel and supplies and equipment not required for the course of instruction at an educational institution. (See IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for E-3 FSA HB Sep 2018Appendix E\u2014Miscellaneous Business Office FunctionsEducation, Chapter 1: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/index.html .) You are not required to withhold or report taxable scholarship amounts for students considered residents by the Internal Revenue Service. Students are considered residents for tax purposes if they are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or nonresidents that meet the IRS substantial presence test (see https://www.irs.gov/individuals/ international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test ), and are not subject to exemption or treaty benefits. You are required to meet withholding and reporting requirements for nonresident aliens. Schools must generate a 1042-S for each student who is a nonresident alien and who receives taxable income other than wages. This includes Title IV need-based aid and other grants or scholarships. Schools must also prepare a 1042 summarizing the data reported on the individual 1042-S forms. See IRS instructions for form 1042 at https:// www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-1042 . See instructions for form 1042-S at https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1042s. You must w ithhold at the rate of 30% of the taxable portion of the Title IV aid for each nonresident alien unless the student passes the substantial presence test for the calendar year (see https://www.irs.gov/ individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test ). To meet this test, the student must be physically present in the United States for: at least 31 days during the current year; and 183 days during the three-year period that includes the current year, and the two years immediately before that. (Count all of the days present in the current year, 1/3 of the days present in the first year before the current year and 1/6 of the days present in the second year before the current year.) IRS Publications 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities and IRS Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens provide further guidance on withholding and reporting requirements. As a withholding agent, your school is liable for any taxes you are required to withhold. This liability is independent of the tax liability of the foreign student to whom the payment is made. If your school fails to withhold the required amount, and the foreign student fails to satisfy the U.S. tax liability, then both you and the foreign student are liable for the taxes, as well as for interest and any applicable penalties. (Note that the applicable tax will be collected only once.) Even if the foreign student satisfies his or her U.S. tax liability, your school may still be held liable for interest and penalties for your failure to withhold.E-4 FSA HB Sep 2018Federal Student Aid Handbook Appendices, 2018-2019If you withhold amounts from taxable Title IV need-based aid (or other scholarships and grants) the institution must complete an IRS Form 1042-S, Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding (see https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1042s--2017.pdf ). The foreign student must complete and file an IRS Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons with the Internal Revenue Service by March 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the Title IV need-based aid or other grant or scholarship was paid.F-1 FSA HB January 2019Institutional Reporting and Disclosure RequirementsAPPENDIXC FThis appendix provides postsecondary educational institutions with a comprehensive summary of reporting and disclosure requirements re - lated to the Higher Education Act (HEA). In general, reports are sub - mitted to the Department of Education, and disclosures are made to students and the public. However, in some cases\u2014for example, the annual security statistics\u2014information must be provided to both as well as to the institu - tion's faculty and staff. This summary lists the reports and disclosures, their statutory and regulatory authority, a description of what is required in each report/disclosure and other pertinent information, the due date, the method of transmittal or distribution, and the recipient of the report/disclosure. The publication of this document complies with section 482(e) of the HEA, which requires the Secretary to provide institutions with a \"compliance calendar\" of all reports and disclosures required under the HEA. Important : Any omission in this document does not relieve institutions of any Title IV requirement. Also, this document is not intended to provide complete guidance about implementing the requirements listed. For more instruction on that, see the pertinent regulations as well as the appropriate volume and chapter of the Federal Student Aid Handbook. UPDATES FOR 2018-2019 On page 2 we added a citation to 34 CFR 668.45 in the margin note for athlete completion and graduation rates, as well as the waiver information from 668.45(e)(1) at the end of the body text for that section. On page 4 we updated the URL for the method of transmittal for the FISAP; the COD website has replaced the Campus-Based site. See the August 1 , 2018, announcement for that and other FISAP information. We modified the gainful employment (GE) reporting requirements on page 5 for clarity and accuracy, and we rewrote the GE disclosure require - ments on page 14 to account for 34 CFR 668.412.Notes 1. See the HEA Table of Contents, Ap - pendix G of the FSA Handbook, for the sections of the U.S. Code that cor - respond to the sections of the HEA re - ferred to in this appendix. 2.
