Call to schedule the best IV therapy Downtown Chicago has to offer with Freeze and Float Spa. Intravenous (IV) fluid drips deliver saline solution or a lactated ringer through a small catheter and tubing directly into the bloodstream. This solution usually includes medications and vitamin supplements that are tailored to the individual patient. During therapy, the nurse inserts an IV line which is attached to a bag of saline or lactated ringer solution. The bag is then hung above the patient's head. IV therapy bags are designed to let gravity, as opposed to a syringe or other forced technique, carry fluid into the veins over time. The duration of a single treatment varies from person to person, but typically lasts 30 - 45 minutes. The exceptions to this timeframe are our NAD IV treatments, which generally last 3 - 4 hours per session. Our IV drip treatments typically last between 30 - 45 minutes depending on the individual. Our NAD+ and NAD+ Boost IVs take 3 - 4 hours per session to administer. IV drip therapy is one of the most effective ways to deliver nutrients, vitamins, and fluids to your body, and is more efficient than oral supplements. This technique bypasses your digestive system and is administered directly into your bloodstream. Your body is able to absorb the maximum amount of nutrients and fluids since nothing is lost as a result of the digestive process. In addition, vitamins and nutrients become immediately available to your cells for use for fast results.

The benefits of IV therapy are felt with a single treatment. On average our clients visit 1-2 per week, depending on the goals. The human body is comprised of 60% water. When people are sick with food poisoning, hangover, stomach bug or other illness your body can lose a lot of water. When we lose fluids via vomiting, diarrhea, excess sweating, it's important to replace those fluids to maintain the necessary bodily functions. Taking oral meds with an upset stomach can ultimately result in increasing your nausea and throwing all the meds up. Receiving the IV vitamins, minerals and essential fluids bypasses your gut and gives you the rapid relief you need. "}
