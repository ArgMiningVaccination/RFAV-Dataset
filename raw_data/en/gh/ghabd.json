However, a number of clinical features appear to be characteristic of post-vaccine syndrome; most notably, severe neurological symptoms appear to be more common following vaccination. To complicate matters further, patients with long COVID are often also vaccinated, making the issue of definition more difficult. [Belgian Study by Sander Eens et al. proves mRNA vaccines induced turbo cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10183601/)(May 2023) Two Strategies to Eliminate Spike ProteinMarik and Kory believe there may be ways to boost the immune system to allow it to degrade and eventually remove the spike from your cells. One of the strategies they recommend for this is [TRE (time restricted easting)](https://www.onedaymd.com/search/label/fasting), which stimulates [autophagy](https://www.onedaymd.com/2022/02/autophagy-finally-considered-for-viral.html), a natural cleaning process that eliminates damaged, misfolded and toxic proteins. Ivermectin also binds to the spike protein, thereby facilitating its removal. The spike protein is toxic regardless of whether it comes from the natural infection or the injection. Early and aggressive treatment will lower your spike protein load, thereby reducing your risk of long-COVID. Kory stresses that, at present, they still do not know the exact correct dose for ivermectin. When prescribed for long-COVID and vaccine injury, he monitors the patient and adjusts the dosage based on individual response. That said, he typically starts patients out at a mid-range dose of 0.3 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, daily. Now, he's noticed that when it comes to ivermectin, there are responders and non-responders. It works exceptionally well for some, while benefits are negligible in others. That said, a majority of patients do tend to experience a benefit. The length of treatment is also highly variable. As for safety, it's [been used for over 50 years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043740/)and has a remarkably robust safety profile. We now also have a large-scale Brazilian study in which patients received ivermectin for four days every month for six months. Curiously, not only was COVID incidence dramatically reduced, but kidney and liver function actually improved with this treatment. Marik also dismisses claims that ivermectin can be harmful to your liver, saying it's actually used to treat fatty liver disease. So, overall, \"we have not seen a safety signal ... with long-term use,\" Kory says. \"Some of that is published data, and some of it is just our experience with treating patients.\" Marik adds, \"It's one of the safest medications ... even when taken in high doses appropriately.\" [I-Prevent Post Vaccine](https://covid19.onedaymd.com/2023/05/flccc-i-prevent-protocol-post-vaccine.html)). [An Approach to Managing Post-Vaccine Syndrome](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/I-RECOVER-Post-Vaccine-2023-07-24.pdf)\" (July 2023). Patients with post-vaccine syndrome should do whatever they can to prevent themselves from getting COVID-19. This may include a preventative protocol (see [I-PREVENT](https://covid19.onedaymd.com/2022/07/flccc-i-prevent-covid-prevention.html)) or early treatment in the event you do contract the virus or suspect infection (see [I-CARE](https://covid19.onedaymd.com/2022/07/flccc-i-care-covid-treatment-protocol.html)). COVID-19 will likely exacerbate the symptoms of vaccine injury. Once a patient has shown improvement, the various interventions should be reduced or stopped one at a time. A less intensive maintenance approach is then suggested. The core problem in post-vaccine syndrome is long-lasting \"immune dysregulation.\" The most important treatment goal is to help the body restore a healthy immune system \u2014 in other words, to let the body heal itself. Our recommended treatment strategy involves two major approaches: - Promote autophagy to help rid the cells of the spike protein - Use interventions that limit the toxicity/pathogenicity of the spike protein [An Approach to Managing Post-Vaccine Syndrome](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/I-RECOVER-Post-Vaccine-2023-07-24.pdf)\" (July 2023) and which should be discussed with a qualified provider as well.

One of the safest drugs known, it is on the WHO's list of essential medicines, has been given over 3.7 billion times, and won the Nobel Prize for its global and historic impacts in eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. Review the totality of supporting evidence for ivermectin: [https://c19ivm.org](https://c19ivm.org). It appears that vaccine-injured patients can be grouped into two categories: i) ivermectin responders and ii) ivermectin non-responders. This distinction is important, as the latter are more difficult to treat and require more aggressive therapy. For ivermectin responders, prolonged and chronic daily treatment is often necessary to support their recovery. In many, if the daily ivermectin is discontinued worsening symptoms often recur within days. Disease-Specific Therapeutic Adjuncts Generalized Neurologic Symptoms/Injuries/\"Brain Fog\"/Fatigue - LDN (low dose naltrexone) appears to play a pivotal role in treatment of many neurological symptoms - Fluvoxamine; Start on a low dose of 12.5 mg/day and increase slowly as tolerated. Some patients report a significant improvement with fluvoxamine while other patients appear to tolerate this drug poorly. Fluoxetine 20 mg/day is an alternative, as are tricyclic antidepressants. - Nigella Sativa; 200-500 mg twice daily. - Valproic acid and pentoxifylline may be of value in these patients. - These symptoms may be mediated by Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS); see specific treatment below. - Luteolin: Long-COVID syndrome-associated brain fog and chemofog: Luteolin to the rescue [ [R](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33847020/)].

What you can do is eat food that helps in preventing the outbreaks. Lysine (amino acid) blocks arginine, and stops the virus from replicating. Lysine-rich foods like vegetables, legumes, milk, cheese and fish are helpful in strengthening your immune system and preventing cold sore. Tinnitus - This a frequent and disabling complication reported in post-vaccine syndrome. ( [R](https://theepochtimes.com/health/tinnitus-a-common-incurable-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-event-doctors-share-ways-to-help_5168930.html)) - Tinnitus refers to the sensation of sound in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus and can, therefore, be classified as a phantom phenomenon. Tinnitus sensations are usually of an unformed acoustic nature such as buzzing, hissing, or ringing. Tinnitus can be localized unilaterally or bilaterally, but it can also be described to emerge within the head. [ [R](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26261868/)] - Ideally, patients should be evaluated by an ENT specialist or audiologist to exclude underlying disorders. Vision Impairment and Migraines - These are lesser known adverse events that are appearing in the research literature as well as in doctors' clinics. ( [R](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/doctors-seeing-ocular-adverse-events-after-covid-19-vaccination-caution-possible-risks_5047558.html)) - Patients should be evaluated by an Eye specialist or neurologist to exclude underlying disorders. Bell's Palsy / Facial Paresthesia - Low dose naltrexone (LDN). Begin with 1 mg/day and increase to 4.5 mg/day as required. May take 2-3 months for full effect. - Low dose corticosteroid: 10-15 mg/day prednisone for 3 weeks. Taper to 10 mg/day and then 5 mg/day as tolerated. - Reduced workload, stress, and light exercises for a couple of months. IVIG treatment (Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment) - Generally, treatment with IVIG is not recommended. Immunosuppressive Therapies - As a rule, immunosuppressive therapy should be avoided, as these drugs may exacerbate the immune dysfunction in vaccine-injured patients and prevent restoration of immune homeostasis. - A trial of immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated in patients with an established autoimmune syndrome who have failed other therapeutic interventions. long COVID incidence by about 41%, compared with placebo](https://covid19.onedaymd.com/2023/06/outpatient-treatment-of-covid-19-and.html)(The Lancet 2023) This protocol is solely for educational purposes regarding potentially beneficial therapies for COVID-19.
