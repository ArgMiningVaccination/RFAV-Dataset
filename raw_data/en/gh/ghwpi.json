Amorette used a combination of acupuncture, and Chinese herbs to promote healing. She was absolutely mindful to not increase the pain while increasing the blood flow and promote healing during the acupuncture. Amorette had a strategic plan and it helped me get back to my work and daily life much sooner than the doctor or I expected.
