I have over 20 years experience in homeopathy, dietary and lifestyle advice and flower essence prescribing. Hormonal health & menopause My passion for hormonal and women's health grew from my journey through the menopause. For myself and many women, approaching this time in life brings up so much anxiety, fear and questions. During those years a combination of homeopathic remedies, flower essences, superfood cleanses, complemnetary therapies, yoga and time out in nature enabled me to navigate this transition with relative ease. I can now help you manage the myriad of symptoms associated with menopause with one-to-one support, workshops, courses & retreats. A great place to start is with my [Natural Menopause Workshop](https://events.liveit.io/caroline-gaskin-mcph-2/managing-menopause-naturally-workshop-with-carol-2/) I also have a [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/567420193837434) for Managing Menopause Naturally without HRT If you're not there yet but looking for hormonal harmony I have [Balancing Your Hormones Workshop](https://events.liveit.io/caroline-gaskin-mcph-2/balancing-your-hormones-workshop-with-caroline-g-2/) packed full of advice for self care, nutrition and natural pain relief. General practice I work with people of all ages and at all stages of life. Whether you are a pregnant woman, have a new baby or children, want help with hormones or are managing old age. I have prescribed for thousands of people for both physical and emotional issues. We can use homeopathy and natural health options instead of, or alongside conventional medicine, and to help detox and re-energise after long courses of conventional treatment. All appointments are currently online. Click [here](http://carolinegaskin.co.uk/whattoexpect/) to find out more.
