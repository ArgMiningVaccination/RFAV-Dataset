In our 146 -year history, we haven't strayed from that vision. We are intellectually di verse, with more than 32,000 full-time and part-time stu dents enrolled in our nine academic divisions. Our fac ulty and students study, teach, and learn in and acr oss more than 260 program s widely recognized as being among the nation's best . Johns Hopkins University is tied at No. 7 on U.S. News & World Report list of top nat ional universities. The university's graduate prog rams in public health, nursing, biomedical engineering, me dicine, and education are considered among the best in the country, according to U.S. News & World Report. For 42 years in a row, we've put more money into research than any other U.S. academic institution. Re- search isn't just something we do\u2014it's who we are. Every day, Johns Hopkins faculty and students work side by side in a tireless pursuit of discovery, with the ultimate aim of advancing humanity. The university's main campus for undergraduates is located in Baltimore, a city that gives our students the chance to apply classroom knowledge in the real world, no matter their major. And Baltimore off ers plenty of ways to fi ll free time, too, with a thriving arts scene, foodie culture, and local sports teams, including our own Blue Jays men's lacrosse team, winner of 44 nati- onal titles. The women's cross country squad is also a perennial champion, winning the NCAA Division III title seven of the last nine years. Baltimore is also site to one of the best hospitals in the world, the university's partner institution, Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Johns Hopkins community takes pride in being a good neighbor and an economic driver for the city and state. As Maryland's largest private employer, the university and the hospital and health system employ more than 54 ,000 people and together contribute more than $12 billion a year to the state's economy ($6.2 billion of that is generated in Baltimore City). We are based in Baltimore but at home wherever we go. With campuses on three continents, researchers in every time zone, and students from more than 111 countries, Johns Hopkins truly has a global perspective.The Clery Act The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, more commonly known as the \"Clery Act,\" requires institutions to pro-vide current and prospective students, their families, and current and prospective faculty and staff with infor-mation about campus safety.The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to: publish annually an Annual Security and Fire Safety Report (the \"Report\") by October 1 of each year thatcontains three years of campus cri me and fi re safety statistics and certain campus security policy state-ments; disclose crime statistics for the campus, public areas immediately adjacent to or running through the cam- pus, and certain non-campus facilities and remote classrooms. The statistics must be gathered from campus police or security, local law enforcement, and other University officials who have \"significant responsibility for student and campus activities\"; provide \"timely warning\" notices of certain crimes that pose a \"serious or continuing\" threat to students and employees; issue an emergency notification, upon the confi rma- tion of a significant emergency or dangerous situationinvolving an immediate threat to the health or safetyof students or employees occurring on campus; disclose in a public crime log \"any crime that oc- curred on campus, in or on noncampus buildings orproperty or on public property within the campusor immediately adjacent to and accessible from thecampus, or within the patrol jurisdiction of the cam-pus police or the campus security department andthat are reported to the campus police or securitydepartment\"; and maintain in a pu blic fire log a record of any fi re that occurred in an on-campus student housing facility. Compliance with the Clery Act does not violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). Any student, staff or faculty member who reports a crime or is involved in any aspect of compliance under the Clery Act is protected from retaliation.ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 2University-Wide Policy Statements Separate Campuses JHU has numerous campuses addressed in this combined Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. All policy statements contained in this report apply to all campuses unless otherwise indicated. Reporting Crimes or Other Emergencies The University strongly encourages students, faculty and staff to accurately and promptly report all crimes to their respective campus security offices and the appropriate law enforcement agencies, crimes should be reported when the victim elects to or is unable to make a report (note, Campus Security Authorities or CSAs, listed below and on page 115 of this report, have special reporting obligations). Prompt, accurate crime reports submitted to campus security personnel listed below and other primary CSAs listed on page 115 of this report, help facilitate successful investigations and enforcement, inform prev ention eff orts, aid in issuance of timely warnings and emergency notifications and disclosure of crime statistics in this Report, and edu- cate the University community. In the event your cam- pus is closed, for all emergencies dial 911. To report a crime or other emergency at your campus, please contact your campus security personnel: Homewood Campus Public Safety Emergency 410-516-7777 Non-Emergency 410-516-4600 Baltimore Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency 410-396-2455 The Peabody Institute Public Safety Emergency 667-208-6608 Non-Emergency 667-208-6608 Baltimore Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency 410-396-2411 East Baltimore Campus Public Safety Emergency 410-955-5585 Non-Emergency 410-614-3473 Baltimore Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency Medical Center Public Safety Emergency 410-550-0333 Non-Emergency 410-550-3179 Baltimore Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency 410-396-2422 Harbor East Campus Public Safety Emergency 410-234-9300 Non-Emergency 410-234-9301 Baltimore Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency Laboratory (APL)Security Services Department Emergency 443-778-7575 Non-Emergency 443-778-7575 Howard County Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency 410-313-2200 Washington Centers Public Safety Emergency 202-663-5808 Non-Emergency Police Department Emergency 911 Non-Emergency Center Finance & Administration Emergency +39.051.2917.811 Emergency +39.051.2917.811 State Police Emergency 112 Non-Emergency 112 Hopkins-Nanjing Center HNC Security Office Emergency/Non-Emergency 86.25.8359.3031 NJU Security Office Emergency/Non-Emergency 86.25.8359.5110 Nanjing Public Security Bureau Emergency 110 Non-Emergency 86.25.8442.1494 Johns Hopkins Public Emergency/Non-Emergency HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 3 112 (list continues on page 115)ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 4 Preparing the Annual Disclosure of Crime Statistics The procedures for preparing the annual disclosure of crime statistics in this Report include requesting Clery- reportable statistics from the following sources on an annual basis; statistics received are included in the Report for the appropriate campus based on juris- diction of the law enforcement agency: the security offices at each University campus, the Maryland State Police, the Metropolitan Transit Administration Police, reportable crime statistics were sent to law enfor- cement agencies in good faith; some agencies did not respond or could not provide the statistics as requested. All of the statistics are gathered, compiled, and reported to the University community via this Report. Homewood Campus Safety & Security submits the annual crime statistics published in this Report to the U.S. Department of Education (\"DOE\"). The statistical information gathered by the DOE is available to the public through the DOE website at http://ope.ed.gov/security/. Campus Law Enforcement Johns Hopkins Public Safety's enforcement authority, their relationship with State and local police agencies, their jurisdiction, and their arrest authority is des- cribed in more detail under each specific campus section. A close working relationship is maintained with local law enforcement to foster open commun- ication regarding incidents and emergencies on and around each campus. The Johns Hopkins University has a memorandum of understanding with BPD in regards to investigations of sexual assault. None of the University's security organizations have a memoran- dum of understanding or other formal agreement with State or local law enforcement pertaining to the invest- igation of crimi nal off enses, outside of sexual assaults. Con fidential Reporting Witnesses and victims of crime who do not want to pursue action within the University or the criminal jus- tice system may want to consider voluntarily making an anonymous report to their respective campus sec- urity offices identified under the individual campuses addressed in this Report. With some exceptions, as noted below, these officials can file a report on the de- tails of the incident without revealing the victim iden- tity. The purpose of an anonymous report is to comply with a wish to keep the matter confidential, while tak- ing steps to enhance the future safety of the University community. With such information, the University can keep an accurate record of the number of incidents involving students, employees and visitors; assess risk; determine where there is a pattern of crime with re-gard to a particular location, method, or assailant; and alert the campus community to potential danger. Re-ports filed in this manner are counted and disclosed in Baltimore Police Department (\"BPD\"), the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Depar tment, Howard County Police Department, Montgomery County Police Depart- ment, and other applicable law enforcement agencies, and non-security CSAs. For the SAIS Bologna Center, the University requests crime statistics from the Bologna Police Department . For the Hopkins-Nanji ng Center , the University requests crime statistics from the Ministry of Public Security. For the Johns Hopkins Public Policy Center, the University requests crime statistics from the Barcelona Police Department. Crime statistics for non- campus locations are requested from the law enforce- ment agency that has primary jurisdiction for that loca- tion. For statistical purposes, crime statistics obtained from any of these sources are recorded in the calendar year the crime was reported. Requests for CleryJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 5 the annual crime statistics for the University and m ay be the subject of a timely warning, emergency notif ica- tion, or other security notification to some or all of the campus community. Note, that for purpose s of repor ts of sexual misconduct, campus security per sonnel are \"responsible employees\" who share with the Title IX Coordinator any report of sexual misconduct that they receive. As a result, any communication to campus security personnel relating to sexual misconduct will lead to additional University follow-up, as a pprop riate, including but not limited to, potential investig ation of the misconduct at issue. Victims and witnesses should be aware that the University will strive to protect, to the g reatest exten t possible, the confidentiality of persons rep orting or ac- cused of crimes, and related information; however, the University cannot guarantee complete confidentiality where it would conflict with the University's legal obli- gation to investigate a complaint or take steps to deter further crimes, or with its duty to comply with other legal obligations (e.g., responding to a subpo ena). If a student or employee desires to kee p the details of an incident of sexual harassment, sexua l assa ult, relationship violence or stalking (collectivel y, \"se xual misconduct\") confidential, the indiv idual should speak with a confidential resource, i.e ., individuals who are designated by the University as a confide ntial resource and may also have a legal obligation to keep comm-unications confidential when acting in their profes-sional capacity, unless there is an immi nent threat to health or safety, or other basis for disclosure pursuant to law. When seeking advice and support, persons who are concerned about confidentiality should discuss their concerns about confident iality with the person with whom they are speaking. Victi ms of crimes are encouraged to seek confidential counseling or treat-ment from the confid entia l resources listed on pg. 21. Information shared with confidential resources does not constitute a report or complaint filed with the University for the purpose of instituting an inve stig- ation or resolution of a sexual misconduct com plaint. At the end of each aca demic year, the Counseli ng Center at Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus compiles statistics on its services to students and the community. This r eport can be found on the Counseling Center's we bsite, http://studentaf fairs.jhu.edu/counselingcen ter/annual- reports. Th e University does not have procedures to encourage professional counselors or pastoral counselors to raise t he subject of reporting statistics confidentially and instead leaves the issue to the professional judgment o f the counselor. Response to Reports Upon receiving a report of a crime, and depending o n the facts and circumstances, t he campus security office or center director may dispatch an officer, ask the victim to report to the security office to file a incident report, notify local law enforcement authorities, or take another appropriate step, such as in the case of sexual misconduct, promptly notifying the Title IX Coordina- tor. In response to a reported emergency, campus se- curity or center directors will respond and summon the appropriate resources, internal and external, to assist in the response to the incident. Additionally, reports made to the campus security of- fice at each JHU campus, Campus Security Authorities (\"CSAs\"), and to local law enforcement (when reported by them to JHU) will be assessed for potential distribu- tion of a timely warning notice, emergency notification or other security notification, and inclusion in the Daily Crime Log and crime statistics in this Report. Timely Warnings The University deeply values the safety and welfare of its community. To enhance campus security and aid in the prevention of similar occurrences, the Vice Presi- dent of Johns Hopkins Public Safety or his/her desig- nee will timely warn the affected campus community of crimes that are reportable under Federal law and represent a serious or continuing threat to the comm - unity. Public Safety will issue a warning as soon as theANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 6 pertinent information is available, following a report to a CSA or local police agency. Public Safety will determine whether a reportable crime presents a serious or continuing threat on a case-by-case basis after examining the nature of the crime, the danger facing the campus community, and other relevant factors. Timely Warnings are typically issued for the follow- ing Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR)/National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime classi-fications: - Murder/Non-Negligent Manslaughter- Negligent Manslaughter- Aggravated Assault (cases involving assaults among known parties, will be evaluated on a case-by-casebasis to determine if the individual is believed to bean ongoing threat to the larger JHU community) - Robbery involving force or violence- Sexual A ssault (considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts of the case, when and wherethe incident occurred, when it was reported, andthe amount information known to JHU CorporateSecurity). - Major incidents of Arson - Other Clery crimes as determined necessary by the Vice President of Johns Hopkins Public Safety,bulletins or advisories, security blotters, sirens or public address systems, and bull horns. Personally identifi able information about victims will not be included in any timely warning or security notification, or in any publicly available record-keep ing, including the disclosure of crime statistics in this Report. Timely Warning Notices will be distributed as soon as pertinent information is available, in a manner that withholds the names of victims as confidential, and with the goal of aiding in the prevention of similar occurrences. JHU is not required to issue a Timely Warning with respect to crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor. Immediate Not ifications, Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures Upon confi rmation of a significant emergency or dan- gerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or st aff, the University will communicate the threat to the Universit y communit y at the aff ected campus(es), or to the appropriate segment of the community. The University will, without delay and taking into account the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and i nitiate some or all of the notification system(s) listed, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist victims or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. Johns Hopkins Public Safety has the responsibility for confi rming (with the assistance of key campus administrators, local fi rst responders and/or the National Weather Service) that a significant emergency or dangerous situation exists. Johns Hopkins Public Safety (primary) and/or JHU Communications (secondary) will collaborate to determine the content of the message and will use some or all of the systems described below to comm- unicate the threat to the JHU Community or to the appropriate segment of the community, if the threat is limited to a particular building or segment of the population. In the event of a serious incident that poses an immediate threat to members of the JHU community, the University has various systems in place for commu-nicating information, including follow-up information, quickly. Some or all of these methods of communi-or his/her designee. Timely Warning Notices may also be posted for other crime classifications and locations, even though that is not required by the law, at the sole discretion of JHU. Even when a timely warning is not required under this policy, Public Safety may at any time elect to issue a timely warning or otherwise advise the aff ected campus community of any incident where doing so is in the best interest of campus security. In deciding to issue such a notice, Johns Hopkins Public Safety will consider all relevant factors, including the nature of the crime, the location, the time of the incident, the local police response and guidance to campus officials, and the potential direct eff ect on the campus community. Timely warnings will normally be disseminated via email to the University-supplied electronic mail account issued to the appropriate group of students and employees. Depending on the circumstances, Johns Hopkins Public Safety could also utilize one or more of the following modes of communication to transmit the warning: Public Safety and other JHU websites, RAVE security alerts, security informationJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 7 cation may be activated in the event of an immediate threat to the JHU campus community. These methods of communication include the following: Emergency Alert (Rave) Text Messaging In the ev ent of a confi rmed major incident that threat- ens the safety of the campus community, the Univer- sity will immediately send a text message alert to the students, faculty and staff who have subscribed to the service, notifying them of the incident. Members can subscribe to the service on the myJHED tab after logging in at https://my.johnshopkins.edu/. Broadcast Email Messaging If an incident should occu r, a broadcast email will be sent to all JHU subscribers providing resources for ad- ditional information as soon as possible. To subscribe for emergency email notification, sign into myJHU and add Emergency Alerts in the \"myProfile\" tab. Emergency Web Page/Emergency Phone Line The University maintains a special web page for emer- gency notices at https://www.jhu.edu/alert/. During the course of any major event, this page will be updated regularly. Interested parties can also obtain updated information by calling JHU's Emergency Hotline at 410-516-7781. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, JHU must follow its emergency notification procedures. An institution that follows its emergency notification pr o- cedures is not required to issue a timely warni ng based on the same circumstances; however, the institution must provide adequate follow-up information to the community as needed. Evacuations Should there be a need to evacuate, follow the recom- mended evacuation route. Once outside, adhere to the directions of Campus Safety and Security or local pub- lic safety officials (police or fi re department). Evacua- tion procedures in place meet ADA compliance. In the event a particular evacuation requires evac- uees to be relocated to an alternative shelter, shelter locations on campus have been designated. Evacuees will be directed to those locations by Campus Safety and Security or local public safety officials (police or fire department).When Evacuation is Not Possible In a fi re or fi re alarm situation, always check doors to see if they are hot or warm to the touch before you open them. If heat or smoke prevents you from evac-uating, return to your room and use towels or other cloth items to seal around the door. Hang a white ob - ject in the window and reclose the window (if it opens) as much as possible. Do not reopen your window (if it opens) unless forced to do so by smoke. After you have sealed your door, immediately call 911 and advise emergency responders of your location and situation. Wait for help to arrive. Post Incident At the completion of the incident, the Fire/Rescue De- partment (or other appropriate emergency official(s)) should release the building to the facility leadership. The facility should be pronounced all clear, or clear with conditions for re-occupancy. The Facility Lead- ership should then communicate the all clear or the clear with conditions to the area entrance monitors in person, via communications equipment, or by the use of a runner. On the way in, staff members should check on others who might have disabilities or other special needs and assist them as much as is reason-able and safe. Sheltering In Place Because sheltering in place may be the protective action recommendation for sev eral emergencies with diff ering risks, and because sometimes the initial recommenda-tion is to shelter in place followed by relocation, there is no single set of shelter in place procedures. Emergencies change as they progress. The questions to ask yourself are: Am I safer inside or outside? Where am I safest inside? Where am I safest outside? University Incident Command System (ICS) The University maintains a multi-tiered National Incident Management System (NIMS)-compliant ICS structure. Each school, campus, and the University as a whole have a formal ICS; the Johns Hopkins Institu- tions (across the University and Health System) also have an ICS, hosted by the Johns Hopkins Institutions Office of Critical Event Preparedness & Response (\"CEPAR\"). CEPAR serves as the command center for enterprise-wide planning for and reaction to a disaster. More information about CEPAR is available at www. hopkins-cepar.org.ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 8 Policy on Drugs and Alcohol The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, sale or use of controlled substances or alco- hol, whether under federal, state, local or other applica- ble law, is prohibited at any time on University property or as a part of University activity. Maryland and District of Columbia laws prohibit the possession or consump- tion of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21. The University expects its students, faculty and staff to follow the law. Campus Safety and Security and other surrounding law enforcement agencies on each campus enforce all liquor laws, including underage drinking violations and all federal and state drug laws. Individuals, including students and employees, who unlawfully possess, use, manufacture, distribute, dis- pense, or sell drugs, controlled substances or alcohol are subject to university disciplinary action (consistent with local, state, federal, or other applicable law), as well as possible referral for criminal prosecution. The Center for Health Education and Well-Being (\"CHEW\") provides health promotion and health education , to all schools and campuses, including alcohol and drug education, motivational inter- viewing, and confidential support for those who have had experiences with interpersonal and power-based violence. CHEW proactively responds to the needs of a diverse under-graduate and graduate student population, with an emphasis on the prevention of illness and harm reduction practices. The professional staff and student peer educators off er a variety of programs that support and affi rm student health and wellness through the delivery of fun and interactive programming. CHEW is dedicated to creating and sustaining a learning environment where healthy behaviors are an integral component to academic and individual success. In addition to the CHEW website, all students can find well-being programming opportunities, resources, and a robust well-being blog at https://wellbeing.jhu.edu. In compliance with the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act , Johns Hopkins University publishes information reg arding the University's educational programs r el ated to drug and alcohol abuse preven- tion; sanctions f or violations of federal, state, and lo - cal laws and University policy; a description of health risks associ ated with alcohol and other drug use; and a description of available treatment programs for JHU students.

This training was designed to help fight the opioid crisis and reduce opioid overdoses in Maryland. Learning outcomes includes increasing awareness of the demographics of people affected byremove barriers to access treatment services, under- stand the health effects of substances, negative consequences, and signs of overdose. In-person training is provided along with additional web-based modules for accessibility. Only virtual training was offered in 2020 to comply with COVID-19 restrictions.JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 9 Policy on Firearms The possession, wearing, carrying, transporting, or use of a firearm or pellet weapon is strictly forbidden on University premises. This prohibition also extends to any person who may have acquired a government-issued permit or license. Violation of this regulation will result in disciplinary action and sanctions up to and including expulsion, in the case of students, or termination of em- ployment, in the case of employees. Disciplinary action for violations of this regulation will be the responsibility of the responsible student affairs officer, dean, directo r, or panel in accordance with applicable procedures or the vice president for human resources, as may be approp- riate, in accordance with applicable procedures. Any questions regarding this policy, including the granting of exceptions for law enforcement officers and for persons acting under the supervision of authorized University personnel, should be addressed to the appro- priate chief campus security officer. Sexual Misconduct: Prevention and Response The University is committed to providing a safe and non-discriminatory educational and working environ- ment for its students, trainees, faculty, st aff, post-doc- toral fellows, residents, and other members of the Uni- versity community. In particular, the University will not tolerate and is committed to providing members of its community with an environment that is free from sex- ual misconduct. Each of the types of sexual misconduct, which includes various forms of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking are defined on pages 36 through 45 and also in the Johns Hopkins University Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures (\"Sexual Misconduct Policy\"), which are available on the JHU Sexual Assault Prevention and Response website at http://sexual misconduct.jhu.edu/. Sexual Misconduct is dis ruptive of the learning and working en vironment of the University's community and deprives students, employees and other community members of eq ual access to the Univ ersity's programs and activities. To that end, the University embraces its responsibility to increase awareness of sex ual miscon- duct, prevent its occurrence, support victims, deal fairly and firmly with offenders, diligently investigate comp- laints of such misconduct and related retaliation, and comply with Title IX of the Higher Education Amend- ments of 1972 (\"Title IX\") and the Campus SaVE Act. JHU reaffi rms its commitment to maintaining a campus environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of all members of the university community. Toward that end, JHU issues this statement of policy to inform the campus community of our programs to ad- dress sexual misconduct, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, as well as the procedures the University will follow when sexual misconduct is reported to a University official, regardless of whether the incident reported occurs on or off campus. (including dating violence, domestic vio- lence, sexual assault and stalking, specificallyas defined by the Clery Act). The University's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits sexual misconduct, and further prohibits any form of retaliation, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrim- ination or attempts thereof, whether direct or indirect, by any officer, employee, faculty, student, trainee, post- doctoral fellow, resident or agent of the University against a person because that person made a compl- aint or report of sexual misconduct or participated in any way in the investigation or resolution of such a complaint or report, or who exercised their rights or responsibilities under the Sexual Misconduct Policy or the law. Additional information about how the Uni- versity responds to allegations of related retaliation can be found on the Office of Institutional Equity's (OIE) website at oie.jhu.edu/Retaliation/Retaliation. ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 10 Education and Prevention Programs The University has education programs to promote prevention and awareness of sexual misconduct. Bystander Intervention Training The University's education also includes safe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an individual to prevent harm or inter-harm. We may not always know what to do even if we want to help. Below is a list of some ways to be an active bystander. 1 If you or someone else is in immediate danger, dial 911. This could be when a person is yelling at or being physically abusive towards another and it is not safe for you to interrupt. 1. Watch out for your friends and fellow students/em- ployees. If you see someone who looks like they could be in trouble or need help, ask if they are ok. 2. Confront people who seclude, hit on, try to make out without consent,including having sex with people who are incapacitated. 3. Speak up when someone discusses plans to take sexual advantage of another person. 4. Believe someone who discloses sexual assault, abu- sive behavior, or experience with stalking. 5.Refer people to on or off campus resources listed in this document for support in health, counseling, or with legal assistance. Preventing Sexual Misconduct Training The University requires robust on-line training for new students and employees, and implements ongoing pre- vention and awareness campaigns for students and em- ployees that address sexual misconduct. The University engages in comprehensive, intentional, and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies, and campaigns intended to prevent sexual misconduct that: A. Are culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive, assessed for val ue, eff ectiveness, or outcome; and B. Consider environmental risk and protective factors as they occur on the individual, relationship, institutional, community and societal levels. Educational programming consists of primary preven- tion and awareness programs for all incoming students and new employees and ongoing awareness and pre-vention campaigns for students that: Identify sexual misconduct as prohibited conduct; vene when there is a risk of sexual misconduct against a person other than such individual. Bystander Intervention Training (\"BIT\") programs, required for all first-year Homewood, help students identify situations of concern, and provide knowledge and tools to encourage safe and successful interventions. Additional BIT programs are also available to students upon request. If you would like to schedule a BIT program for your student group, plea se contact the Gender Violence Prevention and Education Specialist at jhuchew@jh.edu. How to Be an Active Bystander Bystanders play a critical role in the prevention of sexual and relationship violence. They are \"individuals who observe violence or witness the conditions that perpetuate violence. They are not directly involved but have the choice to intervene, speak up, or do something about it.\" We want to promote a culture of community accountability where bystanders are actively engaged in the prevention of violence without causing further 1Bystander intervention strategies adapted from Stanford University's Office of Sexual Assault & Relationship AbuseExplain what conduct constitutes sexual miscon- duct under the laws of Maryland and/or the District of Columbia, as well as University policy and the purposes for which that de finition is used ; Include a statement that the institution prohibits the crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault , and stalking (as defined by the Clery Act;JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 11 Define sexual misconduct according to any applic- able j urisdictional defi nitions of these terms; Explain what constitutes consent, in reference to sexual activit y , under the laws of Maryland and/or the District of Columbia, as well as University policy and the purposes for which that d efinition is used; Provide training for safe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an individual or individuals to prevent harm or in- tervene when there is a risk of sexual misconduct; Provide information on risk reduction, including how to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior or violent behavior so as to intervene directly or get help; Describe the potential sanctions or protective mea- sures that the University may impose or implement after determining that an individual was responsi- ble for sexual misconduct; Describe procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of alleged sexual misconduct (as described in \"Adjudication of Violations\" elsewhere in this document); Explain existing counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid, and other services available for complainants, both within the institution and in the community (as described in \"Assistance for Victims: Rights and Options\" elsewhere in this document); Explain options for, available assistance in, and how to request changes to academic, living, transportation, and working situations or protective measures (as described in \"Assistance for Victims: Rights and Options\" elsewhere in this document); Teach procedures that complainants should follow if sexual misconduct, including sexual misconduct has occurred; Explain the University's procedures for disciplinary action in cases of alleged sexual misconduct; Describe how the University will protect privacy and confidentiality; Provide information about existing services avail- able for complainants both on-campus and in the community; and Explain the interim supportive measures and accommodations offered by the University.For more information on training programs including live/in-person and online training programs, please contact the Office of Institutional Equity (http://oie. jhu.edu/ training/) and/or the Associate Director of Student Wellbeing, Gender Violence Prevention (acampb39@jh.edu).

Even if you don't know where you are going, act like you do. 4.Trust your instincts. If a situation or location feels unsafe or uncomfortable, it probably isn't the best place to be. 5.Try not to load yourself down with packages or bags as this can make you appear more vulnerable. 6.Make sure your cell phone is with you and charged and that you have taxi money. 7.Don't allow yourself to be isolated with someone you don't trust or someone you don't know. 8.Avoid putting music headphones in both ears so that you can be more aware of your surroundings, especially if you are walking alone. 9.When you go to a social gathering, go with a groupIf you've left your drink alone, just get a new one. 12.Don't accept drinks from people you don't know or trust. If you choose to accept a drink, go with theperson to the bar to order it, watch it being poured,and carry it yourself. At parties, don't drink fromthe punch bowls or other large, common opencontainers. 13.Watch out for your friends, and vice versa. If a friend seems out of it, is way too intoxicated for the amount of alcohol they've had, or is acting out of character, get him or her to a safe place immediately. 14.If you suspect you or a friend have been drugged, contact law enforcement immediately (local author-ities can be reached by calling 911 in most areas ofthe U.S.). Be explicit with doctors so they can giveyou the correct tests (you will need a urine test andpossibly others). 15.If you need to get out of an uncomfortable or scary situation here are some things that you can try: Remember that being in this situation is not your fault. You did not do anything wrong. It is the person who is making you uncomfortable that is toblame. Be true to yourself. Don't feel obligated to do anything you don't want to do. \"I don't want to\" is always a good enough reason. Do what feels right toyou and what you are comfortable with. Have a code word with your friends or family so that if you don't feel comfortable you can call themand communicate your discomfort without theperson you are with knowing. Your friends or familycan then come to get you or make up an excuse foryou to leave. Lie. If you don't want to hurt the person's feelings it is better to lie and make up a reason to leaverather than to stay and be uncomfortable, scared, orworse. Some excuses you could use are: needing totake care of a friend or family member, not feelingwell, having somewhere else that you need to be, etc. 16.Try to think of an escape route. How would you try to get out of the room? Where are the doors? Win-dows? Are there people around who might be ableto help you? Is there an emergency phone nearby? 17.If you and/or the other person have been drinking, you can say that you would rather wait until youboth have your full judgment before doing anythingyou may regret later.of friends. Arrive together, check in with each otherthroughout the evening, and leave together. 10.Trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe in any situa- tion, go with your gut. If you see something suspi-cious, contact law enforcement immediately (localauthorities can be reached by calling 911 in mostareas of the U.S.).11.Don't leave your drink unattended while talking, dancing, using the restroom, or making a phone call. 1. 2.Be aware of your surroundings. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help y ou to fi nd a way to help you find a way out of a violent or harmful situation Try to avoid isolated areas. Even if you don't It is more difficult to get help if no one is around.Risk Reduction The University recognizes that abusers are responsible for their abusive behaviors and victims are never at fault for another's abusive actions. The following are some strategies taken from the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network, www.rainn.org, to reduce one's risk of sexual assault or harassment: JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 13 Primary Prevention and Awareness Programs As mentioned above, the University offers automated training covering sexual misconduct, and makes such training available to all incoming students and new employees. The University also provides live trainings with incoming undergraduate and graduate students, as well as new employees, upon request. In response to university operations and safety protocols, many programs offerings were conducted virtually rather than in-person. If you would like to request programming, email jhuchew@jh.edu. Ongoing Prevention and Awareness Campaigns As mentioned above, the University offers automated training covering sexual misconduct, and makes such training available to all students and employees. The University also conducts in-person trainings with existing undergraduate and graduate students, as well as employees, upon request. For example, as the University returned to a hybrid learning and working modality, the Office of Institutional Equity delivered virtual trainings related to sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and related retaliation to responsible employees in the School of Medicine. The Office of Institutional Equity also delivered virtual sessions related to sexual misconduct to responsible employees in Residential Life, and undergraduate students in Fraternity and Sorority Life, First Year Mentors, and Athletics. During Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) and Domestic Violence Awareness Month, as well as throughout the spring and fall semesters, the Center for Health Education and Wellness (CHEW) coordinated multiple virtual programs. During SAAM, CHEW organized an event that highlighted how to cultivate healthy intimate partnerships in a variety of relationships. CHEW also created a collaborative playlist on Spotify and invited students to submit an art piece or spoken word for an event they co-hosted with the Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU). Notably, CHEW launched a University- wide consent campaign called, \"I ask. I listen. I respect.\" with input and support from the Provost's Sexual Violence Advisory Committee (SVAC). Student Government Association (SGA) co-organized a \"Sex Week\" such events as \"Body Mapping\" and \"Consent Media\" workshops. If you would like to request programming email jhuchew@jh.edu.Steps for Victims Seek Medical Help. Victims are encouraged to seek imme- diate medical attention. Obtaining medical attention from a forensic nurse examiner is recommended, as this medical professional can both administer medical services and conduct a medical forensic examination, including: Treat injuries; Test for and treat sexually transmitted diseases; Test for pregnancy; Provide emergency contraception; Collect physical evidence, test for \"date-rape\" drugs, and document injuries; and Connect a patient with counselors and other important non-medical resources. Victims will receive full and prompt cooperation from University personnel in obtaining appropriate medical attention, including transporting the victim to the nearest hospital. Victims reporting an incident to Student Affairs personnel, Office of Institutional Equity or Campus Safety and Security will be offered transportation to Mercy Medical Center or another appropriate medical center. Victims who wish to be transported to Mercy Medical Center or another medical center and also wish to remain anonymous should call Campus Safety and Security with a transportation request, but should not disclose their name. Local Hospitals/Forensic Medical Exams. Baltimore's des- ignated forensic nurse examiner site is Mercy Medical Center, 345 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 410- 332-9494, https://bmoresafemercy.org/. Mercy Medical Center is staffed with forensic nurse examiners trained to assist victims of sexual assault and relationship violence with physical examination, evidence collection, and pursuing a complaint with law enforcement, if a victim so desires (however, engagement with or reporting to law enforcement is not required by Mercy Medical Center). An app is available at http://www.bmoresafemerc y.org/get-the -app/ that explains more about victims' options for medical attention, re porting, forensic examination, and support services. If someone has been victimized by a crime, they do not need to make an appointment for a forensic exam. They can simply go to the Emergency Department and ask for a forensic exam. Exams cannot be scheduled via the bmoresafe app. For a list of other hospitals near JHU's campuses and surrounding areas, please see Appendix F in the Sexual Misconduct Policy or visit https://sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/. Victims in other cities should contact the closest local hospital or cr isis center ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 14 Obtain Counseling. The University encourages victims to seek counseling from a professional counselor, pastoral counselor , or other confi dential resource. These confi - dential resources can provide support and information about a victim's options. The University off ers several confi dential resources, which are described above and more fully enumerated in Appendix B of the Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures located at https :// sexual misconduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/ or the Confidential Resources website, located at https:// sexualmiscoduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/Confidential- Resources. Report The Offens e The victim has s evera l options for reporting the of f ense, including lo cal law enforcement, Campus Safety and Security, and the T itle IX Coordinator. Additional inform ation about report ing o ptions follows. Local Law Enforcement. The University encourages all members of its community to report sexual miscon-duct to law enforcement authorities, but victims have the right to decline involvement with law enforcement authorities. Victims may fi le a report directly with local law enforcement. If they fi rst report to the University, Campus Safety and Security and/or the Title IX Coordi-nator will inform them of their option to fi le criminal charges with local law enforcement of the jurisdiction where the offense occurred. The Title IX Coordinator or Campus Safety and Security will assist any victim with notifying local law enforcement authorities if they so desire. The Baltimore Police Department (BPD) can be reached at 911 (emergency) or 410-396-2455 (non-emergency). Information for other local and state law enforcement units is available on page 3 or in the individual campus sections of this Report, online at the Homewood Campus Safety and Security website (http:// security.jhu.edu/) and the JHU Sexual Misconduct Response and Prevention website (http:// sexual misconduct.jhu.edu/). Reports to the BPD can be made over the phone, in person, or online in certain cases. Once a report is logged and reviewed BPD will assign a report number and decide whether further investigation is warranted and contact individuals accordingly. For more information, see: https:// www .baltimorepolice.org/file-police-report The University reserves the right to report information to law enforcement authorities, in a health or safety emergency. The University will comply with all applicable laws and regulations on the reporting of child abuse and neglect as set forth in the University's Policy on the Safety of Children in University Programs, available at https:// policies.jhu.edu/doc/fetch.cfm/PSAvqXfe.(https://www.rainn.org) and inquire about the nearest hospital equipped with fore nsic nurse examiners and forensic medical services. Preserve Evidence. If possible, to best preserve any ev i- dence, a victim should not showe r, bathe, wash, douche, brush hai r, drink, eat, or change clothes or bedding before a forensic medical exam. If the victim decides to change clothes, the individual should not wash the clothes worn during the assault and should bring them to the hospital or medical facility. Howeve r, even if the victim has already done these things, a forensic exam may still be able to collect valuable evidence. These steps are important to preserve evidence for possible use in legal actio ns to prove a crime has oc- curred or to obtain a no-conta ct or protection orde r. Vic- tims should preserve evidenc e even if, at the time, t hey do not anticipate seeking lega l or disciplinary action. Because evidence dissipates quickl y, victims should seek medical attention as soon as possible after the incident. Victims of sexual misconduct are encouraged to also pres erve evidence by saving text messages, instant messages, social networking pages, other communi- cations, and keeping pictures, logs or other copies of documents, if they have any. Such evidence may be useful to University investigators and hearing boards, to law enforcement authorities (e.g., in proving that an al- leged criminal off ense occurred), and when seeking civil no-contact orders or protection or peace orders. (These steps are less urgent than seeking medical attention.) A forensic medical exam goes beyo nd DNA evidence collection, and therefor e is important regardless of whether the perpetrator i s known to the victim, and regardless of whether the vi ctim thinks there is bio - logical/DNA evidence to col lect. The exam can inclu de writing down the victim's d escription of events, physic al examination, and photograp hic documentation of inju- ries, evidence collection procedures, and assessment for drug-facilitated assault (\"date-rape drugs\"). Vict ims have the right to accept or decl ine any or all parts of th e exam. At some hospitals, inclu ding Mer cy Medical Center in Baltimore, a forensic me dical exam can be completed regardless of whether a victim wishes to report the incid- ent to law enforcement. U nder such circumstances, the victim has the option of c onducting a \"Jane/John Doe\" examination, where the forensic nurse exam-i ner completes a history, condu cts a physical exam and collects evidence but does not release the information to law enforcement; the medi cal records and evidentiar y kit can be stored and later released to law enforcement if the victim chooses to make a police report.JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 15 Campus Safety and Security. Victims may also file a report with their respective Campus Security office or center director, which/who can provide assistance and connect the victim with other important resources. The emergency number for Campus Safety and Securi ty on the Homewood Campus is 410-516-7777. The non- emergency number is 410-516-4600. Contact infor- mation for other campuses is located on page 3 or in the individual campus sections of this Report and the JHU Sexual Misconduct Response and Prevention website: https ://sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/. The victim also has the right to decline to notify Campus Safety and Security. Filing a Discrimination/Harassment/Sexual Misconduct Report. Victims may submit a discrimination/ha- rassment report as well as an incident of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Institutional Equity (\"OIE\"). Additional information on filing a report with OIE can be found on OIE's website (https://oie.jhu.edu/) as well as the JHU Sexual Assault Response and Prevention website ( http:// sexualmis conduct. jhu.edu).

To make an In addition to the Title IX Coordinator, reports of sexual misconduct may be brought to designated Responsible Employees who are obligated to report to the Title IX Coordinator information they receive con- cerning sexual misconduct. Responsible Employee is a designation given to certain University employees who have a duty to report sexual misconduct that the y learn of to the University's Title IX Coordinator. \"Responsible Employees\" are designated based on the University's determination that the y have the authority to redress sexual misconduct, have the duty to report sexual mis- conduct to the Title IX Coordinator, or are employees whom a student reasonably believes has such authority or duty. Responsible Employees designated by the University include academic administrators, academic advisors, non-confidential employees serving in a super - visory role, department heads and chairs, directors, deans, student affairs staff, Office of Institutional Equity st aff, faculty, Human Resources personnel, campus security officers, resident advisors, and athletic coaches. Responsible Employees must promptly report all known relevant information to the Title IX Coordinator, includ- ing the name of the complainant, respondent, and a ny witnesses and any other relevant facts, including the date, time, and location of the misconduct. Faculty who are also licensed medical providers do not have a Re- sponsible Employee obligation when providing patient care where the patient information that constitutes a report of potential sexual misconduct is protected by applicable patient privacy laws.

Report vs. Formal Complaints. The University will respond to all reports of sexual misconduct. A Formal Complaint is a specific type of report that may result in the use of the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harass- ment, and which typically must be signed by the complainant, such that the complainant will not be anonymous. A Formal Complaint typically results in the University issuing a Notice of Allegations to both parties, as further described below in the section discussing the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment.ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 16 The University has procedures in place that serve to be sensitive to complaninants who report sexual miscon- duct, including informing individuals about their right to file criminal charges. The University's procedures are also designed to deal fairly and appropriately with respondents. Upon initial contact with a party, the University informs that party of available resources such as health services, mental health services, sup- porter services, legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance and other services on and/or off-campus as well as additional remedies/interim supportive meas- ures to prevent con-tact between the parties, such as adjustments to on-campus housing and, academic schedules, protective orders, transportation, working accommodations, and retaliation plans, if reasonable and available. The University will provide such mea- sures, if either party requests them and if they are rea- sonable and available, regardless of whether the comp- lainant chooses to report the crime to University Cam- pus Safety and Security or local law enforcement. Students and employees should contact the Title IX Coordinator to request accommodations or with questions concerning the same. Recent Changes to ProceduresDepending on when reported (immediate vs delayed report), institution will help connect the comp- lainant to access to medical care and provide information on preserving evidence. Institution will assess immediate safety needs. Institution will assist complainant with contacting local police if complainant requests and provide the complainant with contact information for local police department. Institution will provide referrals to on and off cam- pus confidential and non-confidential resources. Institution will assess need to implement interim or long-term supportive measures, if appropriate. Institution will provide the complainant with the applicable sexual misconduct policy as well as a written explanation of the complainant's rights and options. Institution will provide a \"No trespass (PNG)\" if deemed appropriate. Institution will provide written instructions on how to apply for Protective Order or Peace Order. Institution will provide a copy of the policy applica- ble to Sexual Assault to the parties and inform themIf a report of sexual misconduct is reported to the University, the University takes the following initial steps to assess risk and provide support: On August 14, 2020, the Department of Education's revised regulations for how institutions of higher education must handle complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment went into effect. The University thus revised its Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures (SMPP) that same day. The revised, current SMPP, availabe at https://sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/policies- laws/, now has two separate sets of procedures: 1) The Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, which comply with the newly revised Title IX regulations, and 2) The Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct, which address sexual misconduct that is not considered Title IX Sexual Harassment. While these August 2020 revisions resulted in some procedural changes for how the University addresses sexual misconduct, all sexual misconduct that was prohibited under the prior SMPP (prior to August 14, 2020) remains prohibited and will be addressed under university policy. The August 14, 2020 revised regulations are not retroactive. They only apply to reports of Title IX violations where the alleged conduct occurred on or after August 14, 2020. Thus, if the University receives a report of sexual misconduct that is alleged to have occurred prior to August 14, 2020 (regardless of when it is reported), the matter will be handled under the University's prior Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures that was in effect before the August 14, 2020 revisions, available at https://sexualmiscond- uct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/SMPP%20Effective% 208.1.19%20 Through%208.13.20.pdf, rather than the policy that has since gone into effect. Sexual mis- conduct that is alleged to have occurred on or after August 14, 2020 is handled under the current SMPP, available at https://sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/policies- laws/. Initial Response To A Report of Sexual Misconduct Procedures following this initial response depend on the circumstances, including whether the identity the Respondent is known to the University and whether the matter proceeds to investigation and/or adjudication, and can include the following where applicable:Procedures the University Will Follow When a Sexual Misconduct Report is FiledJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 17 Campus Safety and Security and the Title IX Coordi- nator are available to assist any student, faculty, or st aff member seeking a Protective Order, Peace Order, Civil Protection Order, or other protectiv e order, or any other available remedy under St ate or Federal law. Further, the Univ ersity complies with law in recognizing orders of protection and encourages any person who obtains an order of protection, restraining order , or the like, wheth- er civil or criminal in nature, to provide a copy to Cam - pus Safety and Securit y and the Title IX Coordinator. A complainant may then meet with Campus Safety and Security or the Title IX Coordinator to develop a safety plan, which is a plan for Campus Safety and Security and the victim to reduce risk of harm while on campus or coming and going from campus. This plan may include, but is not limited to: escorts, special parking arrangements, providing a temporary cellphone, changing classroom location or allowing a student to complete assignments from home. Note that any camplainant who fears for their safety may meet with Campus Safety and Security or the Title IX Coordinator regarding a safety plan, even if they have not obtained a legal order.Plan for Safety. Compl ainants may also wish to obtain a no-contact or similar or der, or other protecti ve measures. The Universit y may issue an institutio nal no-contact order at the req uest of the complainan t or respondent, or if appropria te, on its own volition. In additi on to obtaining a no-contac t order under University policy, student s, employees, faculty, and staff may seek to obtain an order of protection under Maryland or District of Columbia law, or in anoth er applicable jurisdiction.

The Title IX Coordinator will consider any requests for confidenti ality or requests that an investigation not be pursued in light of the University's commitment to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment for all students. The Title IX Coordinator may also consider a complainant's request for confidenti ality in conjunction with other legal obligations, such as com- pliance with court orders, governmental investigations and proceedings, and litigation requests related to the report. For example, if the Title IX Coordinator If the University honors a request f or confi dentiality, the U niversit y's ability to investigate and respond to the reported misconduct and pursue disciplinary action against the respondent may be limited. The University will however take all reasonable steps to evaluate and respond to the report consistent with a request that has been granted. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the University will not honor a complainant's request for confident iality, the Title IX Coordinator or a designee will inform the complainant prior to starting an investigation. If the complainant or the Title IX Coordinator files a Formal Complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, written notice of the complaint will be provided to both parties and will include the identity of the complainant. Written notice will also be provided to parties in Other Sexual Misconduct investigations. In all circumstances, the University will make ap- propriate interim supportive measures available, provide access to resources, and take such other actions as necessary an d appropriate to protect the safety and security of th e University community. The University will exercise discretion in implementing interim measures and will only disclose information needed to implement such measures. All disclosures will be compliant with federal privacy laws protecting student information. Interim Supportive Measures Every time that OIE receives a report of sexual misconduct of any kind, and regardless of how the report proceeds, the Title IX Coordinator will work with all affected persons to ensure their safety and promote their well-being. This assistance may include the provision of interim supportive measures following an incident or while a matter under these Procedures is pending to assist, support, or protect an individual and/ or to protect the integrity of an investigation or resolution process. Both complainants and respondents will have equal access to appropriate and reasonably available and feasible interim supportive measures.concludes that the allegations about the respondent suggest a threat to the community or learns of other information that warrants or necessitates investigation, the request for confidentiality may not be granted.20 ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator or a designee will provide written notice to the complainant of the interim supportive measures that may be avail- able and feasible and will seek to discuss with the complainant these measures and the complainant's wishes. Similar notice will be provided to the respon- dent upon being notified of the complaint or report. Reasonable and appropriate interim supportive mea - sures that may be available and feasible and will seek to discuss with the complainant reports the matter to Campus Safety and Security or law enforcement, or files a report with the University.

All reported violations of \"no contact\" orders and other similar directives will be assessed to determine whether additional misconduct charges are warranted. 24 ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT Interim measures may include, but are not limited to: Moving residences on campus ; Adjusting work schedules; Changing advisors; Changing academic schedules; Parking and/or transportation accommodations; Rescheduling examinations; Allowing withdrawal from or re-taking classes without penalty; Providing access to tutoring or other academic support; Prohibiting attendance at group or organizational informal or formal functions overseen by the University; Administrative leave for non-student employees; Interim Suspension/ Emergency removal as permitted by applicable law; Issuing mutual \"no contact\" orders; Assistance connecting with medical and/or mental health services; Developing an anti-retaliation plans to address retaliation concerns; Change in dining location; Access to safety escort services; and/or Assistance connecting with a supporte r. Procedures for Disciplinary Action The Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures set forth the University's commitment to investigate and resolve cases involving sexual misconduct and retaliation promptly, fairly, equitably, impartially, and in compliance with law. The Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures applies to all members of the University community, including, but not limited to, students, trainees, faculty, staff, post-doctoral fellows, and residents, and covers prohibited conduct that: occurs on campus or other University property; occurs in connection with University programs or activities, whether on or off campus, including academic, educa- tional, extracurricular, athletic and other programs and activities; impedes equal access to any University educational program or activity or adversely impacts the education or employment of a member of the University community, regardless of where the conduct occurred or, otherwise threatens the health or safety of one or more students, trainees, faculty members, staff members, post-doctoral fellows, or residents. All individuals who enter JHU campuses or property are prohibited from engaging in any form of sexual misconduct as defined by this Policy, regardless of their affiliation with the University. When a report of sexual misconduct is received, OIE will assess the involved individual(s)' relationship with the University as well as the type, location, and context of the reported conduct to determine whether it should be addressed using the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct, or by another University policy/process. Regardless of the process applied, OIE will take reasonable and appropriate supportive and responsive measures to address prohibited conduct under this Policy. In some instances where the accused party (the \"respondent\") is not a student, staff member, faculty member, trainee or resident, some or all of the procedures outlined herein may not apply. In other instances, the University may determine that some or all of the procedures outlined herein should be applied to third parties (e.g., visitors; volunteers; vendors and contractors while on University property, participating in a University sponsored activity, or providing or receiving services to or from the University; applicants for admission to or employment with the University; and former affiliates of the University). Regardless, OIE will take reasonable and appropriate supportive and responsive measures to address prohibited conduct under this Policy. Has the University received a Formal Complaint? When the Title IX Coordinator receives a complaint or report of sexual misconduct, the Title IX Coordinator must determine the appropriate procedures for resolution. If the alleged sexual misconduct occurred prior to August 14, 2020, OIE typically will apply the procedures from the former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, available at https:// sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/SMPP% 20Effective%208.1.19%20Through%208.13.20.pdf. If the alleged sexual misconduct occurred on or after August 14, 2020, OIE must assess whether the appropriate procedures for resolution are: (1) Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, or (2) Procedures for Other Sexual Harassment.25 JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY Assessment to Determine the Appropriate Procedures to Apply This assessment involves considering the federally- mandated criteria for Title IX Sexual Harassment grievance procedures: Does some or all of the alleged conduct, if found to have occurred as alleged, constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment? At the time of filing a Formal Complaint signed by the Complainant, was the complainant participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the university?Did the alleged conduct occur within the United States? Did the alleged conduct occur in the University's education program or activity? If all of the above questions are answered in the affirmative, the University will apply the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, available at https:// sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/#Appendix% 20G. However, if one or more of the above questions is answered in the negative, the Title IX Coordinator will apply the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct, available at https:// sexualmis conduct.jhu.edu/policies- laws/#Appendix%20H, which are very similar to the procedures set forth under the former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures. Reports of retaliation will generally be handled under the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct. In some cases, the Title IX Coordinator may need to engage in limited fact-gathering to make this prelim- inary assessment. Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct/ Former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures This section of the report contains a summary of some of the salient features of the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct Policy and the former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, which are very similar. To view the full text of the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct, please visit https:// sexual misconduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/#Appendix% 20H . To view the full text of the former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, please visit https:// sexualmisconduct.jhu.edu/policies-laws/SMPP% 20Effective%208.1.19%20Through%208.13.20.pdf.ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 26 Notice of Rights Upon filing a report of sexual misconduct that triggers either the Procedures for Other Sexual Misconduct or the former Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, the University will provide the complainant with a written explanation of their rights, options, and responsibilities, and the resources available to assist the complainant within the institution and the larger community, incl- uding counseling, health, mental health, international student services, financial aid, and other services. Upon initiating an assessment or investigation of a complaint of sexual assault, stalking, or relationship violence, the University will provide both the complainant and the respondent with a written explanati on of their rights, options, and responsibilities, and the resources available to assist both the complainant and respondent within the institution and the larger communi ty, including counseling, mental health, international student services, financial aid, legal services, and other services. Standard of Evidence The University will use the preponderance of the evi- dence standard to determine a respondent's responsi- bility for alleged Sexual Misconduct Policy violations. A \"preponderance of the evidence\" means it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred (or did not occur) based on the evidentiary record. Time Frames The University seeks to resolve all sexual misconduct cases as promptly as reasonably possible. OIE is responsible for the investigation of a complaint, which typically takes approximately 30 - 90 days, and results in OIE providing an investigative report to the appropriate decision-maker/panel. Following OIE's investigation, the decision-maker/ panel then determines the outcome, including whether the Policy was violated and, if so, any appropriate sanctions. This post-OIE adjudication process typically takes 30 - 60 days, and additional time may be needed to process an appeal, if applicable. The length of the investigation, adjudication and/or appeal may be impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, the nature and scope of allegation; the number of witnesses; availability of witnesses, parties, party supporters and Hearing Advisors; voluminous documentary evidence; the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities; evidence gathering in a concurrent law enforcement investigation; and the academic calendar(e.g., exam periods, breaks). The University will provide the complainant and respondent with periodic updates on the status of the case, as well as timely written notice of scheduled meet- ings, hearings, and interviews in which they are required or permitted to attend. Investigations When the Title IX Coordinator receives a complaint or report of sexual misconduct, the Title IX Coordinator determines whether to initiate an investigation. If an investigation is opened, the Title IX Coordinator will coordinate, oversee, or conduct the investigation. Duri ng the fi rst phase of its investigation, the inves- tigator(s) will gather facts related to the allegations of sexual misconduct, interview the complainant, respondent, and witnesses, and gather pertinent docu- ments and other evidence identified by either party or that comes to their attention. Parties have the right to submit evidence, witness lists and/or suggest specific questions to be posed to the other party during the investigation. Upon completion of the fact-gathering process, the investigator(s) will prepare an investigative report including the investigator(s)' fi ndings of fact, and a recommended determination as to whether the respondent is responsible for the alleged violation(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. The parties will have a chance to review and comment on the investigation report, prior to its finalization. Once the investigation is complete, the investigative report is transmitted to the appropriate resolution/hearing panel, board or admin-istrator for resolution and administration of sanctions. Informal Resolution If the complainant and respondent agree, certain cases may be resolved informally with the approval of the Title IX Coordinator. Cases involving allegations of sexual assault or sexual coercion are not suitable for informal resolution. Informal resolution may also be unavailable if the Title IX Coordinator determines that it is inappropriate based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. All informal resolutions will be conducted and overseen by the Title IX Coordinator or a designee, and under no circumstances will a complainant be directed to resolve a matter directly The Title IX Coordinator (for investigations) and th e decision-maker/ panel or appeal officer (for adjudication and appeals) may extend the above time frames for good cause with written notice to the complainant and respondent. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 27 with the respondent. Either the complainant or the respondent may withdraw their agreement to proceed informally at any time. If both parties are satisfied with a proposed informal resolution and the Title IX Coordi- nator considers the resolution to satisfy the University's obligation to provide a safe and non-discriminatory en- vironment, the resolution will be implemented and the informal resolution process will be concluded. Both parties receive written notice of outcome in a matter resolved informally. If informal resolution efforts are unsuccessful, the Title IX Coordinator will determine if the matter should be formally investigated, referred to a different department or division for informal follow-up, or closed internally with no further action. Formal Resolution Except as provided in the Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, resolution, sanctions and appeals of sexual misconduct comp laints will be governed by the procedures in the University's personnel policies when the respondent is a staff member; and when the respondent is a faculty member, post-doctoral fellow, or resident will be processed by the office of the dean of the appropriate division according to the disciplinary procedures estab lished by that division. The resolution, sanctions and appeals of sexual misconduct cases in which the responden t is a student will be governed by the Sexual Misco nduct Policy. Some of the pertinent features of the student respondent resolution process are as follows: If a matter involving a student respondent is not resolved by informal resolution or a respondent's ac- ceptance of responsibility, the Title IX Coordinator or a designee will convene a resolution panel at the conclu- sion of an investigation to determine whether the re- spondent is or is not responsible for violation(s) of the Policy. A panel will have three members drawn from a trained pool of University faculty and administrators and retired judges or other qualified legal professional selected by the Title IX Coordinator or a designee (two University personnel (faculty and/or administrators) and one retired judge/qualified legal professional).for further investigation or clarification of the inves- tigative report, or (iii)convene a hearing. If the panel determines that a case can be decided without hearing from witnesses or receiving further evidence, both the complainant and respondent will none- theless have the opportunity to make a statement to the resolution panel if they so choose. The panel will determine respondent's responsibility for alleged Policy viol ations. If f ound responsible, the panel will proceed to the sanctioning phase. Procedural Rights For complaints of sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking: All procedural right s will be aff orded equally to com- plainants and respondents. Upon review of the investigative report and any comments submitted by the parties or the Office of Institutional Equity, the panel may (i) determine that the case can be decided without hearing from witness- es or receiving further evidence, (ii) remand the case Supporters. The complainant and the respondent may be assisted and advised by one personal supporter (i.e., someone who is not serving as a legal counsel or an advocate) and/or one supporter who serves as a legal counsel, an advocate super- vised by an attorney or a trained advocate, through- out the investigative and resolution process (including hearing, sanctioning and appeals). The supporters may accompany the party to any meeting or hearing held pursuant to the Sexual Misconduct Policy. During any such meeting or proceeding, a supporter (whether or not legal counsel) may privately consult the party (except during quest- ioning of a party at a hearing) but may not speak on the party's behalf or otherwise participate, or add- ress or question the investigator, resolution pan el, or other parties or witnesses. The supporter may make written submission on the party's behalf. University personnel employed in the office respon- sible for the discplinary proceedings described in ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 28 these Procedures, along with those in the chai n of command above them, personnel employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and others whose partic- ipation could create a conflict of interest and/or reason- ably call into question the impartiality of the Univer- sity's process are not elig-ible to serve as supporters. If there is a question or a concern about a possible supporter, please consult with the Title IX Coordinator. Attorneys for Student Sexual Assault Matters. Maryland law (Education Article section 11-601) provides that a party (whether the complain-ant or respondent) who would like to be assisted by legal counsel during an investigation under this Policy is permitted to access counsel paid for by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (\"MHEC\") if: (1) the party is a current or former student; (2) the party makes or responds to a complaint alleging an incident of sexual assault; (3) the party was enrolled as a student at the University at the time of the alleged incident of sexual assault; and (4) the Title IX Coordinates decides to conduct an investigation into the complaint. Under those circumstances, and assuming funding is available, MHEC is required to pay the reasonable costs and attorney's fees for students who access legal counsel. A student who is authorized to access legal counsel paid for by MHEC may select their counsel from a list of attorneys and legal services programs developed by MHEC. The following MHEC webpage provides more information, including a list of participating attorney: https:// mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual- Assault-Proceedings---Attorney-List.aspx. Altern- atively, if a student selects and retains an attorney who is not on MHEC's list, MHEC will pay fees to the attorney selected by the student that are equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The complainant and respondent will each have equal and timely access to and an opportunity to review any information that will be used during informal and formal disciplinary meetings and hearings, consistent with FERPA and to protect other confi dential and privileged information. The complainant and respondent will have timely notice for meetings at which they may be present. A student may select and retain legal counsel at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigative and resolution process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the complainant and/or the respondent may knowingly and voluntarily choose not to have legal counsel. JHU is not responsibl e for the provision of attorneys through MHEC (or any other source) or theTraining for Officials Conducting Investigations and Hearings All officials conducting sexual misconduct investi- gations and hearings shall, at a minimum, receive annual training on issues related to sexual misconduct, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking, and on how to conduct an investigation and hearing that pr omote safety and accountability and affords equal procedural rights to complianants and respondents. In addition, investigators and the Director of Case Management receive topic-specific trainings throughout the year. Conflict of Interest Policy All persons participating in the investigation or reso- lution (including hearing, sanctioning and appeals) of sexual misconduct cases should disclose any potential or actual conflict of interest to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for sharing relevant information with the complainant and res- pondent. If either party believes that any person in- volved in the process has a conflict of interest, they may make a request to the Title IX Coordinator that the individual not participate. Any such request should include a descr iption of the alleged conflict. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that a disabling conflict of interest exists, the Title IX C oordinator will take steps to address the conflict in order to ensure an impartial process. The institutional disciplinary procedures will not be conducted by officials who have a conflict of interest or bi as for or against the complainant or the respondent.payment of any attorneys' fe es, and cannot guarantee that attorneys or funding fo r attorney's fees will be available from MHEC. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 29 Sanctions and Protective Measures In cases of sexual misconduct, the University will im- pose sanctions that are fair and appropriate, consistent with the University's handling of similar cases, adequate to protect the safety of the campus community, and reflective of the seriousness of the misconduct at issue. The University may impose any one or more of the following sanctions on a respondent found respon-sible for sexual misconduct, or other such appropriate sanction as the circumstances may dictate: Reprimand/warning; Changing the respondent's academic schedule or employment schedule; Disciplinary probation; Revocation of honors or awards; Loss of privileges; Alcohol and/or drug assessment or counseling; Imposition of conditions of employment; Restricting access to University facilities or ac- tivities, including student activities and campusorganizations; Mandatory training; Service hours Issuing a \"no contact\" order to the respondent or requiring that an existing order remain in place; Moving the respondent's residence; Dismissal, termination or restriction from Universi- ty employment; Making a former University employee or student (including those expelled or terminated pursuant to these sanctions) ineligible for hire or rehire by the University; Removal from student housing; Demotion or other removal from a management, supervisory or leadership role(s); A full or partial ban from campus (either limited time or i ndefi nite); Transcript notations; Deferred suspension Restriction from University sponsored or affiliated events; Pay reduction Loss of raise; Loss of supervision or oversight duties;Suspension; Expulsion; and Revocation of degree. The University may implement additional measures that are designed to prevent the recurrence of sexual miscond uct or respond to the eff ects of the sexual mis- conduct on the University community that include, but are not limited to: increased monitoring, supervision, or security at locations or activities where the sexual misconduct occurred; additional training and/or edu-cational materials for students or groups; and campus climate surveys. The University may also implement additional mea-sures to remedy the eff ects of the sexual misconduct on the complainant.

In all cases, the notice will also include information on the procedures, if any, for the complainant and respondent to appeal the results of the disciplinary pro-ceeding. Subsequent simultaneous written notice will be provided to the complainant and respondent if there is any change to the results that occurs prior to the time that such result s become fi nal, when such results become fi nal, and the outcome of an appeal, if any.Notice of Rights & Notice of Allegations Upon receiving a report of sexual misconduct, the University will provide the complainant with a written explanation of their rights, options, and responsiblities and the resources available to assist the complainant, including notifying the complainant of the Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures. The Title IX Coordinator or designee will promptly contact the complainant to discuss the availablity of interim supportive measures (regardless of whether a Formal Complaint is filed), the complainant's wishes with respect to supportive measures, and the process for filing a Formal Complaint. Following receipt of a Formal Complaint, OIE simultaneously will provide written notice to each known party (Complainant(s) and Respondent(s)) that will include the following: Notice of the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, including the informal resolution process and a range of possible sanctions associated with the allegations; Notice of the allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment, including: the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known; the conduct alleged to constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment; the date, time, and location of the alleged incident(s), if known;Appeals In student respondent cases, both parties have the right to appeal the resolution panel's finding of responsibility and/or imposition of sanction(s) on limited grounds, within the applicable time frame and in writing, to the Vice Provost for Student Affairs or a designee, who will decide all appeals. In faculty and staff respondent cases, that involve a student complainant, the parties may appeal a determination or sanction. In faculty and staff respondent cases that do not involve a student, if divisional or unit procedures allow an appeal with respect to procedural errors, findings or sanctions, such right to appeal shall be available equally to the complianant and respondent. Procedures for Title IX Sexual HarassmentJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 31 A statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of any investigation and adjudication process; The Title IX Coordinator or a designee reserves the right to amend or supplement the Notice of Alleg- ations at any time and will notify the parties in writing of any changes. Along with the Notice of Allegations, the Title IX Coordinator or a designee also will provide the Complainant and Respondent, respectively, a written explanation of their rights, options, and responsibilities under these Procedures, including the availability of interim supportive measures and support resources, information regarding other civil and criminal options, and legal services organizations and referral services available to the party. Even if a preliminary determination is made that alleged misconduct in a Formal Complaint triggers the Procedures for Title IX Sexual Harassment, as described in Section IX of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, throughout the investigation and adjudication process it may become apparent that some or all of the alleged misconduct does not meet the requirements of Title IX Sexual Harassment. In that case, the University must dismiss the Formal Complaint (or the allegations within the Formal Complaint that do not meet the Title IX Sexual Harassment requirements), but it retains the discretion to address the alleged misconduct as Other Sexual Misconduct under the Sexual Misconduct Policy or under other policies, including the Student Conduct Code. Information regarding the parties' right to a supporter of choice (including an attorney or advocate) and a hearing advisor in the event of a live hearing; and A statement describing applicable prohibitions against knowingly making false statements or submitting false information during any investigation, adjudication, or informal resolution process. If any of these circumstances is present, the Title IX Coordinator will make a fact-specific determination whether to dismiss the Formal Complaint, considering all relevant circumstances, including the safety adn security of the University community. In the event of a discretionary dismissal, both parties will be notified simultaneously and will have the right to appeal the dismissal. Standard of Evidence The University will use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine a respondent's responsibility for alleged Sexual Misconduct Policy violations. A \"preponderance of the evidence\" means it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred (or did not occur) based on the evidentiary record. Discretionary and Mandatory Dismissal of a Formal Complaint The Title IX Coordinator has discretion to dismiss a Formal Compliant of TItle IX Sexual Harassment or any allegations within such a Formal Complaint where: (1) The Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complaintant would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any allegations within it; (2) The Respondent is no longer enrolled at the University or is no longer employed by the University; or (3) Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint or allegations therein. Time Frames The University seeks to resolve all sexual misconduct cases as promptly as reasonably possible. OIE is responsible for the investigation of a complaint, which typically takes approximately 30 - 90 days, and results in OIE providing an investigative report to the appropriate determination panel. Following OIE's investigation, the determination panel then determines the outcome via a live hearing with cross examination, including determining whether the Policy was violated and, if so, any appropriate sanctions. This post-OIE adjudication process typically takes 30 - 60 days, but can be impacted by the factors described below. The length of the investigation, adjudication and/or appeal may be impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, the nature and scope of allegations; the number of witnesses; availability of witnesses, parties, party supporters and Hearing Advisors; voluminous documentary evidence; the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities; evidence gathering in a concurrent law enforcement investigation; and the academic calendar (e.g., exam periods, breaks).ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT32 T he Title IX Coordinator (for investigations) and the decision-maker/ panel or appeal officer (for adjudication and appeals) may extend the above time frames for good cause with written notice to the complainant and respondents. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, the factors listed in the above paragraph. The University will provide the complainant and respondent with periodic updates on the status of the case, as well as timely written notice of scheduled meetings, hearings, and interviews in which they are required or permitted to attend. InvestigationInformal Resolution of a Formal Complaint At any time prior to reaching a determination regarding a Formal Complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, the Title IX Coordinator or designee may facilitate an informal resolution process (such as mediation) that does not involve a full investigation and adjudication, if the following circumstances are met: (1) The parties each receive a written notice disclosing the allegations adn the requirements of the informal resolution process; (2) The parties each provide voluntary, written consent to particpating in the informal resolution process; and (3) The Formal Complaint does not allege that a University employee engaged in Title IX Sexual Harassment of a student. If the parties agree to engage in the informal resolution of the Formal Complaint. If either party decides to withdraw, the investigation and adjudication process for the Formal Complaint will resume. If, through the informal resolution process, the parties agree to a resolution of the Formal Complaint, the party's agreement will be confirmed in writing, the Formal Complaint will be closed, and the parties may no longer resume the investigation and adjudication process on the same allegations. However, an Informal Resolution does not prevent either party from reporting new allegations that were not part of a Formal Complaint that was informally resolved.-ation, the investigator(s) will gather facts related to the allegations of sexual misconduct, interview the complainant, respondent, and witnesses, and gather pertinent documents and other evidence identified by either party or that comes to their attention. Parties have the right to submit evidence (both inculpatory and exculpatory), present witnesses (including fact and expert witnesses), and/or suggest specific questions to be posed to the other party during the investigation. The burden of proof and of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University and not on the parties. Evidence File Reivew. Prior to the completion of the Investigative Report, OIE will provide each party and their supporter(s) (if applicable) with electronic access to review and inspect the evidence file, which includes any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint. The parties will have 10 calendar days to submit a written response to OIE, if they choose, which will become part of the evidence file unless the response is not directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint. If either or both parties submit a response to the evidence file, the assigned investigator(s) will consider the resp- onse(s) prior to completing the Investigative Report. Investigative Report. Upon completion of the fact- gathering process and with consideration of any response to the evidence file review, the investig- ator(s) will consider all relevant evidence and prepare a report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence. The report will include the investigator's recomm- ended findings of fact, an assessment of credibility of the information provided, and a recommended deter- mination as to whether the Respondent is responsible for the alleged violation(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. At least 10 days prior to the hearing, the Complainant and Respondent will be notified in writing of their right to review the investigative report and submit written comments to the determination panel. If either party chooses to submit written comments to the determination panel, these comments will be provided in full to the other party along with OIE's final investigative report.Fact Gathering. When the Title IX Coordinator receives a complaint or report of sexual misconduct, the Title IX Coordinator determines whether to initiate an investigation. If an investigation is opened, the Title IX Coordinator will coordinate, oversee, or conduct the investigation. During the first phase of its investig-JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 33 Once the Title IX Coordinator or investigator deter- mines that an investigation is complete, the Title IX Coordinator or investigator will transmit the invest- igative report and the evidence file to the appropriate determination panel. Live Hearing Unless a Formal Complaint is dismissed or resolved via the informal resolution process, the University will provide for a live hearing presided over by a trained determination panel. Live hearings may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same geographic location or, at the University's discretion, any or all parties physically present in the same geographic location or, at the University's discretion, any or all parties, witnesses and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants to simultaneously see and hear each other. Cross Examination by Hearing Advisor. All parties must have a Hearing Advisor present at the live hearing, and no other supporter(s) may attend the hearing. If a party does not have a Hearing Advisor present at the live hearing, the University will provide a Hearing Advisor to the party without fee or charge to conduct cross-examination on behalf of the party during the live hearing. The determination panel will permit each party's Hearing Advisor of choice to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Parties are not permitted to directly question the other party(ies) or witnesses at the hearing. All questioning must be via the Hearing Advisor. The determination panel cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based soley on a party's or witness's absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.Determination Regarding Responsibility The determination panel will issue a written determination regarding responsibility simult- aneously to both parties which will include: (1) Identification of the allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment; (2) A description of the procedural steps taken; (3) Findings of fact supporting the determinations; (4) Conclusions regarding the application of the Sexual Misconduct Policy to the facts; (5) A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determ- ination regarding responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the Respondent, and whether the University will provide to the complainant remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to its education programs and/or activities; and (6) Information about procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and respondent to appeal. Sanctions and Protective Measures The determination panel will impose sanctions that are fair and appropriate, consistent with the University's handling of similar cases, adequate to protect the safety of the campus community, and reflective of the seriousness of the misconduct at issue. The determination panel may impose any one or more of the following sanctions on a Res- pondent found responsible for sexual miscon- duct, or other such appropriate sanction as the circumstances may dictate: Reprimand/ warning; Changing the Respondent's academic or employment schedule; Disciplinary probation; Revocation of honors or awards; Loss of privileges; Restricting access to University facilities or activities, including student activities and campus organizations;Imposition of conditions of employment;ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT34 Where the Respondent is a faculty member, the only available sanction for a policy violation(s) will be referred for further sanctioning pursuant to applicable policies and/or procedures. Should this sanction be imposed, both parties will be informed of subsequent processes and sanctions issued as appropriate and required by law. The University may implement additional measures that are designed to prevent the recurrence of sexual misconduct or respond to the effects of the sexual misconduct on the University Dismissal, termination or restriction from University employment;community that include, but are not limited to: increased monitoring, supervision, or security at locations or activities where the sexual misconduct occurred; additional training and/or educational materials for students or groups; and campus climate surveys.

Procedural Rights All procedural rights will be afforded equally to complainants and respondents. The complainant and respondent will each have equal and timely access to and an opportunity to review any information that will be used during informal and formal disciplinary meetings and hearings, consistent with FERPA and to protect other confidential and privileged information. The complainant and respondent will have timely notice for meetings at which they may be present. Supporters.

A student who is authorized to access legal counsel paid for by MHEC may select their counsel from a list of attorneys and legal services programs developed by MHEC. The following MHEC webpage provides more information, including a list of participating attorney: https://mhec.maryland.gov/ Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings--- Attorney- List.aspx. Alternatively, if a student selects and retains an attorney who is not on MHEC's list, MHEC will pay fees to the attorney selected by the student that are equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. A student may select and retain legal counsel at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigative and resolution process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the complainant and/or the respondent may knowingly and voluntarily choose not to have legal counsel.

During a live hearing, only one Hearing Advisor for each party may be present-- no supporter(s) may attend the hearing, whether virtual or in-person. If a party does not identify their own Hearing Advisor, the University will provide a Hearing Advisor to the party without fee or charge in the event of a live hearing. The Hearing Advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. The Hearing Advisor also may be, but is not required to be, an individual whom a party has selected as a personal or legal supporter. Attorneys for Student Sexual Assault Matters. Maryland law (Education Article section 11-601) provides that a party (whether the complanaint or respondent) who would like to be assisted by legal counsel during an investigation under this Policy is permitted to access counsel paid for by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (\"MHEC\") if: (1) the party is current or former student; (2) the party makes or responds to a complaint alleging an incident of sexual assault; (3) the party was enrolled as a student at the University at the time of the alleged incident of sexual assault; and (4) the Title IX Coordinator decides to conduct an investigation into the complaint.

If either party believes that any person involved in the process has a conflict of interest, they may make a request to the Title IX Coordinator that the individual not particpate. Any such request should include a description of the alleged conflict. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that a disabling conflict of interest exists, the Title IX Coordinator will take steps to address the conflict in order to ensure an impartial process. Appeals Both parties have the right to appeal the determination panel's determination regarding responsibility and the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein on limited bases. The appeal process does not involve another hearing or any meetings with the Complaint, Respondent, supporters or Hearing Advisors.

W .C. Whiting School of Engineering (\"WSE\"), the Carey Busi- ness School and the School of Education (\"SOE\"). Com- bined full-time enrollment through KSAS and WSE for the 2021 -202 2 fall semester was over 5,000 undergrad- uates and over 8,000 graduate students. Over 2,700 students reside in University housing, dormitories, and apartment buildings. Supporting the Homewood Campus student population are approximately 2,600 faculty and staff . Reporting Crimes and Other Emergencies Crime and safety concerns may be reported to Johns Hopkins Public Safety by calling the on-campus emer- gency numbers 410-516-7777 or 911, or activating any of the 115 campus emergency phones for an immediate Johns Hopkins Public Safety officer response. To report non-emergency safety concerns, an email can be sent to security@jhu.edu or call 410-516-4600. Uniformed offi- cers maintain highly visible patrols 24 hours a day and are accessible to anyone wishing to report any incident. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publications and program reminders. Campus Law Enforcement Johns Hopkins Pubic Safety is the recognized law enforcement agency of the Homewood Campus. It maintains the web site https://publicsafety.jhu.edu/ for the daily publication of crimes known to have occurre d on campus, in residential halls and in University-owned buildings, on public property contiguous to the cam- pus, as well as in designated patrol zones. This web site, accessible through the University home page (www.jhu. edu), also provides crime prevention information and personal safety tips. A daily crime log is available for review during normal business hours at the front desk of Johns Hopkins Public Safety headquarters. Johns Hopkins Public Safety embraces a community-based philosophy, striving to prevent crime, provide assistance to victims and investigate reported incidents in coope r- ation with other campus authorities and city, State, an d Federal law enforcement agencies. Johns Hopkins Public Safety has the authority to enforce campus policies a nd violations of the law that occur on JHU owned or controlled property. A close working relationship i s maintained with the Baltimore Police Department ( \"BPD\"), and when appropriate Maryland State Police, a nd in any serious or major criminal incident on the H omewood Campus, the BPD would be the investigative a gency as they have primary jurisdiction. Public Safety would serve i n a support role in assisting in the investigation. Public Safety does not have a written memorandum of understanding pertain- ing to the investigation of criminal incidents with BPD or any other law enforcement agency. Under the direction of an Executive Director, and Senior Director, Johns Hopkins Public Safety employs 44 special police officers or Campus Police Officers (\"CPOs\"). All are comm issioned by the State of Mary- land with full arrest powers and jur isdiction on Uni - versity property throughout Maryland. A large number of these uniformed, highly trained professionals have graduated from accredited law enfo rcement acad- emies. They do not carry firearms. All newly hired CPOs receive formal entry level training, which includes laws of arrest, evidence collection, community policing, crime preventi on, cultural diversity, hate crimes, sexual harassment, and first aid/AED. Annual refresher training provided to all staff enables them to keep pace with the varied security service demands. A senior department coordinator, administrative coor- dinator and a hi-tech Homewood Communication Center support Campus Safety and Se curity operations. The Homewood Communication Center is operational 24 hours a day under the supe rvision of a Security Systems Manager and a staff that includes a technical systems analyst, LAN admi nistrator and 12 security systems specialists.ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT47 For incidents on the Homewood Campus, the Inves- tigative Services of Homewood Public Safety will make every eff ort to identify the person(s) responsible for criminal or other incidents and to recover property and/or evidence. Investigators provide support for Off duty armed uniformed BPD officers and off duty armed uniformed Baltimore Deputy Sheriffs are em- ployed during specific times and assigned to areas ad- jacent to campus along Charles Street, St. Paul Street, University Parkway and the Charles Village. Off-duty BPD officers and Deputy Sheriffs maintain arrest authority with jurisdiction on all JHU property when employed by the University. During the school year, students are employed as campus security monitors, bringing the total number of campus police officers, security guards, and support staff to over 200. All members of Public Safety, regard- less of job title or position, are held to the same high standard of professional conduct. Johns Hopkins Public Safety provides full security services to the Homewood Cam pus community around the clock. It functions in concert with several other service-oriented offices to ensure a safe and secure envi- ronment in which students, faculty and staff may enjoy rewarding academic and social experiences. To this end , Public Safety maintains an open-door policy and works in partnership with students, faculty, staff and the community. A close working relationship exists between Public Safety, the Dean of Student Life, the directors of Residential Life, Housing, Counseling and Student Development, and Multicultur-a l Student Affairs. In keeping with its community-based philosophy, Public Safety strives to keep officers on regular posts and foster positive rapport with all members of the campus community. Public Safety maintains Visible Uniformed Patrols, including: 24-hour foot, motorized, and club cars coverage on and adjacent to campus. 24-hour uniformed presence at the entrance/ turnstiles and perimeter of the on-campus Alumni Memorial Residence Halls (\"AMRs\"). 24-hour uniformed presence at the front desks/ turnstiles of the Wolman, McCoy and Charles Commons residence halls and the entrances to the desks at the Homewood and Bradford Apartments (off campus University-owned residence halls).

Investigators work closely with University administra- tors and Student Affairs staff to handle student-related issues administratively when possible. Contract security is also assigned to various on and off-campus locations. These officers have no arrest authority, but do maintain the authority to enforce JHU policies on campus. They provide a visible uniformed presence targeted at preventative patrol and provide extra eyes and ears for campus police officers and BPD. The contract officers attend a pre-deployment entrance-level training program as prescribed by the University and security service company. They also attend an annual in-service training through their agency.

Dedicated off campus community patrols in marked Public Safety patrol vehicles, fulfilling a University commitment to the surrounding neighborhoods where many students, faculty and staff from Homewood Campus, The Peabody Institute and the Medical Institutions reside. Community Asset Walks In previous years, each first-year floor was organized into a walk with Johns Hopkins Public Safety and there was a specific path that they followed, high- lighting blue lights, personal safety tips, and other issues to be aware of, as students transition to an urb- an campus. This year, the walks are being re-tooled into Community Asset Walks, pairing a student leader with a Public Safety officer to provide additional information when helpful and offer a personal introduction to the officer. The goal is to provide a holistic introduction to the JHU campus and surr- ounding community, including how to get involved, while providing answers to any safety and security questions that may arise from students. Each walk departs at 5 PM from outside the targeted residence hall. There are two walks, at the same time, with two leaders each. Split the total group of students as equal- ly as possible. One group goes clockwise, one goes counterclockwise. Each walk will have a Safety and Security officer accompanying the students, walking in the back. These walks happen during the month of September, every weekday, Monday through Thursday. Security and Access of Campus Facilities At the Homewood Campus, academic and research halls are open during normal business hours, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, and at other times to accommodate scheduled classes and activities. Fac- ulty, staff , and students may also be granted after-hours access to buildings by Johns Hopkins Public Safetyofficers for study, research or other legitimate purposes. Non-commuting freshmen and sophomores are re- quired to live in University housing. Student residence halls are secured at all times and may be entered only by key and/or electronic access card or when escorted b y a hall resident. Residence halls are equipped with fi re and access door alarm systems. On-campus residence halls have contract security guards at the turnstiles on duty 24 hours a day. Johns Hopkins Public Safety patrol the perimeter and common areas of these buildings. Three undergraduate residence halls (Wolman, McCoy, and Charles Commons) across the street from campus have security guards stationed at the desk/turnstiles with a campus police officer patrolling the perimeter and common areas of these facilities as well as adjacent University-owned property 24 hours a day. University- owned apartment buildings (Homewood and Brad- ford) are st affed by contract security guards 24 hours a day. The Housing Department's Lock Shop ensures the proper functioning of all residential door locks and is on emergency call 24 hours a day. Access Control JHU students must use a J-Card to access all residence halls. Guests can be admitted after signing in and showing a photo-ID. Johns Hopkins Public Safety, through the computer terminal located at the Home- wood Communication Center, deactivates lost access cards during periods when the J-Card office is closed. ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT49 Security Systems (Smart CCTV, Emergency Phones) The Homewood Communication Center, is st affed 24 hours a day with Security Systems Specialists who are responsible for taking calls and dispatching requests for security-related services, monitoring of the 705 CCTV cameras mounted in and around the Home- wood Campus, monitoring intrusion and fire alarms on University properties, and maintaining constant communications with the Baltimore Police Depart- ment and Baltimore City Fire Department. The University continues installing \"Smart CCTV\" systems using behavioral recognition software to iden- tify suspicious or unusual behaviors, focusing primarily on the exterior of residence halls and their surround- ings and areas where students congregate. The behav- ioral recognition software reacts to persons, vehicles, or objects according to parameters defi ned by Campus Safety and Security, and alerts the CCTV operator when- ev er an event occurs and facilitates an appropriate level of response. The current number of \"Smart CCTV\" cameras has increased to 190, with additional cameras planned as the area of coverage expands. There are 117 blue light emergency phones on and around campus. Students, faculty and staff are encour- aged to familiarize themselves with their locations and Maintenance of Campus Facilities Johns Hopkins Public Safety encourages recommen- dations from its members, faculty, other staff and students for ways to better protect the University com- munity as may be needed. Public Safety takes security into consideration in the maintenance of JHU facilities by scheduling evening walks around cam-pus with the dean of student life, the director of plant operations, and student representatives to identify haz-ards and areas in need of improved lighting, pruning, upgraded locks, or other improvements. Cooperative eff orts and partnership is the keystone of providing the best possible security services to the Homewood Campus. Facilities and landscaping are typically maintained in a manner that minimizes hazardous conditions. Public Safety units regularly patrol campus and report mal- functioning lights and other unsafe physical conditions to the Facilities Management unit for correction. Other members of the JHU community at each campus are helpful when they report equipment problems to Public Safety or to Facilities Management directly. Off-Duty Baltimore Police and Sheriff s Initiative s Public Safety employs a cadre of off duty armed uniformed BPD officers and uniformed Deputy sheriffs to walk foot patrols on public streets contiguous to campus, most frequented by JHU students. These patrols add yet another layer of security to the JHU multi-layer security strategy. The patrols are employed throughout the week during targeted hours most susceptible to high student foot traffic. The current foot posts for these officers are along Charles Street, St. Paul Street, University Parkway and in the Charles Village neighborhood. Regular assess ments are conducted to determine where these valua ble resources are most beneficial for student safety and adjusted accordingly. Non campus Locations of Recognized Student Organizations JHU has officially recognized student organizations that own or control housing facilities outside of the JHU core campus. If BPD is called by a citizen to respond to one of those locations, BPD will typically notify Public Safety to respond with them or they will notify Public Safety after they have responded to inform JHU of the situation. However, BPD does this out of courtesy and is not \"required\" to notify or involve Public Safety when they respond to a call involving private property.operation. The push of the red button activates the si ren, light and phone and the location is displayed to the Security Systems Specialist who immediately dis- patches Public Safety officers. Emergency phones are tested regularly and any service requirement is promptly reported to the Telecommunications Department. An out-of-service phone is clearly marked and promptly repaired. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 50 Campus Safety Awareness Programs At freshman orientation and throughout the school year, Johns Hopkins Public Safety addresses the stud- ent body on security matters and methods to enhance their personal safety. It also provides knowledgeable speakers for summer programs, resident advisors, the student council and others upon request. These speak- ers address a variety of timely campus security topics and encourage students to report crimes and other emergencies to Public Safety as quickly as possible and to become partners responsible for their own security and the security of others. There are also security publications that include a weekly e-mail sent to resident advisors to post in their respective areas and to use in open discussions with students in their care. Seasonal bulletins published throughout the year and distributed on and around campus also provide a variety of timely safety tips. Homewood Human Resources advises new University employees on security procedures and practices to en-hance their personal safety on campus as well as crime prevention techniques. The department encourages all employees to report crimes in a timely fashion to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and to be re-sponsible for their own safety and the safety of others. \"Meet and Greet\" sessions with students and employ- ees are held at d ifferent locations on cam pus throughout the school year. This a ffords interested persons the op - por tunity to speak directly with a ca mpus police o ffic er, ask questions, voice concerns or make suggestions.

Siren/Public Address System The Homewood Campus maintains three siren/pub- lic address mass notification devices on the roofs of Garland Hall, Whitehead Hall, and the O'Connor Recreational Center. These devices are strategically located around the campus to provide maximum coverage of the campus and the surrounding community. In the event of a confi rmed major incident that threat-JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 52 ens the safety of the campus community, Johns Hopkins Public Safety will immediat ely send a text message alert to the students, faculty and sta ff who have subscribed to the service, notifying them of the incident. A t the Home- wood campus, the Rave alert system is tested concur- rently with the siren/public address system. Shou ld a confi rmed i ncident that presents a n immedi- ate danger occur, the siren/pu blic address system will be activated to sound a 60-second warning tone, followed by voice instructions notifying the campus community of an emergency. During the course of any emergency, additional instructions can be broadcast using any or all of these devices. Once the incident has been resolved, an all-clear tone and message will be broadcasted. This system is tested three times each year. The campus community is notified that siren/public address system is being tested. Bull Horns Select units patrolling the Homewood Campus are equipped with bull horns for announcing instructions and information to supplement the other technologies to ensure that maximum communication is achieved. Evacuations Building evacuation maps are located on all floors in all buildings on the Homewood C ampus. Should there be a need to evacuate, follow the r ecommended evacuation route on the map. Once outside, adhere to the directions of Johns Hopkins Public Saf ety officers, BPD, or other local public safety official (Baltimore City Fire Depart- ment). Evacuation procedures i n place meet ADA compliance. In the event a particular evacuation requires evacuees to be re located to an alternativ e shelter, shelter locations on campus have been designated. Evacuees will be di- rected to those locations by Public Safety, BPD or other local public safety officials (Baltimore City Fire Depart - ment). In 2019 , and 2021, a Crisis Management table top exercise was completed with senior leadership. The purpose of the exercise was to test the University's Incident Command System and Business Continuity Planning. Announced tests of the emergency notification system were conducted on February 9, 2021, and June 15, 202 1.

ANNUAL FIRE SAFETY REPORT On-Campus Fire Safety Systems For residential facilities on the Homewood Campus, fire drills are conducted in every University owned and operated residential building twice a year as required by Baltimore Cit y fire codes by University staff and the Baltimore City Fire Department. A dditional fi re alarm tests and drills occur as necessary. Smoke detectors have been installed in each The University contracts for certain systems and equipment to be inspected to include; all sprinkler sys - tems are inspected quarterly, Fire Alarm systems are inspected annually, and fire extinguishers are inspe- cted yearly (monthly by JHU mechanics). If a fire occurs in a residential buildi ng, community mem bers should immediately no tify their local campus security office or the local agency emergency services. If campus security is contacted, campus security will initiate a response and contact the local fire department. If a member of the JHU community finds evidence of a fire that has been extinguished, and the person is not sure whether campus security has already responded, the community members should immediately notify campus security to investigate and document the incident. Evacuation Procedures for Fire and Number of M andatory Fire Drills Procedures Students and Employees Should Follow In Case of a Fire Your worst enemy duri ng a fi re is smoke. If you're sur- rounded by smoke, get down on the floor and crawl to safety. Hold your breath and close your eyes if you can. Close doors behind you as you escape. Always use stairs to escape. Never use an elevator. Here are a few simple fire safety tips i n case of a fi re: Learn the location of fi re exits and alarm pull sta- tions near you and know the campus security and local agency emergency call number for assistance. Sound the fi re alarm if you see smoke or detect a burning odor. Have a prepared escape plan and know your escape route. Remember to remain calm. Use exit stairs. Never use elevators. Close doors behind you as you escape. In most cas- es, this will prevent smoke d amage and fi re from entering the room you are exiting. Do not re- enter a fi re-damaged building until it has been declared safe. If you become trapped, seal off cracks around doors and vent s with c loth or rugs. (Soak them in water if possible.) Shut off fans and air conditioners.2019: Five hate crimes reported Four intimidation cases reported on public property characterized by a religion bias.- One intimidation case reported on public property characterized by a nationality bias.- 2020: Three hate crimes reported One intimidation case reported on public property characterized by a race bias.- - -One intimidation case reported on campus characterized by a race bias.

Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures The campus emergency response is based on the Nation- al Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Com-mand System (ICS) model. Building evacuation maps are located on all floors in all buildings of Peabody. Should there be a need to evacuate, students, faculty, and st aff are instructed to follow the recommended evacuation route on the map. Once outside students, faculty, and staff are instructed to follow the directions of Campus Security or the local public safety officials (fire/police). Unannounced fire drills are held in the re sidence halls at least once per semester. These drills are evaluated by the Director of Public Safety for the speed, complete- ness, and general organization of the drill. The results are shared with the Residential Life Administrator. Fire drills were held in the Residence Hall (dorm) and Peabody Living Center (formerly called the Peabody Inn) on 3/28/2019, 10/24/2019 and 5/26/2021. No fire drills were conducted in 2020 due to the absence of students on campus during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The RAVE system was tested on 6/1/2021.Maintenance of Campus Facilities The Public Safety conducts routine patrols of the facility to identify hazardous areas in need of repair. Referrals are promptly made to Facilities Management for attention. Public Safety officers routinely check the status of lighting both on and adjacent to campus and alert Peabody Facilities for any needed adjustments or repairs. Officers also check the operation of elevators on campus for proper operation. Public Safety maintains an on-call list for facilities personnel at the Public Safety dispatch desk. The Peabody Institute does not have any officially recognized student organizations that own or control off campus housing facilities and therefore does not monitor off campus criminal activity. Campus Safety Awareness Programs At the start of and throughout each school year, info- rmation is provided to students and staff concerning JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 62 Fire alarms will sound in the buildings if fire is detected or if a pull station is activated. Once an alarm is sounded or there is a determination that an evacuation is necessary, a Rave alert is sent via text message, email, and information displays informing of the danger and providing direction. There is also a bull horn in the Campus Security office that can be used to provide instruction during an evacuation. In the event of an emergency requiring an evacuation that is not triggered by a fire alarm, the Director of Public Safety, or in his/ her absence, the on-duty Public Safety Supervisor, will determine the need for an evacuation. Students or staff will be notified via a Rave alert and will be directed by Campus Security staff . In the event of an extended or long-term evacuation, the Director of Public Safety will notify Peabody's Incident Com-mander, who will activate Incident Command. All resident students are advi sed of fir e safety proce- dures via the Resi dence Hall and Pe abody Living Center Handbooks. I ncoming freshman, transfer, and grad uate students are also advi sed on fire safety and evac uation procedures during orie ntation. Students or staff can report fires or other emergency situations via phone by calling 911. Students and s taff may also call Public Safety at 667-208-6608 to report such emergencies. The Residence Hall and other buildings are e quipped with emergency call-down phones which ring directly to the security office. Information on fire safety will be availabl e on the revamped Peabody website and will be pro vided via email during the course of the academic year.

Individuals who are conc erned about someone who has not been missing for 24 h ours but has failed to return to his/her residenc e are encouraged to contac t the campus security office to rep ort the situtation. In addition to registering a general emergency contact, students residing in campus housing will be informed annually that each student has the option to identify one or more confidential missing person contacts. If designated, the missing person contact(s) will be notified by the University no later than 24 hours after the time the student is determined to be missing by either the designated campus official(s) authorized to make that determination or local law enforcement. This confidential information is accessible only to authorized campus officials who have the responsib- ility of notification as well as law enforcement officers in furtherance of a missing person investigation. In the case that the missing student is under the age of 18 and not emancipated, his or her custodial parent(s) or guardian(s) will be notified within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any additional contact person designated by the student. In all cases, local law enforcement will be notified within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing even if the student is above the age of 18, is an emancipated mino r, or has not provided a missing person contact, unless local law enforcement made the determination that the student was missing. The Uni- versity will provide the necessary information to assist in locating the missing student. If the circumstances related to a student's disappear- ance appear to be related to foul play, i.e., kidnapping or other criminal acts, then the appropriate notifica- tions and actions will be initiated immediately, even if the student has been missing for less than 24 hours.

Additional fi re alarm tests and drills occur as necessary. No fire drills were conducted in 2020. Smoke detectors have been installed in each student room for protection in case of fire. In addition to de- tectors, the Peabody Living Center has a fire sprinkler system. It is unlawful to tamper with this equipment or any other fire safety equipment. If a fi re occurs in a residential building, community members should immediately notify Public Safety office at 667-208-6608 or Baltimore City Fire Depart- ment at 911. If campus security is contacted, campus security will initiate a response, and contact the local fire department. If a member of the JHU community finds evidence of a fi re that has been extinguished, and the person is not sure whether campus security has already responded, the community member should immediately notify campus security to investigate and document the incident. Evacuation Procedures for Fire and Number of Mandatory Fire Drills Procedures Students and Employees Should Follow In Case of a Fire Your worst enemy duri ng a fi re is smoke. If you're sur- rounded by smoke, get down on the floor and crawl tosafety. Hold your breath and close your eyes if you can. Close doors behind you as you escape. Always use stairs to escape. Never use an elevator. Here are a few simple fire safety tips i n case of a fi re: Learn the location of fi re exits and alarm pull sta- tions near you and know the campus security and local agency emergency call number for assistance. Sound the fi re alarm if you see smoke or detect a burning odor. Have a prepared escape plan and know your escape route. Remember to remain calm. Use exit stairs. Never use elevators. Close doors behind you as you escape. In most cases, this will prevent smoke d amage and fi re from entering the room you are exiting. Do not re- enter a fi re-damaged building until it has been declared safe. If you become trapped, seal off cracks around doors and vents with cloth or rugs. (Soak them in water if possible.) Shut off fans and air conditioners. Signal for help from a window. If a campus phone is still operational or you have access to a cell phone, call Campus Security or local agency emer-gency services. Additionally, individuals should follow these procedures:If You See or Smell Fire: Remember the acronym RACE: R - Remove yourself from contact with smoke or fi re. A - Alarm - Pu ll the nearest fi re alarm. C - Call campus security from a safe location.E - Evacuate the building to a safe location. Do NOT use elevators. Procedures Students and Employees Should Follow in Case of EvacuationResidents are required by law and University policy to evacuate their residences immediate ly when the fi re alarm sounds. Procedures include: If y ou hear the fi re alarm sound, you must prepare to evacuate. Students found in the building duringan evacuation will be subject to disciplinary action. Feel your room door. If it is hot, stay in your room and signal for help from your window. Put a towelunder your door. If there are no fl ames or heavy smoke, close your room door behind you and walk quickly to thenearest exit.

Maintenance of Campus Facilities Public Safety participates in identifying and reporting facility hazards to the Facilities Department for mainte - nance and repair. The East B altimore Campus does not have any officially recognized student organizations that own or control off campus housing facilities a nd therefore does not monitor o ff campus criminal activity. Campus Safety Awareness Programs In 202 1, due to COVID-19 restrictions, Public Safety participated in 14 virtual presentations. Public Safety provided narrated Power Point presentations for new students, faculty, and staff. Public Safety personnel participate in all student and employee orientations and provide information about the services provided, to include, how the office communicates with students and employees during an emergency, how they can reach the office in an emergency, and how and when the o ffice may communicate with them in a non- emergency situation. Public Safety also presents basic crime prevention strategies during orientation to students and e mployees. In these programs, students and employees are encouraged to be aware of their surroundings at all times and to minimize personal distractions, i.e. on the phone. Public Safety attends student government meetings and staff meetings on an as-needed or as-requested basis and distributes general safety information emails at least twice a year. Crime Prevention and Security Presentations Public Safety conducts various security presentations for Johns Hopkins students, residents and employees on an annual basis. These presentations are custom- ized for the audience and provide educational and safety awareness resources. The frequency of programs is based upon an identified need of the requesting party, or on an annual basis such as student orientations. Student orientations consist of general safety guidelines, security escort services, and personal safety. Public Safety also participates at new employee orientations, which are conducted on a weekly basis. Educational programs are offered frequently through- out the year at venues such as Town Hall meetings, Career Fairs, Visitors Day and Summer Job Programs to include Active Shooter Responses and Security on Campus programs. Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures The East Baltimore Campus has a department of Emer- gency Management and Response and an Emergency Management Committee. The Emergency Operations Plan to include the Evacuation Plan comes under the authority of that office and committee. The committee Emergency Notifi cation for Guests at Johns Hopkins Hospital and East Baltimore Campus Non-affiliates who are visiting the Johns Hopkins Hosp- ital and the East Baltimore Cam pus now have the option to Opt In for RAVE noti fications.

If it is hot, stay in your room and signal for help from your window. Put a towelunder your door. If there are no fl ames or heavy smoke, close your room door behind you and walk quickly to thenearest exit. Remain a safe distance from the building until you are told b y the fi re department that you may go back inside. It is essential for each student to know what to do if and when an evacuation of a complex is necessary.

The campus-like setting employs about 7, 789 part-time and full-time staff members. APL provides a vast array of scientific energies in numerous disciplines for the U.S. Government, mainly the Depart- ment of the Navy. Designated as a \"Prime Contractor\" operating under the security cognizance of NAVSEA and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), APL is involved in many task assign- ments vital to national defense. In addition to defense research, APL maintains strong academic relationships with other divisions of JHU through joint programs, seminars, exchange of lecturers and fellow-ships. The Whiting School of Engineering in partnership with the Applied Physics Laboratory, off ers on-site Engineering for Professionals graduate classes to over 198 non-APL students. The following programs off er classes at the Applied Physics Laboratory: Applied Biomedical Engineering, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Applied Physics, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering Management, Information Systems Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Space Systems Engineering, Systems Engineering, and Technical Management. Reporting C rimes and Other Emergencies Crime and safety concerns may be repor ted to the Security Services Department by calling the emergency numbers 443-778-7575 or 911. Uniformed officers are accessible to any one wishing to report any incident during the Center's operating hours. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publi- cations and program reminders. Security of Campus Facilities The Kossiakoff Conference and Education Center is open and staff ed by an APL security officer during normal business hours and when classes or events are being held at the center. The APL Main campus can be accessed by authorized personnel 24 hours each day, seven days a week through Lobby One. The Security Services Department (\"SECD\") is tasked to ensure the safety of the st aff, to protect the APL facility and property and to instruct and assist staff members in preventing unauthorized disclosure of classified information to individuals who are not properly cleared or who do not Reporting CrimesSecurity Services Department Emergency/Non-Emergency: 443-778-7575On-Site Medical Services: 443-778-5592 Howard Department Emergency: 911 Non-Emergency: 410-313-2200 have a need-to-know. The latter is in accordance with National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (attachment to DD form 441). Whenever unusual security situ-a tions develop which vary from the written established g uidance, the SECD should be contacted. The SECD supervises and directs the physical and personnel securit y program at APL, promu lgates neces- sary written and verbal presentations to ensure proper safeguarding of classified information at APL and at field test sites and coordinates all visit requests. The Campus is patrolled by Security 24 hours/7days a week. The SECD is an integral part of APL's overall securityANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT83 program. In addition to their duties of loss prevention, the Security Group performs daily security inspections to ensure that c lassified material is properly safeguarded. The SECD is made up of 79 non-sworn officers who have jurisdiction on APL owned and controlled property and enforce APL policies. This force is supplemented by two armed off duty law enforcement officers. Reports of irregul arities and after-hours security infractions are submitted to the Security Office for corrective action. Although the SECD does not have arrest powers, it enjoys an excellent relationship with the Howard County Police Department (\"HCPD\") and in any serious or major criminal incident on the APL campus, the HCPD would be the primary investigative agency. The SECD would serve in a support role in assisting in the investigation. The APL does not have any officially-sanctioned off campus locations and therefore does not monitor off campus criminal activity. The Clery regulations are reviewed by the security managers and disseminated to the appropriate staff at APL. In emergency situations involving the limited amount of students attending classes at APL, several options to notify them are available. Personal notifi- cation by a SECD officer, phone contact directly to the affected classroom, as well as the public address sys- tem are used for ensuring information reaches the app- ropriate people. Other SECD responsibilities include: Liaison with Federal and local law enforcement agencies, including the HCPD, with whom an excellent relationship is maintained. Monitoring of all security surveillance equipment to include fi re, perimeter and classified area alarms, CCTV and access control systems. Enforcing parking regulations. Assisting motorists to start their cars when requested. Providing after-hours escort service to the parking lots. Providing Visitor Control functions for classified meetings. Escorting cleared as well as un-cleared personnel when required. Providing security and escort protection when classified material is in transit. Supervising property being hand-carried into or out of APL. Conducting security and safety inspections. Administeri ng basic fi rst aid and CPR as required after hours The SECD conducts an in-house review of all Depart- ments and Sectors to evaluate their respective security posture. These reviews occur throughout the year. Staff interviews are conducted during the reviews to gauge overall staff security awareness. A detailed fi nd- ings report noting all vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment is provided to APL management and mitigation actions for vulnerabilities must be reported. APL provides an anonymous Compliance Hotline for staff to report concerns regarding APL policy, contract obligations, or laws and regulations. The Compliance Hotline is managed by an independent organiza- tion and can be reached by calling 1-888-266-7593 or 1-888-COMPLY3. Maintenance of Campus Facilities The SECD conducts weekly inspections of the perimeter lighting and reports any deficiencies to APL's Facilities Maintenance and Operations Group for corrective action. Any structural or infrastructure deficiencies are also addressed by this group. Facilities Maintenance has a Service Call system that staff can utilize to report any issues. Campus Safety Awareness Programs The SECD is able to notify all students, staff and faculty who attend the Whiting School of Engineering of emer- gencies at the APL through the mass e-mail system. APL provides mandatory online security training each year to all st aff. In addition, the SECD issues quarterly Security Bulletins via e-mail, posts security reminders throughout the Laboratory, and maintains a website on APL's internal network. The SECD posts security awareness and updates on an as needed basis to the APL internal website. The SECD also maintains a website on APL's internal network. Crime Prevention and Security Presentations Eac h of the 12 APL Departments has a designated Department Security Representative (\"DSR\") who distributes security-related materials to their respective departments on as as-needed basis and who holds an annual security refresher for each department. The SECD holds a quarterly meeting with all DSRs to dis-84 cuss any relevant security changes. All APL staff are required to complete an annual Re-fresher Compliance and Security Training Course, which provides staff with reminders and updates concerning APL's compliance and security policies and procedures. Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures APL utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) struc- ture for emergency management. Laboratory-wide emergency response and evacuation procedures/poli- cies are posted in an online policy library where all st aff can access them. APL also has an Emergency home page on the internal internet where all emergency response procedures are listed for staff to access. Pr o- cedures include information on evacuations, reporting medical emergencies, active assailant procedures, shelter-in-place, and lockdowns. In an emergency situation, staff would contact an emergency line at the SECD security console. SECD staff would then notify 911 as appropriate. APL conducts annual fi re alarm and evacuation exercises which are unannounced. Tests are conducted by building. Over the course of 8 days in March 2021, an active assailant exercises was conducted in 45 buildings. These exercises were able to test both staff ability to respond to mass notifications and the Security Force's internal processes, procedures, and mass notification equipment preformance. Notifications: Emergency notifications will be made by the Everbridge Notification system, Alertus system, mass e-mail, APL website and the PA system. The Ever- bridge system sends notifications to cell phones, office phones and home phones. This system is tested weekly and periodic unannounced tests. The Alertus system which provides network notifications of emergency incidents to desktop and laptop computers and Cisco phones. The message must be acknowledged prior to using the system. There are annual tests of the PA syst- em are conducted on a monthly basis. Exterior emerg- ency notifications are made by the Eaton WAVES Mass Notification System with exterior speakers positioned throughout campus.

SAIS Europe occupies a five-story building (The Bologna Center, or \"Center\") on Via Andreatta 3, a suite of offices in Via Andreatta 7 (next door to the main building) which contains the Business and Technology Services (BaTS) as well as work and meeting space for visiting professors (the Adjunctory), and a suite of offices in Via Zanolini 15 (about 300 yards from the main building), which houses the Language Department. The Center's 5th floor penthouse has a terrace with a large conference room, four small conference rooms, and a dining and food preparation area. An auditorium and a snack bar are located on the 1st floor as is a library, which spans part of the 1st and 2nd floors. There are a total of 49 offices, 9 classrooms and a language lab. The Center is open to the general public during normal business hours on weekdays, and is closed on Saturday and Sunday. The Library, which is situated inside the Center facility, has the following operating hours for students: Mon - Thurs 8:30 AM to 11:00 PM 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM Friday Saturday Sunday 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM 10:00 AM to 10:00 PMlocation. Students occasionally visit faculty during office hour and engage in work study programs. Access to the building is gained through a gated front entrance, through a courtyard area to the front door of the building. Once inside there are stairs leading to the language department lobby door. The gate entrance and front door are opened by a buzzer control from inside each of the offices. These entrances are moni- tored by a CCTV enabling the staff member opening the gate and front door to see who is being granted access. The 3rd floor lobby door (which is kept locked) needs to be physically opened by a staff member. The building's elevator is restricted from stopping at the 3rd floor (staff members have a key to allow the elev- ator to the 3rd floor when needed). Fire exits are clearly marked as well as a host of other precautions for the safety of staff and students. Both of the above locations are surveilled by private security outside of office hours, and a security guard Approximately 185 students attend classes per academic year representing up to 40 countries. Each year, about 50 percent are from the United States. Of these students, several Arts & Sciences undergradu- ate students are enrolled in the \"Junior Year Abroad\" program at SAIS Europe. This is a commuter campus and housing is the responsibility of the students, who generally rent apartments in the area. SAIS Europe does not have any officially-sanctioned noncampus locations, including those with student organizations with noncampus housing facilities, and therefore does not monitor off campus criminal activity. SAIS Europe is headed by a Director and operates un- der the same policies and guidelines as SAIS in Wash- ington, D.C., to the extent that Italian law and business practice allows. noncampus locations, including those with student organizations with noncampus housing facilities, The Center is open to the general public during normalBaTS and the Adjunctory are located on the ground floor of a residential building just to the left of the main building. Students arrive there by exiting the main building, turning right and walking about 40 yards, then another right into the Andreatta 07 courtyard. BaTS is the first door on the right, the Adjunctory on the left. The areas in and around this location are covered by centrally controlled CCTV cameras and access is only allowed with JHU badges. The SAIS Language Faculty (consisting of seven offices) is on the 3rd floor of an office building appro- ximately two blocks from the main Center. It is not open to the public and no classes are held in thisANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT93 Reporting Crimes and Other Emergencies Crime may be reported to State Police by calling the emergency number 112. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publications and pro-gram reminders. Security and Access of F acilities SAIS Europe maintains excellent rapport with the local authorities with an open line of communication and a histor y of eff ective and fruitful collaboration. They have agreed to provide additional security in the event of political turmoil or times of anti-American sentiment. Due to the relative nonexistence of serious crime on the campus, the administration has not had to avail them- selves significantly of the local police services. Petty crimes are reported to the authorities by telephone, fax or in person and all appropriate repor ts are compiled either at the Bologna Center or at the local police head-informed of all relevant details through the Director of Finance and Administration, who is responsible for the security of SAIS Europe facilities. Should a student at SAIS Europe require or feel a need for coun-seling, they have access to a local, English-speaking, licensed psychologist. After being open to the public for almost 50 years, SAIS Europe has taken a number of steps to restrict access to the facility and to increase perimeter surveil- lance. While there have been no specific threats against SAIS Europe, the administration recognizes that as one of the few U.S. activities in the area, SAIS Europe must increase its awareness and tighten its security, at least for the time being. Therefore, additional security cameras (with 24-hour recording) have been added to cov er a greater area of the building perimeter, and split-screen monitors have been installed at the front desk, in the Library, at the Snack Bar, and in the Custo- dian's apartment. In addition, a proximity card reader system has been installed at a number of key entryways throughout the building, and students and staff have been issued programmable access cards. Members of the general public must ring a doorbell and identify themselves to the video camera before they are granted access. Guests with business on the upper floors of the facility who do not have JHU or University of Bologna ID must register at the front desk and are issued a temporary visitor ID. A private securit y firm has been engaged to cover the front desk in the evenings. Signif- icant landscaping work has been done in the front of the building to create a more open space with less area for loitering or hiding. Blast proof laminate has been applied to front windows to increase the safety of those inside the building. Given the nature of the SAIS Europe program, with a relatively tight geographic concentration of its stu- dents and limited dispersion (all students live within walking or biking distance of the Center), emergencies are usually handled on a personal basis. For immedi- ate notification purposes during an emergency when it is necessary to communicate with the entire class/ building occupants, email is used as well as a broadcast text messaging system. Additionally, the Center was completely renovated in 2006/2007, and currently meets all Europe-wide mandated safety and disability access requirements. quarters. A closed-circuit television and a receptionist whose office faces the front door monitors the front entranceway. In the event of any abnormal activity or entry of unauthorized persons, the receptionist alerts management. During non-business hours, the Center is patrolled by a private security agency. The security officers are non-sworn and does not have any arrest powers. A custodial staff member resides in the buil- ding a nd is present during the day and most evenings. When the library remains open past normal business hours, the staff locks up upon leaving. In the event of criminal activity, faculty, staff and students would be JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 94 This includes clear marki ng of fi re exits, extinguishers, seismic compliance, and a host of other precautions for the safety of staff and students. All side exit doors have panic bars so that it is easy to exit during an emer- gency. In SAIS Europe's crisis response pl an, specific personnel have been designated to assist with evac- uation to ensure that everyone is evacuated from the premises. A specific area outside the complex has been designated as a meeting place for evacuees. Maintenance of SAIS Europe Facilities SAIS Europe is required by Italian and European Com- munity law to have in place a formal safety infrastruc- ture, which includes nominating management and labor safety representatives. This legally mandated process includes extensive staff training on fire safety, evacuation, first responder, and other emergency treat- ments, as well as the installation and upkeep of alarms, evacuation signage, fire and flood equipment, and other i nfrastructure throughout our facility. SAIS Europe's i nsurance underwriter also inspects SAIS Europe's facil-i ties periodically to ensure that the highest standards of s afety are met. Finally, the Center's Facilities Mainte-n ance coordinator lives in the building, and works with s ubcontractors and maintenance consultants to ensure t hat the campus facilities are safe and comfortable for s tudents, faculty and staff, and that they comply with all a pplicable regulations. Safety Awareness Programs During Orientation, students are provided with Student Welcome Packets; these packets include an \"Evacuation Flyer\" that includes maps, lists evacuation instructions, and provides students with contact information for police as well as local and internal emergency numbers. Crime Prevention and Security Presentations As part of Orientation, all students receive a Power-Point presentation on safety and security both via email and through an in-person discussion. Students receive the same PowerPoint a month later in advance of the \"Opening Ceremony\" and are again presented with a short speech concerning safety and security. Students receive the presentation once again at the beginning of the spring semester and are encouraged to refresh their understanding of the steps they can take towards safety and security. All crime prevention and security awareness programs encourage students and employees to be responsible for their own security. Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures At the beginning of each academic year, SAIS provides all Bologna campus students with a flier containing Center evacuation procedures and contact information. They also receive both an email and a briefing at orientation that reinforces the safety procedures, as well a s an indication that the Administration will conduct at l east one unannounced \"fi re drill\" per year. SAIS Europe i s required by Italian law to evaluate and document t he unannounced evacuation test (s); documentation i s prepared by the SAIS Safety Committee and provid-e d to SAIS Europe's safety consultant, but is not mad e publically available. In addition, the campus is required t o provide a document, \"Documento Valutazione Rischi\" (DVR), that catalogues all possible health and safety risks to its employees and students, the creation and updating of which is managed by a legally mandated c ommittee composed of an employer safety representa -tive, a labor union safety representative, and a medical d octor (its structure is primarily aimed at worker and s tudent occupational safety, not criminal secur ity).ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT95 SAIS Europe, Bologna, Italy Clery Crime Statistics (By O & Year) Rape Fondling IncestStatutory Rape RobberyMurder & Non-negligent Manslaughter Manslaughter by Negligence 2019 Aggravated Assault Burglary 2019 Motor Vehicle T heftArson 2019 Domestic Violence Dating Violence StalkingLiquor Law Violations 2019 Drug Law Violations Weapons Law ViolationsLiquor Law ViolationsDrug Law ViolationsWeapons Law Violations2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0On-Campus Public Property Total Crimes Reported On-Campus Public Property Total Crimes ReportedReferrals for Disciplinary Action Arrests Domestic Violence / Dating Violence / Stalking2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 02021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 0 0 02021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 2021 0 0 0 2020 0 0 0 2019 0 0 0 Additional information may be obtained from: Director of Finance & Administration, SAIS Europe, via Belmeloro 11, 40126 Bologna, Italy, +39 051-2917811 SAIS Europe is a commuter campus with no residence halls, dormitories or non-campus buildings or property. 2019 and 2021 crime statistics were provided by the Bologna, Italy Police Department.JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 96 Information about Registered Sex Offenders In Bologna, Italy , sex off ender registries are not known to exist.

The street address of the Center is 162 Shang-h ai Road, Gulou District, Nanjing 210008. The Center offers two full-time residential graduate-level programs: a Master of Arts in International Studies and a graduate c ertificate in Chinese and American Studies. Established in 1986, the Center is jointly managed by American and Chinese co-directors who are hired by, and represent, their respective parent institutions. The Center faculty consists of 8 non-Chinese pro- fessors hired by JHU, and up to 30 Chinese professors hired by Nanjing University. The Center's administ- rative staff comprises four Americans and nine Chinese citizens. Library, housekeeping, physical plant, maintenance, and cafeteria personnel total 50, all Chinese nationals. Janitorial and physical security services are provided by a building management company that employs 24 personnel on site. The Center facility consists of approximately 200, 000 square feet of floor space in two connected U-shaped buildings (a newer, 10-story \"East\" building and an older, five-story \"West\" building) comprising an interior courtyard, a 100-room student dormitory, five floors of faculty, staff, and guest apartments (34 apartments in total), a cafeteria, a library, two auditoriums, five class- rooms, five conference rooms, 30 faculty offices, nine administration offices, an underground parking garage, four rooftop terraces, two laundry rooms, a student lounge, a recreation center (billiards, ping pong, and music rooms), a fitness room, a student computer room, and an outdoor basketball court. The Center is situated in a Nanjing University com- pound at the northwest corner of the Nanjing Univer- sity's Gulou campus. It shares roughly one city block with three other Nanjing University entities: the Foreign Students Department (two buildings), the Sciences Laboratories (one building), and the School of Business (one buildin g). The compound is bordered on all four sides by Nanjing city streets and is separated from them by walls and fences. The Center does not have any officially-sanctioned off campus locations. There are two main entrances into the Nanjing Universi- ty compound: one entrance primarily for vehicles, and one entrance primarily for pedestrians. The vehicle entrance is manned around the clock and provides electronic gated ve- hicle access to surface and underground parking. Pedestri- an and bicycle traffic can also enter the compound through pedestrian lanes at this gate. The primary pedestrian entrance is not guarded and is open to pedestrians around the clock. Although it is closed to normal vehicle traffic , it is designed to provide emergency vehicle access to the compound when necessary. Reporting Crimes and Other Emergencies Crime may be reported to Nanjing Public Security Bureau by calling the emergency numbers 110. Uniformed offic- ers are accessible to anyone wishing to report any incident. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publications and program reminders. Center La w Enforcement The Center employs a 14 security guard force around the clock, with at least three security officers on duty at all times. The security officers primar y mission is to control access, as w ell as making hourly i nspection rounds of the entire facility, interior and exterior. The security office also have fi re suppression and evacuation responsibilities in the event of a fi re on the premises. The security guards are hired and trained by a building management company under contract to the Center. The security officers are certified to have undergone basic JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 98 training by the Nanjing municipal police, but they are not armed and are not qualified to interdict armed or violent i ntruders. The Center relies on the Nanjing University security officers as first responder for the investigation of break- ins or damage to Center property, or for routine situat- ions involving Center participants and the surrounding community. The security office hotline number is 86- 25-8359-5110. The Nanjing University security office is staff ed by security professionals who have detention authority and are capable of conducting limited inves- tigations on campus, but they are not armed. Campus security does not have the authority to conduct criminal investigations or arrest anyone. They can detain indi-viduals until police arrive. Chinese campuses are closed compounds, and campus security mans access points, conducts fi re and public safety patrols throughout cam- pus, and enforces university policies. In the event of a violent crime on or near campus in- volving students, faculty, or staff of the Center, the Nan - jing University security office and the Nanjing munici- pal police would be contacted immediately. The Nanj- ing University security incident hotline is 8359-5110; the Nanjing municipal police crime incident hotline is 110 . Within the municipal police department, the Foreign Affairs (\"FA\") Office is responsible for handling incid- ents involving foreigners. The FA office is subdivided along city district lines, with a specific FA officer assigned to cover each district. In cases involving international Center personnel, the municipal police F A office would be brought in as soon as the involvement of a foreigner was confirmed. The Center maintains excellent rapport with the local authorities and has a long history of effective collaboration with the police off- icial responsible for foreigners in our district. The Gulou District, in which the Center is situated, is also home to three other major universities with large foreign student populations: Nanjing Normal Univ ersity, Southeast University, and Hohai University. Giv en the large concentration of foreign students in their district , the Gulou District municipal police are extremely sensi- tive to political or social circumstances that might pose a threat to the safety of the foreigners in their charge. In times of high tension in the relations between the Unit- ed States and China, the municipal police have taken t he initiative to increase the security of the Center. After the missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and again after the collision of a U.S. navy aircraft and a Chinese Air Force jet, the municipal police consulted with the joint leadership of the Center to plan for the protection of Center facilities and personnel in the event of violent protests against perceived American assets i n China. Break-ins, thefts, vandalism, or other serious crimes are reported by telephone to the Nanjing University secu- rity office and simultaneously to the Center administra- tion (Deputy Director for Administration and the Ameri- can Deputy Director); the nature of the case determines whether the municipal police will become involved. Official records of criminal incidents are held by the Nanjing University security office or the municipal police. Official police records are not available to the Center. Security and Access of Center Facilities All external doors are fitted with electronic locks to control access to the Center. Center students, faculty, st aff, and registered residents are issued key cards for all entrances. At the Shanghai Road entrance to the compound, an external gate with an electronic lock is manned around the clock by security officers who screen guests who wish to enter the Center. Pedestrians using this gate cross a small external courtyard and enter the building through the West Lobby entrance (ground floor), where a reception desk is staffed by reception staff personnel during normal business hours. The receptionist at this desk is trained to greet and direct non-Center individuals who enter the lobby via the west entrance. The West Lobby ground floor entrance, as well as entrances to the lobby from the interior courtyard, are equipped with electronic locks that require key cards for access during hours of darkness. Access through the East Lobby main entrance is controlled by electronic key card and by reception desk pers onnel. The East Lobby reception desk is staffed by reception office personnel or a security office during business hours. The reception desk st aff controls the doors for non-Center individuals who have business in the building during business hours. A fter 10:00 PM, non-Center individuals may enter the Center only with the assistance of Center residents or security guards, ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT99 through the manned gate at the West Lobby entrance. Non-resident guests are required to leave the Center no later than midnight. No unregistered guests are allowed in the Center between the hours of midnight and 8:00 AM daily. Video Surveillance System The Center has a CCTV monitoring and recording system composed of 12 infrared-assisted color video cameras that allow for the surveillance of high-priori-ty common areas, including the underground garage, the garage-level stairwell exits, basketball court, and approaches to the Center within the Nanjing University compound. An additional surveillance camera is situ-ated to record unauthorized exits through the library's emergency exit when that door's theft alarm is triggered. Intrusion Detection System An infrared intrusion detection system is installed on the outside walls of the West building. The old- er West building has ground-level windows that are designed to be opened to provide ventilation to dormi- tory rooms, faculty offices, recreation rooms, and the fitness and laundry rooms. Eight sets of window-level infrared-beam sensors are activated at dusk to warn the Center security guards of activit y in these areas duri ng the night. The newer East building has no ground-level windows that can be opened. Interior motion detectors are located in the West building at entrances that are not covered by the exterior infrared sensors, and in the East building at all external door locations. Maintenance of Center Facilities The Center routinely cleans and repairs surveillance cameras and infrared sensors, and notifies Nanjing University when university lights in the area need to be replaced or repaired. The Center also routinely checks to ensure that the wall and fence along Beijing West Road and Shanghai Road are in good condition and secure. Students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to notify the maintenance staff if they notice that security lighting (in-cluding stairwell and fi re exit lights) or electronic locks in any area are broken or malfunctioning. Center Safety Awareness Programs The General Handbook issued at the beginning of the orientation week contains a section that describes the Center's security procedures and gives basic guidance about safety and security in the Center.Crime Prevention and Securit y Presentations The Nanjing Public Security Bureau gave a safety presentation to Center program participants on March 9, 2021. Move-in was delayed due to a large Covid outbreak in China, the administration gave an in-person personal safety and fire safety presentation on November 9, 2021. The presentation covers personal safety issues and risky behaviors (pickpocketing, night-clubbing, etc.) as well as security procedures like locking doors and se curing personal property. The presentation also includes advice about how to avoid unsafe situations and explains what a student should do if he or she is the victim of a crime. Periodically throughout the year the administrati on issues reminders about travel safety and physical security as well, particularly during holiday periods. Emergency Response and Prevention Procedures Instructions for student, faculty, and staff responses to security incidents and fi res are included in the General Handbook. In the event of a Center-wide emergency, the fire al arm public address system can be used to dissemi- nate information and instructions in all areas of the Cen- ter, including the dormitories. In an emergency other than fi re, the decision to use the public address system would be made jointly by the Chinese and American co- directors or their representatives. To notify the com- munity about an ongoing emergency, a message will be sent to the community via email and using the moble messaging platform WeChat. Once an emergency has been identified, designated administrators will compose a message in English and Chinese and disseminate the message to contacts pre-sorted as current HNC students. A fire emergency evacuation drill was conducted on January 18, 2021, announced, March 9, 2021, unannounced, and November 9, 2021, announced. Because the Center is a self-contained academic and residential compound with administrative office and residential facilities in immediate proximity, all inci- dents during business hours will immediately involve administration leadershi p and buildi ng security person- nel. During non-business hours, American administra- tion leaders are resident in the facility, and the imme- diate reporting chain between security personnel and administration leadership is maintained. The primary after-hours emergency contact is the Deputy American Co-Director, but all four resident American staff members a re on-call for emergencies 24 hours a day.JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 100 Missing Student Procedures If an individual has reason to believe that a residential student has been missing for 24 hours, they should immediately report the situation to American Co-Direc-tor at 86.25.8359.2436 for the Hopkins-Nanjing Center. Individuals who are concerned about someone who has not been missing for 24 hours but has failed to return to his/her residence are encouraged to contact the Ameri-can Co-Director to report the situation. In addition to registering a general emergency contact, students residing in campus housing will be informed annually that each student has the option to identify one or more confidential missing person contacts. If des- ignated, the missing person contact(s) will be notified by the Univ ersit y no later than 24 hours after the time the student is determined to be missing by either the designated campus offici al(s) authorized to make that determination or local law enforcement. This confiden- tial information is accessible only to authorized campus officials who have the responsibility of notification as well as law enforcement officers in furtherance of a missing person investigation. In the case that the missing student is under the age of 18 and not emancipated, his or her custodial parent(s) or guardian(s) will be notified within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any additional contact person designated by the student. In all cases, local law enforcement will be notified within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing even if the student is abov e the age of 18, is an emancipated mi nor, or has not provided a missing person contact, unless local law enforcement made the determination that the student was missing. The Uni- versity will provide the necessary information to assist in locating the missi ng student. If the circumstances related to a student's disappear- ance appear to be related to foul play, i.e., kidnapping or other criminal acts, then the appropriate notification and actions will be initiated immediately, even if the student has been missing for less than 24 hours.

It is unlawful to tamper with this equipment or any other fi re safety equipment. If a fi re occurs in a residential building, community members should immediately notify their local campus security offic e or the local agency emergency services (see contact information on page 3). If campus security is contacted, campus security will initiate a response, and contact the local fire department. If a member of the JHU community finds evidence of a fire that has been extinguished, and the person is not sure whether campus security has already responded , the community member should i mmediately notify campus security to investigate and document the incident . Evacuation Procedures for Fire and Number of Mandatory Fire DrillsProcedures Students and Employees Should Follow In Case of a Fire Your worst enemy during a fi re is smoke. If you're sur- rounded by smoke, get down on the floor and crawl to safety. Hold your breath and close your eyes if you can. Close doors behind you as you escape. Always use stairs to escape. Here are a few simple fi re safety tips in case of a fire: Learn the location of fi re exits and alarm pull sta- tions near you and know the campus security and local agency emergency call number for assistance. Sound the fi re alarm if you see smoke or detect a burning odor. Have a prepared escape plan and know your escape route. Remember to remain calm. Use exit stairs. Never use elevators. Close doors behind you as you escape. In most cases, this will prevent smoke damage and fi re from entering the room you are exiting. Do not re-enter a fi re-damaged building until it has been declared safe. If you become trapped, seal off cracks around doors and vents with cloth or rugs. (Soak them in water if possible.) Shut off fans and air conditioners. Signal for help from a window. If a campus phone is still operational or you have access to a cell phone, call local Campus Security or local agency emergen-cy services. Additionally, individuals should follow these procedures: If You See or Smell Fire: Remember the acronym RACE:R - Remove yourself from contact with smoke or fi re. A - Alarm - Pull the nearest fi re alarm. C - Call campus security from a safe location. E - Evacuate the building to a safe location. Do NOT use elevators. Procedures Students and Employees Should Follow in Case of EvacuationResidents are required by law and University policy to evacuate their residences immediately when the fi re alarm sounds. Procedures include: If you hear the fi re alarm sound, you must prepare to evacuate. Students found in the building during an evacuation will be subject to disciplinary action. Feel your room door. If it is hot, stay in your room and signal for help from your window. Put a towel under your door. If there are no fl ames or heavy smoke, close your room door behind you and walk quickly to the nearest exit.

In addition, fire safety orientation is provided to all residents by the Nanjing Fire Department during the first-week orientation sessions, and fire drills are con-ducted once each semester. Smoke detectors have been installed in each student room to alert residents in case of fire. ANNUAL SECURITY & FIRE SAFETY REPORT 103 Remain a safe distance from the building until you are told by a member of the administration that you may go back inside. It is essential for each student to know what to do if and when an evacuation of a complex is necessary; a minimum of one fi re evacuation drill is conducted each semester and is mandatory for students. University Organizations that should be Informed of Fire The University is required to annually disclose statis-tical data on all fi res that occur in on-campus student housing facilities. Listed below are non-emergency numbers to call to report fi res that have already been extinguished. When calling, please provide as much information as possible about the location, date, time, and cause of the fi re. Hopkins-Nanjing Center: Campus Security Authority - 86.25.8359.2436 The University's Policies on Portable Electrical Appliances, Smoking, and Open FlamesAt the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, the following portable electrical appliances and other sources of open fl ames are not permitted within the facility: halogen lamps of any type space heaters multiple-outlet extension cords without self-con- tained circuit breaker incandescent bulbs in lamps with plastic covers cooking appliances refrigeratorsfireworks candles or incense Smoking is prohibited in University housing. Specifi- cally, smoking is prohibited inside University housing buildings, including but not limited to, student rooms, suites, lounges, bathrooms, common areas, stairwells, lobbies and elevators. Residents who smoke must do so outside of the build- ing and must be far enough away from the building that smoke will not filter into the building via exterior doors, windows or the building ventilation systems. Full cooperation with these policies is expected. Any vi - olation of these policies will result in disciplinary action. Fire Safety Education and Training Students, faculty, and staff are provided education on fire safety and information on how to report a fi re, or ev- idence of a fi re, to whom, and procedures to be followed for non-residential buildings on campus when a fi re alarm signals. Each building has fi re evacuation plans posted in com- mon areas. All students and employees are encouraged to become familiar with the escape routes for all build-ings and floors and the locations of fi re extinguishers, hoses and alarms. In the event of a fi re or evacuation, every student and employee should follow the fi re safety evacuation route and vacate the premises until the offi-cials in charge declare the premises safe to enter. Exits and areas around fi re extinguishers must be kept clear at all times. Periodic fi re safety inspections and drills are held to test equipment and procedures. Any Plans for Improving Fire Safety JHU continues to monitor its life safety systems. There are no future improvements currently planned. Training and fi re safety information is reviewed on an annual basis.

The campus comprises more than 15 buildings located on 140 acres. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine owns the Asthma and Allergy Center and frequently conducts educational seminars in several meeting rooms on the campus. There are approximately 1,150 Johns Hopkins University Faculty and staff on the Bayview campus and approximately 240 students that rotate through the cam-pus during the year. Reporting Crimes and Other Emergencies The Johns Hopkins Public Safety (\"Public Safety\") and/or local emergency services, including Baltimore Police Department (\"BPD\"), fire or ambulance, can be requested via the Security Communication Center by calling 410-550-0333 or 0-0333 using any of the in-house phones. Uniformed officers maintain highly visible posts and are accessible to anyone wishing to report any incident. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publications and program reminders. Campus Law Enforcement Johns Hopkins Public Safety, a staff of over 100 uniform- ed (unarmed) officers providing interior, exterior, and mobile patrols, operates on a 24-hour basis to assist and respond to emergency or security related incidents. Public Safety enforces corporate policy and assists law enforcement in the enforcement of local and state criminal laws for Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Hospital and all entities of the Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation. The security officers have jurisdiction to operate on JHU owned and controlled property and have authority to enforce University policy. Strategically placed electronic surveillance equipment and a radio communications center support Public Safety's response to security incidents. This system increases the ability of security personnel to pinpoint areas of concern. Public Safety officers may be summoned via any number of in-house phones by calling 410-550-0333. The 410-550-0333 number may also be used to summon local police or emergency services through the central SecurityCommunications Center. Public Safety documents and departmental publications prominently display this information. Public Safety maintains the website https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/security_ parking_transportation and provides daily publication of crimes known to have occurred on campus, in the residential hall and in JHU owned buildings, as well as on public property contiguous to the campus. A daily crime log is available for review during normal business hours at the security administrative office located in the ASC building. Public Safety works in close concert with the BPD concerning the apprehension of criminal offenders, investigations, crime awareness programs and crime prevention programs. A close working relation- ship is maintained with the BPD and in any criminal incident on the Bayview Medical Center campus, the BPD would be the investigative agency as they have pri- mary jurisdiction. Public Safety would serve in a support role in assisting in the investigation. Public Safety does not have a written memorandum of understanding pertaining to the investigation of criminal incidents with BPD or any law enforcement agency. The Bayview Medical Center does not have any official- ly-sanctioned off campus locations and therefore does not monitor off campus criminal activity. Security and Access of Campus Facilities Most campus buildings remain open 24 hours a day. Students, facu lty and staff may gain access to restricted areas, e.g. laboratories or libraries, by key or access card, depending on the location and their approved access. All areas are patrolled by security officers in addition to security officers assigned to specific access locations. All unusual or suspicious activities or persons are investi- gated and appropriate action is t aken, when necessary.

The Prosegur officers have the authority to detain individuals until the police arrive. In the event of criminal activity, faculty, staff and stu- dents would be informed of all relevant details through the Director of the UPF Ciutadella Campus. Should a student at the Center require or feel a need for coun-seling, they have access to a local, English-speaking, licensed psychologist. Security Considerations U sed in the Maintena nce of Campus Facilities UPF maintains campus facilities in a manner that mi n- imizes hazardous and unsafe conditions. Parking lots and pathways are illuminated with lighting. There are security cameras and alarms in the entrance of the building, which are controlled in the Alarms Center Reception by security personnel. Security w orks closely with Facilities Management to address b urned out lights promptly as well as malfunctioning door locks or other physical conditions that enhance security. Other members of the University community are helpful when they report equipment problems to Security or to Facilities Management. Center Safety Awareness Programs During Orientation, students are provided with inform- ation in the Welcome to UPF pa cket; these packets provide students with contact information for police as well as local and internal emer gency numbers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no events held on the UPF Ciutadella campus in 20 21 which involved JHU students. All students are given an introduction to cam- pus safety on arrival, including information about pro- tecting valuables, fire emergencies, and emergency contact numbers. Also, the Mobility Office invites the local police to come and speak to interna tional stu- dents about safety in Barcelona and on campus at the The Johns Hopkins University Public Policy Center, Barcelona, Spain Backgrou nd The Johns Hopkins University Public Policy Center, established in Spring 2013, builds upon a long stand- ing collaborative re lationship between the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (\"UPF\"). The Center resides within the Univer- si tat Pompeu Fabra Ciutadella campus in Barcelona, the capital city of Catalonia, Spain. The Center occupies the fourth floor of the Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda Building. There are 10 offices on the floor and classrooms used during the Hopkins Fall Institute vary according to need. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health runs the Fall Institute in Health Policy and Manage ment out of the Center. The Fall Institute is sponso red by The Agencia De Salut Publica de Barcelona (the Public Health Agency of Barcelona) and attracts public health profess- ionals and students from around the globe to participate in the of f erings by faculty from the Johns Hopkins University and the Public Health Agency of Barcelona. The Center is open to the general public during the hours of 8:00 AM to 1:00 AM on weekdays, 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM on Saturdays and is closed Sunday. The Universitat Pompeu Fabra maintains the website https:// www.upf.edu/web/campus/campus-ciutadella Reporting Crimes and Other Emergencies Crime may be reported to local Police by calling the emergency number 112. The prompt reporting of crime is encouraged through various publications and pro - gram reminders. Security and Access of Center Facilities The campus is open to the public. The UPF security is managed by the private company, Prosegur. They are located in the concierge of the building, Jaume 1 Building, Ramon Triaz Fargas, 25-27. There are three security guards on campus 24 hours a day; all year round Prosegur officers have the authority to enforce State and Local laws and Uni-v ersity policies. There are no written agreements or memorandums of understanding regarding any topics, including the investigation of criminal incidents, between JHU and the local police department.

All crime prevention and security awareness programs encourage students and employees to be responsible for their own security and the security of others. Participants in these programs are asked to be alert, security-conscious and involved and advised to contact the UPF reception to report suspicious behavior. For additional questions regarding crime prevention, contact the UPF reception directly at 34-93-542-1701. Emergency Re sponse a nd Prevention Procedures The UPF has a Self-Protection Plan with which stu- dents, st aff and faculty shou ld familiarize themselves. It includes basic information about programs aimed at ensuring that buildings are properly evacuated and fire-fighting appliances are used appropriately. In all Univ ersity buildings panels can be located on the walls with instructions which will help students and st aff to evacuate the buildings i n case of emergenc y. The plan also includes UPF plans for emergencies that may occur as a result of its activities and the response measures i n situations of risk, catastrophes, and public disasters that may aff ect the campus community. In the case of a fi re or accident, the Ciutade lla reception should be called at 1701, or from an outside phone. What to do in case of evacuation from a building: 1. Follow the marked evacuation route. 2. When you leave the building, avoid obstructing emergency exits. 3. Go to the designated meeting point and wait there for further instructions. Current legislation requires that administrative and service staff as well as teaching and research staff at the C enter must be aware of the prevention system and the risk prevention procedures in the various workplaces. With this in mind, UPF started the campaign, \"Preven- tion is everybody's responsibility.\" Among other initia- tives, each month staff and faculty will receive a short email containing the essential information they need to have about each specific topic in this area, which can be consulted in more depth on the Technical Office for Occupational Hazards Prevention website. Due to the pandemic, no fire drill was scheduled in 2021.
