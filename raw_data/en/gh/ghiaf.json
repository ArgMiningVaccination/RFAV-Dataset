radiosurgery Social Research SubcommitteeX ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Glossary of technical terms Access Improvement ProgramA major change program initiated in early 2005 aimed at redesigning the way we provide health services by focusing on patient journeys through our health system. Acute careAn episode of acute care for an admitted patient is one in which the principal clinical intent is to provide short-term hospital admission focused on the treatment of emergency conditions or the conduct of an elective procedure. Ambulatory careCare provided in a non-inpatient setting such as outpatients, home-based care, office-based care or community health centre-based care. BenchmarkingThe process of assessing the performance of an organisation of entity within an organisation by comparing it to the performance of a similar entity, a national average, or the best performing entity within the same field in order to assess performance and determine opportunities for improvement. Community-based organisationsNot-for-profit organisations within the community that have specialist skills in the management of certain health issues. These organisations provide services such as health services for disadvantaged young people, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services and supported accommodation for people with mental illness. Cost weightA cost weight is a form of measurement for the use of health services that provides an indication of the relative resource use. It provides an indication as to the complexity of an admission or an occasion of service. Decant To rehouse people while their buildings are being refurbished or rebuilt. Hepatitis CHepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C is a viral form that is transferred by blood-to-blood contact. Length of stayThe number of days (or part thereof) that each admitted patient stays in hospital. Patients who are admitted and discharged on the same day have a length of stay of one day. Patient-centred careRefocusing the delivery of health care around the needs of the patient rather than other stakeholders such as providers. Patient journeyA patient's experience of travelling or moving through the health system at pre -hospital to hospital and to community care. Primary healthcare servicePrimary healthcare services are those which focus on first contact health services provided predominantly by GPs, but also by practice nurses, primary/ community health care nurses, early childhood nurses and community pharmacists, allied health professionals and other health workers such as multicultural health workers and Indigenous health workers, health education/ promotion and community development workers. Public health officersPublic health officers provide a range of services to the community, including communicable disease control, pharmaceutical services, environmental health and scientific services, and have certain powers enshrined in legislation. Occasion of serviceA measure of services provided to patients\u2014usually used in the outpatient or community health setting. Sub-acuteIntermediate care provided between acute care and community-based care. Sub-acute care includes services such as rehabilitation that can be provided in a less invasive environment than an acute hospital environment. Tertiary servicesTertiary services are generally those provided in a complex, highly specialised hospital environment.

Our values are: Care Excellence Collaboration Integrity. Our vision, and these values developed by ACT Health staff, represent what we believe is important and worthwhile. Our values underpin the way we work and how we treat others. The ACT Health Directorate Corporate Plan 2012-17 guides ACT Health business units in achieving the overarching organisational vision in line with its corporate values. The plan builds on existing and new plans under development, while providing an organisational framework against which to prioritise our efforts over the next five years. We aim to deliver better service to our government to meet the needs of community, and to our community on behalf of our government. Objectives The ACT Health Directorate Corporate Plan 2012-17 has four key areas of focus, which inform all business plans and performance agreements within the organisation. ACT Health partners with the community and consumers for better health outcomes by: delivering patient and family centred care strengthening partnerships promoting good health and wellbeing improving access to appropriate healthcare, and having robust safety and quality systems. We aim for sustainability and improved efficiency in the use of resources, by designing sustainable services to deliver outcomes efficiently, and embedding a culture of research and innovation. ACT Health continues to strengthen clinical governance of its processes, and strives to be accountable to both the government and the community. ACT Health aims to support our people and strengthen teams, by helping staff to reach their potential; promoting a learning culture and providing high-level leadership.Section A Performance and financial reporting 7 Organisational structure The organisational chart on pages 2 and 3 provides an overview of the structure of the Health Directorate on 30 June 2013. ACT Health's Director-General guides the organisation in delivering its vision. ACT Health's two major divisions are led by Deputy Directors-General who report to the Director-General. Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CH&HS) employs the majority of staff working within the Health Directorate, and provides acute, sub-acute, primary and community-based health services to the population of the ACT and surrounding region. The Little Company of Mary also provides public hospital services through Calvary Public Hospital under a contractual agreement with ACT Health. Strategy and Corporate employs a smaller number of staff who provide infrastructure, policy guidance, funding and strategic planning support to clinical service areas, while planning for ACT Health's future workforce and health service needs. Other operational areas also report directly to the Director-General and provide a range of corporate support and organisation-wide services, such as quality and safety oversight and sound financial management. ACT Health's Population Health Division provides a range of public and environmental health services, health protection and health promotion services, under the guidance of the ACT Chief Health Officer. ACT Health, other agencies and external stakeholders ACT Health works closely with other ACT Government agencies such as the ACT Government's Community Services Directorate, Justice and Community Safety Directorate, Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate, and emergency services providers such as the ACT Ambulance Service and the Australian Federal Police. Formalised consultative arrangements exist with a range of agencies, such as the Health Care Consumers' Association (ACT), ACT Medicare Local and mental health, alcohol and drug, and other community service providers. The tertiary and training sectors remain key partners in the planning, development and delivery of healthcare services. Partnership arrangements with The Australian National University Medical School, University of Canberra, Australian Catholic University and Canberra Institute of Technology are well established and serve to assure the future supply of skilled health professionals.8 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 A.2 and A.3 Overview and highlights 2012-13 ACT Health faced a challenging year in 2012-13, but rose to the challenge and performed well against its key strategic objectives. In 2012-13, ACT Health exceeded its target for the number of people removed from the elective surgery waiting list\u2014the highest on record for the ACT\u2014and continues to reduce the amount of patients waiting longer than clinically recommended timeframes. ACT Public hospitals met the need for cancer treatment services in all three major triage categories: urgent, semi- urgent and non-urgent. The ACT Government's investment in the public health system bettered the national rate of government investment in 2012-13. The ACT also fared well in the management of chronic disease, with rates of life expectancy at birth for men and women in the ACT exceeding the national average. ACT residents have the highest life expectancy of any Australian jurisdiction. However, the higher proportion of the ACT population diagnosed with some form of circulatory disease when compared with the national average is tangible evidence that the ACT population is ageing faster than that of other jurisdictions, with the median age of the ACT population increasing 6.4 years since 1985 to 34.5 years in 2011. Moreover, improved early intervention has increased detection of diabetes in the ACT. Experts estimate that only half of those with diabetes are actually aware of their condition. The ACT met the national response timeframe for in-hospital assessments by the Aged Care Assessment Team, indicating the team's responsiveness in assessing the needs of clients. Our mental health services were particularly effective at minimising the need for seclusion, reflected in a significant reduction in the use of seclusion during inpatient mental health episodes. Moreover, mental health consumers and carers were represented on all Mental Health committees, which monitor the delivery and planning of our mental health services. We also achieved our target of less that 10 per cent of mental health clients returning to hospital within 28 days of discharge from an ACT public mental health unit, which is very heartening. We performed well in minimising the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases among the ACT's population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, with an overall immunisation rate of 88 per cent for children aged between 12 and 63 months, against a target of 90 per cent, thereby lessening the disparity with non-Indigenous Australians. The high quality of service that Canberrans receive at our ACT public hospitals was reflected in the quality of theatre and post-operative care, the effective treatment of people who receive hospital-based care by our hospital-based and community services, and the low number of people admitted to hospital who acquired a bacteraemial infection (bacteria in the blood) during their stay. The ACT exceeded the national average for its participation rate in the Cervical Screening Program. ACT public hospital emergency departments continued to treat patients requiring urgent treatment within national timeframes, while dealing with increased demand. Breastscreen ACT has a number of initiatives underway to raise awareness of its screening service, particularly within the target group of women aged 50 to 69, to lift the proportion of women in the target age group who have breastscreens. The ACT had the lowest jurisdictional rate for the mean number of teeth with dental decay, missing or filled teeth among children at ages 6 and 12, showing the effectiveness of our prevention, early intervention and treatment services. Moreover, ACT Health met its target percentage for the number of dental emergency clients seen within 24 hours.Section A Performance and financial reporting 9 We didn't achieve our long-term target for reducing the rate of broken hips (fractured neck of femur) in older persons. However, only small numbers of patients are included in the calculations, and small changes can result in significant fluctuations in the result. The ACT has seen a continued decline in the rate of 12-17-year-olds who smoke regularly, which is significantly lower than the national rate. This year we also completed the ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 and the ACT Health Aboriginal Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018 and implemented Health Workforce Australia (HWA) initiatives to support national health workforce reforms. An independent evaluation report confirmed the Walk-In Centre (WiC) model for the treatment of people with minor illness or injuries to be a safe and effective means of providing primary healthcare services, while highlighting that it improved access to free, extended hours primary health care services. In 2012-13, we opened Stage One of the new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children\u2014one of the Health Infrastructure Program's major new capital works, which features state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. The Gungahlin Community Health Centre also opened, providing a range of services to those in the north of Canberra. The Radiation Oncology Department commenced operation of a fourth linear accelerator, which was timely in light of increased demand for radiotherapy treatment services. We improved our Prosthetics and Orthotics Service by implementing a triage clinic to better manage the needs of clients, resulting in a significant fall in the non-urgent waiting time. ACT Health, through the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards, met all reaccreditation criteria\u2014with 28 marked achievements, 18 extensive achievements and one outstanding achievement\u2014to retain its full accreditation status for another four years. Projections suggest that life expectancy will continue to increase over the coming years, with cancer, mental disorders and cardiovascular disease the leading contributors to the total burden of disease, contributing nearly half of the total disease burden. A number of staff changes at Canberra Hospital and Health Services occurred during the year. Mr Lee Martin, Deputy Director-General, resigned to return to the United Kingdom, as did Ms Susan Aitkenhead, Executive Director of Nursing and Midwifery. Dr Jo Burnand, Executive Director of Medical Services, also resigned. We thank them for their contributions and wish them well for their future careers. ACT Health also mourned the loss of three senior medical staff in 2012. Dr Damian McMahon, Professor Marjan Klijakovic and Dr Toni Medcalf (Peadon) all passed away, cutting short lives that were dedicated to delivering better health to the ACT community.10 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 A.4 Outlook for 2013-14 The 2013-14 reporting period promises to be another year of tremendous growth for ACT Health, as it delivers key pieces of infrastructure under the Health Infrastructure Program and further consolidates its response to the National Health Reform Agenda, including the National Elective Surgery Target and National Emergency Access Target. The ACT Government continues to invest heavily in health to meet both present and future challenges. Health continues to be one of the ACT Government's biggest areas of spending, with annual investment of $1.3 billion to transform our health system. In the coming year, we are committed to further improvements to elective surgery services, further reductions in waiting times, expansion of the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit at Canberra Hospital, and rapid assessment services at Calvary. We will complete the planning and commence forward design of the new University of Canberra Public Hospital. More beds will be opened at Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital and the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, and there will be increased staffing at the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department. ACT Health will deliver an additional 31 inpatient beds across Canberra and Calvary Public Hospitals, as well as six Hospital in the Home places. Additional staffing and resources at Canberra Hospital will help us better manage patient movement through and out of the emergency department, and we will also establish an eight-bed rapid assessment unit at Calvary Public Hospital. We will also establish an Obesity Management Service to improve the health of patients with severe obesity through coordinated intervention and prevention services. A mobile dental clinic will help people who cannot access a dentist surgery, and we will expand outreach services for cancer sufferers. We will increase mental health services provided through non-government organisations and community health programs, and expand our community health centres and nurse-led walk-in centres. Services will be relocated to the new Belconnen Community Health Centre in Canberra's north, and an expanded and refurbished Tuggeranong Community Health Centre will reopen in Canberra's south. Finally, in the first half of the 2013-14 financial year, we will officially open Stage 2 of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, and the Canberra Region Cancer Centre. These are two of the most significant pieces of health infrastructure to have ever been delivered in the ACT, and are an important legacy for Canberra and the surrounding region of this centenary year.Section A Performance and financial reporting 11 A.5 Management discussion and analysis Management discussion and analysis for the Health Directorate for the financial year ended 30 June 2013 General overview Operations and principal activities The Health Directorate aims to achieve good health for all residents of the Territory by planning and providing quality community based health services and hospital and extended care services, managing public health risks, and promoting health and early care interventions. The Health Directorate's objectives are grouped around the following seven key performance areas: consumer experience sustainability hospital and related care prevention social inclusion and indigenous health community based health, and aged care. Changes in administrative structure The Directorate did not gain or lose any functions in the 2012-13 financial year. There was however, a change to funding arrangements. The ACT is a signatory to the National Health Reform Agreement, which changed the way hospitals are funded nationally. As a consequence, the ACT Government created a new Local Hospital Network (LHN) Directorate for receiving funding for both activity-based services and block-funded services from a national pool of funds that was contributed to by Commonwealth, States and Territories. The changed funding arrangement meant that the Health Directorate is no longer funded by the Government directly for hospital services. The ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate purchases hospital services from the following ACT public hospitals: the Canberra Hospital Calvary Public Hospital Clare Holland House, and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. Risk management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risks that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate: abnormal rates of staff separation the cost of medical malpractice indemnity ability to attract and retain health professionals rising costs of pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical supplies demands on replacing systems and equipment, and growth in demand for services.12 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The Government and the Directorate have responded to these risks in a number of ways, including: implementation of strategies for the retention and recruitment of doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals strengthening our patient safety and clinical practice review framework establishing the Medical School in cooperation with the Australian National University enhancement of procurement processes to maximise benefits from contracting a significant investment in infrastructure replacement and growth a significant investment in clinical systems and recording systems, and the Government introduced growth funding into the Health Budget in 2006-07. This was based on activity projected throu gh clinical services planning. The above risks are monitored regularly throughout the year. Financial performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 2011-12 and 2012-13, and the forward estimates contained in the 2013-14 Budget Paper Number 4. Total net cost of 301.9 Comparison to budget net cost of services for 2012-13 of $403.9 million was $7.4 million or 1.9 per cent higher than the 2012-13 budget. This reflects a combination of factors that resulted in higher than budgeted expenses ($20.5 million). The main variations are: depreciation and amortisation ($17.1 million)\u2014due to accelerated depreciation for the old Women and Children's Hospital, Tuggeranong Community Health Centre, Level 5 Building 1 at the Canberra Hospital and the old Psychiatric Services Unit as a result of extensive refurbishment works grants and purchased services ($6.0 million)\u2014due to higher payments to Calvary Public Hospital for cost pressures and emergency department refurbishment works, and salary and superannuation expenses ($6.4 million)\u2014due to the difference between the long service leave discount rate of 92 per cent used in budget calculations and the actual rate of 101.3 per cent, and a slower than anticipated decline in the number of employees leaving the higher cost CSS, PSS and PSSAP superannuation schemes. The higher than budgeted expenses were offset by lower than budgeted expenses for: cost of goods sold ($4.9 million)\u2014as a result of ACT private hospitals purchasing some medical and surgical supplies directly from suppliers, and other expenses ($4.1 million)\u2014due to this expense category including the budget for blood products and the actual expense being reported in the supplies and services expense category. These expenses were offset by a combination of higher than budgeted own source revenue ($13.0 million). The main variations for higher than budgeted revenue are: non-ACT Government user charges ($12.4 million)\u2014following acquittal of prior year cross border activity other revenue ($2.7 million)\u2014for grants received from Health Workforce Australia and prior year reimbursements such as workers' compensation, and gains ($0.9 million)\u2014mainly from increased general donations. The higher than budgeted own source revenue was offset by lower than budgeted revenue for: ACT Government user charges ($3.2 million)\u2014mainly due to reduced funding from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate in line with a reduction in the Commonwealth specific purpose funding based on population adjustments. Section A Performance and financial reporting 13 Comparison to 2011-12 actual expenses Total net cost of services was $518.0 million or 56.2 per cent lower than the 2011-12 actual cost. This is due to decreased expenses ($94.0 million), mainly comprising lower: grants and purchased services ($164.6 million) \u2014from Calvary Public Hospital payments that are now being paid through the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate. This was offset by increased expenses for: salary and superannuation expenses ($34.8 million)\u2014as a result of a larger workforce and pay increases in line with enterprise agreements depreciation and amortisation ($24.1 million)\u2014due to accelerated depreciation for the old Women and Children's Hospital, the Tuggeranong Community Health Centre, Level 5 Building 1 at the Canberra Hospital and the old Psychiatric Services Unit having extensive refurbishments works and the Commissioning of the new Gungahlin Community Health Centre and the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, and supplies and services ($15.9 million)\u2014from increased computer costs for additional ICT project staff, increases in floor space for the Health Directorate which results in higher cleaning/utilities costs, the introduction of the carbon tax levy, running costs associated with a new patient transport vehicle, including wages for a Paramedic team, and an increase in the demand for high-cost blood products. Increased own source revenue ($423.9 million) also contributed to the lower net cost of services. The main contributors to this reduction are: ACT Government user charges ($542.7 million)\u2014as a result of the changes to how payments are received from the ACT and Commonwealth Governments and this has a direct correlation with the reduced Government Payment for Outputs, which is $540.0 million lower than in 2011-12, and gains ($1.2 million)\u2014from increased general donations and the profit from sale of a larger number of motor vehicles. These were offset by reduced: non-ACT Government user charges ($115.9 million)\u2014from a change in funding arrangements for interstate residents, and other revenue ($4.1 million)\u2014as a result of receiving a large one-off grant from Health Workforce Australia in 2011-12 for the purchase of student accommodation properties and training equipment.

Net cost of services is then planned to increase slightly over the following years.14 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Total expenditure Components of expenditure Figure 2 below indicates the components of the Directorate's expenses for 2012-13, with the largest components of expense being employee expenses (excluding superannuation), which represents 51.3 per cent or $556.5 million, supplies and services which represents 27.8 per cent or $301.3 million and grants and purchased services, which represents 7.7 per cent or $82.9 million. Employee Expenses 51.3%Cost of Goods Sold 1.0%Suppliers and Services 27.8% Borrowing and Amortisation 4.9% Superannuation Expenses 6.7% Figure 2: Components of expenditure Comparison to budget Total expenses of $1,083.8 million were $20.5 million or 1.9 per cent, higher than the original 2012-13 budget of $1,063.3 million. This increase was predominantly due to higher: depreciation and amortisation ($17.1 million)\u2014due to accelerated depreciation for the old Women and Children's Hospital, Tuggeranong Community Health Centre, Level 5 Building 1 at the Canberra Hospital, and the old Psychiatric Services Unit as a result of significant refurbishment works grants and purchased services ($6.0 million)\u2014mainly due to higher payments to Calvary Public Hospital associated with cost pressures and refurbishment of the emergency department at Calvary Public Hospital employee expenses (excluding superannuation) ($3.2 million)\u2014mainly due to the difference between the long service leave discount rate of 92 per cent used in budget calculations and the actual rate of 101.3 per cent, and superannuation ($3.2 million)\u2014mainly due to an increasing workforce and a slower decline in the number of employees leaving the higher cost CSS, PSS and PSSAP schemes than had been anticipated.Section A Performance and financial reporting 15 This higher expenditure was partially offset by lower: cost of goods sold ($4.9 million)\u2014due to lower than anticipated supplies bought through the Directorate by private hospitals, who are now purchasing some items directly from suppliers, and other expenses ($4.1 million)\u2014mainly relating to blood products, which is budgeted against other expenses but with the actuals being reflected against supplies and services, which are partially offset by higher miscellaneous expenses, higher legal settlements and higher impairment losses. Comparison to 2011-12 actual expenses Total expenses were ($94.0 million) or 8.0 per cent lower than the 2011-12 actual result. The decrease reflects a combination of factors: lower grants and purchased services ($164.6 million) \u2014due to payments made to Calvary Public Hospital now being paid by the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate. The lower expenses were partially offset by higher: employee expenses (excluding superannuation) ($28.6 million)\u2014due to a greater increase in the overall workforce to cover growth in services in critical care, acute care, women and children's hospital, adult mental health, aged care and rehabilitation and cancer and pay increases in line with associated enterprise agreements depreciation and amortisation ($24.1 million)\u2014mainly resulting from accelerated depreciation for the old Women and Children's Hospital, Tuggeranong Community Health Centre, Level 5 Building 1 at the Canberra Hospital, and the old Psychiatric Services Unit due to extensive refurbishment works. The commissioning of the Gungahlin Community Health Centre and the new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children also increased depreciation costs supplies and services ($15.9 million)\u2014the variations being largely due to increased: - computer expenses\u2014which is a combination of price escalation, increase in staff numbers, and support costs for projects that became operational in 2013. These projects include a Digital Wireless Network at TCH Campus, Digital Intensive Care Unit CIS System, E-Referral & Discharge Summary and Clinical Systems Project - domestic services/food/utilities\u2014as a result of cleaning contract price increases, increases in floor space for new facilities and the carbon tax levy - running costs from the purchase of a new patient transport vehicle, including wages for paramedics, and demand for high cost blood products superannuation ($6.2 million)\u2014as a result of a larger workforce, increase in notional superannuation rates, and a slower decline in the number of employees leaving the higher cost CSS, PSS and PSSAP schemes than had been anticipated. Future trends Expenses are budgeted to increase steadily across the forward years to account for price escalation and growth in services.16 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Total own source revenue Components of own source revenue Figure 3 below indicates that for the financial year ended 30 June 2013, the Directorate received 80.3 per cent of its total own source revenue of $543.6 million from ACT Government user charges. Figure 3: Components of own source revenue Comparison to budget Own source revenue for the year ending 30 June 2013 was $677.5 million, which was $12.2 million or 1.8 per cent higher than the 2012-13 budget of $665.3 million. This favourable variance is due to higher: user charges\u2014non-ACT Government ($12.4 million)\u2014due to the accrual of cross border revenue related to prior years' activity for residents of New South Wales other revenue ($2.7 million)\u2014mainly relating to Health Workforce Australia grants and additional prior year expenditure reimbursement for workers' compensation claims, and gains ($0.9 million)\u2014due to increased general donations and profit from the sale of motor vehicles. The higher revenue was offset by lower than budgeted: ACT Government user charges ($3.2 million) - mainly due to reduced funding from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate in line with a reduction in the Commonwealth specific purpose funds based on population adjustments. Comparison to 2011-12 actual income Own source revenue was $423.9 million or 165.7 per cent higher than the 2011-12 actual result of $254.7 million. The result reflects an increase in: ACT Government user charges ($542.7 million)\u2014due to a change in the way payments are received from the ACT and Commonwealth Governments, and has a direct correlation with Government Payments for Outputs, which is $540.0 million lower than the actual 2011-12 result, andUser Charges - ACT Government 80.3%User Charges - Non-ACT Government 16.7%Other Revenue 2.9% Resources Received Free of Charge 0.1%Interest & Distributions 0.0%Section A Performance and financial reporting 17 gains ($1.2 million)\u2014due to increased general donations and profit from the sale of motor vehicles, which due to the cyclic nature of motor vehicle leases more cars were due to be sold in 2012-13. This was partially offset by a reduction in: non-ACT Government user charges ($115.9 million)\u2014mainly due to the changed funding arrangements for the treatment of interstate patients in ACT hospitals following the implementation of the National Health Reform Agreement (these revenues are now collected through the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate), and other revenue ($4.1 million)\u2014due to the receipt, in 2011-12, of a large one-off grant from Health Workforce Australia for training and education of the health workforce in the ACT and surrounding regions, including purchase of student accommodation and training equipment. Future trends Total own source revenue is expected to increase by $160.9 million in 2013-14, mainly due to the first full year of changed funding arrangements following the implementation of the National Health Reform Agreement, under which the funding for hospital services, which was previously paid as Government Payment for Outputs, will now be paid as user charges by the new ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate. It will then trend upwards steadily across the two forward years. Financial position Total assets Components of total assets Figure 4 below indicates that, for the financial year ended 30 June 2013, the Directorate held 63.8 per cent of its assets in property, plant and equipment. Other Assets 0.2% Property, Plant and Equipment 63.8% Intangible Assets 1.0%Capital Works in Progress 21.8%Cash and Cash Equivalents 0.9%Receivables 11.4%Investments 0.3%Inventories 0.7% Assets Held for Sale 0.0% Figure 4: Total assets as at 30 June 201318 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Comparison to budget The total asset position as at 30 June 2013 is $1,110.9 million, $74.6 million lower than the 2012-13 budget of $1,185.5 million. The variance reflects the timing associated with the acquisition and completion of various assets over the 2012-13 financial year including: intangibles ($22.2 million)\u2014mainly due to delays with ICT projects such as e-Health and Identity Access Management capital works in progress ($59.7 million)\u2014due to the deferral of capital works projects from 2012-13 into future years as a result of prolonged lease negotiations for decant space, procurement delays due to structural and manufacturing issues, and operational commissioning delays, and property, plant and equipment ($77.4 million)\u2014mainly due to delays with commissioning of the Belconnen Community Health Centre and accelerated depreciation for buildings undergoing extensive refurbishment work. This was partially offset by higher: receivables ($76.5 million)\u2014due largely to payments owing from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate, which relies on payments from the New South Wales Ministry of Health to then pay the Health Directorate, and cash and cash equivalents ($8.0 million)\u2014mainly due to funding for ICT capital projects and grants received from Health Workforce Australia. Comparison to 2011-12 actual The Directorate's total asset position is $114.7 million higher than the 2011-12 actual result of $996.2 million, largely due to increases in: property, plant and equipment including assets held for sale ($80.2 million)\u2014mainly due to completed new building capital works projects, including the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, the Gungahlin Community Health Centre and the Cancer Patient Accommodation property receivables ($68.6 million)\u2014due largely to cross border revenue not yet received from the New South Wales Ministry of Health, and capital works in progress ($23.4 million)\u2014as a result of works progressing on the new facilities, including the Community Health Centres in Belconnen, Tuggeranong and Gungahlin, the Canberra Region Cancer Centre, the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, for Clinical Services Redevelopment, the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit, e-Health, Digital Mammography, Identity Access Management and various capital upgrades. The above increases were partially offset by a reduction in: cash and cash equivalents ($59.8 million) \u2014due to an increase in receivables associated with the timing of cross border payments by the New South Wales Ministry of Health.Section A Performance and financial reporting 19 Total liabilities Components of total liabilities Figure 5 below indicates that the majority of the Directorate's liabilities relate to employee benefits 66.3 per cent and payables 30.2 per cent. Employee Benefits 66.3% Finance Leases 2.2%Payables 30.2%Other Liabilities 1.3% Figure 5: Total liabilities as at 30 June 2013 Comparison to budget The Directorate's liabilities for the year ended 30 June 2013, of $291.0 million, were $43.7 million higher than the 2012-13 budget of $247.3 million. This was largely due to higher: payables ($31.2 million)\u2014mainly due to invoices for capital works projects being received late in June, and employee benefits ($15.5 million)\u2014mainly due to the long service leave discount rate changing from 92 per cent to 101.3 per cent shortly after the original budget was set. This was offset by lower: other liabilities ($3.2 million)\u2014other liabilities mainly relates to revenue received in advance. Most of the grants and donations received during the year were brought to account as revenue earned even though conditions attached to those were not yet fulfilled. The variance is due to budget assumptions not being in line with the type of actual revenue received. 20 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Comparison to 2011-12 actual Total liabilities were $24.5 million higher than the actual results as at 30 June 2012 of $266.5 million. This was due to increases in: employee benefits ($13.7 million)\u2014mainly due to the impact of collective agreement pay rises and an increase in staff numbers for growth in services and the growth in liability due to leave consumption not in line with leave earned payables ($7.8 million)\u2014due to receipt of invoices for contractual capital works to be paid to Shared Services Procurement being received late in June 2013 other liabilities ($1.6 million)\u2014mainly due to payment in advance for services provided to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and finance leases ($1.4 million)\u2014due to the cyclic nature of the motor vehicles, which are generally on a three year lease. In 2012-13 the Health Directorate acquired 185 new motor vehicle leases and disposed of 164 old motor vehicle finance leases. Territorial statement of revenue and expenses The activities whose funds flow through the Directorate's Territorial accounts are: the receipt of regulatory licence fees, and the receipt and on-passing of monies for capital works at Calvary Public Hospital. Total income Figure 6 below indicates that 59.5 per cent of Territorial income is regulatory licence fees, with the balance being the receipt, for on-passing, of monies for capital works at Calvary Public Hospital (expenses on behalf of the Territory). Regulatory Licence Fees 59.5%Payments for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory 40.5% Figure 6: Sources of Territorial revenue Total Territorial income for the year ending 30 June 2013 was $1.8 million, which was $0.4 million higher than the budget figure of $1.4 million. The variance was due to higher regulatory licence fees revenue ($0.4 million). Total Territorial income for 2012-13, of $1.8 million was consistent with the 2011-12 income of $1.8 million.Section A Performance and financial reporting 21 Total expenses Figure 7 below indicates that 40.6 per cent of expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory relate to the on-passing of monies for capital works to Calvary Public Hospital, with the other 59.4 per cent being the transfer, to Government, of regulatory licence fees. Grants and Purchased Services 40.6%Transfer to ACT Government 59.4% Figure 7: Sources of Territorial expenses Total expenses were $1.8 million, which was $0.4 million higher than the budget of $1.4 million due to higher regulatory licence fees received. Total expenses were $0.3 million higher than for the same period last year of $1.5 million.

Column Heading Explanations The Original Budget column shows the amounts that appear in the Cash Flow Statement in the Budget Papers. This amount also appears in the Cash Flow Statement. The Total Appropriated column is inclusive of all appropriation variations occurring after the Original Budget. The Appropriation Drawn is the total amount of appropriation received by the Directorate during the year. This amount appears in the Cash Flow Statement. Variances between 'Original Budget' and 'Total Appropriated' Government Payment for Outputs The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated to the Directorate is due to the re-appropriation in 2012-13 of unspent Commonwealth Government funding from 2011-12 and increased Commonwealth Government funding for programs including Essential Vaccines, Long Stay Older Patients and Preventable Health. Capital Injections The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated in 2012-13 is due to the Section 16b capital injection reconciliation instrument of $17.436m from 2011-12. The Section 16b instrument is used to move the balance of capital injection from the end of one year into the following financial year. Variances between 'Total Appropriated' and 'Appropriated Drawn' Government Payment for Outputs The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriated Drawn is due to the movement of funding from 2012-13 into 2013-14 mainly due to delays in the National Health Reform and Preventable Health programs. The deferrals in part relate to delays in refurbishment work before facilities could become operational. Capital Injections The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriation Drawn in 2012-13 is due to the deferral of capital works projects from 2012-13 to 2013-14 and 2014-15. The main reasons for the deferral of capital works projects from 2012-13 into future years was prolonged lease negotiations for vacant space to be used as temporary accommodation, procurement delays due to structural and manufacturing issues, development application approval delays, delays in appointment of principal consultants, and operational commissioning delays.Section A Performance and financial reporting 33 Health Directorate Controlled Note Index Note 1Objectives of the Health Directorate Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Note 3Change in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimates, and Correction of a Prior Period Error Income Notes Note 4Government Payment for Outputs Note 5User Charges Note 6 Interest Note 7Distribution from Investments with the Territory Banking Account Note 8Resources Received Free of Charge Note 9Other Revenue Note 10 Gains on Investments Note 11 Other Gains Expense Notes Note 12 Employee Expenses Note 13Superannuation Expenses Note 14Supplies and Services Note 15Depreciation and Amortisation Note 16Grants and Purchased Services Note 17Borrowing Costs Note 18Cost of Goods Sold Note 19 Other Expenses Note 20Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs Note 21Auditor's Remuneration Note 22Act of Grace Payments Asset Notes Note 23Cash and Cash Equivalents Note 24Receivables Note 25 Inventories Note 26Assets Held for Sale Note 27 Investments Note 28Property, Plant and Equipment Note 29Intangible Assets Note 30Capital Works in Progress Note 31 Other Assets Liabilities Notes Note 32 Payables Note 33Finance Leases Note 34Employee Benefits Note 35 Other Provisions Note 36Other Liabilities Equity Note Note 37 Equity Other Notes Note 38 Financial Instruments Note 39 Commitments Note 40Contingent Liabilities Note 41Cash Flow Reconciliation Note 42Events Occurring After Balance Date Note 43Third Party Monies34 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 1. Objectives of the Health Directorate Operations and Principal Activities The Health Directorate (the Directorate) aims to achieve good health for all residents of the Territory by planning for and providing quality community based health services, hospital and extended care services, managing public health risks and promoting health and early care interventions. (The ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate became responsible for purchasing public hospital services from July 2012.) The Directorate's objectives are grouped around the following seven key performance areas: consumer experience; sustainability; hospital and related care; prevention; social inclusion and indigenous health; community based health; and aged care. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Accounting The Financial Management Act 1996 (FMA) requires the preparation of annual financial statements for ACT Government Agencies. The FMA and the Financial Management Guidelines issued under the Act, requires the Directorate's financial statements to include: i. an Operating Statement for the year; ii. a Balance Sheet at the end of the year; iii. a Statement of Changes in Equity for the year; iv. a Cash Flow Statement for the year; v. a Statement of Appropriation for the year; vi. an Operating Statement for each class of output for the year; vii. a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted for the year; and viii. such other statements as are necessary to fairly reflect the financial operations of the Directorate during the year and its financial position at the end of the year. These general-purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' (GAAP) as required by the FMA. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i. Australian Accounting Standards; and ii. ACT Accounting and Disclosure Policies. The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises the effects of transactions and events when they occur. The financial statements have also been prepared according to the historical cost convention, except for assets which were valued in accordance with the (re)/valuation policies applicable to the Directorate during the reporting period. As at 30 June 2013, the Directorate's current assets are insufficient to meet its current liabilities, but this is not considered a liquidity risk as its operations are funded through appropriation from the ACT Government on a cash-needs basis. This is consistent with the Whole-of-Government cash management regime which requires excess cash balances to be held centrally rather than within individual Directorate bank accounts. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Directorate's functional currency. The Directorate is an individual reporting entity.Section A Performance and financial reporting 35 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (b) Controlled and Territorial Items The Directorate produces Controlled and Territorial financial statements. The Controlled financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities over which the Directorate has control. The Territorial financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities that the Directorate administers on behalf of the ACT Government, but does not control. The purpose of the distinction between Controlled and Territorial is to enable an assessment of the Directorate's performance against the decisions it has made in relation to the resources it controls, while maintaining accountability for all resources under its responsibility. The basis of accounting described in Note 2(a) above applies to both Controlled and Territorial financial statements except where specified otherwise. (c) The Reporting Period These financial statements state the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Directorate for the year ending 30 June 2013 together with the financial position of the Directorate as at 30 June 2013. (d) Comparative Figures Budget Figures To facilitate a comparison with Budget Papers, as required by the Financial Management Act 1996 , budget information for 2012-2013 has been presented in the financial statements. Budget numbers in the financial statements are the original budget numbers that appear in the Budget Papers. Prior Year Comparatives Comparative information has been disclosed in respect of the previous period for amounts reported in the financial statements, except where an Australian Accounting Standard does not require comparative information to be disclosed. Where the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is amended, the comparative amounts have been reclassified where practical. Where a reclassification has occurred, the nature, amount and reason for the reclassification is provided. (e) Rounding All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($'000). Use of the \"-\" symbol represents zero amounts or amounts rounded up or down to zero.36 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (f) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the Operating Statement. All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Directorate and the revenue can be reliably measured. In addition, the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Cross Border (Interstate) Health Revenue Revenue for cross border (interstate) health services is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of the treatments provided can be measured reliably and the contract price for such services are agreed with the States and Northern Territory. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised is accounted for in the year of settlement with the States and Northern Territory. Service Revenue Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised when the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date can be measured reliably and the costs of rendering those services can be measured reliably. Inventory Sales Revenue from inventory sales is recognised as revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has transferred to the buyer, the Directorate retains neither continuing managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods sold and the costs incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Amounts Received for Highly Specialised Drugs Revenue from the supply of highly specialised drugs is recognised as revenue when the drugs have been supplied to the patients. Inpatient Fees For the hospital treatment of chargeable patients, inpatient fees are recognised as revenue when the services have been provided. Revenue related to hospital services provided to the Department of Veterans' Affairs patients is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of the treatments provided can be measured reliably and the contract price for such services are agreed with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised is accounted for in the year of settlement with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Facilities Fees Facilities fees are generated from the provision of facilities to enable specialists and senior specialists to exercise rights of private practice in the treatment of chargeable patients at a Health Directorate facility. They are recognised as revenue when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Distribution Distribution revenue is received from investments with the Territory Banking Account. This is recognised on an accrual basis using data supplied by the Territory Banking Account.Section A Performance and financial reporting 37 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (f) Revenue Recognition (Continued) Grants Grants are non-reciprocal in nature and are recognised as revenue in the year in which the Directorate obtains control over them. Where grants are reciprocal in nature, the revenue is recognised over the term of the funding arrangements. Interest Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method. (g) Revenue Received in Advance Revenue received in advance relating to contributions, grants and donations are recognised only where there is a present obligation to repay a grant, contributions and donations because specific conditions attached to the grant, contributions and donations have not been met by the Directorate. (h) Resources Received and Provided Free of Charge Resources received free of charge are recorded as a revenue and expense in the Operating Statement at fair value. The revenue is separately disclosed under resources received free of charge, with the expense being recorded in the line item to which it relates. Goods and services received free of charge from ACT Government agencies are recorded as resources received free of charge, whereas goods and services received free of charge from entities external to the ACT Government are recorded as donations. Services that are received free of charge are only recorded in the Operating Statement if they can be reliably measured and would have been purchased if not provided to the Directorate free of charge. Resources provided free of charge are recorded at their fair value in the expense line items to which they relate. (i) Repairs and Maintenance The Directorate undertakes major cyclical maintenance on its assets. Where the maintenance leads to an upgrade of the asset, and increases the service potential of the existing asset, the cost is capitalised. Maintenance expenses which do not increase the service potential of the asset are expensed. ( j) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. (k) Waivers of Debt Debts that are waived during the year under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996 are expensed during the year in which the right to payment was waived. Further details of waivers are disclosed at Note 20: Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-offs.38 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (l) Current and Non-Current Items Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheet and in the relevant notes. Assets are classified as current where they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date or when the Directorate does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Assets or liabilities which do not fall within the current classification are classified as non-current. (m) Impairment of Assets The Directorate assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. However, intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether there is an indication of impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. Any resulting impairment losses, for land, buildings, and leasehold improvements, are recognised as a decrease in the Asset Revaluation Surplus relating to these classes of assets. Where the impairment loss is greater than the balance in the Asset Revaluation Surplus for the relevant class of asset, the difference is expensed in the Operating Statement. Impairment losses for plant and equipment and intangible assets are expensed in the Operating Statement, as plant and equipment and intangibles are carried at cost. Also, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's 'fair value less cost to sell' and its 'value in use'. An asset's 'value in use' is its depreciated replacement cost, where the asset would be replaced if the Directorate were deprived of it. Non-financial assets that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. (n) Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet, cash includes cash at bank and cash on hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are included in cash and cash equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement but not in the cash and cash equivalents line on the Balance Sheet.Section A Performance and financial reporting 39 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (o) Receivables Accounts receivable (including trade receivables and other trade receivables) are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. Trade receivables arise in the normal course of selling goods and services to other agencies and to the public. Trade receivables are payable within 30 days after the issue of an invoice or the goods/services have been provided under a contractual arrangement. In some cases, the Directorate has entered into contractual arrangements with some customers allowing it to charge interest at commercial rates where payment is not received within 90 days after the amount falls due, until the whole of the debt is paid. Other trade receivables arise outside the normal course of selling goods and services to other agencies and to the public. Other trade receivables are payable within 30 days after the issue of an invoice or the goods/services have been provided under a contractual arrangement. If payment has not been received within 90 days after the amount falls due, under the terms and conditions of the arrangement with the debtor, the Directorate is able to charge interest at commercial rates until the whole amount of the debt is paid. The allowance for impairment losses represents the amount of trade receivables and other trade receivables the Directorate estimates will not be repaid. The allowance for impairment losses is based on objective evidence and a review of overdue balances. The Directorate considers the following is objective evidence of impairment: becoming aware of financial difficulties of debtors; default payments; or debts more than 90 days overdue. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. The allowance for impairment losses are written back against the receivables account when the Directorate ceases action to collect the debt as it considers that it will cost more to recover the debt than the debt is worth. Receivables that have been renegotiated because they are past due or impaired are accounted for based on the renegotiated terms. (p) Investments The Directorate holds one long-term investment. It is held with the Territory Banking Account in a unit trust called the Fixed Interest Portfolio. Investments are measured at fair value with any adjustments to the carrying amount recorded in the Operating Statement. Fair value is based on an underlying pool of investments which have quoted market prices as at the reporting date. (q) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the purchase price of inventories as well as transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of inventories. Trade discounts, rebates and similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase. The cost of inventories is assigned using the cost weighted average method. Net realisable value is determined using the estimated sales proceeds less costs incurred in marketing, selling and distribution to customers.40 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (r) Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are assets that are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and their sale is highly probable. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset to fair value less cost to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated. (s) Acquisition and Recognition of Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the purchase price, directly attributable costs and the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the item (where, upon acquisition, there is a present obligation to remove the item). Where property, plant and equipment are acquired at no cost, or minimal cost, cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. However property, plant and equipment acquired at no cost or minimal cost as part of a Restructuring of Administrative Arrangements is measured at the transferor's book value. Where payment for property, plant and equipment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between its cash price equivalent and the total payment is measured as interest over the period of credit. The discount rate used to calculate the cash price equivalent is an asset specific rate. Property, plant and equipment with a minimum value of $5,000 are capitalised. (t) Measurement of Property, Plant and Equipment after Initial Recognition Property, plant and equipment are valued using the cost or revaluation model of valuation. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are measured at fair value. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value is measured using market based evidence available for that asset (or a similar asset), as this is the best evidence of an asset's fair value. Where the market price for an asset cannot be obtained because the asset is specialised and is rarely sold, depreciated replacement cost is used as fair value. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are revalued every 3 years. However, if at any time management considers that the carrying amount of an asset materially differs from its fair value, then the asset will be revalued regardless of when the last valuation took place. Any accumulated depreciation relating to buildings and leasehold improvements at the date of revaluation is written-back against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. The Directorate measures its plant and equipment at cost.Section A Performance and financial reporting 41 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (u) Intangible Assets The Directorate's Intangible Assets are comprised of internally developed and externally acquired software for internal use. Externally acquired software is recognised and capitalised when: a. it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the software will flow to the Directorate; b. the cost of the software can be measured reliably; and c. the acquisition cost is equal to or exceeds $50,000. Internally generated software is recognised when it meets the general recognition criteria outlined above and where it also meets the specific recognition criteria relating to internally developed intangible assets. Capitalised software has a finite useful life. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life, over a period not exceeding 5 years. Intangible Assets are measured at cost. (v) Depreciation and Amortisation of Non-Current Assets Non-current assets with a limited useful life are systematically depreciated/amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the consumption of their service potential. The useful life commences when an asset is ready for use. When an asset is revalued, it is depreciated/amortised over its newly assessed remaining useful life. Amortisation is used in relation to intangible assets while depreciation is applied to physical assets such as buildings and plant and equipment. Land has an unlimited useful life and is therefore not depreciated. Leasehold improvements and motor vehicles under a finance lease are depreciated over the estimated useful life of each asset improvement, or the unexpired period of the relevant lease, whichever is shorter. All depreciation is calculated after first deducting any residual values which remain for each asset. Depreciation/amortisation for non-current assets is determined as follows. Class of Asset Depreciation/Amortisation Method Useful Life (Years) Buildings Straight Line 40-80 Leasehold Improvements Straight Line 2-10 Plant and Equipment Straight Line 2-20 Externally Purchased Intangibles Straight Line 2-5 Internally Generated Intangibles Straight Line 2-5 Land improvements are included with buildings. The useful lives of all major assets held are reassessed on an annual basis.42 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (w) Payables Payables are a financial liability and are measured at the fair value of the consideration received when initially recognised and at amortised cost subsequent to initial recognition, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. All amounts are normally settled within 30 days after the invoice date. Payables include Trade Payables, Accrued Expenses and Other Payables. Trade Payables represent the amounts owing for goods and services received prior to the end of the reporting period and unpaid at the end of the reporting period and relating to the normal operations of the Directorate. Accrued Expenses represent goods and services provided by other parties during the period that are unpaid at the end of the reporting period and where an invoice has not been received by period end. Other Payables are those unpaid invoices that do not directly relate to the normal operations of the Directorate. (x) Leases The Directorate has entered into finance leases and operating leases. Finance Leases Finance leases effectively transfer to the Directorate substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the assets under a finance lease. The title may or may not eventually be transferred. Finance leases are initially recognised as an asset and a liability at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments each being determined at the inception of the lease. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Assets under a finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life or lease term. Assets under a finance lease are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Each lease payment is allocated between interest expense and reduction of the lease liability. Lease liabilities are classified as current and non-current. Operating Leases Operating leases do not effectively transfer to the Directorate substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset under an operating lease. Operating lease payments are recorded as an expense in the Operating Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Section A Performance and financial reporting 43 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (y) Employee Benefits Employee benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and applicable on-costs. On-costs include annual leave, long service leave, superannuation and other costs that are incurred when employees take annual and long service leave. These benefits accrue as a result of services provided by employees up to the reporting date that remain unpaid. They are recorded as a liability and as an expense. Wages and Salaries Accrued wages and salaries are measured at the amount that remains unpaid to employees at the end of the reporting period. Annual and Long Service Leave Annual leave and long service leave that fall due wholly within the next 12 months is measured based on the estimated amount of remuneration payable when the leave is taken. Annual and long service leave including applicable on-costs that do not fall due within the next 12 months are measured at the present value of estimated future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to the future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. At each reporting period, the present value of future payments are estimated using market yields on Commonwealth Government bonds with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash flows. In 2012-13, the rate used to estimate the present value of these future payments is 101.3% (106.6% in 2011-12). The long service leave liability is estimated with reference to the minimum period of qualifying service. For employees with less than the required minimum period of 7 years qualifying service, the probability that employees will reach the required minimum period has been taken into account in estimating the provision for long service leave and the applicable on-costs. The provision for annual leave and long service leave includes estimated on-costs. As these on-costs only become payable if the employee takes annual and long service leave while in-service, the probability that employees will take annual and long service leave while in-service has been taken into account in estimating the liability for on-costs. Annual leave and long service leave liabilities are classified as current liabilities in the Balance Sheet where there are no unconditional rights to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months. However, where there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months, annual leave and long service leave have been classified as a non-current liability in the Balance Sheet.44 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (z) Superannuation The Directorate receives funding for superannuation payments as part of the Government Payment for Outputs. The Directorate then makes payments on a fortnightly basis to the Territory Banking Account, to cover the Directorate's superannuation liability for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS). This payment covers the CSS/PSS employer contribution, but does not include the productivity component. The productivity component is paid directly to Comsuper by the Directorate. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit superannuation plans meaning that the defined benefits received by employees are based on the employee's years of service and average final salary. Superannuation payments have also been made directly to superannuation funds for those members of the Public Sector who are part of superannuation accumulation schemes. This includes the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Accumulation Plan (PSSAP) and schemes of employee choice. Superannuation employer contribution payments, for the CSS and PSS, are calculated, by taking the salary level at an employee's anniversary date and multiplying it by the actuarially assessed nominal CSS or PSS employer contribution rate for each employee. The productivity component payments are calculated by taking the salary level, at an employee's anniversary date, and multiplying it by the employer contribution rate (approximately 3%) for each employee. Superannuation payments for the PSSAP are calculated by taking the salary level, at an employee's anniversary date, and multiplying it by the appropriate employer contribution rate. Superannuation payments for fund of choice arrangements are calculated by taking an employee's salary each pay and multiplying it by the appropriate employer contribution rate. A superannuation liability is not recognised in the Balance Sheet as the Superannuation Provision Account recognises the total Territory superannuation liability for the CSS and PSS, and Comsuper and the external schemes recognise the superannuation liability for the PSSAP and other schemes respectively. The ACT Government is liable for the reimbursement of the emerging costs of benefits paid each year to members of the CSS and PSS in respect of the ACT Government service provided after 1 July 1989. These reimbursement payments are made from the Superannuation Provision Account. (aa) Equity Contributed by the ACT Government Contributions made by the ACT Government, through its role as owner of the Directorate, are treated as contributions of equity. Increases or decreases in net assets as a result of Administrative Restructures are also recognised in equity. (ab) Insurance Major risks are insured through the ACT Insurance Authority. The excess payable, under this arrangement, varies depending on each class of insurance held. (ac) Third Party Monies The Directorate holds third party monies in a trustee capacity for the ACT Medical Radiation Scientists Board, the ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board, the Health Directorate Human Research Ethics Committee and for residents of its Mental Health facilities. The Directorate also holds third party monies in an administrative capacity which is principally derived from patients treated by salaried specialists. Accordingly, third party transactions are excluded from the Directorate's financial statements. Details of third party monies are shown at Note 43: Third Party Monies.Section A Performance and financial reporting 45 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (ad) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Directorate has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements: a. Fair Value of Assets : the Directorate has made a significant judgement regarding the fair value of its assets. Land and Leasehold Improvements have been recorded at market value of similar properties as determined by an independent valuer. Buildings have been recorded at fair value based on a depreciated replacement cost as determined by an independent valuer. This valuation is determined by reference to the new cost of the buildings less depreciation for their physical, functional and economic obsolescence. b. Employee Benefits: significant judgements have been applied in estimating the liability for employee benefits. The estimated liability for employee benefits requires a consideration of the future wages and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. The estimate also includes an assessment of the probability that employees will meet the minimum service period required to qualify for long service leave and that on-costs will become payable. Further information on this estimate is provided in Note 2 (y): Employee Benefits and Note 3: Change in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimates, and Correction of a Prior Period Error. c. Cross Border (Interstate) Health Revenue : the cross border revenue in the Health Directorate relates to activity prior to 2012-13 and it is based on cost weighted separations and an agreed price. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement with the States and Northern Territory. The Health Directorate has accounted for patient activity that has been agreed with the New South Wales Ministry of Health. There is currently three years of final acquittals for patient activity that have not been finalised due to a lengthy process of data review (In August 2013 the 2009-10 and 2010-11 financial year acquittal processes were finalised and paid by the New South Wales Ministry of Health). d. Depreciation and Amortisation : the Directorate has made a significant estimate in the lengths of useful lives over which its assets are depreciated and amortised. This estimation is the period in which utility will be gained from the use of the asset, based on either estimates from officers of the Directorate or an independent valuer. e. Contingent Liabilities : contingent liabilities is an estimate provided by the ACT Government Solicitor of the likely liability for legal claim against the Directorate. f. Allowance for Impairment Losses: the Directorate has made a significant estimate in calculating the allowance for impairment losses. The allowance is based on reviews of overdue receivable balances and the amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. Further details in relation to the calculation of this estimate are outlined in Note 2 (o): Receivables. g. Impairment of Assets: the Directorate has made a significant judgement regarding its impairment of assets by undertaking a process of reviewing any likely impairment factors. Business Units across the Directorate made an assessment of any indication of impairment by assessing against an impairment checklist.46 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (ae) Impact of Accounting Standards Issued but Yet to be Applied The following new and revised accounting standards and interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but do not apply to the current reporting period.

Change in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimates, and Correction of a Prior Period Error Change in Accounting Policy The Directorate had no changes in Accounting Policy during the reporting period. Change in Accounting Estimates Revision of the Estimation of Employee Benefit Liability As disclosed in Note 2 (y): Employee benefits, annual leave and long service leave, including applicable on-costs, which do not fall due in the next 12 months, are measured at the present value of estimated payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. The present value of future payments is estimated using the Government bond rate. Last financial year the present value rate was 106.6%, however, due to a change in the Government bond rate that rate is now 101.3%. As such the estimate of the long service leave liability has changed. This change has resulted in a decrease to the estimate of the long service leave liability and expense in the current reporting period of $4,597,538. Revision of Depreciation Charge As a result of the Health Infrastructure Program, some Directorate buildings are being partially demolished and reconstructed and some are planned to undergo significant refurbishment work. As no future economic benefits will be derived from the part of the asset from the date of demolition or start of refurbishment, this would constitute a de-recognition of that component of the asset. Therefore, depreciation was accelerated for those asset components. For further details see Note 15: Depreciation and Amortisation . Correction of a Prior Period Error The Directorate had no correction of material prior period errors during the reporting period. Note 4. Government Payment for Outputs Government Payment for Outputs is revenue received from the ACT Government to fund the costs of delivering outputs. The ACT Government pays Government Payment for Outputs appropriation on a fortnightly basis. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Revenue from the ACT Government Government Payment for Outputsa364,256 904,281 Total Government Payment for Outputs 364,256 904,281 a. The decrease in Government Payment for Outputs was due to the commencement of a new funding arrangement under the National Health Reform Agreement. Under the new arrangement the Directorate no longer receives Government Payment for Outputs for most public hospital services. Government Payment for Outputs for public hospital services are provided to the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate.48 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 5. User Charges User charge revenue is derived by providing goods and services to other ACT Government agencies and to the public. User charge revenue is not part of ACT Government appropriation and is paid by the user of the goods or services.

This revenue is due to the changed funding arrangements following the implementation of the National Health Reform Agreement from 1 July 2012. This revenue relates to the receipt of funding from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate for public hospital services provided by Canberra Hospital and Health Services. b. The decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction in the number of private patients requiring implanted prostheses. c. This is mainly due to usage of highly specialised drugs being lower than in the previous year. d. The decrease is due to the changed funding arrangements for the treatment of interstate patients in ACT hospitals following the implementation of National Health Reform Agreement. This revenue is now collected by the ACT Local Health Network Directorate. e. The increase mainly relates to revenue received for prior year activity for Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) patients following the acquittals of 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years. f. The increase is attributable to the full year operation of the Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerised Tomography (CT) service which commenced operation during 2012. g. The reduction is due to reduced demand from the private sector for the supply of medical and surgical supplies.Section A Performance and financial reporting 49 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 6.

The increase in Wages and Salaries mainly relates to payrises under collective agreements and staff increases related to growth in services in Critical Care, Acute Care, Women and Children's Hospital, Surgical Services, Adult Mental Health, Rehabilitation and Cancer. b. The increase in Annual Leave largely relates to the impact of payrises and an increase in staff numbers in 2013. c. The decrease in Long Service Leave is mainly due to a reduction in the rate used to estimate the present value of Long Service Leave payments from 106.6% to 101.3%. d. The increase relates to labour costs, as the Workers' Compensation Insurance Premium is affected by increased wages and salaries. e. The decrease reflects a lower number of redundancies in 2013. f. The decrease is mainly due to lower recruitment agency fees than in previous year due to changed recruitment practice.52 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 13. Superannuation Expenses 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Superannuation 72,276 66,067 a. The increase is due to an increase in the rate for the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) from 17.8% in 2012 to 19.7% in 2013. This was partially offset by a reduction in the rate for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) from 19.7% in 2012 to 18.5% in 2013. b. The decrease is due to declining number of members in the CSS and PSS. c. The increase is due to pay rises and that most new starters are members of superannuation schemes managed by external providers. Note 14.

Supplies and Services (Continued) a. The decrease is due to a one-off audit of emergency department data conducted in 2012. b. The increase is mainly attributable to price escalation and an increase in demand for high cost blood products. c. The increase is mainly attributable to price escalation. d. The increase is due to a combination of factors, including price escalation, increase in staff numbers and support costs for projects that became operational in 2013. They include Digital Wireless Network at the Canberra Hospital campus, Digital Intensive Care Unit Clinical Information System, E-Referral & Discharge Summary and Clinical Systems Project. e. The decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction in the use of consultants in line with a targeted savings plan. f. The increase is mainly attributable to cleaning contract price increases, increases in floor space and new facilities and the carbon tax levy. g. The increase is mainly due to a combination of factors, including payments to ACT Emergency Services for operating an ambulance, increased cost of freight, payment to the Australian National University (ANU) for the maintenance of the medical research animal house that was re-located to the ANU campus and price escalation for Service Level Agreement charges paid to Shared Services. h. The decrease in the insurance premium reflects a reduction following an actuarial assessment of the future cost of claims. The key element being a downward revision to the number of assumed small claim settlements for the 2012-13 insurance year. i. The increase is mainly due to the quantity of medical equipment purchases that fell below the asset capitalisation threshold of $5,000. j. The increase is mainly due to higher usage of agency nursing and agency dental staff to cover vacancies, which were partially offset by a reduction in the use of agency medical staff. Agency staff refers to temporary staff sourced at short notice from external labour providers. k. The decrease is mainly due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in the usage of highly specialised (s100) drugs, price decreases for some drugs and a reduction in the usage of some expensive drugs. l. This increase mainly relates to increases in temporary rental accommodation for new medical staff. m. The decrease is mainly due to a reduction in use of promotional materials. n. This is mainly attributable to increased expenditure on preventative and reactive maintenance of ageing infrastructure and an increase in breakdown repairs for medical equipment. o. The increase mainly relates to training expenses and study reimbursements . Note 15. Depreciation and Amortisation 2013 $'0002012 28,929 Change in Depreciation Due to De-recognition of Components of Buildings Depreciation was accelerated to de-recognise part of the original Women and Children's Hospital and Tuggeranong Health Centre which were partially demolished for reconstruction and The Canberra Hospital Psychiatric Unit building and The Canberra Hospital Tower Block level 5 which are planned to undergo significant refurbishment work. As a result depreciation expenses increased by $22.1 million in the current accounting period. a. The increase mainly relates to accelerating the depreciation for the original Women and Children's Hospital ($16.1 million) and Tuggeranong Health Centre ($1.4 million) which were partially demolished for reconstruction and for the Canberra Hospital Psychiatric Unit building ($1.9 million) and the Canberra Hospital Tower Block level 5 ($2.7 million) which are planned to undergo significant refurbishment work. The addition of new buildings, namely the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, Gungahlin Community Health Centre and Cancer Patient Accommodation property in Duffy have also contributed to this increase. b. The increase is mainly due to additional leasehold improvements at Village Creek Centre and 1 Moore Street. 54 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 16. Grants and Purchased Services Grants are sums of money given to organisations or individuals for a specified purpose directed at achieving goals and objectives consistent with Government policy on health promotion. Purchased Services are amounts paid to obtain services by the Directorate from other ACT Government agencies and external parties. They may be for capital, current or recurrent purposes and they are usually subject to terms and conditions set out in a contract, agreement, or by legislation. Non-Government Organisation service providers provide services in a range of areas including Home and Community Care, Alcohol and Drug, Community Mental Health, Women's Health, Aged Care and Aboriginal Health.

The decrease in Purchased Services from Calvary Hospital is due to the commencement of the National Health Reform Agreement. Public hospital activities that meet the funding criteria of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority are now purchased through the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate. b. The decrease is due to the changed funding arrangement for over 65 year olds and the Home and Community Care Program which are now being directly funded by the Commonwealth Government, offset by indexation, growth in mental health services and elective surgery procedures delivered by the non-government sector. c. The decrease is due to cross border hospital services being purchased in 2012-13 by the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate rather than the Health Directorate. The 2013 amount is due to the finalisation of prior year acquittals. d. The decrease is due to a reduced level of elective surgery procedures purchased from private providers.Section A Performance and financial reporting 55 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 17.

Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs Under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996, the Treasurer may, in writing, waive the right to payment of an amount payable to the Territory. A waiver is the relinquishment of a legal claim to a debt over which the Directorate has control. The write-off of a debt is the accounting action taken to remove a debt from the books but does not relinquish the legal right of the Directorate to recover the amount. The write-off of debts may occur for reasons other than waivers. The waivers, impairment losses and write-offs listed below have occurred during the reporting period for the Directorate.

The increase is due to the Treasurer's decision, in 2013, to grant a debtor a 50 per cent waiver of debt owed for hospital treatment on compassionate grounds. b. This is largely attributable to lower levels of ineligible (those not covered by Medicare) and compensable patients' debts, that are impaired. c. The increase is mainly attributable to medical and surgical equipment that has been assessed as not operating efficiently, or is under repair or cannot be located within the campus. d. The decrease mainly relates to lower number of high value write-offs in 2013.Section A Performance and financial reporting 57 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 21.

'Past Due - Greater Than 60 Days are mostly third party, workers' compensation or public liability transactions which have become the subject of legal claims as to responsibility for the payment. Substantial delays can therefore occur before liability for such debts is determined. This also includes amounts receivable from Calvary Health Care for medical officers seconded from the Canberra Hospital. f. The increase in the overdue amounts in 2013 is largely attributable to payments due from Calvary Health Care. g. Cross Border receivables is funding due from the New South Wales Ministry of Health for admitted and non-admitted patient services provided to residents of New South Wales. This is categorised as not overdue as the funding agreement does not mandate a timeframe for payment prior to final acquittal of activity numbers for each period and the final acquittals are yet to occur.

Capital Works in Progress Capital Works in Progress are assets being constructed over periods of time in excess of the present reporting period. These assets often require extensive installation work or integration with other assets, and contrast with simpler assets that are ready for use when acquired, such as motor vehicles and equipment. Capital Works in Progress are not depreciated as the Directorate is not currently deriving any economic benefits from them. Assets, which are under construction, include hospital buildings, community health centres and computer software. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Building Works in Progressa186,265 177,252 Plant and Equipment Works in Progressb915 154 Computer Software Works in Progressc54,398 40,641 Other Works in Progress 58 188 Total Capital Works in Progress 241,636 218,235 a. The increase in building works in progress is mainly for works carried out on the Community Health Centres in Belconnen and Tuggeranong, the Canberra Region Cancer Centre, the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, for Clinical Services Redevelopment, the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit, and various capital upgrade projects. b. The increase in plant and equipment works in progress is due to the commencement of the Improving Critical Care Outreach and Training in the ACT and Southern NSW Project. This project is to provide access to a range of visual and audio communication tools to assist in the decision making and provision of medical care for critically ill patients. c. The increase in computer software works in progress is mainly for the e-Health project which is providing the information technology and communication systems needed to support the Health Infrastructure Program and National E-Health Program, the Identity Access Management project which is providing a system that automates and manages identity and access to information, and the Digital Mammography project which is changing the breast screening system from analogue (hard copy) to digital (soft copy).

This mainly relates to Shared Services Procurement invoices for progress payment of capital works. These payments were delayed to ensure adequate cash availability for non-ACT Government suppliers. c. The delay is mainly due to disputed invoices.68 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 33. Finance Leases The Directorate has 351 finance leases, which have been taken up as a finance lease liability and an asset under a finance lease. These leases are for motor vehicles. The interest rate implicit in these leases vary from 4.35% to 7.99% and the terms vary from 1 year to 5 years. These leases allow for extensions, but have no terms of renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Current Finance Leases Secured Finance Leases 2,315 3,288 Total Current Finance Leases 2,315 3,288 Non-Current Finance Finance Leasesa4,162 1,802 Leases 4,162 1,802 Total Finance Leases 6,477 5,090 Secured Liability The Directorate's finance lease liability is effectively secured because, if the Directorate defaults, the assets under a financial lease revert to the lessor. a. The increase in non-current finance leases is due to the cyclic nature of the motor vehicles which are generally on a 3 year lease. In 2012-13 Health Directorate acquired 185 new motor vehicle leases and disposed of 164 old motor vehicle finance leases which results in a larger non-current balance. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Finance lease commitments are payable as follows: Within one year 2,613 3,513 Later than one year but not later than five years 4,412 1,905 Minimum Lease Payments 7,025 5,418 Less: Future Finance Lease Charges (548) (328) Amount Recognised as a Liability 6,477 5,090 Add: Lease incentive involved with non-cancellable operating lease - - Total Present Value of Minimum Lease Payments 6,477 5,090 The present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: Within one year 2,613 3,288 Later than one year but not later than five years 3,864 1,802 Total Present Value of Minimum Lease Payments 6,477 5,090 Classification on the Balance Sheet Finance Leases Current Finance Leases 2,315 3,288 Non-Current Finance Leases 4,162 1,802 Total Finance Leases 6,477 5,090Section A Performance and financial reporting 69 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 34.

The increase is mainly due to the impact of collective agreement pay rises and an increase in staff numbers for growth in services and the growth in liability due to leave consumption not in line with leave earned. b. The increase is mainly due to the impact of collective agreement pay rises and an increase in staff numbers for growth in services and the growth in liability due to leave consumption not in line with leave earned, which was partially offset by the impact of a reduction in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave payments from 106.6% to 101.3%. c. The increase is due to an additional day's pay accrued in 2013 compared to 2012. d. The reduction in non-current long service leave liabilities is mainly due to a reduction in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave payments from 106.6% to 101.3%.

Other Provisions Provision for Make Good The Directorate entered into lease agreements for some office space in Civic and Belconnen. There are clauses within the lease agreements which require the Directorate, upon cessation of the tenancy, to return the office space to the condition it was in before it was leased (this is referred to as 'make good').

Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate does not hold any financial liabilities with floating interest rates, the Directorate is therefore not exposed to movements in interest payable. The Directorate is, however, exposed to movements in interest rates on amounts held in Cash at Bank. Interest rate risk for financial assets is managed by the Directorate by only investing in floating interest rate investments that are low risk. There have been no changes in risk exposure or processes for managing risk since last financial reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken as it is considered that the Directorate's exposure to this risk is insignificant and would have an insignificant impact on its financial results. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets it holds net of any allowance for impairment. The Directorate expects to collect all financial assets that are not past due or impaired. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for cash at bank by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker, Westpac Banking Corporation. In 2012-13 as part of the Whole-of-Government banking arrangements, the Directorate transitioned banking services from the Commonwealth Bank to Westpac Banking Corporation. Both of these banks hold a AA- issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for investments by only investing surplus funds with the Territory Banking Account, which has appropriate investment criteria for the external fund manager engaged to manage the Territory's surplus funds. The Directorate's receivables are predominantly from insurance companies, ACT Government and State (mainly New South Wales) and the Commonwealth Governments. As the Commonwealth Government and New South Wales Government have a AAA credit rating it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for those receivables. Credit risk for receivables with the New South Wales Ministry of Health, which are for provision of services to patients who reside in New South Wales is managed by having an agreement in place, providing required activity data in a timely manner and requiring provisional payments for these activities. There has been no change in credit risk exposure since last reporting period.72 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 38. Financial Instruments (Continued) Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. The Directorate's financial obligations relate to the payment of grants and the purchase of supplies and services. Grants are paid on a quarterly basis and purchases of supplies and services are paid within 30 days of receiving the goods or services. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is appropriation from the ACT Government which is paid on a fortnightly basis during the year. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting appropriation drawdown requirements to enable payment of anticipated obligations. See the maturity analysis provided later in this note for further details of when financial assets and liabilities mature. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is considered insignificant based on experience from prior years and the current assessment of risk. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded into the market. The only price risk the Directorate is exposed to results from its investment in the Fixed Interest Portfolio. The Directorate has units in the Fixed Interest Portfolio that fluctuate in value. The price fluctuation in the units of the portfolio is caused by movements in the underlying investments of the portfolio. The underlying investments are managed by an external fund manager who invests in a variety of different securities, including bonds issued by the Commonwealth Government, the State Government guaranteed treasury corporations and semi-government authorities, as well as investment-grade corporate issues. The Directorate's exposure to price risk and the management of this risk has not changed since last reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the price risk of the Directorate as it has been determined that the possible impact on profit and loss or total equity from fluctuations in price is immaterial. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period are: Carrying Amount 2013 $'000Fair Value 2013 $'000Carrying Amount 2012 $'000Fair Value 2012 $'000 Financial Assets Cash Receivables 122,304 94,250 85,050 85,050Section A Performance and financial reporting 73 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 38. Financial Instruments (Continued) Fair Value Hierarchy The Directorate is required to classify financial assets and financial liabilities into a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining their fair value. The fair value hierarchy is made up of the following three levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability; either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The carrying amount of financial assets measured at fair value, as well as the methods used to estimate the fair value are summarised in the table below. All other financial assets and liabilities are measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at amortised cost and as such are not included in the table below. 2013 Classification According to Fair Value Hierarchy Level 1 $'000Level 2 $'000Level 3 $'000Total $'000 Financial Assets Investment with the Territory Banking Account - Fixed Interest Portfolio Account3,011 - 3,011 - 3,011 - 3,011 Transfer Between Categories There have been no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the reporting period. 2012 Classification According to Fair Value Hierarchy Level 1 $'000Level 2 $'000Level 3 $'000Total $'000 Financial Assets Investment with the Territory Banking Account - Fixed Interest Portfolio Account- 2,990 - 2,990 - 2,990 - 2,990 Transfer Between Categories There have been no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the reporting period.74 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 38.

The decrease is a result of less capital works funding appropriated in 2013. Operating Lease Commitments The Directorate has several non-cancellable operating leases for buildings. The operating lease agreements give the Directorate the right to renew the leases. Renegotiations of the lease terms occur on renewal of the leases. The Directorate also has non-cancellable operating leases with Shared Services for IT equipment. Contingent rental payments have not been included in the commitments below. Non-cancellable operating lease commitments are payable as follows:2013 $'0002012 $'000 Within one year 7,830 7,290 Later than one year but not later than five years 16,974 21,135 Total Operating Lease Commitments 24,804 28,425 Other Commitments Other commitments contracted at reporting date mainly relate to grants to Non-Government Organisations that have not been recognised as liabilities.

Contingent Liabilities Contingent Liabilities The Directorate is currently defending 123 actions (2012 - 142 actions). These actions have an estimated net liability of $5,190,000 (2012 - $5,530,000), which has not been provided for in the accounts. The estimated liability has been calculated net of the amounts covered under the Directorate's insurance policy. The reduction in the estimated net liability is due to the ACT Insurance Authority's acceptance, in 2012, of one previously declined high cost insurance claim. There were no contingent assets as at 30 June 2013.78 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 41.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Territorial The Directorate's accounting policies are contained in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The policies outlined in Note 2 apply to both the Controlled and Territorial financial statements. Note 45. Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory - Territorial Under the Financial Management Act 1996, funds can be appropriated for expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory. The Directorate receives this appropriation to fund a number of expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory, being on-passing of appropriated funds for capital funding for Calvary Public Hospital.

This relates to capital upgrades at Calvary Hospital. The decrease reflects that the payment in 2012 included some of the 2011 capital upgrades funding. Note 46. Fees - Territorial Fee refers to the collection of licence fees, including from food businesses, smoke free places, boarding houses and radiation equipment. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Fees Fees for Regulatory Servicesa1,094 794 Total Fees 1,094 794 a. The increase is mainly due to price escalation increases, growth in licence numbers and the introduction of licences for pharmacies.Section A Performance and financial reporting 87 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 47. Grants and Purchased Services - Territorial Grants are amounts provided by the Directorate, to ACT Government entities and non-ACT Government entities for general assistance or for a particular purpose. Grants may be for capital, current or re-current purposes and the name or category reflects the use of the grant. The grants given are usually subject to terms and conditions set out in a contract, correspondence, or by legislation. 2013 $'0002012 $'000 Capital Grants to External Parties - Calvary Hospitala746 727 Total Grants and Purchased Services 746 727 a.

Financial Instruments - Territorial Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 44: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Territorial. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate has all of its Territorial financial assets and financial liabilities held in non-interest bearing arrangements. This means that the Directorate is not exposed to movements in interest rates, and, as such does not have any interest rate risk. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the interest rate risk of the Directorate as it is not exposed to movements in interest rates. 90 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 53. Financial Instruments - Territorial (Continued) Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets held. The Directorate's Territorial financial assets mostly consist of Cash and Cash Equivalents. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for cash at bank by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker. In 2012-13 as part of the Whole-of-Government banking arrangements, the Directorate transitioned banking services from the Commonwealth Bank to Westpac Banking Corporation. Both of these banks hold a AA- issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Directorate's only Territorial financial obligation relates to an advance received from the Territory Banking Account where there is no requirement to repay the advance within the next twelve months. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is therefore insignificant. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no investments on behalf of the Territory that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken.

The key strategic priority for acute services is to deliver timely access to effective and safe hospital care services. This means focussing on: implementing work arising from the National Health Reform Agreement which the Commonwealth Government has put into place through a number of national partnerships and agreements with the aim of improving services to the Australian community; strategies to improve access to emergency services; meeting the demand for elective surgery in the Territory and reducing the number of people waiting longer than recommended standard waiting times; strategies to meet performance targets for the emergency department and elective and emergency surgery; and continuing to increase the capacity of acute care services in the ACT and surrounding region.

Category one patients are those assessed by the treating medical officer as the highest priority for elective surgery requiring surgery within 30 days of being listed on the elective surgery waiting list. In line with national definitions, the 30-day recommended waiting time for category one patients commences from when the hospital accepts the patient's 'request for admission' from the treating medical officer and is placed on the hospital's elective surgery waiting list. The time does not start from the date a patient is initially assessed by the treating medical officer as the Directorate cannot control the time taken by the treating medical officer to submit complete documentation to the hospital to place them on the elective surgery waiting list. 4. The number of allied health services to inpatients within the Canberra Hospital. 5.

This service works with its community partners to provide integrated and responsive care to a range of services including hospital based specialist services, supported accommodation services and community based service responses. The key strategic priorities for Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services are ensuring that clients' needs are met in a timely fashion and that care is integrated across hospital, community, and residential support services. This means focussing on: ensuring timely access to emergency mental health care by reducing waiting times for urgent admissions to acute psychiatric units; ensuring that public mental health services in the ACT provide consumers with appropriate assessment, treatment and care that result in improved mental health outcomes; and providing hospital and community based alcohol and drug services and health care assessments for people detained in corrective facilities. Original Target 2012-13Actual Result 2012-13% Variance from Original Target Explanation of Notes Total cost ($000's) 117,504 114,338 (3%)The variance relates to staff vacancies and a delayed opening of a planned older persons step- up step-down sub-acute service.

Some strategic indicators which were reported in 2011-12 have been deleted from the 2012-13 set of strategic indicators. The strategic indicators relating to emergency department access block were deleted, as they are no longer consistent with national reporting or reporting under the national health reforms. The strategic indicators relating to discharge planning have also been deleted, as they are not reflective of wider discharge planning services. Strategic objective 1: Removals from waiting list for elective surgery This refers to the number of people removed from the ACT elective surgery waiting lists managed by ACT public hospitals. This may include public patients treated in private hospitals. Strategic indicator 1: Number of people removed from waiting list 2012-13 target 2012-13 result People removed from the ACT elective surgery waiting list 11,000 11,579 In order to improve access to elective surgery, the Commonwealth and state and territory governments have entered into a partnership to significantly increase the number of elective surgery operations provided in our public hospitals each year and reduce the number of people waiting more than clinically recommended times for that surgery. As part of this program, the Commonwealth and the ACT governments have committed funds to specifically increase access to surgery from 2009-10 to 2012-13.

Population projections suggest that the ACT population is ageing faster than that of other jurisdictions. The median age of the ACT population (34.5 years in 2011) has increased 6.4 years since 1985. While people of all ages can present with chronic disease, the ageing of the population and its longer lifespan mean that chronic diseases will place major demands on the health system for workforce and financial resources. Strategic objective 8: Lower than national average prevalence of diabetes Strategic indicator 8: The proportion of the ACT population diagnosed with some form of diabetes Diabetes ACT rate National rate Prevalence of diabetes in the ACT 3.8% 3.7% Source: Australian Health Survey: First Results, 2011-12, cat. no: 4364.0.55.001, ABS, Canberra. This provides an indication of the success of prevention and early intervention initiatives. The self-reported prevalence of diabetes in Australia has more than doubled over the past 25 years. Prevalence rates may increase in the short term as a result of early intervention and detection campaigns. This would be a positive result, as experts predict that only half of those with diabetes are aware of their condition. This can have significant impacts on their long-term health.110 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Strategic objective 9: Higher than national average proportion of government recurrent health funding expenditure on public health activities Strategic indicator 9: Proportion of government recurrent health funding expenditure on public health activities Improvements in the prevention of diseases can reduce longer-term impacts on the health system, particularly for people with chronic diseases.

In 2011-12, the ACT rate of admissions in persons aged 75 years and over with a fractured neck of femur was 6.6 per 1,000 ACT population. This is slightly higher than the previous rate of 5.3 in 2010-11; however, the difference is not statistically significant. This is within the long-term target and follows the generally decreasing trend since 2001-02. 2011-12 outcome Long-term target Rate per 1,000 people 6.6 5.3 The low numbers of patients included in this calculation means that the rate of broken hips in older persons should be read with caution.

These range across support for National Health Reforms and National Partnership Agreements, strategies for attraction and retention of the health workforce, and development and maintenance of critical physical and technological infrastructure for our hospitals and health services. Highlights for this reporting period for Strategy and Corporate, which may not appear elsewhere in this report, are set out below. Professional leadership Pending finalisation of a review of the 2011 restructure, interim arrangements were put into place following the departure of previous incumbents of senior clinical leadership positions. ACT Health took the opportunity to amalgamate the Principal Medical Advisor role with that of the Executive Director, Medical Services, and the Chief Nurse role with that of the Executive Director, Nursing and Midwifery. eHealth The eHealth and Clinical Records Branch administers the ICT strategy within ACT Health and is responsible for the implementation of the technologies to support the $90 million ACT Health Your health\u2014Our priority program of work entitled 'Health-e Futures'. In addition to the projects within Health-e Futures, managed under the three areas of Clinical Systems, Support Systems, and Digital Health Infrastructure, the branch was responsible for successful completion of the first public hospital connection to the national Personally Controlled Electronic Health Health Record (PCEHR) during the reporting period. Healthcare consumers who are admitted to the Canberra Hospital can now elect to have their discharge summary sent to their national eHealth record. With the ACT being the first jurisdiction to submit discharge summaries to the national eHealth record system, and ACT Health being the second healthcare organisation to achieve this milestone, ACT Health is leading the way for healthcare organisations across the country. Locally, the rollout of the ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS) to the Calvary Hospital in 2012 laid the foundation for introduction at Calvary of a variety of proven clinical systems used by ACT Health. The use of common systems enhances the networking of services across the territory for the benefit of patients and clinicians alike. The Concerto Clinical Portal is one example. Designed to provide a single point of access for clinical information, the portal enables staff from both the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Hospital to view episode information, allergies, alerts, radiology and pathology results, and discharge summaries created within it. This will greatly improve access to timely information to assist with clinical decisions. Similarly, Metavision, the Intensive Care Clinical Information System at the Canberra Hospital, enables staff to manage all clinical documentation electronically, integrates with the clinical modalities and provides them with a complete view of patient health information at the point of care. This recently implemented application at Calvary Hospital now provides a shared view of care for the Intensive Care Staff Specialists treating the patients. Infrastructure In addition to the completion of a number of major capital development projects ( see section C.14 Capital works ), branches across the directorate collaborated to deliver a variety of other projects for the benefit of consumers of our health services.116 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Duffy House In October 2011, a house in Duffy was purchased to provide a home-away-from-home environment for regional cancer outpatients and their carers during treatment at Canberra Hospital, less than 10 kilometres away. The Australian Government provided $1.8 million for the property's purchase, extensive renovations, special furniture and equipment, landscaping and fit-out of the facility, which was opened to its first residents on 6 September 2012. Youth Mental Health Step-Up, Step-Down residential service In late 2012, a house in Kambah was purchased with funding support from the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services to provide a Youth (18-25-year- olds) Mental Health Step-Up, Step-Down residential accommodation service. The service, which opened on 6 March 2013, operates under a partnership arrangement between the ACT Health clinical mental health service and the community mental health service provider, the Mental Illness Fellowship of Victoria. The six-bed residence offers 24-hour support seven days per week and provides additional clinical and psychosocial support for young people who either require transition between an acute admission to hospital and their home, or have a deteriorating mental illness and require treatment and support of a type that cannot readily be provided at home but which does not require a hospital admission. The service completes the continuum of sub-acute mental health care between the two existing step-up step-down services currently operating for the 13-17-year-old and 26-64-year-old age groups. MyMeal In the Business and Infrastructure branch, the Food Services section introduced MyMeal\u2014a fully integrated food service management system to improve the quality and efficiency of ordering and delivery of meals to patients within the Canberra Hospital, thereby enhancing the patient's journey. The MyMeal system underpins Canberra Hospital's ability to order safe and nutritious meals and deliver them to the right patient at the right time, as well as assisting with the management of the 1.3 million patient, client and cafeteria meals produced by Food Services annually. Local Health Network performance In 2011, COAG agreed to the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) to address changing and growing health care needs, nationally and for the ACT. The agreement provided for substantial increases in Commonwealth funding for the ACT . Key components of the reforms were the establishment of Local Hospital Networks (LHNs), comprising small groups of public hospitals with a geographic or functional connection, and a National Health Funding Body to administer payments for hospital services between the Commonwealth and participating states and territories. In March 2011 the ACT Legislative Assembly passed amendments to the Health Act 1993 that provided for the establishment of the ACT LHN and a skill-based ACT LHN Council. In February 2013 the Assembly passed complementary legislation establishing the banking and financial infrastructure that enables funds to be made payable to the ACT by the Administrator of the National Health Funding Pool. The ACT LHN consists of a networked system of service contracts between ACT Health and Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House and the Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. Throughout the reporting period, ACT Health's Performance and Information Branch and Policy and Government Relations Branch have continued to refine data analysis and reporting capability to support these new arrangements, as evidenced by quarterly reports provided to the ACT LHN Council. The ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate financial and performance statements are provided as an annexure to this annual report at page 314.Section A Performance and financial reporting 117 Workforce It was particularly pleasing during the reporting period to have finalised the ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-18 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018. The former forges local linkages with national initiatives by describing local workforce issues and actions under the rubric of the domains identified in Health Workforce Australia's National Health Workforce Innovation and Reform Strategic Framework for Action 2011-2015. The latter responds directly to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework 2011-2015 and the ACT Public Service Employment Strategy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People\u2014Building a culturally diverse workforce 2010 . Refinement and updating of our Learning and Development Framework and the Essential Education Policy has also strengthened the support provided to our workforce. Canberra Hospital and Health Services overview Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CH&HS) provides acute, sub-acute, primary and community-based health services to the ACT and surrounding region. CHHS consists of eight divisions: Surgery & Oral Health, Women Youth & Children, Critical Care, Capital Region Cancer Service, Rehabilitation, Aged & Community Care, Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol & Drug Service, Pathology and Medicine. A comprehensive range of services are delivered from the Canberra Hospital campus, including acute inpatient and day services, outpatient and pathology services. Community-based services include early childhood, youth and women's health, dental health, rehabilitation and community care, mental health care, and alcohol and drug services. In addition, justice health services are provided within the territory's detention facilities. Strong links are maintained between hospital and community-based services, as many of the community-based services are provided from various venues across the ACT, including community health centres, child and family centres, schools and in people's homes. Canberra Hospital and Health Services liaises closely with Calvary Public Hospital to ensure effective coordination of services across the territory and delivery of required outputs. A number of CHHS divisions provide services within the Calvary Public Hospital facilities and many of the community-based services liaise closely to ensure that a seamless service is provided. Significant achievements for CHHS over the past year include the completion of the new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children. Patients were moved into the new hospital in August 2012 and it was a significant milestone to move patients from the old area to the new area without incident. The move included moving babies from within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. This move was a carefully planned and considered process, which included communication strategies to ensure that the safety of the patients and staff was upheld as the highest priority. The new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children features state-of-the-art equipment and infrastructure and is an impressive building, delivering high-level care to women, children and adolescents. As part of the National Elective Surgery Targets (NEST), the ACT was required to remove 11,000 people from the surgical waiting list. The Canberra Hospital component of this target was 6,300 removals. The Canberra Hospital exceeded this target by delivering 6,464 removals from the list. This contributed to the ACT meeting the NEST targets. A report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the ACT was the only jurisdiction to meet all three components of the national elective surgery targets. In addition, the Canberra Hospital is currently admitting 81 per cent of patients for surgery within standard waiting times. This is a 10 per cent improvement on the same period last year. Activity throughout the Canberra Hospital has increased over the past year, which has increased pressure on both inpatient and outpatient areas. The Canberra Hospital Emergency Department had a total of 65,815 presentations over the 2012-13 financial year, an increase on the previous year. A number of initiatives have been put in place to help manage increasing levels of activity within the emergency department and across the hospital. 118 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 These include: 'front loading'\u2014whereby patients can be assessed and treated by a doctor more rapidly expansion of the Canberra Hospital Discharge Lounge, which enables patients to leave the inpatient wards earlier, which in turn opens up inpatient beds quicker, allowing for increased access purchasing beds at Monash Goodwin Village for sub-acute patients with an extended length of stay. This enables acute beds to be made available for patients who need to be in an acute setting. Managing increased demand requires a whole-of-hospital approach. The hospital frequently operates at capacity and regularly deals with increases in activity. Work will continue over the next financial year to initiate a number of hospital-wide changes that will further improve patient flow. Canberra Hospital and Health Services also opened the new Gungahlin Community Health Centre in September 2012. This progressive development provides a range of services to residents who live in or near Gungahlin. The centre offers access to community nursing, allied health services, including physiotherapy and podiatry, dental surgeries for children and youth, and a range of services for women and children including a women's health nurse and nutrition clinic. The centre incorporates many environmentally sustainable design principles, such as energy- efficient lighting systems, fresh-air ventilation, air-cooled chillers (rather than water-cooled ones), cyclist facilities, and stormwater retention tanks beneath the surface-level car park, which capture water for irrigating the landscaped areas. Another significant achievement for CHHS was our progress in reducing the public dental waiting list. In 2012-13 the federal Government allocated $345.9 million over three years to reduce the public dental waiting list across Australia. The funding has increased workforce capacity and increased utilisation of the private sector to reduce public dental waiting lists. At 30 June 2013, there were 165 people waiting for non-urgent restorative dental services, compared with 2,310 clients on the waiting list at 30 June 2012. At 30 June 2013, 2,447 clients were removed from the restorative waiting list, compared with 1,856 at 30 June 2012. This is an increase in clients being removed of 591 in 12 months\u2014a significant achievement. Canberra Hospital and Health Services is also under new leadership, following the appointment of Mr Ian Thompson in August 2012. Section A Performance and financial reporting 119 Output 1.1 Acute Services Output description The Government provides public hospital services at Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital. These public hospitals provide a comprehensive range of acute care, including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department services. The key strategic priority for acute services is to deliver timely access to effective and safe hospital care services. This means focusing on: implementing work arising from the National Health Reform Agreement which the Commonwealth Government has put into place through a number of national partnerships and agreements with the aim of improving services to the Australian community; strategies to improve access to emergency services under the National Health Reform; meeting the increasing demand for elective surgery in the Territory and reduce the number of people waiting longer than recommended standard waiting times; strategies to meet performance targets for the emergency department and elective and emergency surgery; and continuing to increase the capacity of acute care services within the ACT and surrounding region. Both Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital are part of the ACT Local Hospital Network. Section A9 reflects acute services delivered by the ACT Local Hospital Network. Increasing the capacity of the ACT Public Health Services More beds to manage increasing demand for hospital services The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reported that in 2011-12, ACT public hospitals provided an average of 939 beds. In 2012-13, an additional 47 beds were introduced, providing an estimated capacity of 986 beds. The ACT Government has proposed funding for another 39 inpatient beds in 2013-14, including: 16 general inpatient beds at Canberra Hospital 15 general inpatient beds at Calvary Public Hospital an 8-bed Rapid Assessment and Planning Unit to be established at Calvary Public Hospital. This equates to an extra 355 beds since 2001-02. In addition there has been a considerable expansion to the Hospital in the Home service, with the addition of 15 bed equivalents in 2012-13. 120 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT public hospitals Bed capacity by year 670 682 683 679 714 785 2013-14*2012-13*2011-122010-112009-102008-092007-082006-072005-062004-052003-042002-032001-02 * 2012-13 and 2013-14 figures provides estimated impact of Government investment in additional capacity. Source: Australian Hospital Statistics, AIHW, 2012-02 to 2011-2012 publications. The ACT Government continues its commitment to adding bed capacity to the public hospital system to meet growing demand for care and to reduce bed occupancy to optimum levels. In 2012-13, the ACT's public hospitals provided 87,969 cost-weighted separations within Acute Care Services (which includes general hospital services and private hospital contracted patients but excludes hospital services provided by Mental Health ACT, the Capital Region Cancer Service and the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Service). This represents a 2 per cent increase in cost-weighted separations in 2012-13 compared with 2011-12. ACT public hospitals Inpatient Admitted Patient Source: Admitted patient care A Performance and financial reporting 121 In 2012-13, ACT's public hospitals provided over 277,988 overnight hospital bed days of care, 1 per cent up on the total of 274,851 in 2011-12. The Australian Hospital Statistics Report for 2011-12 issued by the AIHW in April 2013 showed that the ACT had achieved the national average in providing public hospital bed availability for the third time in the almost 21 years of reporting by the AIHW. ACT Health reached 2.6 public hospital beds per 1000 people\u2014which is on par with the Australian national average.

The Australian Government's long-term target is to maintain bed occupancy levels at around 85 per cent, which is considered the best level for best patient outcomes and to achieve maximum efficiency. However, with increasing pressure on ACT public hospitals each year, the target for this indicator in 2013-14 has been revised to 90 per cent. This will allow for the necessary infrastructure and process improvement to take effect which will make for more realistic transition for ACT public hospitals to achieve the 85 per cent in coming years. The additional 39 beds funded in the 2013-14 budget should assist in reducing bed occupancy rates towards the 90 per cent target.

Over recent years, there have been significant increases in the demand for non-admitted outpatient services. In 2012-13, Outpatient Services experienced a 6 per cent growth in outpatient occasions of service compared with 2011-12. However, since 2009-10, demand for these services has grown by 18 per cent at both Canberra and Calvary hospitals. In response to this growth, resources have been committed to improve the function and processes of Outpatient Services.

The ACT rate of 26 per cent in 2010-11 was lower than most recent national figures published by the AIHW, for 2007-08. ACT public hospitals continue to have a low Caesarean rate compared to benchmarking hospitals. The main strategy is to move towards further implementation of the 'continuity of maternity model of care' which has proven improved clinical outcomes for woman\u2014such as reduced rate of Caesareans. The ACT Government has also provided an additional $2 million in 2010-11 and $1.5 million in 2011-12 to enhance obstetric and gynaecological services and neonatal services. The Continuity at the Canberra Hospital (CatCH) Program began in 2011 as a second continuity-of-care model at the Canberra Hospital. In 2012-13, a Community Midwifery Program (CMP) at Calvary Public Hospital will be established to further enhance obstetric services at Calvary. Operations in ACT public hospitals Over the past three years, the number of surgical operations performed at ACT Health public hospitals has jumped by 13 per cent, from 16,312 in 2009-10 to 18,469 in 2012-13. Around 30 per cent of the emergency and elective surgical operations are performed on people from New South Wales.124 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Public Hospitals Total surgical operations performed (elective and surgery) 2012-13 2011-12 2010-11 2009-10 18,469 29% 16,31217,93518,232 Source: Admitted patient Access to elective surgery ACT public hospitals provided 11,579 elective surgery procedures in 2012-13. This is the highest number in a year of patients accessing elective surgery in the ACT. This is also the third consecutive year that ACT Health has provided for over 11,000 elective surgery procedures. The 2012-13 result of 11,579 is an 18 per cent increase over the figure of 9,778 in 2009-10. This achievement was aided through utilising the private sector, and was part of the strategy to maintain the high level of throughput for elective surgery in the ACT\u2014particularly in the specialties of ear, nose and throat surgery, urology surgery and orthopaedic surgery. In 2010-11, approximately 171 patients accessed elective surgery under these arrangements. An additional 366 people accessed elective surgery under this agreement in 2011-12 and over 2012-13 a further 191 patients had elective surgery which makes a total of 761 patients since this initiative was first established. ACT Public Hospitals Number of elective surgery operations performed 2012-13 2011-12 11,300 Source: Elective surgery waiting list datasetSection A Performance and financial reporting 125 In addition to the work contracted by the private sector, the ACT Government and Southern New South Wales Local Health District have commenced utilisation of Queanbeyan Hospital to provide elective surgery capacity purchased by the ACT. In 2012-13, a total of 69 patients accessed elective surgery at Queanbeyan Hospital, covering urological and gynaecological procedures. As a result of the increased access to elective surgery, the number of people waiting to access elective surgery has reduced to 3,943 people on the waiting list at 30 June 2013. This is a 1 per cent reduction compared with the same period last year, and a 26 per cent decrease compared with 2009-10. The increased access to elective surgery has also meant that the number of people waiting beyond the clinically recommended timeframes for their surgery has seen significant reductions, with a total of 705 patients waiting at 30 June 2013. This has resulted in a 21 per cent reduction in the number of overdue patients in just 12 months, and a 68 per cent reduction on the 2,220 reported for June 2010. While the result of 705 is pleasing, it is still too high. ACT Health's commitment to improving access to elective surgery will result in this number reducing in future reports. The ACT Government will provide over $12 million over the next four years to meet the growing demand for surgical services in ACT public hospitals.

This ensures that any improvement or deterioration in the way the directorate manages the elective surgery waiting list is evident, so it can adjust management to improve access as required. The result of 51 days reported for 2012-13 is a vast improvement on the 77 days reported in 2010-11, which is evidence that this approach is paying off.

Presentations within triage categories one and five are currently meeting national targets. Targets were not reached for triage category two, three or four presentations. While there has been growth in the number of presentations to the EDs, there has been a 12 per cent decrease in non-urgent category five presentations. This reflects a significant increase in higher acuity presentations and increasing pressure on ED resources and can restrict the ability to see and treat lower acuity presentations in a timely manner.

Recent initiatives implemented to improve timely access to emergency services include: 'front loading'\u2014where patients can be assessed and treated by an ED doctor more rapidly the expansion of the Canberra Hospital discharge lounge, which enables patients to leave the inpatient wards earlier, freeing up inpatient beds and allowing for increased access from the ED, and the purchase of beds at Monash Goodwin Village for sub-acute patients with an extended length of stay in the acute setting. The 2012-13 budget provides for an additional $12.7 million over the next four years to meet the growing demand for emergency care, including: an additional six treatment spaces at Calvary capital works at Canberra Hospital to expand the ED by six beds and to change the physical layout of the ED four cardiac assessment beds to provide rapid assessment for care for people who present to the ED with chest pain and associated cardiac issues an additional 47 inpatient beds across both public hospitals, which will allow for improved access to inpatient beds for patients in the ED. The ACT Government has also committed additional funding from 2013-14 to provide for: expansion of Canberra Hospital's Emergency Medicine Unit increasing the number of ED physicians at both Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital the establishment of a Rapid Assessment Unit at Calvary Public Hospital an additional 170 beds to the ACT public hospital system. In March 2013, the ACT Government tabled its Emergency Access Plan for 2013-17, which detailed actions to be implemented over the next four years to improve waiting and treatment times within ACT Health public hospital EDs. The plan recognises that improvements to ED times must include changes to the way the whole hospital works and improved partnerships between hospitals and community services.128 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Australia's first Walk-in-Centre The Walk-in-Centre (WiC), located on the campus of the Canberra Hospital at Garran, provides free treatment for people with minor illnesses or injuries. The WiC has been funded by the ACT and Australian governments. The WiC is designed to help people get fast, free, one-off treatment for minor illnesses and injuries. The people of Canberra are able to see a specialist nurse for advice, assessment and treatment for conditions such as cuts and bruises, minor infections, strains, sprains, skin complaints, and coughs and colds. In 2011-12 an independent evaluation report confirmed the WiC model to be a safe and effective means of providing primary health care services. The report also highlighted the improved access to free, extended hours primary health care services. ACT Health currently operates one WiC located on the campus of the Canberra Hospital. In 2012, the ACT Government made an election commitment to double the current budget for the WiC and expand the nurse-led WiCs to the community location in Belconnen and Tuggeranong. It is proposed that the two WiCs be located within the new Community Health Centres at Belconnen and Tuggeranong. Work on the WiC within the Tuggeranong Health Centre refurbishment will occur in 2014.

A visit report is sent to the patient's general practitioner with consent.130 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 People in the ACT community now have access to a wide range of primary health services including their GPs, EDs, community health services, pharmacists and the WiC. The operation of the WiC was evaluated externally after its first year of operation. ACT Health is responding to aspects of the WiC review that will enhance its efficiency, such as staffing profile and hours of operation, as well as effectiveness of service delivery. Patient attendances have increased consistently since the WiC opened and consumer feedback remains positive. National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services The Commonwealth will deliver an additional $67 million to the ACT under the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services for ED, elective surgery and sub-acute services. This agreement commenced on 1 January 2012. National Emergency Access Targets The main objective of National Emergency Access Targets (NEAT) is that 90 per cent of all patients presenting to a public hospital ED will be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. The targets will be staged in increments over the next 4 years to achieve the final target of 90 per cent. The first target was to be achieved by December 2012, with the target set at 64 per cent. In the 2012 calendar year (January 2012 to December 2012), ACT public hospitals reported 57 per cent of all patients had a length of stay less than four hours. This was 7 per cent below the target of 64 per cent. National reports on jurisdictional performance against NEAT targets showed that Western Australia was the only jurisdiction to meet their 2012 target. In the calendar year to end June 2013 (January 2013 to June 2013), ACT public hospitals have seen some improvement in NEAT performance, with a result of 58 per cent, against a target for the end of 2013 of 65 per cent. ACT Health expects further improvements in the future with: increased investment in infrastructure, including an additional 170 beds over the next four years physical redesigns of ED. At the same time, both public hospitals are undergoing continual redesign and process improvement initiatives to improve the way patients move into, through and out of the EDs. National Elective Surgery Targets There are three components to the National Elective Surgery Targets (NEST). These are aimed at ensuring timely access to surgery whilst reducing the number of patients waiting beyond clinically recommended timeframes. The final targets for all components of the NEST are to be met by December 2016; the first set of targets was to be achieved by December 2012. In the 2012 calendar year (January 2012 to December 2012) ACT Health was successful in meeting all three components of the NEST. On 27 February 2013, the AIHW released its first annual report on jurisdictional performance against emergency access and elective surgery targets. The report shows that the ACT was the only jurisdiction to successfully meet all three components of the NEST. Part 1 of the NEST refers to the proportion of patients who access their elective surgery procedure within clinically recommended timeframes. In the calendar year to June 2013 (January 2013 to June 2013), ACT public hospitals achieved the required targets for category one and three patients accessing their surgery on time. Category two patients did not meet the target reporting a result of 57 per cent of category two patients accessing surgery on time against a target of 66 per cent. Recent monthly results have seen an improvement, and work is ongoing to improve this result for future months.Section A Performance and financial reporting 131 Part 2A of the NEST is based on the requirement to reduce the average overdue waiting times for each category of patients so that there are no overdue patients by the conclusion of the agreement. In the calendar year to end June 2013 (January 2013 to June 2013), ACT public hospitals were on track to meet the required targets for urgency category one, two and three patients. Part 2B of the NEST is related to the removal of the top 10 per cent of longest waiting patients on the elective surgery waiting list. The Australian Government has issued ACT Health with the 2013 cohort of long-wait patients to have their surgery in 2013. In the calendar year to end June 2013 (January 2013 to June 2013), ACT public hospitals removed 76 per cent of the longest waiting patients from the list established at 31 December 2012, and remained on track to meet the end of 2013 target. Sub-acute care reform The sub-acute component is aimed at improving patient health outcomes, functional capacity and quality of life by increasing access to sub-acute care services including rehabilitation, palliative care, sub-acute mental health and geriatric evaluation and management, and psycho-geriatric services in both hospitals and the community. The ACT was required to build capacity for 11 sub-acute bed equivalents before 1 July 2012. Due to a lack of appropriate tender applications in relation to the ACT's sub-acute projects, the ACT added 6.9 bed equivalents to the system at the end of June 2012. However, to facilitate the process, ACT Health established a National Health Reform Steering Committee. This committee has worked on alternative models to attract additional service providers, as well as contingency plans in relation to this project. Over the 12 months of 2012-13, the planning into growth for sub-acute care services has paid off. The ACT has now delivered over 22 sub-acute bed equivalents into the system, above the June 2013 target of 16 bed equivalents. There is no financial reward or penalty associated with this target. Division of Critical Care The Division of Critical Care was formed following the restructure of ACT Health in February 2011. The division is responsible for the delivery of acute and critical care and retrieval services. These are provided as inpatient and outpatient services at the Canberra Hospital, with a strong emphasis on accessible and timely care, delivered to a high standard of safety and quality. This is underpinned by the division's commitments to research and training. The division includes the Retrieval Service (both road and air), Emergency Department (ED), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Access Unit, Surgical Short Stay Unit, Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU), and Surgical Assessment and Planning Unit. Achievements ED nursing introduced a Mentor Matrix in 2012 to ensure that all nursing staff have support for feedback, goal setting and recognition of achievements. Since its implementation, there has been 100% per cent compliance with learning and achievement plans. The Medical Education Team collaborated in a cross-border learning initiative to develop and introduce an education website (www.canberraemergency.com.au ). This is available to all ED nursing, medical and allied health staff and has quickly become an excellent communication and education tool. ED Nursing Education Team arranged for Queanbeyan Emergency Staff to attend triage and resuscitation training workshops at Canberra Hospital. In September 2012, four additional ED treatment spaces were created. These are used to treat ambulatory patients with non-complex problems. The additional beds support the capacity requirements for the ED to provide quality, safe care and assist with meeting activity targets. The Optimal Capacity Escalation Plan was introduced to manage the unpredictable nature of the ED clinical volume and acuity through the implementation of efficient changes in bed management processes to maintain patient safety, including the forecasting of clinical workloads to assist in predicting future requirements for inpatient beds. A targeted education plan saw a significant improvement in the compliance rate with police blood testing requirements.132 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The ED, in conjunction with Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care, ran a Delirium Project to screen all patients older than 85 years presenting to the ED. The project achieved a greater understanding of the treatment of patients with a delirium diagnosis within an extremely busy ED and has improved the working relationship between the two departments. In November 2012, an additional two high-dependency beds were commissioned in the Intensive Care Unit. These have increased available capacity to 24 beds, expanding the ability of the Intensive Care Unit to optimally accept and treat 12 intensive care and eight high-dependency patients at any given time. A territory-wide approach to clinical leadership training for nursing and medical staff, with multiple leadership training opportunities, was implemented. A cascading mentorship structure was implemented in ICU to ensure all nursing staff participate in regular performance and feedback discussions, goal setting and recognition of achievements. The Medical Emergency Team (MET), in collaboration with the Deteriorating Patient Team, won the Quality Award for Care and Response Escalation (CARE) for patient safety and was a national finalist in the National Lead Clinicians Group Awards for Excellence in Innovative Implementation of Clinical Guidelines in 2013. A Volunteer Program was successfully introduced into the ICU waiting room to improve communication, support for families and orientation to the environment. On completion of her PhD, the Clinical Director of the ICU, Associate Professor Imogen Mitchell, received a Harkness Scholarship for Health and Policy Practice at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States. Associate Professor Frank Van Haren was appointed State Medical Director, DonateLife. Ms Jenny Rochow, ICU Nurse Unit Manager, received the Defence Reserves Support Council Employer Support Award. The relocation of the Discharge Lounge to level 2 of Building 1 has provided additional capacity, improved access to support services such as Pharmacy and made pick-up easier for relatives and transport services. The Access Unit received an Australia Day Team Achievement Award for the commitment and ability of staff to strive for excellence in service delivery in our health service system. Issues and challenges While the National Emergency Access Targets remain a challenge, senior ED staff continue to develop initiatives directed at internal departmental issues, with a view to achieving triage targets for all categories and streamlining the discharge pathway. ED and ICU continue to experience challenges associated with the increasing numbers of unplanned admissions after hours. MET is working with the Staff Development Unit to implement a more comprehensive advanced life support training program to meet the learning needs of multiple tiers of staff and provide opportunities to meet the demands of concurrent MET calls. Future directions The Division of Critical Care is working collaboratively with all hospital divisions to develop an ACT Health Winter Bed Strategy for the safety and isolation of patients during the flu season. The Division of Critical Care is working collaboratively with the Division of Women, Youth and Children to develop the Paediatric Short Stay Unit to enable paediatric patients to be admitted more quickly. Six new beds opened in the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU) in September 2012 have been allocated to provide capacity for the Medical Short Stay Ward (MSS). This initiative is directed at expediting the flow of patients with an undifferentiated medical condition from the ED to an inpatient area for further assessment and management, leading to improved patient care and safety, and efficiencies of service. The Division of Critical Care is working collaboratively with the Division of Medicine to develop the MSS model and undertaking ongoing work to provide timely admission for patients. The ACT Government has committed funds to establish a dedicated Paediatric Stream for children in the Canberra Hospital ED to provide an overall increase in treatment spaces.Section A Performance and financial reporting 133 A large Infection Control Quality Improvement Project in collaboration with the Infection Control Team is under way to reduce rates of infection in the ICU. A monthly scorecard, hand hygiene audits, environmental improvements and a comprehensive education strategy form part of the project to improve patient outcomes by reducing the transmission of infections between patients. An eight-bedroom MediHostel at the Canberra Hospital is on track to become operational in 2013. The MediHostel will provide high-quality, non-ward, hotel-style accommodation with nursing supervision to eligible consumers prior to or following their episode of acute care. In 2013, the Access Unit has expanded operational hours to provide seven-day cover, until 11 pm. The extended hours have enhanced service delivery, continuity, coordination and monitoring through a centralised point of contact for all patient flow activity. The Access Unit After-Hours Hospital Management Service was the beneficiary of a 2013 Practice Development Scholarship Award, which will provide resources for a review of its services. It is envisaged that the review will identify opportunities aimed at making resource efficiencies and implementing quality improvement initiatives. The University of Technology Sydney has engaged in a partnership project with ACT Health Ward 7B to undertake a study titled 'Effective clinical handover communication: improving patient safety, experiences and outcomes'. This innovative study project is due for completion in 2014 and aims to improve the safety of clinical handover practices, thereby reducing the number of adverse events. Division of Medicine The Division of Medicine provides a wide range of adult medicine services to the Canberra community in inpatient, outpatient and outreach settings. It also provides chronic disease management, infection control and pharmacy services. A strong emphasis is placed on accessible, timely and integrated care delivered to a high standard of safety and quality. The division has a strong commitment to teaching and research. Health students from several universities do practical placements within the division. Most of our senior medical staff also hold academic appointments in the Australian National University Medical School, and there are many active research programs in operation. Many members of the division also participate in the development of national professional guidelines and quality initiatives. Many units of the division work actively with community groups, other services and the private sector to improve the care of patients across the whole health system. Consumer representatives play a crucial role on our internal advisory committees. In the coming year, the division's services will expand to include more inpatient beds and an increase in Hospital in the Home provision. We will continue to develop innovative ways to provide the care that people need and ensure our patients have access to leading edge medical treatment. Over the next year, an emphasis will be placed on the care of acute medical admissions to Canberra Hospital and Health Services, including models of prevention of admission and the streamlining of discharge to appropriate services in the community with the further development of the Acute General Medicine Service. Achievements Endocrinology and Diabetes services In 2012-13, the ACT Health Diabetes Service made progress in restructuring and expanding its service to meet existing needs and the expected growth in service requirements due to increasing diabetes prevalence. The restructure was directed at improving the quality and efficiency of care to children, youth, pregnant women and adults in the ambulatory and acute care settings. The restructure included the following: establishing the ACT Health Diabetes Service Clinical Advisory to provide strategic direction and clinical governance establishing clinical teams in each of the service areas increasing the focus and development of clinical services to adolescents and young adults with diabetes addressing deficiencies in service levels for people with diabetes on the north side of the ACT.134 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The expansion of the ACT Health Diabetes Service involved the recruitment of three new part-time endocrinologists and a part-time social worker. At the Canberra Hospital, the Diabetes Service was enhanced by the opening of two new specialist medical consulting rooms and a second podiatry room. A northside ACT Diabetes Service Working Group (including consumer representation) was established to inform the development of an enhanced collaborative approach to diabetes prevention and care across all health care sectors for the community living on the north side of the ACT. The ACT Health Diabetes Service commenced clinical services at the Gungahlin Community Health Centre in November 2012. Services for women are being strengthened on the northside with the establishment of a new clinic for women with gestational diabetes. The ACT Health Diabetes Service increased its support to the Winnunga Aboriginal Health Service with the establishment of an endocrinologist clinic at Winnunga to support the existing nursing, nutrition and podiatry diabetes service. A Service Funding Agreement was established with the ACT Medicare Local for the Diabetes Link Project to improve the collaborative links between the primary care sector and the ACT Health Diabetes Service and foster a best practice care approach for all people with diabetes in the ACT. A project coordinator for the Diabetes Link Project was identified and will commence in mid-2013. Cardiology Services Procurement is underway for the purchase of a replacement state-of-the-art cardiac catheter laboratory. In addition, approval has been granted to purchase two echocardiography machines and the tender process is currently underway. The first stage of the integrated IT system has just been rolled out. This stage will provide an improved archiving process and ultimately a more secure reporting of echocardiography and better access to echocardiography results. This is the first step in a major upgrade. The recruitment process for a cardiologist specialising in echocardiography is underway to support this growing service. This is a key position that will assist with the upgrade of Canberra Hospital's echocardiography services. The Cardiology Department commenced the Chest Pain Evaluation Unit in April 2013. A large portion of patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) present with chest pain. Patients that are identified as requiring access to the Cardiac Catheter Laboratory for intervention are processed directly to the Cardiac Catheter Laboratory (CCL); however, those not requiring the CCL are transferred out of the ED in a more timely way. This process will allow for concentrated management and facilitation of investigation of these patients and therefore decrease times in ED. Renal Services The Renal Electronic Medical Record project is now operational and its use has steadily increased in all areas of the service. This project has improved renal service delivery by reducing duplication of data entry and improving communication between geographical sites and integration with other Health Directorate applications. Having a holistic view of patient data across the Renal Service allows for quality improvement in patient outcomes and will assist in further clinical research. The Renal Electronic Medical Record was launched in 2012 and has been rolled out to all dialysis units in the ACT and southern New South Wales. A renal network covering the ACT and Southern New South Wales Local Health District was established. Under this agreement, the Renal Service is providing governance to all dialysis centres in the Southern New South Wales Local Health District, including those in Queanbeyan, Goulburn, Moruya and Bega. The Renal Service is providing clinics to Goulburn, Moruya, Batemans Bay, Bega and Cooma and overseeing quality assurance across the area. A further achievement for renal services in 2012-13 was the completion of the self-care training facility at Gaunt Place and the Weston Self-Care Unit, established for those patients who are unable to dialyse at home. Chronic Disease Management Chronic Disease Management (CDM) is a multidisciplinary team within the Division of Medicine of Canberra Hospital and Health Services. CDM focuses on improving the management of patients with chronic disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), Parkinson's Disease and obesity. Section A Performance and financial reporting 135 Achievements for 2012-13 include the following: Due to increased service demand, a new approach to managing patients in the Care Coordination Service was implemented, leading to significantly increased productivity. The Chronic Disease Management Register (CDMR) was used to support research projects and generate multiple patient identification reports. In collaboration with the ACT Medicare Local, a pilot study was developed to test joint care planning between the Chronic Care Program of the CDMU and the primary health care sector. There was an increased uptake of advanced care planning (ACP) in the Chronic Care Program, with around half of case coordination patients having an ACP by June 2013. Neurology services The number of admissions to the Stroke Unit continues to rise each year, but this year the rise was offset by the creation of a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) clinic, which allowed appropriate urgent neurology patients to be seen on an outpatient basis. In addition to the TIA clinics, there was an expansion of capacity to meet demand for neurology outpatients, with increased registrar input into clinics. With the appointment of a third neurophysiology technician, the waiting time for an electro-encephalogram (EEG) was reduced in the past year, from eight months to less than a month. Clinical Forensic Medical Services Clinical Forensic Medical Services (CFMS) is the overarching service combining two services, Forensic and Medical Sexual Assault Care (FAMSAC), funded under ACT Health, and Clinical Forensics ACT (CFACT), funded under a tendered contractual arrangement between ACT Health and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). CFMS continued to expand CFACT services, meeting increased demand in response to AFP requirements. This included: the successful introduction of a seven-day-a-week nursing service to triage and attend consultations within scope of practice; increased medical expert reporting requirements for the ACT Coroner's Office; and complex reporting to police requesting medical information and toxicology reports in relation to driving under the influence. Adding to this was a recently signed agreement with New South Wales allowing CFMS to provide medical forensic services to the New South Wales Police in the Monaro Local Area Command. FAMSAC continued to provide care to victims of sexual assault in the ACT and surrounding New South Wales. FAMSAC also offers a service for injury documentation for victims of domestic violence. CFMS nursing staff commenced a service in 2013 to provide a weekly clinic within the drug and alcohol service for the purpose of blood-borne virus screening. Pharmacy Services A key indicator for pharmacy is the waiting time for discharge prescription processing. In 2012-13 the average wait time from receipt of the medication order to distribution of the medication order was less than 45 minutes. A significant recognition in allied health was attributed to the Pharmacy Department. Jessica Parker was the recipient of the 2012 Allied Health Award for Excellence and won the 2012 Allied Health Professional of the Year award. Closed System Transfer Devices (CSTD) were fully implemented in chemotherapy production, enhancing safety for staff in the pharmacy and on the wards. A number of medication safety initiatives and continuous quality improvement activities were undertaken, including: The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare recommended a pilot of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis section in the National Inpatient Medication Chart (NIMC). This pilot provided strong support for the inclusion of a VTE prophylaxis section in the NIMC, a major enhancement to patient safety. A drug library was introduced to the new B. Braun Smart Infusion Pumps, which ensures that all i ntravenous drugs are administered in the safest possible manner.136 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The Director of the Pharmacy Department was the joint clinical lead for the Medication Safety Standard of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards and oversaw work to meet national standards for medication safety. The Pharmacy Department of the Canberra Hospital participated in a national pharmaceutical spending benchmarking exercise. Despite being a small jurisdiction, the ACT has excellent purchasing processes, ensuring that resources are maximised. Gastroenterology and hepatology The Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit at Canberra Hospital provides services to patients in the ACT and surrounding region in all areas of gastrointestinal diseases, with particular focus on inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrointestinal cancer, chronic hepatitis, chronic liver disease and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The unit has well- developed multidisciplinary teams, including consultant medical staff, senior registrars and nursing staff with special expertise. In 2012-13, the unit commissioned a third endoscopy room and commissioned new technology, the Transient Elastography (FibroScan), to assist in the detection and staging of liver disease and to reduce reliance on liver biopsies. In 2012-13, additional medical, nursing and administrative staff were appointed on receipt of budget enhancement for the unit. In 2012-13, staff of the unit performed 4,832 endoscopy procedures (elective and acute), the highest number of endoscopies ever recorded and an increase of 9.4 per cent from last year. There were 7,040 outpatient attendances, an increase of 9.8 per cent over 2011-12. The unit provided many other services, including inpatient care and day-only admissions. It also provided services and information sessions in the community and at the Alexander Maconochie Centre. Hospital in the Home In 2012-13, funding for Hospital in the Home (HITH) was increased. This was used to recruit nursing staff, including a nurse dedicated to identifying and assessing potential referrals in a timely manner. New arrangements were put in place whereby GPs can directly contact the HITH Registrar about a patient they are seeing in their rooms before sending them into HITH for assessment for admission, without patients needing to attend the Emergency Department. Respiratory and Sleep Service The Respiratory and Sleep Service is available to patients in the ACT and surrounding areas of New South Wales, with an occasional referral from Victoria. It provides care in all areas of respiratory and sleep medicine\u2014and in particular supports the Tuberculosis Service of the ACT and surrounding New South Wales\u2014including asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease and cystic fibrosis. The Respiratory and Sleep Service supports the management of lung cancer and in particular has special weekly urgent clinics set aside. In addition, the service conducts joint meetings with thoracic surgeons, medical staff and radiation oncologists to facilitate the management of lung cancers. These meetings are held weekly. The services provided have increased over the past few years and will continue to do so, particularly in relation to consultations for both inpatients, outpatients and bronchoscopies. General/Acute Medicine Work commenced in 2011-12 to develop a model for a general/acute medicine service as part of a redesign exercise. Funding in 2012-13 was utilised to implement an acute general medicine model with the advent of the Medical Short Stay (MSS) Unit. This service facilitates early identification and management of patients who are identified as requiring admission to medicine beds in the hospital from the Emergency Department. It is staffed by nursing and medical staff to better manage patients with multiple complex conditions who present to the hospital for care.Section A Performance and financial reporting 137 Issues and challenges Issues and challenges for the Division of Medicine include: further integrating services across the Territory, such as the Stroke Unit, Renal Services and Cardiology Services, including Chronic Disease Management meeting patient demand for endoscopy facilitating prevention of hospital admission and promoting seamless discharge. Future directions Endocrinology and Diabetes services Services will be represented on the northside with the opening of the Belconnen Community Health Centre in 2013. The Diabetes Service will be further enhanced on the northside with the establishment of a new Vision Screening Program. In 2013-14, programs to enhance engagement between ACT Health Diabetes Service and primary care services will be developed with assistance from the ACT Medicare Local, and improved referral patterns, joint professional education and staff development programs will be established. The ACT Health Diabetes Service has established collaboration with ACT health units involved in the care of patients with acute diabetes-related foot complications. A multidisciplinary high-risk foot collaboration clinic will commence in July 2013 at the Canberra Hospital. ACT Health is working towards the establishment of a Public Obesity Management Service and is improving clinical data collection in relation to weight and height. In 2013-14, this service will work closely with general practitioners and community organisations, as well as other specialist services that care for these people. These hospital-based services include Diabetes, Cardiology, Respiratory and Chronic Care programs. Neurology services The development of a Stroke Network, inclusive of a Stroke Unit, planned for Calvary Health Care will greatly contribute to the management of these patients across the Territory. Pharmacy The Pharmacy Business Plan for 2013-14 aims to build on past successes and address upcoming challenges\u2014namely: to improve clinical pharmacy services, such as the establishment of specialised pharmacist positions, the creation of a ward-based technician service and an increase in the number of clinical pharmacists to provide further education for the pharmacy workforce, such as TAFE certificate training for technicians and the internal People Manager Program for all senior staff. Gastroenterology and Hepatology Waiting lists for both endoscopy and outpatient services continue to grow but have been addressed by the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and administrative staff and effective leave management for medical staff. The planned refurbishment of the unit will also enable more patients to be seen in 2013-14. The unit plans to commence endoscopic ultrasound to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal cancer.138 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Hospital in the Home HITH is working on the development of a protocol with the Chronic Care Program for the respiratory service to identify patients in the community who are acutely deteriorating and who may benefit from a pre-emptive stay in HITH, potentially avoiding an admission to hospital. In the second half of 2013, the introduction of a dedicated pharmacist to HITH will assist with the increasingly complex and numerous medications being utilised both by patients in their homes and by those receiving treatment as day-only patients. General/Acute Medicine The training program for General Medicine was accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, and a team of registrars, including an Admitting Registrar for Medicine (ARM), was recruited to support this service. The service will enhance services already provided by the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU). A multispecialty consultant team will be further developed in 2013-14 to better manage this cohort of patients and facilitate education of physician trainees in General Medicine and subspecialties. Division of Pathology The Division of Pathology provides specialist pathology services to the medical practitioners of the ACT and surrounding region. This includes pathology testing while patients are in hospital and when they return to their homes. Services are provided in the acute setting at Canberra and Calvary hospitals and the National Capital Private Hospital and in the community through collection centres across the ACT. A home collection service for patients who are frail or unwell and who cannot attend these collection centres is also provided. Analysis of collected samples is undertaken at the two laboratories in the ACT. The main laboratory is located at the Canberra Hospital and a branch laboratory is located at Calvary Hospital. Pathology is a medical specialty looking at disease processes and their cause. Body tissue, blood and other bodily fluids are analysed to assist medical practitioners to identify the cause and severity of disease, and to monitor treatment. The Division of Pathology is made up of a range of clinical specialities: Anatomical Pathology, Chemical Pathology, Haematology, Cytogenetics, Immunology, Microbiology and Molecular Pathology. All areas are accredited with the National Association of Testing Authorities and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. Pathology is a demand-driven service that plays a critical role in more than 70 per cent of clinical diagnoses and many of the decisions around optimal treatment for patients. Due to the critical role of pathology testing in diagnosis and treatment, the objective and direction for pathology are intimately tied to the objectives and priorities of ACT Health's Corporate Plan. Achievements Quality system ACT Pathology undergoes three-yearly accreditation inspections by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The last accreditation assessment in 2012 saw an overall accreditation achievement at a high level. A large number of ACT pathology specialist and scientific staff have been invited to become NATA assessors and regularly inspect other laboratories in Australia and overseas. The microbiology laboratory participates in a range of surveillance programs, including the Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) and the World Health Organization (WHO) influenza surveillance group, contributing to important epidemiological information locally and internationally. ACT Pathology is also a member of the Public Health Laboratory Network. Social inclusion Pathology testing now includes Aboriginal identification when this information has been provided. This data is then available to feed through to health databases such as the Pap smear register, notifiable diseases and cancer cases, and should enable better health policy planning.Section A Performance and financial reporting 139 Collaboration and performance Pathology works in close collaboration with many areas of the Health Directorate to provide access to timely results, facilitate decision making and assist them to achieve their outputs. While the number of requests for pathology from Canberra Hospital has slightly decreased overall, there has been an increase in the number of tests per request, resulting in a 2.6 per cent increase in tests. LocationNumber of requests 2011-12Number of requests 2012-13% increase in 94,951 Cytogenetic Department has implemented microarray analysis as the first line of investigation for the detection of chromosomal rearrangements in constitutional and products of conception referrals. This technology offers a higher level of resolution, improves the scope of detection of chromosome anomalies and replaces conventional karyotyping of chromosomes. The introduction of this service to ACT Pathology has contributed to patient care in genetic services. Changes in technology New slide stainer: The Anatomical Pathology Department has introduced a new processor for the staining of tissue samples. This processor has a number of features that improve safety and quality. This includes decreased handling and use of dangerous chemicals by staff, and individual processing of samples to eliminate cross-contamination. Front-end automation: A PVT automated front-end processor was installed this year. This system improves processing and storage of patient samples received in the laboratory. It decreases the amount of manual handling of samples staff are required to do, as well as reducing pre-analytical errors and the incidence of repetitive strain type injury. It will benefit both patients (with improved quality) and staff (with improved work safe practice) and release staff to concentrate on more complex scientific duties. E-health Pathology embraces electronic delivery of pathology results for better management of patient care and the provision of continuity of services. Pathology results are currently: included in the discharge summary delivered to the ICU and renal department systems to support patient care and other databases in clinical areas delivered electronically to medical practitioners in the community. Education Pathology holds Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia accreditation for medical postgraduate pathology training in all the major specialisations of pathology. Pathology is working in collaboration with the University of Canberra, Australian National University and Canberra Institute of Technology to continue to develop and support the various scientific and technical courses required in medical laboratory science. This includes both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. A number of ACT Pathology scientific staff prepare and provide lectures for these courses. In addition, students are supported in the pathology laboratories while undertaking their professional practice requirements. This initiative is already providing new graduates who are being introduced into the workforce in Canberra The scientific staff from cytogenetics contributed to the development of the University of Canberra course that is now the only postgraduate cytogenetic course to be offered in Australia. ACT Pathology continues to support staff continuing education through attendance at external conferences of national associations, including the Australian Association of Clinical Biochemists (AACB), Australian Institute of Medical Scientists and various industry workshops.140 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Investments in research Pathology is a scientific discipline with research as a cornerstone. Many of the pathologists and scientists are actively involved in their own research or work collaboratively with others. This demonstrates the important role of research in teaching, and Pathology's increasing link and contribution to the Australian National University Medical School. Members of the division (scientific and medical) continue to publish actively in peer-reviewed journals and participate in professional meetings and workshops both in Australia and overseas. ACT Pathology has been instrumental in a study to determine reference intervals for a healthy Australian population. This study, Aussie Normals, has been supported by the diagnostic industry through the availability of consumables. ACT Pathology scientific and clinical staff, in supporting this initiative, have been involved in pursuing harmonised reference intervals in clinical chemistry. This has resulted in a national workshop in 2012 and a satellite conference in association with the AACB national meeting. Publication of the findings will be presented later in 2013. The ACT Haematology Research Tissue Bank archives tissue samples from patients with haematological and related disorders. Set up in 2007, it has proven to be an important resource to support laboratory research and has enabled the department to apply for competitive grants. Issues and challenges The major challenge for the Division of Pathology in the future is dealing with increasing demand by clinicians and patients for more rapid, specific and high-tech testing for patient management, particularly in the molecular fields of cancer gene analysis and bacterial sequencing, in combination with maintaining a skilled workforce operating 24 hours a day. The future will see a significant increase in technology, including both automation and new technologies, that will require a workforce that is well informed and able to adapt to changes in laboratory practice. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain links with universities and other national bodies to foster a dynamic group of pathologists and scientists who form the critical link between clinical medicine and laboratory practice. Another challenge for the Division of Pathology is managing demand on staff and resources. Community collection centres have been a major contributor to this increasing demand over recent years. To manage this increase in demand, two of Pathology's collection centres have been closed. This has enabled resources to be redirected and assist in responding to demand on public pathology services with the available workforce and resources. ACT Pathology's core business is the delivery of inpatient pathology services to Canberra and Calvary hospitals. Future directions Increased range of services At the request of ACT Health staff specialists, the Molecular Pathology Department is in the process of implementing mutation marker assays to assist in the selection of suitable treatment modalities for cancer patients. This diagnostic service is likely to be offered later in 2013. The laboratory offers an already expanded respiratory pathogen testing service and is looking to expand this repertoire of testing in the future. Research that promotes evidence-based practice Pathology supports much of the clinical research being carried out in the public hospital system in the ACT by undertaking the assays directly or preparing special samples for forwarding to research institutes in other states. This activity is in addition to work initiated within various departments across pathology, which is often of a collaborative nature with the Australian National University and University of Canberra. ACT Pathology is currently supporting and contributing to in excess of 40 research projects, and it will continue to support such projects in the future.Section A Performance and financial reporting 141 Improve patient safety and quality of care Pathology is working collaboratively with Health IT to introduce Computerised Physician Order Entry (CPOE). CPOE is an electronic ward ordering system that will improve completion of mandatory information required for pathology testing, improve legibility and thus accuracy of request information and provide decision-making support information to the requesting doctor. Having this up-front information for requesting doctors is expected to lead to more efficient ordering of pathology tests. In conjunction with the CPOE, a pathology collection system providing positive patient identification (PPID) for the collection of blood samples will be introduced. The introduction of both CPOE and PPID is expected to reduce pre-analytical errors that occur before the sample is presented to the laboratory for analysis. This will significantly improve patient safety. The process is necessarily long and intensive and we look forward to implementation in 2014. Division of Surgery and Oral Health The Division of Surgery and Oral Health is responsible for delivering inpatient and outpatient surgical and medical imaging services and prevention and treatment dental health programs for children, targeted youth and adults of the ACT community and surrounding region. The aim of surgical services is to provide timely access to elective and emergency surgery, with a focus on quality patient-centred care, supported by evidence-based practice. The division includes the Surgical Bookings and Pre-Admission Clinic, Anaesthesia, the Pain Management Unit, Operating Theatres, the Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit, the Day Surgery Unit, the Admissions/Extended Day Surgery Unit, Medical Imaging, various specialty surgical ward areas, the Outpatient Department (medical and nursing only), the Shock Trauma Service, the Trauma Orthopaedic Research Unit and the Dental Health Program. Achievements Capital funding was received for the purchase and installation of two new CT scanners. The first, a state-of-the- art CT scanner, became operational on 3 July 2013. The second, a medium-range CT scanner, is expected to be operational by the end of August 2013. Medical Imaging implemented neuro-interventional services\u2014in particular, coiling of intracranial aneurysms\u2014 which provide access for patients who have previously had to travel interstate for these services. In the past 12 months, there has been increasing interest from international radiologists in spending time at Canberra Hospital to further develop skills and training. These positions are sponsored by their individual governments. The appointment of a Nuclear Medicine Fellow assisted with the development of a career path and future teaching opportunities. Dr Robert Allen received an Interventional Radiology Society of Australia Gold Medal Award in recognition of his contribution to interventional radiology. Dr Allen is the third person to be awarded this honour. Mr Chris McLaren became an Honorary Life Member of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine in 2012. Mr McLaren is only the second nuclear medicine scientist to be granted this honour. In 2012-13, the federal government provided $345.9 million over three years to reduce public dental waiting lists across Australia. The ACT was the first jurisdiction to sign the National Partnership Agreement (NPA) in January 2013 and was allocated $5.5 million over three years. The funding has increased workforce capacity and increased utilisation of the private sector to reduce public dental waiting lists. At 30 April 2013, the Dental Health Program (DHP) met baseline NPA activity targets, attracting an additional $300,000 of NPA funding on 1 June 2013. This brings total NPA funding for 2012-13 to $954,000. At 30 June 2013, there were 1,659 people waiting for non-urgent restorative dental services, compared to 2,310 clients on the waiting list at 30 June 2012. At 30 June 2013, 2,447 clients were removed from the restorative waiting list, compared to 1,856 at 30 June 2012. This is an increase of 591 clients being removed in 12 months. One dental clinic in Civic was refurbished, and an additional clinic in Civic was constructed. A student tutorial room and orthopantomograph (OPG) x-ray machine, to increase the number of dentistry students, were completed. Vision-Impaired Persons Hospital Kits were introduced across the hospital in September 2012 for use by people who are blind or have low vision, as well as their families and carers. The kit provides information on a range of resources that enable patients to maintain a high level of independence and assist hospital staff to have a greater understanding of the needs of people who are blind or have low vision. The kit includes resources for use in hospital, such as signage to increas e awareness of patients' needs, checklists to ensure patients are prepared and orientated to the ward environment, signed guide techniques for staff or carers and information about low vision services in the ACT.142 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Mr Daniel Wood, Acting Assistant Director of Nursing, Wards, was awarded an ACT Health Australia Day Award. Two college ophthalmology trainees were re-accredited in September 2012 for three years. Dr Rohan Essex is coordinating a national research project on retinal surgery outcomes based in Canberra. The Pain Management Unit won the ACT Quality in Healthcare Award in 2012 for 'Access and Efficiency\u2014Improving Customer Access to Multidisciplinary Pain Management Services' and the ACT Government Health Better Practice Award in 2013 for 'Improving Consumer Access to Multidisciplinary Pain Management Interventions'. The ACT Trauma Committee was formed to promote integration and coordination of the trauma system. Key representatives from Canberra Hospital and from hospitals in our region are members. Monthly Trauma Grand Rounds were established to improve the health outcomes of trauma patients by providing trauma education and training that are locally accessible. The Shock Trauma Service made a formal commitment to the Australian Trauma Quality Improvement Program. The aim of the program is to collaborate in improving care of seriously injured patients through sharing information, making joint efforts in trauma quality improvement projects and developing a 'next generation' national clinical quality registry for trauma. Ms Rebekah Ogilvie, Trauma Coordinator, was recognised this year for her research in major traumatic injury in young people when she was awarded the inaugural Skellern PhD Scholarship. A new Director of the Pain Management Unit commenced in April 2013. Issues and challenges Demand for services increased but the division was able to respond with additional activity\u2014for example: - In 2012-13, there were 6,464 elective surgery procedures undertaken, compared with 6,317 in 2011-12, which has exceeded the annual target of 6,300. - The Dental Health Program removed 3,098 clients from the central list for treatment in 2012-13, compared with 1,727 in 2011-12. The decanting of the Tuggeranong Dental Clinic to the Phillip Dental Clinic to allow for the refurbishment of the Tuggeranong Health Centre presented a number of challenges, including: - scheduling and relocation of staff and equipment to enable the continuation of service delivery to child and youth clients - negotiations with the Phillip Health Centre for additional office space to administer the National Child Oral Health Survey - good communication to allay staff concerns and anxiety about the relocation - a multi-pronged client communication strategy to inform clients of the changes to service delivery and access. Future directions The installation of new CT scanners provides opportunities to offer new developments in diagnostic options. Medical Imaging has received funding to acquire a range of new, state-of-the-art equipment, including ultrasound machines, a gamma camera and a biplane angiography suite. The ACT Government has committed $1.6 million from 2013-14 over four years to fund a mobile dental van to provide dental care to residential aged care facilities, special schools, and pregnant and parenting students attending the Canberra College Cares Program. The operations of the mobile dental van are in the early planning stages. The newly built Belconnen Health Centre will open in November 2013 with 11 dental chairs\u2014an additional six chairs compared with the old Belconnen Health Centre. The newly refurbished Tuggeranong Health Centre will open in the first half of 2014 with five dental chairs. The DHP continues to collaborate with allied health professionals to introduce orthodontic treatment for clients with cleft palate. Clinical training is occurring between the Canberra Hospital Cleft Palate Clinic and the DHP, and a mentorship has been established with a senior orthodontist at the Sydney Cleft Palate Clinic. Clients are being treated for general dental interventions, with full orthodontics expected to commence for clients referred by the Canberra Hospital Cleft Palate Clinic later in 2013.Section A Performance and financial reporting 143 An upgrade to the dental electronic client information system, including digital radiography, will be completed in October 2013. Formalisation of cross-border networking arrangements as part of the 2013 New South Wales Trauma Services Review will strengthen data linkage with New South Wales referral facilities and facilitate repatriation for ongoing care, which will link in with rehabilitation services available closer to home. Division of Women, Youth and Children The Division of Women, Youth and Children provides a broad range of primary, secondary and tertiary health care services. The provision of services is based on a family-centred, multidisciplinary approach to care in partnership with the consumer and other service providers. Services are provided at the Canberra Hospital, in community health centres and in community-based settings, including clients' homes, schools, and child and family centres. Some services are provided within other agency facilities. The Division of Women, Youth and Children service comprises: maternity services, including the Continuity at the Canberra Hospital (CatCH) Program and the Canberra Midwifery Program (CMP) women's health, including screening, gynaecology and programs targeting violence against women neonatology, including the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Special Care Nursery, specialist clinics, newborn hearing screening and ACT Newborn Retrieval Service paediatrics, including inpatient care, specialist clinics, community paediatricians and genetics Maternal and Child Health (MACH), including a universal home visit following birth, support for breastfeeding and parenting, immunisation and referral services that support children and their families with complex care needs: - Maternal and Child Health (MACH) Parenting Enhancement Program - Asthma Nurse Educator Service - Caring for Kids Program (care in the home for children with complex needs) - Child at Risk Health Unit (care for children affected by violence and abuse) - Integrated Multi-agencies for Parents and Children Together, which coordinates care for woman with complex care needs who are pregnant and/or have young children - child protection training for clinicians school-based nursing services, including immunisation, kindergarten health checks, school youth health checks and special school nurses nurse audiometry, providing hearing assessments to children and adults. Achievements Centenary Hospital for Women and Children The new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children is one of the Health Infrastructure Program's major new facilities and features state-of-the-art equipment and infrastructure. The project includes the major refurbishment of the existing maternity building. The move into the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children took place in August 2012 and presented significant challenges, including: relocation of babies in the NICU and Special Care Nursery and women in the Maternity Unit communication with staff, which was of utmost importance to alleviate any concerns regarding the relocation a multi-pronged client communication strategy to inform clients of the changes to service delivery and access.144 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Community health programs Community health programs provide services under a primary health care framework for children, families and women in the community. Programs and services are delivered to individuals or groups across a variety of settings in health centres, child and family centres, schools and clients' homes. In 2012-13, there was increased demand for services and a need to develop new models for service delivery to try to address this demand. Extensive work was also done to prepare for the moves to the new or refurbished community health centres. ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework The ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework 2010-2015 was launched on 10 November 2010. Its aim is to increase the number of infants being exclusively breastfed from birth to six months and to encourage ongoing breastfeeding with complementary foods until at least 12 months of age, in line with National Health and Medical Research Council recommendations. Implementation of the framework continues, with a focus on priority groups and consistency with the national breastfeeding strategic framework. Key initiatives include the development of resources for priority and mainstream groups, health professional education, a whole-of-government approach to the 'Breastfeeding-Friendly Workplace' and enhanced breastfeeding data collection. A dedicated project officer led the implementation until June 2013. The development and implementation of the Breastfeeding Strategic Framework was funded by the ACT Population Health Division's Healthy Future budget and is a joint initiative of the Health Improvement Branch and the Women Youth and Children community health programs. The implementation of the framework has been guided since its inception by the Breastfeeding Initiative Steering Committee. Implementation will now be coordinated through the Division of Women, Youth and Children and Policy and Government relations. The Division of Women, Youth and Children will manage the service delivery side of breastfeeding, including: exploration of the current service delivery model for breastfeeding ongoing education of health professionals and support for resource development the embedding of breastfeeding and the strategy into the core business of ACT Health by establishing a subcommittee ongoing Breastfeeding-Friendly Workplace re-accreditation for ACT Health the development of an ACT Health policy on the preparation of formula the embedding of breastfeeding into all relevant health and government policies and frameworks during the development process. Women's Health Service The Women's Health Service (WHS) has continued to implement an interprofessional primary health care (ACCESS) model for disadvantaged women who experience significant barriers to health service access. The counsellors, women's health nurses, nurse practitioner and staff specialist work collaboratively to provide comprehensive care to the priority population groups. The women's health nurses have maintained their expanded outreach to better target vulnerable groups. An evaluation framework for the ACCESS model has been developed by researchers from the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute. To support health professionals working with women who have been subjected to interpersonal violence, a training package for general practitioners has been developed and delivered in conjunction with Medicare Local, and presentations on trauma-informed care have been developed and delivered to other health professionals. School Youth Health Nurse Program The School Youth Health Nurse Program aims to promote positive health outcomes for young people and their families through the delivery of accessible, acceptable, appropriate and culturally respectful primary health care services in the school setting. It also provides the opportunity for young people, their parents and members of the school community to access a health professional in the school setting. This can be for matters relating to health or wellbeing and includes acting as a curriculum resource for staff. The external evaluation was completed in 2012 and, based on the positive results, the program was extended in 2013.Section A Performance and financial reporting 145 Immunisation From 2013, the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program, which has been offered to girls in Year 7, is being offered to boys. The School Health Team is offering the vaccination to Year 7 boys, with a two-year catch-up component for boys in year 9. The HPV virus can cause genital warts and a range of cancers, including cervical, penile and anal cancer. Maternal and Child Health nursing partnership with Canberra College The Maternal and Child Health (MACH) nursing partnership with Canberra College (CCCares), where MACH services are delivered to pregnant young women and young parents who are continuing their education and bringing their child to this unique school setting, continues to grow and develop. Over 100 young parents are engaged with MACH services through this partnership, and an increased number of sessions have been provided by MACH services. A community paediatrician now provides a clinic once a month. National Perinatal Depression Initiative The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing and ACT Health have a five-year agreement for the National Perinatal Depression Initiative (NPDI), from 2008 to 2013, to improve prevention and early detection of antenatal and postnatal depression and provide better support and treatment for expectant and new mothers who are experiencing depression or are at risk of developing depression. The initiative is making consistent progress aligned with the agreed milestones of the NPDI. Progress and improvements against all outputs in the implementation plan are on track, with no significant risks or issues emerging. The NPDI project particularly focuses on: routine and universal screening to identify women at risk of, or experiencing, perinatal depression (PND) follow-up integrated care pathways for women an education and training framework in perinatal mental health for multidisciplinary professionals community awareness of the risk factors related to PND, anxiety and adjustment to parenting improvement of data collection methods. Health services to children and young people with complex health issues in all ACT Government schools The Health Directorate and the Education and Training Directorate are working together on a project to develop a whole-of-government model addressing the provision of health services to children and young people with complex health issues in all ACT Government schools. A community consultation process was conducted in November 2012. A preferred model, named Healthcare Access At School (HAAS), was piloted in early 2013 with positive outcomes. Implementation will occur in 2013-14. Centre for Newborn Care The new Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) was built to accommodate up to 34 patients. Since the move to the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children in August 2012, occupancy in the NICU has been at 91 per cent. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Webcam In the 2008-09 Budget, ACT Health allocated $200,000 to develop and implement a video streaming service for parents of infants at the Centre for Newborn Care Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The NICUCAM website provides general information on the services provided by the Centre for Newborn Care and can be accessed by the public. From this site, parents can access the secure password-protected portal to view their own babies daily between 6.00 am and 10.00 am and between 6.00 pm and 10.00 pm, via a webcam installed above the baby's cot in the Centre for Newborn Care. Parents may provide the password and login to family members in Australia and overseas, which promotes bonding with the new baby.146 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 A total of 10 babies can be on the webcam site at the same time, though to date six has been the maximum number. The website has received over 100,000 hits and has been accessed from 80 countries, as far afield as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Hungary and India. In 2011, the program was awarded the national and, in 2012, the International Oceania-Pacific Project Management Award in the category Organisation/Change Management. A technical design was developed to update the website and manage the cameras by NICUCAM staff. Solution went for tender and the successful company was offered the contract. ACT Newborn Retrieval Service The Newborn Retrieval Service, a satellite of the Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS) New South Wales, has been operational since 2008. Annually, 40 to 50 babies are retrieved from the ACT and New South Wales and taken as far as from Nowra to Canberra Hospital by the neonatal retrieval team, which consists of a neonatal nurse and medical officer. In addition, the service provides a timely, safe and coordinated transfer of babies to their local hospitals. The retrieval team (medical and nursing) is being trained in paediatric life support and provides a neonatal and infant (up to 10 months of age) medical emergency team at Canberra Hospital in the Centre for Newborn Care. The team also provides treatment and stabilisation of children up to the age of two years before transfer to Sydney to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. An updated memorandum of understanding has been developed to increase service delivery to hospitals in New South Wales that are closer to Canberra than Sydney and to facilitate time-appropriate retrieval and back-transfer of convalescing neonates to improve patient flow. Paediatric and Adolescent Health Services The Paediatric Department, in addition to its general paediatrics duties, runs sub-speciality services in paediatric endocrinology, respiratory medicine and nephrology and conducts outreach clinics in Cooma and Pambula on a monthly basis. The department also strives to meet the needs of children requiring other sub-specialist services by hosting visiting specialists from Sydney in paediatric cardiology, gastroenterology, oncology and neurology. Paediatric research is conducted with involvement in vaccine and drug trials, as well as research on genetic renal disorders and endocrine and metabolism disorders in children. All paediatric staff specialists have an academic appointment and actively participate in Australian National University Medical School student teaching. Outpatient waiting lists in paediatrics have been addressed by administrative improvements, the recruitment of two new paediatricians (1.8 full-time equivalent) and improved paediatric registrar participation in outpatient clinics. The work of the Chronic Care Coordinator nurse in the Outpatient Department has allowed for a cohesive, family- and child-centred approach for children with chronic disease. The Paediatric Palliative Care Committee has improved palliative care services for children and their families through a collaborative, multidisciplinary and multi-agency approach. Improved links with Clare Holland House through a monthly interdisciplinary meeting and attendance at a conjoint meeting with New South Wales Paediatric Palliative Care Services ensure our paediatric palliative service aligns with current best practice. The Paediatric Department has commenced strategic planning on improved resident and registrar training by developing a training program that will allow Australian National University graduates to undertake all but six months of their paediatric training in the ACT. Recognition is actively being sought from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians for local training in several paediatric sub-speciality rotations. iPatCH (Paediatrics high dependency unit) In the 2012-13 Budget, funding was allocated for two additional iPatCH beds. These beds have been identified in Ward 4B and will be utilised to provide closer monitoring of patients and a higher level of nursing care for sick children. iPaTCH has accepted NETS transfer of nine acutely unwell children from surrounding hospitals in New South Wales and Canberra. iPaTCH beds are not restricted to patients of the Paediatric Department; all specialities may admit paediatric patients into iPatCH care under the guidance of a consultant paediatrician.Section A Performance and financial reporting 147 Maternity and gynaecology services Maternity and gynaecology services at Centenary Hospital for Women and Children provide care to women and children in the ACT and surrounding regional area. There were 3,342 births in 2012-13, compared to 2,974 in 2011-12 and 2,769 in 2010-11. In the past six months, outpatient antenatal care occasions of service were 3,425 for medical officers and 3,848 for midwifery. Outpatient gynaecology services provided 1,795 occasions of service. Issues and challenges In recent years, there have been significant changes in the mix between private and public sector births, and the number of public sector births has increased significantly. Between 2006-07 and 2011-12, there was only a 9 per cent increase in the total number of births in the ACT; this is less than 2 per cent a year. Over the same period, there was a 25 per cent increase in births in the public sector, while private hospitals experienced a 21 per cent reduction in birth rates over the same period. Changes to the Medicare Safety Net have coincided with a significant decrease in private sector activity and a significant increase in public sector activity. This change was significant in 2010-11 and 2011-12, as many of the private sector bookings were previously made at the time of the safety net changes. The change in pattern and downturn of private sector activity unfortunately occurred too late to enable any change in planning for the construction of the new hospital. The planning of the facility was based on the projections for increases in demand. The total number of ACT births is consistent with the projections that were made. However, the safety net changes were not known at the time and therefore the shift from private to public sector was unexpected. The Centenary Hospital for Women and Children has experienced pressure in relation to occupancy. A review into maternity services has been commissioned to look at ways in which the territory can work collaboratively to meet this unprecedented demand. The purpose of the review is to examine and provide an assessment of the model of care in the new Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Maternity Unit. It will also look at the capacity of ACT maternity services to meet current and future demand, taking into account recent changes to service demand as well as the model of care. The review team was sought from Women's Health Australasia (WHA), the peak body for hospitals and health services providing care to women and babies. The review team has conducted interviews with members of staff and consumers of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children and will provide a report by September 2013. Strategies have been put in place to manage demand, such as: the opening of four short-stay postnatal beds as a short-term measure to manage the overflow of patients additional staff increased capacity for the continuity of the midwifery program. Future directions Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Maternity and gynaecology services at Centenary Hospital for Women and Children provide care to women and children in the ACT and surrounding regional areas. The Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, stage 2 will open at the end of October 2013. At the completion of stage 2, the inpatient and outpatient paediatric service will relocate to level 1. The Antenatal and Gynaecology Outpatient Service, the Maternity Unit and the Fetal Medicine Unit will occupy level 2. Two assessment rooms, five birth centre beds and the new birthing suite, which have 13 labour birth recovery beds, will occupy level 3. Community Paediatric and Child Health Service: Child Development Service In early 2012, a discussion paper titled 'The Future of Community Paediatrics in the ACT Region\u2014Beyond 2012' was sent to the Director-General of ACT Health, Dr Peggy Brown. It was subsequently endorsed for further exploration and a working group to be formed. This paper has stimulated stakeholders across government departments and non-government organisations involved in the provision of child and youth services to work together to develop a collaborative model to improve child development services in the ACT. This work will be incorporated into the Paediatric Services Strategic Plan. The aim of this collaborative and multidisciplinary work is to examine the potential to transform the present Community Paediatric and Child Health Service (CPCHS) into a best practice, evidence-based, multi-disciplinary child development centre for the ACT and surrounding region.148 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Personal Child Health Record In alignment with the National Framework for Universal Child and Family Health Services , ACT Health is committed to the progression of a national Personal Child Health Record (PCHR). The logical first step is to come into alignment with the recently updated New South Wales PCHR in consultation with ACT clinicians and other professionals who work with children. This approach was approved by the ACT Child Youth Health Reference Group and the ACT Maternity Services Network Forum. The rationale for this includes: extensive recent consumer consultation by New South Wales Health on their PCHR ongoing trials of an electronic version of the New South Wales PCHR consideration of those professionals, clinicians and families whose working and living arrangements straddle the ACT-New South Wales border substantial cost savings from printing this format. Approval to adopt the New South Wales PCHR style and format has been given by New South Wales Health and the Executive Director of New South Wales Kids and Families. A working group will make minor local amendments and then seek final endorsement by the ACT Child Youth Health Reference Group and New South Wales Health. Chronic Kids The paediatric service is looking at the development and implementation of a chronic care strategy. This would aim to improve the service delivered to children and their families through a more integrated and comprehensive approach to chronic care management. The strategy would be based on the principles outlined in the ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy and the National Chronic Disease Strategy. Paediatric Services Strategic Plan The future direction for the Paediatric Department is to continue to strive to improve paediatric outpatient services and waiting times for families, to improve inpatient services and to ensure the timely and seamless discharge of children when hospital care is no longer required. The service is working to improve the flow of children through the Emergency Department to the ward and is undertaking a trial of a paediatric observation unit (Short Stay Ward) for children who require a longer period of observation for acute treatment prior to a decision to admit or discharge being made. The service is planning to develop an acute paediatric review clinic, which will give ACT general practitioners the ability to obtain an immediate paediatric review of a child they have concerns about who does not require presentation to the Emergency Department. Such a model will assist greatly in meeting the National Emergency Access Target (NEAT), reduce the burden on the Emergency Department and improve liaison with ACT general practitioners. Calvary Health Care ACT Calvary Hospital provides public health and hospital services in the ACT. These services include Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, Medical Care, Elective and Emergency Surgery, Day Surgery, Aged Care and Rehabilitation, Mental Health, and Inpatient and Community Specialist Palliative Care services from Clare Holland House (the ACT Hospice). Calvary Hospital is operated by Calvary Health Care ACT (CHC ACT), a subsidiary of Little Company of Mary Health Care. CHC ACT has operated Calvary Hospital since its inception in 1979. Funding for the operation of the public component of Calvary Hospital is provided by the Territory. The enduring arrangements between Calvary Health Care ACT and the Territory are described in the Calvary Network Agreement. Each year the Territory and Calvary Health Care ACT negotiate required activity levels and funding arrangements. These are formalised in the annual Performance Plan, against which Calvary regularly reports its service to the local community and other people in need of public health and hospital services.Section A Performance and financial reporting 149 Achievements in the reporting period Achieving impressive results from the Australian Council on Health Care Standards accreditation survey of Calvary Health Care ACT against the recently introduced EquipNational criteria, which include the National Quality and Health Standards. Calvary Hospital is the first public health facility in the ACT to be reviewed and to receive unqualified accreditation against EquipNational requirements. Delivering record levels of service in all clinical areas and outpatient occasions of service. Redesigning Community Palliative Care Services provided from Clare Holland House. The Community Specialist Palliative Care Pathway provides patients with faster and more equitable access to palliative care services, with all patients being assessed and reviewed through a triage process and then being involved in choosing their preferred palliative care treatment program. Introducing the Palcare patient management system to enable greater involvement and improved coordination of primary care providers in their patients' palliative care treatment. Embedding the Calvary Patient Access Improvement Program, which is constructed around robust processes and cooperation between clinical areas, to provide improved patient access and flow and to achieve efficiency in elective and emergency admissions and surgery. Continuing to build the partnerships and processes associated with the networking of health and hospital services in the Territory. Increasing the number of people who received elective surgery procedures and reduced surgery waiting times. Completing the refurbishment of the Calvary Hospital Emergency Department, which has created additional treatment spaces and facilitated the streaming of patients into 'likely to be admitted' and 'see and treat' streams. Expanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander liaison services through the appointment of a second Liaison Officer; these officers have direct contact with Indigenous patients and families and actively participate in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander networks in and around the ACT. Strengthening links between Clare Holland House and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to ensure Indigenous people have access to culturally sensitive and appropriate palliative and end-of-life care. Continuing the program of implementing technology which is shared with other health and hospital services in the Territory. Notable achievements in this area include: the roll-out of the ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS), creating a single electronic patient record across the Territory; the expansion of free wi-fi in many areas of Calvary for business and personal use; and the introduction of the MetaVision Clinical Information System in the Calvary Critical Care Unit. Improving the level of governance of clinical and administrative systems through the continuous review and refinement of the Calvary Hospital Committee Structure. Establishing the Australian Catholic University Clinical School on the Bruce campus, enriching clinical experience and practical learning opportunities for ACU students of nursing, midwifery and allied health. Enhancing the Graduate Program for Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health staff, and building the importance of this program as a core element of the recruitment and retention strategies documented in the draft Calvary workforce plan. Advancing negotiations with the Territory on the planning and development of expanded services and new facilities on the Calvary Bruce campus. Refining the Calvary Health Care ACT Strategic Planning Framework, comprising a 15-Year Strategic Vision, a 5-Year Strategic Plan and the 2013-14 Local Services Plan. Expanding and formalising patient and consumer participation in the design, development, review and refinement of Calvary's services. The role of patients and consumers will be formalised in a Consumer and Carer Participation Strategy that will be completed in the third quarter of 2013. Actively contributing to the broader public health and hospital networks and partnerships in the ACT, with particular attention to the Local Hospital Network and the ACT Medicare Local. Creating the Calvary Health@Home Unit, comprising an expanded Hospital in the Home program and an innovative Calvary Medical Outreach Service. A pilot of the Outreach Service will commence in the fourth quarter of 2013.150 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Implementing, in partnership with Carers ACT, the Carers at Calvary program, which introduces the assistance and support available to carers early in the patient journey, and facilitates the creation of carer services and support for the timely and safe discharge of patients to their preferred residential arrangement. Expanding the process for patient feedback, including the introduction of bedside patient experience surveys and follow-up phone calls to patients discharged after treatment for serious health ailments. Commencing the design of Calvary Hospital's Midwife-Led Model of Care, including an extensive public consultation process around the model and service. Design work has also been advanced for the creation of a birth centre at Calvary Hospital. Initiating the development process for expanded car-parking capacity at the Calvary Bruce campus. Enriching the Calvary community and the Calvary patient experience through the expanded and innovative engagement and deployment of the Calvary Volunteers Group. Refining the Calvary Refugee Mentoring program and offering participants more individualised work placements to assist with their settlement, assimilation and contribution to their new community. Continuing to collaborate with the Calvary Community Advisory Council. Improving staff engagement. In the most recent staff satisfaction survey, 63 per cent of respondents said they believed Calvary was 'a truly great place to work'. Issues and analysis The clear and transparent arrangements that now exist between Calvary and the Territory under the Calvary Network Agreement continued to provide a platform for open and productive clinical and administrative relationships that address contemporary circumstances and allow for collaborative future planning and development. This is of particular importance, as the Territory is committed to the expansion of public health and hospital services in North Canberra in close proximity to the major population growth areas of Gungahlin and Molonglo. Calvary's levels of activity in the reporting period corresponded with the projected health needs of an ageing and growing population, in the context of improving services and developing new treatments. Calvary has made consistent progress in this area. Improved patient flow processes enable better forecasting of service levels; 24-hour coverage of emergency surgical services ensures earlier appropriate treatment for emergency presentations; enhanced discharge procedures featuring multidisciplinary collaboration are reducing patient length of stay; tracking of inpatient progress occurs in all medical and surgical wards, with the production of daily patient status reports; and the use of clinical pathways is being expanded from surgical patients to include many more medical patients. The provision of services in non-acute settings is also being expanded at Calvary. More patients are receiving the later stages of their treatment and follow-up care in the Outpatient Clinic environment; the Calvary Hospital in the Home program has been expanded and a trial of direct external referrals to the service is under way; and a medical outreach service will commence shortly. In addition, a new ward area has been created specifically for patients transitioning from acute care to nursing home accommodation. The Calvary Medical Inpatient Wards have been reconfigured to create standard patient numbers and common staffing levels. This process ensures equitable accommodation for patients across the various wards and enhances patient and staff safety by reducing the risk of transmission of infections and other illness through improved patient isolation options. Engagement with patients and consumers at Calvary is growing as a result of their greater formal involvement and representation on clinical and non-clinical committees. In addition, consumers are engaged to comment on and contribute to any information being produced for patients and families. Development and design work for expanded car-parking capacity at Calvary Hospital, which is expected to assist with peak demand, has commenced.Section A Performance and financial reporting 151 Future directions Calvary Health Care ACT has identified a number of areas of focus for the short, medium and long term. These include: increasing the capability of our workforce and growing the engagement of the workforce in the development and delivery of services\u2014a workforce plan will be published to describe the strategies to achieve this ensuring our conduct and service strongly represent our values of hospitality, healing, stewardship and respect striving to be more consistent in the provision of high-quality care, distinguished by patient engagement advancing our attention to patient safety with an even stronger focus on areas of preventable harm, including infection control, skin integrity and pressure ulcers, falls prevention, medication safety, the handling of blood products, nutrition, and pre-procedure consent and preparation enhancing our patient and family feedback processes to ensure our patients' experiences assist us to improve our service introducing new services and service expansion, as negotiated with the Territory and described in the Calvary Performance Plan continuing to explore ways care can be provided earlier, more rapidly and in the most appropriate setting exploring ways that technology can improve our services and working collaboratively with the Territory in the use of shared technology continuing the enhancement of budgetary and reporting processes to underpin our financial sustainability considering the environmental impact and whole-of-life costs in our procurement processes publishing and implementing the Calvary Health Care ACT Reconciliation Action Plan ensuring that we support and assist the vulnerable and needy in our community, and ensuring that they have access to our services. Our future directions are documented in the Calvary Health Care ACT Local Services Plan for 2013-14.152 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Output 1.2 Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services provide a range of services in hospitals, community health centres, adult and youth correctional facilities and people's homes across the territory. They work with community partners to provide integrated and responsive care with a range of services, including hospital-based specialist services, supported accommodation services and community-based service responses. The key strategic priorities for Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services are ensuring that clients' needs are met in a timely fashion and that care is integrated across hospital, community and residential support services. This means focusing on: ensuring timely access to emergency mental health care by reducing waiting times for urgent admissions to acute psychiatric units ensuring that public mental health services in the ACT provide consumers with appropriate assessment, treatment and care that result in improved mental health outcomes providing hospital and community-based alcohol and drug services and health care assessments for people detained in corrective facilities. Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services provide health services directly and through partnerships with community organisations. The services provided range from prevention and treatment to recovery and maintenance and harm minimisation. Consumer and carer participation is encouraged in all aspects of service planning and delivery. The division works in partnership with consumers, carers and a range of government and non-government service providers to ensure the best possible outcomes for clients. The division delivers services at a number of locations, including hospital inpatient and outpatient settings, community health centres, detention centres and community settings such as people's homes. Services are outlined below. Mental Health Services ACT-Wide Mental Health Services Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Adult Mental Health Services Justice Health Services Primary Health Forensic Mental Health Section A Performance and financial reporting 153 Alcohol and Drug Services Opioid Maintenance Treatment Services Withdrawal Services Counselling and Treatment Services Diversion Services Consultation and Liaison Services Achievements Mental Health Services continue to monitor and review all episodes of seclusion and restraint. In 2013 the Early Support and Intervention Team will be reintroduced in the Adult Mental Health Unit to assist in the identification of consumers who are escalating and to work one on one to de-escalate. This initiative will be introduced in partnership with Ward Services to reduce aggression and consumer distress. A training package that focuses on engagement and de-escalation has been developed collaboratively with Ward Services. The Mental Health Community Policing Initiative (MHCPI) was developed after a review of ACT Policing mental health practices and procedures in 2010. A pilot was commenced in April 2011. This project was funded in 2011-12 and is now an ongoing initiative. In March 2013, the presence of Crisis Team clinicians in the Police Operations Centre was extended from four days per week to seven days per week. The clinicians are a dedicated resource for the police. They have access to the mental heath electronic clinical record, MHAGIC, and can provide information relevant to individuals. At the commencement of the MHCPI, there were, on average, 90 AFP-initiated emergency actions placed on consumers per month. This has dropped by 50 per cent, with an average over the past year of 45 per month. AFP, ambulance and MHCPI representatives are now providing mandatory in-service training to mental health teams. In April 2012, the Adult Mental Health Unit was commissioned. This is a purpose-built facility with an innovative model of care that has consumer engagement at its centre. The facility has a purpose-built High Dependency Unit, Low Dependency Unit and a therapy wing, which includes group therapy rooms, a gym and spiritual space. In 2013, additional allied health staff were employed in the Adult Mental Health Unit in the extended therapy program, and activities became available after hours and on the weekends. The Perinatal Mental Health Consultation Service provides specialist consultation and treatment planning for pregnant and postnatal women (up to 12 months postpartum). Since its inception, service demand has increased considerably. The program currently has approximately 80 registered clients. This year saw the implementation of a group program to support women with high levels of stress or distress. This group is co- facilitated with Child and Family Centre staff (Gungahlin) and has been beneficial for participants. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) was reviewed in 2012 to develop a revised model of care in consideration of the mental health needs of children, adolescents and young adults up to the age of 25 years. The CAMHS Re-design Project was informed by consultation with staff members, service providers, consumers and carers to ensure the mental health needs of this client group could be met using evidence-based practices in the context of a recovery framework. The CAMHS Model of Care was endorsed by the ACT Health Re-development Committee in May 2013. Planning for a phased implementation process has commenced. At the Hume Health Centre, Justice Health Services have introduced: - a Suboxone Withdrawal and Maintenance Regime. This is the first time that buprenorphine has routinely been used to manage withdrawal and maintenance in an ACT correctional facility - Hepatitis C treatments, which are achieved through a shared care model with a referral pathway to the Gastroenterology Service of the Canberra Hospital. Up to 10 patients continue to be cared for under a complex treatment regime.154 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 In the Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) program: - Following two pilot programs to implement influenza vaccination for clients of the Opioid Treatment Service, the program was rolled out as a yearly service in 2013. - The Alcohol and Drug Services overall program and the ADS Diversion team were the recipients of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation awards, recognising the work being done across the program to provide access and service delivery to people from an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background. - The ADS won the Quality in Health Care overall award in November 2012 for their opportunistic opioid treatment training program for community pharmacists, general practitioners and other health professionals. - In January 2013, counselling commenced in the Alexander Maconochie Centre. A dedicated counsellor employed by ADS is working with Alexander Maconochie Centre clients who have complex alcohol and other drug (AOD) issues to provide continuity of counselling care when they are discharged. A senior nurse also attends weekly to work with clients who are on opioid maintenance treatment and who are close to being released from the centre back into the community. - AOD psychotherapy and counselling are now provided at the Tuggeranong, Gunghalin, Hume and city health centres. Psychotherapy and counselling will commence at the enhanced Belconnen health centre when it opens later in 2013. Consumer and carer participation has remained a priority, and a number of consumers and carer consultants have been employed in the division. These roles support a cultural shift in Mental Health Services, particularly in recovery and consumer empowerment. Roles include systems advocacy for consumers, involvement in the review of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 , implementation of the recovery model, development and implementation of advance agreements, and staff training. The division also maintains full representation of consumers and carers on all relevant governance committees. The mental health services have been working to implement recovery principles and practices for a number of years. This work is supported through the actions of the ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 and the National Standards for Mental Health Services 2010 . The ACT has also been involved in consultations on the National Mental Health Recovery Framework, to be released over the next 12 months, and this framework will help to further consolidate a recovery orientation of services. Training and education are offered so that staff and stakeholders can develop an understanding of recovery and how services can assist through the implementation of practices and processes that promote a person-centred, strengths-focused and collaborative approach to the planning and delivery of the division's services. The division implemented a smoke-free environment in response to concerns about passive smoking raised by consumers, carers and staff. On 1 January 2013, all areas of the division became smoke free. Staff completed training designed to assist consumers who smoke by providing education, support and access to a range of nicotine replacement therapies. The division won the 2013 Health Promotion Award for the Smoke-Free Initiative in the Outstanding Achievement to Address Unhealthy Behaviours category. Mental Health transitional clinicians have been employed in each of the four Adult Community Mental Health Teams. The primary function of these clinicians is to support the transition of, and coordinate care for, people exiting either of the two public ACT psychiatric inpatient units (the Adult Mental Health Unit or Calvary Psychiatry Ward 2N) into the community setting. A review of four Adult Community Mental Health Team catchment area boundaries was completed in late 2012. The boundaries between the City and Woden catchment areas were realigned and five suburbs were moved into the Woden catchment area. This will result in benefits of improved access to mental health services, including reduced waiting times for appointments, reallocation of clinical staff and reduced response time to referrals. The Aboriginal Liaison Service was expanded as a result of the recruitment of a senior mental health nurse to work with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service. The nurse provides direct mental health interventions and clinical management for consumers with mental health issues in that community who are seeking treatment and care.Section A Performance and financial reporting 155 Issues and challenges The review of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 continues. The review aims to ensure that the Act remains consistent with contemporary mental health policy and service delivery. Working groups are addressing several areas of detailed content of the Act. The revised Act is scheduled for consideration by the ACT Legislative Assembly in late 2013. The division is facing some challenges in finding staff to fill clinical vacancies. Strategies include the implementation of health professional officer career pathways to ensure ongoing development, mentoring and sustainability for health professional officers in this sector. Future directions A streamlined induction process will be established at the Bimberi Youth Detention Centre, which will reduce duplication and engage specialist services when they are assessed as being clinically required. Strengthened medication management at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre has begun, with the recruitment of endorsed enrolled nurses who support a through-care model. Forensic Services will provide training on mental health awareness and processes to the magistrates of the ACT law courts. Preparation and organisation for the training have commenced. It is hoped this initiative will be expanded to other agencies, such as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Legal Aid services. Forensic Services has also continued to provide mental health awareness and education training to Bimberi youth workers as part of their training inductions. Alcohol and Drug Services are in the process of setting up a pharmacist-led Nicotine Replacement Clinic for clients of the Opioid Treatment Service. A pilot program will commence in August 2013 with an evaluation that will inform further development of this clinic. Funding for the enhancement of alcohol and drug outpatient services is in the planning phase, which includes consideration of a public opioid treatment clinic in the north of Canberra. The adult Mental Health Services Model of Care project is to review and develop mental health services currently provided to adults (18-64 years) within the ACT. The development of this model of care will inform the concept design of health infrastructure. The model of care will be based on evidence-based practice and comply with all relevant legislations. The implementation of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Model of Care is currently being planned for delivery during 2013-14.156 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Output 1.3 Public Health Services Public Health Services provides high quality health and community services to the ACT and surrounding region. The key strategic priorities for Public Health Services include monitoring the health of the ACT population, promoting health, preventing disease, improving health equity, protecting the health of the public, and supporting workforce excellence (Population Health Division). Public health services in the ACT are largely provided through the Population Health Division. The Population Health Division is headed by the Chief Health Officer who is appointed under the Public Health Act 1997 and reports to the Director-General of ACT Health. The Chief Health Officer is also required to report biennially on the health of the ACT population on specific health-related topics, which is done through the Chief Health Officer's Report . The Population Health Division has primary responsibility for the management of population health issues within ACT Health. The Division undertakes the core functions of prevention, assessment, policy development and assurance, and contributes to local and national policy, program delivery and protocols on population health issues. As of 1 July 2012, the Population Health Division has implemented a new structure: The Health Improvement Branch is responsible for improving the health and wellbeing of the ACT population through promoting healthy behaviours and lifestyles\u2014and providing ongoing monitoring and evaluation of health programs and policy. The Branch includes the ACT Cancer Registry, ACT Cervical Cytology Screening Program and the ACT Health Promotion Grants Program. The Health Protection Service manages risks and implements strategies for the prevention of, and timely response to, public health incidents. This is achieved through a range of regulatory and policy activities relating to areas such as food safety, communicable disease control, environmental health, emergency management, pharmaceutical products, tobacco control, and analytical services. The Office of the Chief Health Officer (OCHO) is responsible for providing public health advice\u2014both internally and externally to the division\u2014as well as high-level project and policy work on behalf of the CHO. Key policy priority areas for the OCHO include gene technology; climate change; the Whole-of-Government Healthy Weight Initiative; and the Whole of Government Initiative on Injury Prevention. Achievements The Population Health Division fulfilled its statutory and national reporting requirements for 2012-13. These included the collection of data for, and maintenance of, the ACT Cancer Registry and Maternal and Perinatal Data Collection. The Population Health Division fulfilled national reporting requirements on public health expenditure, cancer incidence and mortality, and maternal and perinatal statistics for the ACT. On 24 August 2012, the Minister for Health, Katy Gallagher, tabled the 2012 Chief Health Officer's Report . The report is a legislated requirement under the Public Health Act and profiles the health of the ACT population, including mortality, morbidity, health-service use and social factors influencing health. The Population Health Division has a Survey Program that supports the monitoring of population health trends across the Australian Capital Territory. Survey results are published in a number of reports and health series publications which are utilised to inform health policy and program development. The Survey Program includes: - the ACT General Health Survey, a telephone computer-assisted technology household survey which collects information across a range of factors influencing health status in the ACT. - the ACT Secondary School Alcohol and Drug Survey, a classroom-based questionnaire conducted every three years, collecting information on risk behaviours of ACT secondary school students including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use - the ACT Year 6 Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey, a classroom-based questionnaire conducted every three years on children's weight status, physical activity and nutrition The report, The Health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in the ACT 2006-2011 was published in January 2013. This report provides a demographic overview of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the ACT and examines factors influencing their health profile.Section A Performance and financial reporting 157 In 2012-13, the Population Health Division continued to strengthen its quality systems in population health data collection and reporting. This included working toward the development of systems for the electronic transmission of maternal and perinatal data in the ACT, with one notifier developing the capacity to transmit data electronically during this reporting period. The Population Health Division has also continued to build local capacity in data linkage between key population health data collections. In late June 2013, a new notifiable diseases database was implemented after a lengthy development period. The new system will enable more efficient recording and management of notifiable diseases, and will provide accurate, consistent information that complies with national reporting requirements. The database was one of the last remaining recommendations to be finalised from the evaluation of the response to the H1N1 Influenza 2009 pandemic. A food safety guide for businesses was finalised and translated into 11 languages to ensure food safety information was available to non-English speakers. The food safety guide provides comprehensive information about the most common food safety requirements. A food stall guideline for temporary food stalls was developed and translated into 12 languages. The food stall guideline is designed to assist organisers of food stalls at outdoor events in the ACT to meet all necessary food safety requirements. The Food (Nutritional Information) Amendment Act 2011 commenced operation on 1 January 2013, requiring certain food businesses to display the kilojoule (kJ) content of their standard items on menus and price tags. The businesses will also need to display the statement 'The average adult daily energy intake is 8,700kJ' in one location on each menu board and food display stand. Kilojoule displays may encourage consumers to make healthier food choices and promote dietary awareness. They may also encourage food businesses to reformulate foods into healthier options. The Food Amendment Bill 2012 introduced a new requirement for food safety supervisors. From 1 September 2013, all registered food businesses are required to appoint a food safety supervisor responsible for ensuring that hygiene and food safety standards are achieved and maintained in food businesses. The food safety supervisor must complete prescribed training, which will remain current for five years. The ACT Health website provides full information about food safety supervisors, including training requirements. In February 2013, a team of 12 public health officers conducted food inspections during the three-day National Multicultural Festival as a strategy to minimise public health risks from serious breaches of the Food Act 2001 . In total, approximately 300 inspections were conducted over the duration of the event. During inspections of food stalls, Public Health Officers routinely look for issues (breaches) that would give rise to unacceptable food safety risks including temperature control, poor hand-washing facilities and insufficient food storage. A number of food safety breaches were identified, including one food seizure and 12 voluntary disposals of deteriorated food items. - Prior to the event, the Environmental Health (EH) team undertook four community consultation forums. Two were attended by prospective stallholders and one was for a community organisation which requested an additional food safety talk. The final forum was aimed at festival volunteers. - The Pharmaceutical Service Section (PSS) attended a number of community consultation forums while establishing the kava exemption for the festival. Once the kava exemption was in place, a specific forum was held with the communities directly involved with the cultural use of kava, at which the exemption was clearly articulated and explained to stakeholders. The Health Protection Service responded to two major outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness among diners who reported eating at two restaurants in the ACT over the weekend of 11 and 12 May 2013. The first outbreak had 162 cases of gastrointestinal illness, with 78 of these confirmed as Salmonella infections. Of those that have been tested, Salmonella typhimurium 170 has been identified as the causative serotype. More than 90 cases of illness were reported in the second outbreak. During the investigation, Health Protection Service staff interviewed more than 400 people (both well and unwell) from both outbreaks, conducted multiple inspections of the implicated restaurants, and sampled and tested 109 food items from one restaurant. Interviews, inspections and testing of food supported the clinical and epidemiological findings. The response involved significant collaboration between Health Protection Service, the Canberra and Calvary hospitals, and local and interstate laboratories, and included the utilisation of the Health Emergency Coordination Centre. This collaboration and hard work by all, both in the outbreak investigation and in maintaining routine business operations, contributed to the successful investigation and resolution of the outbreak. The Health Protection Service conducted a Legionella Cooling Towers survey, Oriental Grocers food survey, Fresh Squeezed Juice survey and Ready to Eat food survey to determine the bacteriological status and compliance with the relevant legislation and codes of practice.158 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The Chief Health Officer worked closely with the ACT Medicare Local, and both Canberra and Calvary Hospitals to coordinate and document 2013 winter preparedness activities. The subsequent 2013 ACT Health Sector Winter Plan was launched at a media release on 16 April 2013. The 2013 ACT Health Sector Winter Plan documents preparedness activities by agency including stockpiling of essential medicines and equipment, streamlining infectious disease testing, improving surveillance arrangements and developing health facility escalation plans. A review and major revision of the Public Health Emergency Response Plan 2007 was undertaken. The revised Plan was endorsed in early 2013. In 2011, the Health Emergency Management Sub Committee agreed to develop four appendices to the Health Emergency Plan. The Health Emergency Plan Appendix I: ACTBurnPlan and Appendix II: HealthEvacPlan were endorsed by the Health Emergency Management Sub Committee out of session on 30 July 2012. The draft Health Emergency Plan Appendix III: HealthCBRNPlan was endorsed without change at the Health Emergency Management Sub Committee meeting of 18 June 2012. The draft Health Emergency Plan Appendix IV: Part A\u2014 Summer Plan, was also endorsed at the same meeting with minor amendment. The final draft appendix, Appendix IV: Part B\u2014Winter Plan, remains a work in progress. The expected completion date is February 2014, following a trial over the 2013 winter. Once completed, all of the Health Emergency Plan appendices will be provided to the Security and Emergency Management Senior Officials Group, through the ACT Health Executive Council for information. The Population Health Division led a consultation process with the ACT Pacific Island community in 2012 regarding an ACT exemption for cultural kava use. Recommendations were subsequently provided to the Minister for Health. An amendment to the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008 was made on 25 January 2013 to enable use of kava for cultural purposes at declared public events. On 29 January 2013, the Minister for Health declared the National Multicultural Festival held in Canberra each year to be an exempt public event. These changes followed detailed consultation with the ACT Pacific Island community. Overall the serving of kava at the 2013 National Multicultural Festival was regarded to be a success. Officers of the Health Protection Service attended the event to observe stallholder compliance with the exemption. The 2011-12 ACT Health Annual Report noted that the Minister had agreed to introduce a new licensing scheme for community pharmacies under the Public Health Act 1997 . This was successfully implemented by the Health Protection Service over 2012-13. The new licensing scheme came into effect on 1 March 2013 with all existing ACT pharmacies licensed by the required date. Issues and challenges The Population Health Division implemented a new testing method for recreational waters. Since the introduction of the Microbiological Guidelines for the ACT Recreational Waters in 2010, the Health Protection Service has been striving to improve sample turnaround times and the responsiveness of the service on the Public Health status of the local lakes and rivers. This has reduced testing turnaround times from 48 hours to 24 hours and provided the capability to resample sites promptly and provide the community surety regarding the status of our local lakes. Future directions The Health Improvement Branch is developing a new web platform for reporting on national and local indicators, as well as other population health priorities. The Population Health Division undertook an internal review of options to change the requirements for prescribing controlled medicines under the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 2008 . The review followed a number of complaints from the medical and pharmacist communities that the current system imposes excessive regulatory burden and is not achieving its public health objectives. The Health Protection Service (HPS) will be implementing a new real-time monitoring system for controlled medicines in 2013-14. This will involve transmission of data from ACT pharmacies electronically in real time for every controlled medicine that is dispensed. The new system will provide the HPS with a vastly improved tool for monitoring the supply of controlled medicines in the ACT. This is with the view to minimise the risk of harms associated with their misuse, abuse and diversion. The ACT Government announced on 13 June 2013 that commercial solariums will be banned in the ACT from 31 December 2014. The ban is expected to help lower the incidence of skin cancers in the ACT, and is in line with similar bans in other jurisdictions commencing on the same date.Section A Performance and financial reporting 159 ACT Health collaborated with the University of Canberra on the establishment of an accredited Environmental Health course in the ACT. The need for this collaboration was outlined in the 2011 Auditor-General's Report, which identified a necessity for ACT Health to promote the development of an accredited Environmental Health course at a local University to address the shortage of skilled Environmental Health Officers. The collaboration with the University of Canberra seeks to promote environmental health careers and help to address the Environmental Health Officer workforce shortage. The collaboration also hopes to facilitate communication between NSW regional local government, other enforcement agencies, tertiary institutions and ACT Health. It will also ensure the provision of appropriate undergraduate training and network opportunities for students embarking on a career in environmental health. The Environmental Health course is understood to commence in 2014. The Population Health Division is expanding the ambient air monitoring network by establishing an Ambient Air Quality National Environment Protection Measure Performance Monitoring Station in the Belconnen region. This station will assist with assessing and developing policies around ambient air quality. It is expected the establishment of the station at Florey will be completed by December 2013. Scoping and development work for a website featuring air quality data has been undertaken by the Population Health Division. The aim is to allow the public access to ambient air quality data in the Canberra region, with the view to having an Air Quality Index to provide an overall rating of the ambient air quality. The HPS continues work on developing further enforcement strategies regarding food regulation. This includes scoping work on a food hygiene grading scheme for food businesses, often called 'Scores on Doors', pending agreement from the ACT Government. This work will involve consultation with relevant stakeholders, including representatives from food industry, community and public health groups. The HPS will continue to consult with stakeholders concerning food regulation matters. The HPS is implementing the food safety supervisor training requirement, which will become mandatory on 1 September 2013. The HPS also continues to strengthen food safety information base for food businesses and the general public by reviewing current and developing new information. 160 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Output 1.4 Cancer Services Capital Region Cancer Service provides a comprehensive range of screening, assessment, diagnostic, treatment, and palliative care services. Services are provided in inpatient, outpatient, and community settings. The key strategic priorities for cancer care services are early detection and timely access to diagnostic and treatment services. These include ensuring that population screening rates for breast cancer meet targets, waiting times for access to essential services such as radiotherapy are consistent with agreed benchmarks, and increasing the proportion of women screened through the BreastScreen Australia program for the target population (aged 50 to 69 years) to 70 per cent over time. The Capital Region Cancer Service (CRCS) Division is responsible for the provision of oncology, clinical haematology, radiation oncology, BreastScreen and immunology services to the ACT and surrounding region. Services are offered in the form of screening, inpatient and outpatient services and community-based psycho-social support services. The division also manages and coordinates clinical Outpatient administrative support, Health Centre Administration, Community Health Intake and Transcription Services. The clinical services of CRCS integrate existing cancer services across the ACT and surrounding region to ensure a continuum of care for consumers, ranging from prevention and screening through to diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. Services are provided on an area-wide basis and delivered at a number of locations, including hospital and community settings and the patient's home. Achievements The Radiation Oncology department commenced operation of a fourth linear accelerator in July 2012. Additional staff recruited to support this expansion included a radiation oncologist, radiation therapists and nursing staff. This resulted in an increase in services provided. Demand for radiotherapy treatment services increased by 3.4 per cent, with 1,330 courses of treatment provided in 2012-13 compared to 1,286 courses in 2011-12. CRCS provided care for 1,566 new radiation oncology patients in 2012-13. This is a 2.7 per cent increase on the 1,525 new patients in the same period last year. CRCS provided care for 649 new patients from interstate; 642 of these patients were from NSW, representing 41.4 per cent of new patients provided with care. Brachytherapy treatment services provide a highly focused treatment option to a specific group of prostate cancer patients and cervical cancer patients. Indications are that demand for prostate cancer treatment is increasing. However, due to the success of screening and immunisation programs for cervical cancer, there has been a significant decrease in demand for cervical cancer treatment. Over the past 12 months, Radiation Oncology has developed the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) capability offered with the new linear accelerator to treat brain cancers. The SRS service was released for clinical operation in June 2013, with the first patient scheduled for treatment in early July 2013. The implementation of the 'CHARM' cancer information management system has provided a single system for scheduling, billing and ordering complex chemotherapy regimes for Medical Oncology, Haematology and Immunology. Medical Oncology, Haematology and Immunology have implemented electronic signing of chemotherapy orders and commenced the electronic documentation of patient notes, with the aim of eliminating paper records. The Haematology department achieved an end-of-year result 9 per cent over target for outpatient services despite critical haematologist shortages throughout the year. This was achieved through the significant commitment of the haematologists in ensuring that all urgent, category 1 and category 2 patients received appointments within the recommended timeframes. CRCS provided representation on the Cancer Council Australia Oncology Education Committee and the Therapeutic Goods Administration Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicine. The Medical Oncology Office Manager, Marilyn Cooper, was the recipient of the ACT Government Health Directorate Australia Day 2013 Achievement Medallion. Three new haematologists were recruited to CRCS this year, providing much needed specialist support to the department. Two of the specialists have commenced and the third is due to start in August 2013.Section A Performance and financial reporting 161 The implementation of a Radiation Oncology Nurse Led Clinic in January 2013 has improved access for patients following radiation treatment. The clinic provides advice, treatment and medical review, as needed, for patients who have completed a course of radiation treatment. The first peripheral blood stem cell transplant was successfully trialled in an outpatient setting, achieving a reduction of four inpatient days for the overall care. Participation in radiotherapy clinical trials has increased with the appointment of a clinical trials data manager. Participation in technically based trials supports credentialing of processes and independent audit of dosimetry systems for the implementation of new radiotherapy techniques. All nine consultants in Medical Oncology have achieved academic appointments with the Australian National University Medical School and participate in teaching and research. Medical Oncology published four papers in 2012-13 and gave 16 conference presentations. Radiation Oncology successfully applied for an Allied Health Research Support grant to support the establishment of the Palliative Radiotherapy Rapid Access Clinic (PRRAC). This clinic will provide streamlined care for palliative patients requiring radiotherapy treatment. The grant funding is to support salary costs of a radiation therapist engaged in developing the communication aspects of the project. Canberra Hospital Outpatient Services commenced the initial phase of planning for the refurbishment of the waiting areas for Central Outpatients, Ear, Nose and Throat Department, Fracture Clinic, Sleep & Respiratory Department and Diabetes/Endocrinology departments. The refurbishment plans to increase seated waiting areas by at least 50 per cent, with specific consideration given to the needs of bariatric patients, wheelchair access, children's play area and improved signage. Breastscreen ACT achieved a participation rate of 56 per cent for women in the target age group of 50 to 69. This is the highest level achieved in the past five years. BreastScreen ACT underwent a two-day data audit as part of the BreastScreen Australia accreditation process. For the first time all criteria were met. CRCS developed and commenced a clinical audit project to introduce a regular program of clinical audit across all areas of CRCS. Initial baseline data was received for the areas of Patient Identification, Schedule 8 medication register, hand hygiene and falls assessment. The Care of the Dying Patient Collaborative Pathway pilot was implemented on wards 11A, 14B and 10A. The pathway reflects a shift from life-prolonging treatment to palliative care. This enhances comfort and acknowledges the need to actively make decisions that promote sensitive and appropriate care for the patient in the last predicted days of life. It also takes into account the wishes of the patient and family under their Respecting Patient Choices and advanced care plan needs. The pilot has produced excellent feedback to date. Gungahlin Community Health Centre opened in September 2012, offering a wide range of health services. Tuggeranong Health Centre was temporarily relocated to an alternative site at Greenway Waters Suites in January 2013, facilitating the commencement of work to refurbish and extend the existing centre. 4,111 cost-weighted admitted separations were provided by Cancer Services in 2012-13 against the target of 4,142. This constitudes a 2 per cent increase on those provided in 2011-12. 65,462 non-admitted occasions of service were provided by Cancer Services in 2012-13 against the target of 59,260. This is a 14 per cent increase on those provided in 2011-12 and reflects the high demand for services. Against a target of 100 per cent, 99.9 per cent of women received the results of their normal breast screen within 28 days. Against a target of 90 per cent, 94 per cent of women screened who required an assessment were assessed within 28 days of their screening appointment.162 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Issues and challenges Continued growth and increased demand for all CRCS services has challenged the physical space and resources across inpatient and outpatient services. The move to the new Canberra Region Cancer Centre will provide increased outpatient capacity. New models of service are being developed to reflect changes to treatment options and will be implemented in readiness for the move to the new centre. The Haematology department experienced shortages in the haematologist workforce, resulting in extremely high workloads and an increase in the number of less urgent patients waiting to be seen. With the commencement of new specialists in March and April the wait time is being reduced. Breastscreen continues to have challenges in recruiting women to the screening program. Activities continue to promote the program to new women and lapsed attendees. Future directions The Canberra Region Cancer Centre is due to open in the second half of 2013. The new facility and improved models of care will enhance services for patients. The Palliative Radiotherapy Rapid Access Clinic (PRRAC) model of care will be established. This is a patient- centred approach to care whereby appointments are coordinated around patients and their requirements and the waiting time for treatment is reduced. A Radiation Therapist Advanced Practitioner role to support the clinic is being developed, and the clinic is planned to commence operation in August 2013. There will be further development of the stereotactic radiotherapy service to include treatment of a wider range of cancers. BreastScreen ACT is due to complete the National BreastScreen program accreditation process in November 2013. The data audit has been completed and the two-day site visit is scheduled for August 2013. The development of the Cancer Triage and Rapid Assessment model of care is nearing completion, with the implementation of a pilot planned for August 2013. This model of care aims to provide timely access to information and assessment for patients receiving outpatient treatment through CRCS Oncology and Haematology. It will focus on assessing concerns early, allowing treatment and support within the outpatient setting with the aim of reducing and diverting presentations to the emergency department. Belconnen Community Health Centre is scheduled to open for business on 11 November 2013. This is the largest of the new community health centres and it will provide a much wider range of services than was previously available in community health centres, and these will include renal dialysis.Section A Performance and financial reporting 163 Output 1.5 Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care The provision of an integrated, effective and timely response to rehabilitation, aged care and community care services in inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, sub-acute and community-based settings. The key strategic priorities for Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care are: ensuring that older persons in hospital wait the least possible time for access to comprehensive assessment by the Aged Care Assessment Team. This will assist in their safe return home with appropriate support, or access to appropriately supported residential accommodation improving discharge planning to minimise the likelihood of re-admission or inadequate support for independent living, following completion of hospital care ensuring that access, consistent with clinical need, is timely for community-based nursing and allied health services and that community-based services are in place to better provide for the acute and post-acute health care needs of the community. The Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care (RACC) division integrates public health system rehabilitation, aged and community and primary care services across the ACT. The division aims to improve the quality and accessibility of services to clients. RACC promotes a continuum of care covering the range of prevention, assessment, diagnosis, treatment, support, rehabilitation and maintenance. RACC adopts an area-wide approach to client-centred care. To this end, RACC works closely with others to improve the communication between primary, acute, sub-acute and community health care services while fostering professional development and promoting best practice in rehabilitation, aged and community care. RACC services are delivered at a broad range of sites throughout the ACT, including hospitals, community health centres and the homes of clients. This includes health care and support for people with acute, post-acute, long- term and terminal illnesses. The provision of these services includes: hospital-based admitted and outpatient geriatric and rehabilitation medicine services, including ortho- geriatrics, at both the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital geriatric medicine and rehabilitation medicine outpatient services to regional New South Wales the Rapid Assessment of the Deteriorating and At-Risk Aged (RADAR) Service, providing service to older people in their own homes, including to residents of aged care facilities upon referral from a general practitioner aged care client assessment services residential aged care liaison community nursing and allied health services, such as podiatry, social work, nutrition and weight management, physiotherapy, continence services, occupational therapy and self-management of chronic conditions training courses the Transitional Therapy and Care Program (TTCP), providing allied health services to support clients in the post-hospital discharge period, either in a residential setting or in their own homes. RACC provides this service in partnership with Baptist Community Services falls injury prevention services, including falls assessment clinics, the Stepping On program and related health promotion activities transitional rehabilitation at the Rehabilitation Independent Living Unit (RILU) community-based multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services services provided by exercise physiologists, including programs for rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation and hydrotherapy vocational assessment and rehabilitation services driver assessment and rehabilitation services geriatric outpatient speech pathology and neuropsychology services a multi-disciplinary memory assessment service164 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Equipment Scheme Equipment Loan Service Domiciliary Oxygen and Respiratory Support Scheme ACT Continence Support Service Clinical Technology Services a specialised wheelchair and posture seating service prosthetics and orthotics services information and advice on assistive technologies by the Independent Living Centre (ILC). Achievements RACC made improvements to a range of facilities, systems and processes with the aim of improving service provisions, including the following: RACC Prosthetics and Orthotics implemented a triage clinic to better manage client need and wait times. This saw the non-urgent wait time fall from 20 weeks in June 2012 to 13 weeks in June 2013. The Domiciliary Oxygen and Respiratory Support Scheme improved contract arrangements and management of clients. This included annual review of all oxygen clients for the first time in the ACT and the ongoing annual review of all respiratory clients. Following a multi-disciplinary review of how the Spinal Cord Injury Review Clinic was conducted, format changes have allowed for an increase in the number of clients able to attend. Pain management support was introduced in the Rehabilitation Independent Living Unit (RILU) for clients attending the gym for therapy sessions. This has promoted good pain management, allowing the clients to achieve their goals with minimal disruption to their programs. Implementation of multi-disciplinary triage meetings daily has resulted in more timely processing and management of referrals to the Rapid Assessment of the Deteriorating and At-Risk Aged (RADAR) service. Clients referred to RADAR continue to be assessed within the target of one working day. The Exercise Physiology Department implemented a number of service improvements, including the rollout and completion of the Beat It Physical Activity and Lifestyle Program to Health Directorate staff, and the revision and development of standardised testing protocols for exercise tests. RACC strengthened existing initiatives and introduced innovations with the aim of further reducing falls in both community and hospital settings. RACC introduced the following new services in 2012-13: Physiotherapy, nutrition, podiatry services and a nursing ambulatory care clinic are now provided at the new Gungahlin Community Health Centre, which opened in the second half of 2012. Additional workshop space at the Village Creek Centre was refurbished and equipped for the implementation of a custom medical-grade footwear service within the Clinical Technology Service. RACC improved the coordination of geriatric and rehabilitation services across community, outpatient, Emergency Department and inpatient settings: This year saw the successful transition and discharge of the first ventilator-dependent tetraplegic client from inpatient rehabilitation services to the community. This was achieved through comprehensive clinical management, collaboration, and consultation across various health areas and ACT Government departments. RACC Nursing undertook a project aimed at enhancing the experience of elderly clients in the Emergency Department (ED). The project targeted clients either presenting from residential aged care facilities or who were over 85 years. The focus was on improved assessment, diagnosis and treatment of delirium. This project was undertaken collaboratively with the ED. As a result of the project, the average response time by the Department of Geriatric Medicine to the ED showed an improvement of almost 30 minutes. ED staff also report they are now better informed about delirium and dementia. A validated screening tool for malnutrition in the elderly population on 11A, the Acute Care of the Elderly ward at the Canberra Hospital, was introduced. The screen has resulted in more efficient referral to a dietician and timely follow-up.Section A Performance and financial reporting 165 A successful partnership with Goodwin Aged Care Services resulted in an additional eight beds for Canberra Hospital clients approved and waiting for permanent residential aged care placement. This released eight acute beds to assist with access. RACC undertook considerable learning and development activities, including the following: Sustaining a high level of student placement opportunities across the service, including opportunities for students from the University of Canberra, in a number of allied health professions (such as occupational therapy, clinical psychology, podiatry, physiotherapy, nutrition, prosthetics and speech pathology). A nursing-specific core education course on neurological rehabilitation was developed and delivered. This 12-module course is conducted in a cyclical manner on a fortnightly basis. This format is designed to capture all nursing staff over time, without being dependent on their particular scheduled shifts. The Department of Geriatric Medicine has received a Best Clinical Unit for Teaching nomination from the ANU Medical School for the past three years. Through training and mentoring, a career in geriatric medicine was promoted to junior medical officers and medical students. In 2012-13, RACC undertook a number of workforce initiatives, including the following: The successful implementation of a Podiatry Assistant role in the Community Care Podiatry Service in 2011-12 led to the establishment of a second trainee position, commencing in April 2013. Recruitment was undertaken to a Transitional Therapy and Care Program (TTCP) Access Officer position at the Canberra Hospital. The purpose of the position is to improve access to, and occupancy of, the TTCP and to improve the transition from hospital for clients. The position has been operating since March 2013 and early indications are that there have been improvements in TTCP access. RACC services, teams and staff members were nominated for or won the following in 2012-13: The ACT Equipment Scheme (ACTES) Equipment Mobile Repairs and Maintenance Service was evaluated and found to provide a high-quality service, winning an ACT Quality in Healthcare Award in the Innovative Models of Care category. Community Rehabilitation occupational therapy staff were finalists at the ACT Health Quality in Healthcare Awards for Getting on with It\u2014Single Handed, a group designed to look at engagement in functional activities and care of low-function upper limbs. In January 2013, the Rehabilitation Nurse Practitioner was awarded an ACT Health Australia Day achievement medallion. In May 2013, the Rehabilitation Nurse Practitioner was awarded the inaugural Nurse Practitioner of the Year award at the ACT Nursing and Midwifery Excellence Awards. The Equipment Loan Service was awarded an ACT Health Australia Day Team achievement medallion for its contribution to clients in the community. At the Health Promotion Awards in June 2013, the Community Care Program was awarded the ACT Medicare Local Award for Outstanding Achievement in a Primary Health Care Setting for its Healthy Communities Outreach Health Program. RACC staff were also nominees and recipients of awards at the 2012-13 Allied Health Awards for Excellence, nominated for Allied Health Clinical Excellence, Allied Health Management and Leadership Excellence, and winning the Award for Allied Health Assistant Excellence. RACC published and presented key work in 2012-13: The Department of Geriatric Medicine published and presented extensive work on: - cardiovascular and neurological diseases in older patients with osteoporotic hip fracture - interactions between serum adipokines and osteocalcin in older patients with hip fracture - hypertension and haemodynamic instability and falls in the elderly - hip fracture in stroke survivors - the impact of malnutrition on co-morbidities, bone metabolism and outcomes in older adults with hip fracture. Other RACC presentations at conferences in 2012-13 included: - 'Transition from Clinician to Supervisor\u2014How Do We Develop the Health Professional Supervisors of the Future?'166 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 - 'How Do We Know Students Have Positive Clinical Experiences in our Health Service?' - 'Making Self-Reflection a Reality in Workplace Integrated Learning (WIL): Practical Strategies for Supervisors' - 'Adult Healthy Weight Service' - 'Social Inclusion through a Health Coaching Approach to Promoting Healthy Lifestyles in a Disadvantaged Community'\u2014developed in collaboration with the Population Health Division as part of a joint Australian and Territory Government initiative under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health - 'HWA Aged Care Workforce Reform\u2014Introduction of a Discharge Support Allied Health Assistant Role in the Aged Care Setting' - 'MS and Driving: A Consideration for All Health Professionals' - 'DiabExercise: Improving Exercise Physiology Services for the Management of Type 2'. Issues and challenges The upgrade of the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) national software database to reflect changes to Commonwealth legislation required a significant time commitment, on the part of the ACAT team, to understand the changes and implications for the service in readiness for implementation by August 2013. Increasing demand for ACAT assessment remains a challenge to meeting the key performance indicator for priority 3 referrals. Strategies to improve this over the next six months include the review of intake processes and recruitment of casual and temporary staff to meet demand at peak times. Some specialist New South Wales services are no longer providing orthotics services to ACT clients, placing additional pressure on RACC Prosthetics and Orthotics. The lack of residential aged care facility beds in the community is continuing to impact on the average length of stay and separations in aged care. At 30 June 2013, there were 46 public hospital inpatients awaiting residential aged care facility placement. Significant work continues with the prospective decant of some services based on the Canberra Hospital campus as part of the Health Infrastructure Project. The challenges include providing existing services temporarily in a refurbished area and meeting expected increased demands over the next few years, while the University of Canberra Public Hospital is built. Geriatric staffing remains a challenge. Although three new consultant staff have been recruited since early 2011, there was a resignation in June 2013 and there is a retirement pending in September 2013. Advertising for recruitment to vacant positions and temporary backfill to cover maternity leave are imminent. In 2012-13, there were three Advanced Trainees in Geriatric Medicine. Future directions Model of care projects are being finalised to support the expansion of community-based services in community health centres. This includes the provision of services, equipment and facilities to enhance the overall experience of clients and staff. A key focus is to deliver health services that are built around the client, addressing needs at the local level. Consumers and staff are central to the design of all new services and facilities. New nurse-led walk-in centres (WiC) will be located at the Belconnen and Tuggeranong Community Health Centre opening in 2014. The model of care for the new WiCs will be similar to that of the Canberra Hospital WiC, which is available for the one-off treatment of minor illness and injury. No appointment is necessary and the service is provided free to clients. Access to RACC nursing and allied health community-based services in Canberra's north will be improved as clinics at the new Belconnen Community Health Centre open in late 2013. Work continues with user groups in preparation for the building of the University of Canberra Public Hospital, a stand-alone subacute facility on the north side of Canberra. This exciting project will feature a centre of excellence for subacute care, including inpatient and ambulatory models of care for rehabilitation. There are plans to review the input of Community Geriatrics to have greater input into the assessment and follow-up of elderly clients presenting to ED, especially with falls, to expedite their safe discharge from ED and minimise the likelihood of re-presentation. In collaboration with other ACT Government directorates, including the Community Services Directorate, RACC will participate in the rollout of DisabilityCare Australia in the ACT.Section A Performance and financial reporting 167 Output 1.6 Early intervention and prevention Increasing the focus on initiatives that provide early intervention to, or prevent, healthcare conditions that result in major acute or chronic health care burdens on the community. The key strategic priorities for intervention and prevention are reducing the level of youth smoking in the ACT and maintaining immunisation rates for children above 90 per cent. ACT Health undertakes several activities aimed at increasing the focus on initiatives that provide early intervention to, or prevent, health conditions that may result in major acute or chronic health care burdens on the community. Early intervention is managed in many ways including the Health Directorate screening programs such as BreastScreen, cervical screening, and newborn hearing screening, as well as through immunisation programs. The Health Directorate supports a comprehensive range of programs aimed at primary prevention to reduce the onset, causes and complications of chronic diseases. ACT Health primary prevention programs are aimed at better understanding, quantifying and preventing chronic disease across the wider ACT population. Achievements The ACT maintained its position as the jurisdiction with the highest life expectancy in Australia. Projections suggest that life expectancy in the ACT will continue to increase over coming years. By 2015, life expectancy at birth in the ACT is projected to be 83.1 years for males (up 2.4 years from 2007) and 86.5 for females (up 2.5 years from 2007). Cancer, mental disorders and cardiovascular disease are the leading contributors to the total burden of disease in the ACT, contributing nearly half of the total disease burden. ACT Health will receive $8.75 million in facilitation payments through the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH) from July 2010 to June 2018. The partnership has been extended within the existing funding envelope, to add a further three years, from June 2015 until June 2018. The NPAPH is aimed at stimulating action in preventing chronic disease. The NPAPH funds the delivery of five different initiatives: Social Marketing; Healthy Children; Healthy Workers; Healthy Communities; and Enabling Infrastructure. Social Marketing: In December 2012, an ACT-developed campaign, 'Beyond Today...it's up to you' was launched to encourage healthy lifestyles and smoking cessation among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Social Marketing: In March 2013, information was sent to approximately 25,000 ACT residents aged 45-49 years to advise them of free health checks and the Get Healthy Service. Medicare Australia website data shows that the number of people claiming the health check Medicare Benefits Schedule items 701, 703, 705, 707 in the ACT in March-April 2013 had doubled compared to the same period in the previous year. Two weeks following the mail out, Get Healthy ACT data showed that the average number of participants joining the service had almost tripled. Healthy Children: ACT Health is receiving $4.09 million over seven years from July 2011, to deliver programs aimed at reducing the rates of overweight and obesity in children aged 0-18 years. These include: - Healthy food at school : an initiative to transform the healthy food and drink culture in ACT schools, in around 75 schools over the next five years. The program targets children from pre-school to Year 6. - It's your move : a research intervention with Deakin University, targeting high schools to increase physical activity and healthy eating and aiming to reduce unhealthy weight gain in young people aged 12-16 years. - Ride or walk to school : an initiative to encourage riding and walking to school in a minimum of 60 schools over the next five years. Healthy Workers: ACT Health is receiving $3.66 million over seven years for the delivery of programs that promote and support healthy lifestyles in and through ACT workplaces. The Healthy Workers program has achieved the following in 2012-13: - Healthier Work : The ACT Healthier Work Service was launched in May 2012 and has conducted site visits to over 100 ACT workplaces. A workplace incentives grants program was conducted in 2013 with 27 workplaces supported to initiate or consolidate staff health and wellbeing programs.168 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 - Public sector health promotion : In partnership with the Chief Minister and Treasury, ACT Health supported the development of an ACT whole-of-government Workplace Health and Wellbeing Policy which was endorsed in May 2012. It also implemented a comprehensive staff health and wellbeing program within ACT Health known as 'my health' and facilitated a staff survey and public consultation on the development of a healthy food and drink choices policy for staff, volunteers and visitors to ACT Health facilities. Healthy Communities Initiative (HCI): This initiative receives funding under the NPAPH and aims to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults not in paid employment in the Inner North of Canberra. Achievements in 2012-13 included: - increased coverage of programs such as Heart Foundation Walking and Heartmoves, to increase physical activity and improved nutritional intake - increased nutrition education by Community Health Dietitians, introduction of outreach clinics delivered by Continuing Care nursing and allied health staff, and improved food and nutrition intake through the Red Cross Foodcents program - increase in numbers of people participating in active recreation. Following a successful public consultation program, the Chief Minister announced a refocused Health Promotion Grants program. A new 'Healthy Canberra Grants' round will focus on tackling obesity across the population, and on improving children's health, including improving eating habits through school canteens and food education. A new 'Health Promotion Innovation Fund' will be also be introduced. This fund will offer smaller value grant funding opportunities several times per year. The ACT Health Food and Nutrition Strategic Framework 2012-18 was released in September 2012. This framework highlights healthy eating and optimal nutrition as priorities for the Health Directorate and creates greater recognition of the importance of nutrition in optimising health outcomes. To effectively tackle rising rates of overweight and obesity, broad action is required beyond the traditional health sector to make healthy choices easier in our neighbourhoods, workplaces and schools. Under the Whole of Government Healthy Weight Initiative, all Directorates of the ACT Government are working together to develop and implement actions to increase physical activity and improve nutrition across the ACT population. The development of the ACT's first whole of government action plan on obesity prevention is underway. The Whole of Government Healthy Weight Initiative was allocated $0.3 million under the 2012-13 ACT budget over three years. The ACT continued to achieve high childhood immunisation coverage in the general population. Coverage rates for children in all three cohorts were consistently above the national average. In 2012-13, ACT childhood immunisation coverage rates remained above the national target of 90 per cent for 12-month-old children. ACT Health's target of 92 per cent of 1-year-old children being fully immunised was exceeded in all quarters (93.1 per cent, 93 per cent, 92.5 per cent and 92.6 per cent). In July 2009 the National Partnership Agreement on Essential Vaccines was implemented. The objective of this Agreement is to improve the health and wellbeing of Australians through the cost-effective delivery of the National Immunisation Program. The Agreement sets out performance benchmarks that must be achieved for the ACT to be eligible for an incentive payment. The performance benchmarks associated with the essential vaccines Agreement are: 1. maintaining or increasing vaccine coverage for Indigenous Australians 2. maintaining or increasing coverage in agreed areas of low immunisation coverage 3. maintaining or decreasing wastage and leakage 4. maintaining or increasing vaccination coverage for 4-year olds. The ACT cannot be assessed against benchmark 2 (maintaining or increasing coverage in agreed areas of low immunisation coverage), as the ACT does not have any identified areas of low immunisation coverage. In 2012-13 the ACT achieved two of the three assessable benchmarks\u2014maintaining or decreasing wastage and leakage (benchmark 3) and maintaining or increasing vaccination coverage for 4-year olds (benchmark 4). Section A Performance and financial reporting 169 The ACT did not meet the performance benchmark 1, maintaining or increasing vaccine coverage for Indigenous Australians. The ACT only improved on the immunisation rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the 4-year cohort. There was a drop in immunisation coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at 12-15 months and 24-27 months. As there are very low numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in each cohort the coverage data can fluctuate widely. For the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 the mean immunisation coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT was: - 12-15 months\u201481.5 per cent - 24-27 months\u201491.6 per cent - 60-63 months\u201491.0 per cent. For the period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, the mean immunisation coverage for 4-year old children in the ACT increased by 0.9 per cent from the previous year and was 92.3 per cent. The ACT Immunisation Strategy 2012-2016, was launched on 17 December 2012. It aims to expand the focus of immunisation to whole of life and to reduce hospital admissions for vaccine preventable diseases, particularly in high-risk groups. The primary objectives of the Strategy are to: - ensure the ongoing appropriateness, quality, safety and effectiveness of the ACT immunisation program - maintain or improve our current immunisation coverage - maintain or decrease our current levels of vaccine-preventable diseases in the Canberra community, thereby decreasing the pressures on primary health care such as GPs, walk in centres and tertiary health facilities such as hospitals, especially emergency departments - support and maintain the current high quality immunisation workforce with education and resources. As pregnant women are at higher risk of severe disease from influenza, the vaccine is recommended and funded for all pregnant women. There has historically been a low uptake of the influenza vaccine with pregnant women. To increase the influenza vaccination rates Health Protection Service liaised with the maternity units of TCH, Calvary and John James. Influenza promotion to parents and education to staff was provided. The vaccine is now offered to all women who are admitted to the antenatal units or outpatients of the antenatal clinics at TCH. Posters have also been provided to General Practitioners, obstetricians, child care centres and libraries. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program for boys commenced in 2013 and is offered to 12-13 year old boys (Year 7) via a school program with a two-year catch-up component for boys in Year 9. Under the National Immunisation Program (NIP) boys in Year 7 are eligible to receive the funded vaccine. As part of a catch-up program, boys in Year 9 in 2013 and 2014 are also being offered the vaccine. The vaccine is administered by the school health team. Boys in Year 10 and above who are 15 years of age or younger are able to access the vaccine through their general practitioner. To promote this new vaccination program the Health Protection Service and the Division of Women, Youth and Children provided communication to stakeholders which included: - letters and information to General Practitioners and general practice staff - articles in the 'Immunisation Newsletter' - media releases, education events and information on the ACT Health website. HPV vaccination course consists of three vaccinations. The administration of the first dose of the HPV vaccination program was completed by May 2013. A total of 5,739 doses of vaccine were administered to eligible students. Preliminary data indicates that the following coverage rates have been achieved for the first dose: - Year 7 girls \u201482.5 per cent - Year 7 boys \u201479.2 per cent - Year 9 boys \u201472.0 per cent. The Cervical Screening Program captures and reports data over a 2-year period as recommended by the National Cervical Screening Program. As of 30 June 2013, the ACT participation rate for the target population was 57.14 per cent. The AIHW report, Cervical Screening in Australia 2010-2011 , again puts the ACT in the top three jurisdictions in Australia for participation in cervical screening and first overall in Australia for the five- year participation rate. 170 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 During 2012-13, the Cervical Screening Program actively promoted cervical screening among community groups. The main message in this promotion is for young women to continue screening even if they have been vaccinated against HPV. Program staff have attended several notable women's health promotional events around the ACT to promote screening in the community. In addition several print media campaigns were implemented to promote screening among women in community publications as well as ACT Government publications targeting ACT Government staff. Several new brochures were designed and produced. BreastScreen ACT & SE NSW is part of a national population breast screening program that is aimed at reducing deaths from breast cancer through early detection. Further information can be found under Cancer Services on page 160 of this report . Newborn Hearing Screenings are provided to every newborn in the ACT and aim to identify babies born with significant hearing loss and introduce them to appropriate services as soon as possible. Further information can be found under Division of Women, Youth and Children on page 143 of this report . School-based nursing programs include immunisations and kindergarten health checks. The School Youth Health Nurse Program promotes positive health outcomes for young people by providing access to a nurse in the high school setting. Further information can be found under Division of Women, Youth and Children on page 143 of this report . As part of the Commonwealth-funded National Bowel Cancer Screening Project, endoscopy services are provided to patients. Further information can be found under Division of Medicine on page 133 of this report. Forty per cent of all Well Woman's Checks were provided to women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This is above the target of 30 per cent, and is the same result as in the 2011-12 period. Ninety-six per cent of eligible children aged 0 to 14 who entered substitute and kinship care in the ACT were seen by the Child at Risk Health Unit's Out-of-Home Care Clinic. This is above the target of 80 per cent, and an increase of 16 per cent from the 2011-12 period. In May 2013, the ACT Minister for Health endorsed the ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy \u2014Improving Care and Support 2013-2018, building on the previous strategy. The ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy\u2014Improving Care and Support 2013-2018 sets the direction of care and support for those living with chronic conditions in the ACT and outlines a collaborative approach to this vitally important area of healthcare. Implementation and evaluation of the Strategy is being overseen by the ACT Primary Health and Chronic Disease Steering Committee. Issues and challenges The immunisation coverage rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in two of the three cohorts (12-15 months and 24-27 months) decreased in 2012-13. The very low numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT means that ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander coverage data should be read with caution as the immunisation coverage rates can fluctuate greatly. Coverage rates can vary dramatically between cohorts and between reporting periods. Increasing and maintaining high immunisation coverage rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children will continue to be a challenge. The Health Protection Service is actively pursuing different strategies to increase immunisation rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children including: phone contact with children identified as overdue for immunisations, discussions with stakeholders, liaising with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and investigating immunisation promotion opportunities with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Working collaboratively with the ACT Medicare Local, Closing the Gap unit to produce resources and educate communities on the importance of immunisation. Health Protection Service undertakes a quarterly mail-out to parents of children who are recorded in the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register as overdue for immunisation. This letter advises parents or guardians that their child is overdue for immunisation, reminds them of the importance of vaccination and enables any administered but unrecorded immunisations to be entered onto ACIR. Section A Performance and financial reporting 171 Future directions Following the successful implementation of the Whole of Government Healthy Weight Initiative, the ACT Government will commence collaborative action to reduce the burden of injury on the ACT population. Injury accounts for approximately 7 per cent of the burden of disease in the ACT, and addressing this issue is pivotal to reducing the incidence of premature mortality, chronic disability and the associated health system costs. The Minister for Health launched Future Directions for Tobacco Reduction 2013-2016 on World No Tobacco Day (31 May 2013). The purpose was to inform the Canberra community of the 12 initiatives proposed by ACT Health in tobacco control. These initiatives aim to investigate restricting access to tobacco to reduce demand and control supply and restricting places of tobacco use. The areas that will be looked at include outdoor areas at public swimming pools, children's playgrounds, among many others, where measures could be taken to reduce smoking and protect non-smokers from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. The timeframes are outlined in Future Directions, with work on each initiative phased over the life of Future Directions. In 2012 the Population Health Division was successful in winning an Australian Research Council Grant in partnership with the Australian National University. This grant will enable the development of methods by which research in population health can be better used by policy-makers. In 2012-13 work began with decision-makers and policy advocates to identify barriers to the uptake of research evidence in population health and to develop a training model to improve processes by which researchers and policy-makers work together. Tools to assist policy-makers use evidence will be developed following this study. Quality and Safety Unit Safety and quality of care are core elements in the provision of health services. The Quality and Safety Unit (QSU) takes a lead role in planning, managing and evaluating patient safety and quality for the ACT Health Directorate. The QSU focuses on quality improvement, evaluation and review, clinical management systems and measurement, consumer engagement, clinical performance related to patient safety and quality, and risk management. The Workplace Safety section within the QSU has overarching responsibility for keeping Health Directorate staff healthy and safe. The Business Plan for the QSU highlights three themes which underpin the functions of the unit. These themes are that care provided to consumers will be: consumer-centred driven by information organised for safety. These themes have been compiled using: recommendations and information from reviews and monitoring processes carried out within the Health Directorate national and international health improvement methods national priority and reform processes. National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards QSU is committed to advancing the national agenda on patient safety and is working closely with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care to progress implementation of the 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards . The QSU also coordinates the accreditation process for the organisation. The Accreditation and Evaluation team is currently managing changes in accreditation practice to ensure that the Health Directorate is ready for its assessment against the 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards in 2014. 172 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Achievements In 2012-13, the QSU carried out the following activities. Policies and procedures Developed clear policy documents on important safety and quality issues such as: - consent and Treatment Policy and Standard Operating Procedures - responding to the use of non-prescription alcohol and other drugs in health settings - open disclosure - work health and safety, and the safety management system - dangerous substance management. Issued a Respiratory Policy to ensure appropriate respiratory protection is maintained for all relevant staff.

ACT Health is committed to providing opportunities for consumers and carers, those who are most affected by healthcare services, to influence the development, delivery and review of services. Increasing the participation of consumers and carers in health care is fundamental to building a strong partnership. ACT Health services will be able to provide higher quality care as a result of meaningful consumer and carer involvement in policy development and planning of health services. The ACT Health Consumer and Carer Participation Framework aims to assist consumers, carers and ACT Health staff to work in genuine collaboration in order to: increase consumer and carer participation in health care facilitate joint decision making at all levels improve the development, delivery and evaluation of ACT's public health services. Opportunities for consumer participation within the health system exist at many levels and at many points within the continuum of care and delivery of services. These include but are not limited to participation at: the level of individual care, where there are interactions between the consumer, patient and/or carer and the healthcare providers the service level, where consumer and carer participation is focused on contributing to service delivery guidelines and procedures the organisational level, where the level of participation is focused on broader strategic and policy development activity. ACT Health already has in place an extensive range of established practices and initiatives that demonstrate its ongoing commitment to consumer and carer participation. Examples of these include: Listening and Learning: Consumer Feedback Policy and Standards implementation of the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights and Charter on the Rights of Children and Young People in Healthcare Services in Australia Consumer, Carer and Community Representative program and Reimbursement Policy relationships with consumer advocacy agencies through service funding agreements Respecting Patient's Choices Patient and Family Centred Care Framework.

Standing Committee on Public Accounts Report No. Title Date presented 25 Review of Auditor-General's Report No. 1 of 2011\u2014Waiting Lists for Elective Surgery and Medical Treatment22 August 2012 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 1. The Committee recommends that the ACT Auditor- General should program a follow-up audit to examine the management of access to elective surgery across the ACT's public hospitals at the midpoint of the 8th ACT Legislative Assembly term. Noted. The Auditor-General determines her work plan independently of Government advice.Not applicable. Report No. Title Date presented 29 Review of Auditor-General's Report No. 6 of 2012\u2014 Emergency Department Performance Information3 July 2012 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 1. The Committee recommends that the Minister for Health give consideration to finalising the Government submission to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in response to Auditor- General's Report No. 6 of 2012: Emergency Department Performance Information earlier than three months after the report being tabled.Not agreed. There are a large number of recommendations in the Public Accounts Committee Report. The proposed timeframe for responding to the Public Accounts Committee recommendations was not achievable prior to the commencement of the caretaker conventions in the lead up to the Territory election in October 2012. This submission now addresses that response.No further action required. 2. The Committee recommends that the Minister for Health make representations at the appropriate forums to progress the concept of a regular national audit by the Commonwealth Auditor-General of health performance and data integrity as it relates to Commonwealth agreements through the recently amended legislative provisions of the Commonwealth Auditor-General Act 1997.Noted. The concept of data integrity on health performance monitoring is integral to ensuring consistent and accurate monitoring and assessment of performance across all jurisdictions. In light of issues that have arisen at Canberra Hospital emergency department, the Commonwealth will undoubtedly put in place processes to ensure accuracy of data. Issues relating to data integrity and reporting have been raised by the ACT at the recent Australian Health Ministers Council and work is underway on a National basis to improve the quality of information we report. At a local level, the ACT Health Directorate is implementing strategies to improve data quality controls across the organisation. A Director of Data Integrity position is being established to oversee processes and methods for data collection, collation and reporting. There is also a review underway to review the data governance structure across Health to ensure greater consistency and accountability for the data that is reported locally and to external agencies. The ACT Health Directorate has gone to tender to undertake a data integrity audit. This audit is aimed at assessing Health data assets to tighten up controls on the entry and security of health related information. On behalf of the Government, the Chief Minister has raised at a national level the issue of striving for nationally consistent measures for emergency department performance. It is the Government's aim to work with other jurisdictions to minimise the variable interpretation that currently exists around data definitions and reported data, ensuring that we obtain and report data that is comparable between States and Territories. The Government will also be seeking agreement from other jurisdictions to implement more qualitative measures of the effectiveness of outcomes for patients treated in the nation's emergency departments.The Commonwealth and relevant national authorities will implement mechanisms to ensure data integrity as part of the National Health Reform Agreement. 3. The Committee recommends that the Government of the day review the security of information which identifies individual patients at the Canberra Hospital and report on the outcomes of this review to the ACT Legislative Assembly on the first sitting day of 2013.Agreed in part. The Health Directorate is in the process of developing System Security Plans for all applications considered by the Health Directorate and Shared Services ICT to be either Government or Business Critical. This process is based on assurances in relation to the security of information which directly identifies patients. It is planned to have these security plans completed by June 2013. Two plans have been finalised to date, with another seven plans close to completion. These plans include all of the key applications that contain individual patient information. The timeframe specified by the Committee was not achievable and therefore is not agreed.Security plans are being developed for all applications across ACT Health.204 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 4. The Committee recommends that the Health Directorate in conjunction with Shared Services ICT ensure that appropriate training on every IT related hospital system, with a particular focus on the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS), is provided to all staff at the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.Agreed. Training for systems is managed by Shared Services ICT Health and training is provided for staff at the commencement of duties and where training requirements are subsequently identified (ie when staff transfer to areas requiring application use or have extended leave that may require a refresher eg Maternity leave). New training packages have been developed for the EDIS which focus on the different roles of people within the emergency department (nurses, administrative staff, doctors). New systems are also being implemented which will require more formal training processes to be completed by all staff within the emergency department. Comprehensive training in the major systems (such as the ACT Patient Administration System) is provided for Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital and community services staff. Training is provided for the equipment lending system for the service at Kambah. Training is provided in relation to access to the Clinical Portal on an as-needs basis and immediately for staff identifying the requirement, and is otherwise scheduled. Training is provided for the Mental Health Assessment Generation and Information Collection (MHAGIC) system. Access is provided on the completion of training provided by Shared Services ICT Health. The other training and support model is managed through business units for all other application training and support. Specifically, emergency department training and system administration is managed locally by the each hospital service and training is provided to hospital staff by the ACT Health staff who manage the systems. Other IT related hospital systems are managed using a similar model to ED and training is addressed as needed and where appropriate scheduled for groups. A number of the IT related hospital systems may support specialist and limited user requirements to service a particular business need or functional requirement. Local business support models accommodate these requirements. There is also work underway assessing the Data Governance across the Directorate. One key recommendation will be to conduct a full scale audit of all data assets across the Directorate. This process will enable visibility of all data systems and processes. The Directorate will be able to assess current data assets and develop appropriate training and protocols for the collection, collation and reporting of health system information. This process will be ongoing with regular auditing of data to provide further evidence of additional training requirements.Systems are in place to provide training for staff in all relevant applications. New training modules are being developed for the new version of EDIS.Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 205 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 4. The Committee recommends that the Health Directorate in conjunction with Shared Services ICT ensure that appropriate training on every IT related hospital system, with a particular focus on the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS), is provided to all staff at the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.Agreed. Training for systems is managed by Shared Services ICT Health and training is provided for staff at the commencement of duties and where training requirements are subsequently identified (ie when staff transfer to areas requiring application use or have extended leave that may require a refresher eg Maternity leave). New training packages have been developed for the EDIS which focus on the different roles of people within the emergency department (nurses, administrative staff, doctors). New systems are also being implemented which will require more formal training processes to be completed by all staff within the emergency department. Comprehensive training in the major systems (such as the ACT Patient Administration System) is provided for Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital and community services staff. Training is provided for the equipment lending system for the service at Kambah. Training is provided in relation to access to the Clinical Portal on an as-needs basis and immediately for staff identifying the requirement, and is otherwise scheduled. Training is provided for the Mental Health Assessment Generation and Information Collection (MHAGIC) system. Access is provided on the completion of training provided by Shared Services ICT Health. The other training and support model is managed through business units for all other application training and support. Specifically, emergency department training and system administration is managed locally by the each hospital service and training is provided to hospital staff by the ACT Health staff who manage the systems. Other IT related hospital systems are managed using a similar model to ED and training is addressed as needed and where appropriate scheduled for groups. A number of the IT related hospital systems may support specialist and limited user requirements to service a particular business need or functional requirement. Local business support models accommodate these requirements. There is also work underway assessing the Data Governance across the Directorate. One key recommendation will be to conduct a full scale audit of all data assets across the Directorate. This process will enable visibility of all data systems and processes. The Directorate will be able to assess current data assets and develop appropriate training and protocols for the collection, collation and reporting of health system information. This process will be ongoing with regular auditing of data to provide further evidence of additional training requirements.Systems are in place to provide training for staff in all relevant applications. New training modules are being developed for the new version of EDIS. Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 5. The Committee recommends that robust data validation processes be established for the Canberra Hospital and that the Government of the day report to the ACT Legislative Assembly on the first sitting day of 2013 on their implementation.Agreed in part. Validation of data in the Health Directorate occurs at a number of points along the continuum from the point of data collection in the source system to end use of the data for reporting and analysis. The first tier of validation involves review by administrative staff and system administrators at the time of data entry into the Emergency Department Information System, usually on a daily basis. A second tier of data validation occurs at the time when data is extracted from source systems and sent to the Health Directorate for centralised processing. This validation process occurs on a monthly basis whereby each record extracted from the source system is run through a series of validation checks against established criteria in order to assess the completeness, accuracy and quality of the data. These validations ensure that ACT data meets nationally mandated data specifications as well as additional validations developed within ACT Health based on analyses of data, such as cross-checking data sources with data extracts used for reporting purposes, and the auditing of data extracts back to source systems to ensure that no changes are made to data extracts. Each month a report is produced on records that fail the validation criteria and then sent back to the originating hospital for investigation at the point of service to determine if the record is correct or requires updating in the source system. Records flagged for investigation will keep re-appearing on consecutive monthly reports until such time as the data is corrected in the source system or advice is received that the record is accurate. These validation checks review all records for possible errors and validity, regardless of whether they have or have not met timeliness targets or other established benchmarks. They also include, where possible, validation checks that have been developed at the national level for checking the quality of Emergency Department data at the point when all State health authorities submit their data to national bodies. Additional checks that are designed to monitor and identify any significant change in trends at a more aggregate level have also been implemented in the Health Directorate at the point of analysis and reporting of Emergency Department data. Prior to the issues with emergency department data in 2012, a number of audit checks were in place to ensure data accuracy. This included audits by the staff who reviewed data following the completion of an emergency department record for any inconsistencies or inaccuracies. This process continues. However, in addition to these checks, additional, system-generated checks are undertaken which monitor any changes to data following the audit process as well as additional reports which have been developed to note any changes to results. These additional processes will provide the mechanisms to highlight any changes to data that are not supported by evidence. The Health Directorate is currently reviewing processes for data validation in other jurisdictions to ascertain if there are any areas for improvement based on experiences elsewhere. The timeframe specified by the Committee was not achievable and therefore not agreed.Validation processes are already in place. Additional audit checks for EDIS will be implemented with the introduction of the new system in late 2013.206 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 6. The Committee recommends that, consistent with the recommendation of the Auditor- General, the rapid sign-on system be implemented as soon as practicable and that the Government of the day report to the ACT Legislative Assembly at the earliest opportunity on its implementation.Agreed. The ACT Government Health Directorate has been working with Shared Services ICT to develop and trial a pilot of the Rapid Sign-On technology to ensure that the human useability factors and technical feasibility are addressed to minimise the disruption to clinical workflow. The completion of this pilot will result in a recommendation and costs for consideration by the organisation to proceed to widespread implementation within the Health Directorate and its diverse applications. The Pilot timeframe is expected to be completed by end of December 2013 with the resulting cost model and implementation plan to be considered by the Health Directorate. This pilot will draw upon a variety of business and technical resources to integrate a number of key components to ensure that the Rapid Sign- On solution is easy to use for our staff, secure, robust and reliable. The implementation of the Rapid Sign-On Technology will focus in areas of highest need, such as the Emergency Department, with a progressive rollout that is likely to take a period of time before the entire organisation has all of the benefits. This timeframe will become clear following the completion of the pilot study. This is largely as a result of the level of training and change management that will be needed for a successful integration of technology into existing clinical work practices without impacting upon patient care.The pilot project is due to be completed by the end of 2013. The assessment of the pilot will determine the roll-out of the technology. 7. The Committee recommends that all ACT Government directorates and agencies should have effective practices and processes in place to review all reports of the Auditor- General, and to assess the relevance of the findings and recommendations to their agency, regardless of whether the agency was involved in a specific audit.Agreed. The Director-Generalof the ACT Government Health Directorate wrote to all ACT Government Directors- General. Directorates are reviewing their processes to ensure that this occurs.Completed. The ACT Health Director- General wrote to all directors-general noting this recommendation.Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 207 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 8. The Committee recommends that all ACT Government directorates and agencies should prioritise as a matter of urgency an assessment of the adequacy of controls over their respective IT systems and applications. This should include consideration of the controls that affect the reliability of all IT systems and applications (general controls) and controls that are specific to each application (application controls).Agreed. On 4 July 2012, the Chief Minister wrote to all Ministerial colleagues, and subsequently, the Director General of the ACT Government Health Directorate wrote to all ACT Government Directorates to draw their attention to this issue. Responses note that systems are in place across the ACT to ensure control of access to and use of IT systems. The Government's new Commerce and Works Directorate has responsibility for providing a secure ICT operating environment within which Directorates operate their business applications. Responsibility for specific applications and the internal controls necessary to address indentified risks lie with the respective Directorate. Security advice to Directorates is provided by the SS ICT Security Team. SS ICT has in place many of the controls required to maintain the security of applications (including but not limited to): Whole of Government security policies, standards and procedures; A dedicated security team with high levels of skill in all facets of ICT, Physical, Personnel and Information security, including forensics, web penetration assessment, security architecture, risk assessments and secure coding. Ready to assist directorates as required; A detailed security audit program across the ACT governments networks to minimise vulnerabilities; A Security Awareness training program available free of charge to all directorates; Assistance in the provision of security templates and advice to facilitate Directorates assessing risks and treatment strategies for their applications; Vulnerability assessment for both internally and externally facing applications; Server build standards; Robust and rigorous system and application change control processes; A robust and secure Internet Gateway and communications network; Good physical security controls around data centres; Internet content filtering and Anti-spam; Workstation end point protection to address malware; Device encryption for Laptops; Having encrypted 'Thumb-drives' available for secure transport and storage of files; Server based anti malware protection; Network Access control; Backup and storage strategies tailored to directorate needs. Shared Services ICT Security assists business system owners to conduct system level risk assessments and complete system level security plans specific to each Directorate in accordance with Auditor General report 2/2012, Recommendation 3e. This assistance identifies and manages vulnerabilities in relation to issues of confidentiality, integrity and availability of application systems.Completed. The ACT Health Director- General wrote to all directors-general noting this recommendation. In addition, security plans are being developed for all ACT Health systems (see recommendation 3 above).208 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 9. The Committee recommends that the Government of the day detail to the ACT Legislative Assembly, at the earliest possible opportunity, how it will address and improve issues about achievements against throughput and triage targets as they relate to the Emergency Department at the Canberra HospitalAgreed. The detailed plan to address issues in relation to access to emergency departments and improving performance was tabled on the last sitting day in March 2013.Completed. The Minister for Health tabled the ED access plan in the ACT Legislative Assembly in March 2013. 10. The Committee recommends that clear guidelines be established concerning internal communication between the ACT Health Directorate, the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.Noted. There are a number of formal committee meetings that ensure visibility and clarity on issues affecting all facets of the Health Directorate and Calvary Public Hospital. A monthly Finance and Performance meeting has been established to discuss matters relating to activity and financial pressures experienced by Calvary Public Hospital. Administrative officers from Health and Calvary attend the forum and were applicable, items discussed that are of concern can be further raised at regular Network Committee meetings for resolution. The ACT Health Directorate and Calvary Health Care ACT have established a Network Agreement to clarify the relationship between the Health Directorate and Calvary Public Hospital. As part of this, a regular meeting between both entities occurs as well as a formal monthly meeting being established between both parties to discuss issues related to pressures and activity. This provides the basis for the relationship between entities and provides clear guidelines in relation to communication between parties.Systems are in place. The Calvary Network Agreement Committee provides for high-level communication between entities and the Finance and Performance Committee provides for more detailed operational matters to be discussed. 11. The Committee recommends that clear guidelines be established concerning external communication regarding matters concerning the ACT Health Directorate, the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.Agreed. The Health Directorate works with a range of national organisations and committees to ensure that our information is consistent with national guidelines and standards. This includes representation on Committees established by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the National Health Performance Authority, sub-committees of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council and meetings arranged by the COAG Reform Council in relation to health matters. The Health Directorate will establish a communication plan to ensure that outcomes from these national meetings are communicated more effectively across the Directorate. Clear guidelines and agency representation exist for all major national committees and organisations. Responsibilities are clearly articulated to relevant executives.Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 209 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 9. The Committee recommends that the Government of the day detail to the ACT Legislative Assembly, at the earliest possible opportunity, how it will address and improve issues about achievements against throughput and triage targets as they relate to the Emergency Department at the Canberra HospitalAgreed.

Clear guidelines and agency representation exist for all major national committees and organisations. Responsibilities are clearly articulated to relevant executives. Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 12. The Committee recommends that the Government of the day detail to the ACT Legislative Assembly, at the earliest possible opportunity, what action the Health Directorate has taken to assess whether a prevailing organisational culture at the Canberra Hospital contributed to the circumstances surrounding the alteration and misreporting of performance information.Agreed. As a result of findings of data alteration at Canberra Hospital emergency department, the Health Directorate commissioned two audit reports, part of which involved the assessment of reasoning behind the need to tamper with this data. The outcome of these assessments can be found in the Audit Report conducted by PWC. In addition, the Health Directorate conducted the 4th in a series of organization-wide Workplace Culture Surveys over the period 19 March - 11 April 2012. This followed surveys conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009, each of which was used to identify, promote and track the outcomes of key development initiatives across the organisation, as well as specific activities within divisions/branches and work areas. The surveys are undertaken by an independent organisation, which provides for benchmarking against similar services across the nation. The surveys cover a range of issues relating to staff management including responses to questions in relation to training and education, bullying and harassment, team dynamics, staff management and leadership. The 2012 survey had a response rate of 55%, with 3161 staff completing the survey. This is the highest response rate the organisation has achieved and is statistically significantly above average compared with similar organisations nationally. The overall culture has steadily improved and is above average compared with government public health care norms. The 'Employee Quality of Working Life' index (which is extracted from the general staff survey noted above) which considers a broad range of factors (including job satisfaction, workplace values, team norms, and management and leadership skills) has similarly shown significant improvements and places the Health Directorate 15% above government public health care norms. Training, reporting and perceptions of how bullying and harassment complaints are managed showed some of the biggest improvements. The detailed results and analysis of the 2012 Workplace Culture Survey are used to consider the priority areas of focus at both the organisation level and at division/branch/unit levels. Improving the workplace environment and responding to feedback from staff is a core responsibility of the ACT Government as an employer.Completed. A response is provided in the government's submission to the assembly. The response noted the work undertaken to assess organisational culture and systems in place to address issues raised from that assessment. 13. The Committee recommends that, given the Health Directorate's failure to protect the privacy of the Executive who admitted to altering data\u2014prior to any civil, criminal or administrative proceedings\u2014 the Health Directorate should: (i) issue a public apology to the individual concerned; and (ii) take appropriate steps to acknowledge the individual's contributions to the operation and administration of the Canberra Hospital.Noted. The naming of the Executive who admitted fault for altering emergency department data at Canberra Hospital was unfortunate. It was not the intention of the ACT Government Health Directorate, or the ACT Government to have this person's name revealed, although legal advice indicated that there was no reason to withhold the staff member's name. This Executive had a longstanding career in Health including working as a Clinical Nurse Consultant, a Director of Nursing of Canberra Hospital Emergency Department, before commencing as Executive Director, Critical Care Division. It is unfortunate that the hard work and commitment of this individual over a long period has been overshadowed by more recent events. The government's submission to the Public Accounts Committee noted the career of the person in question.210 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 14. The Committee recommends that the Commissioner for Public Administration, in consultation with ACT Government directorates and agencies, develop a whole-of-government policy for the management of private information relating to ACT Public Service employees and recipients of ACT Government services.Agreed. The Director-General has written to the Commissioner for Public Administration and is awaiting a response on this matter.The Commissioner for Public Administration is developing an approach in relation to this matter (The ACT Health Director-General wrote to the Commissioner in September 2013 noting this recommendation). 15. The Committee recommends that the Government of the day should inform the ACT Legislative Assembly, at the earliest possible opportunity, if the emergency access targets under the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, will not be reached by the Canberra Hospital for the 2012 calendar year.Agreed. Public Hospitals across the ACT have been working hard to improve the Territory's performance against the National Emergency Access Targets. The initial infrastructure required to increase emergency department and inpatient capacity will not be completed until 2013, and there have been delays in implementing new processes to improve patient flows. In the meantime, neither Canberra Hospital nor the ACT as a whole have reached the 64% target. (for the proportion of people with an emergency department length of stay of less than four hours) to achieve reward funding for the National Emergency Access Target in 2012. Current indications from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing are that the ACT is not alone in this result. The current Deputy Director-General, Canberra Hospital and Health Services is reviewing the projects underway in order to establish a clear and coordinated approach across the entire hospital to reduce the barriers which create delays and result in system blockages. In addition, the emergency department at Canberra Hospital has implemented some recent initiatives that will assist in improving performance in 2013, including: 'front loading'\u2014a concept that enables treatment spaces to be available during peak hours of the day where patients can be assessed and treated by an ED doctor more rapidly; The expansion of the Canberra Hospital Discharge Lounge. This enables patients to leave the inpatient wards earlier, freeing up inpatient beds and allowing for increased access from the emergency department; Establishing criteria led discharge to provide better access to inpatient beds by eliminating delays. The National Health Performance Authority released the 2011-12 MyHospitals report on 14 December 2012. The report showed that both Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital were performing at or above the national average against other peer hospitals in terms of NEAT performance.Completed. The assembly was informed that the ACT did not meet the 2012 NEAT target. 16. The Committee recommends that the 8th ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts should give due consideration to conducting an inquiry into the process of future delivery of health care services across the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.Noted. This is a matter for the Committee.This is a matter for the new Public Accounts Committee.Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 211 Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services Report No. Title Date presented Annual and Financial Reports 2011-2012 Completed 16 May 2013. Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 6. That the Minister for Health provide the Committee with a detailed update of each health infrastructure project currently underway or in planning by 30 June 2013.The Government response is still being developed as at 30 June 2013.The detailed update was provided directly to the committee. Select Committee on Estimates 2012-13 Report No. Title Date presented 1 Appropriation Bill 2012-2013 and Appropriation (Office of the Legislative Assembly) Bill 2012-2013Completed 14 August 2012. Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 28. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consult with Paramedics Australia regarding registration of paramedics as part of the National Health Practitioners Registration Scheme.Agreed. The Health Directorate and the ACT Ambulance Service has already consulted with Paramedics Australia in relation to registration options of paramedics and will continue to consult with them until a National decision is made.The ACT Paramedics Regulation Project Consultation Forum was held on 24 July 2012. Paramedics Australasia attended this forum and provided input. A copy of the Paramedics Australasia Role Descriptors for Paramedics in Australia and New Zealand was circulated to ACT paramedic stakeholders in February 2013. ACT Health is awaiting the final draft of the decision Regulatory Impact Statement to be provided for circulation and comment. From July 2012 to January 2013, national consultation was undertaken to consider the AHMAC consultation paper 'Options for regulation of paramedics'. Representatives from Council of Ambulance Authorities (CAA) member organisations attended consultation forums in each state and territory and a written submission was made by CAA. AHWMC requested advice from the HWPC on the proposal to include paramedics as a profession in the national scheme. The decision Regulatory Impact Statement is still being developed by the Practitioner Regulation Subcommittee (PRSC), on behalf of the HWPC, for ministers to consider whether regulatory change is required. 29. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government detail to the Legislative Assembly the scope and timetable for all the e-health initiatives.Agreed. The e-health program of work and schedule are currently being updated for the 2013-14 financial year. Following completion of this update, information for the 2013-14 financial year will be provided to the assembly.212 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 30. The Committee recommends ACT Health develop and report to the Legislative Assembly on the indicators it will use to measure the quality and the outcomes of care provided through the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department.Agreed. The Government will provide a report for Assembly consideration noting the outcomes of the current processes underway to develop the basis for outcome measures for emergency department care. This process includes liaison with state and territory health authorities and a range of national bodies (such as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the National Health Performance Authority). The report will note the work needed to fully develop, define, collect and report on any proposed measures. The Government will also take the results of this review to COAG for consideration in the establishment of new measures for Emergency Department care within the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services.The ACT is leading a process to establish new national emergency department outcome measures. The Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council has endorsed a proposal to establish a project in 2013- 14 to work with jurisdictions and relevant national bodies to develop options for AHMAC consideration in 2014. Some work has been undertaken by various bodies across Australia. This process will assist in consolidating efforts and providing a nationally consistent approach to ED outcome measurement. 31. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government engage with local midwife representatives to further develop an appropriate model for a stand-alone birth centre.Not agreed. The planned sub acute hospital on the north side of Canberra will not have an associated nor a standalone birth centre as there needs to be provision for escalation upward to an acute facility for the purpose of managing obstetric emergencies. The Canberra Hospital has a birth centre and Calvary Public Hospital will also be progressing a continuity of midwifery care model which will provide improved access to midwifery care.No further action require d. 32. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government continues to grow the proportion of health funding allocated to mental health services towards 12 per cent of the total ACT Budget.Agreed. The ACT Government is progressively increasing the percentage of health funding allocated to mental health services. This has included a minimum annual allocation of $1 million in mental health growth funding in each of the last eight budgets, as well as construction and running costs of a new Adult Mental Health Inpatient Unit and Mental Health Assessment Unit at the Canberra Hospital. The ACT Government through the ALP-Greens Parliamentary Agreement on Government has committed to $35 million for mental health over the term of the eighth Legislative Assembly. This will support additional adult and older persons and new adolescent mental health inpatient beds, a secure mental health unit, additional community mental health services in both the public and community sector, youth-specific mental health services and suicide prevention-specific funding. During the term of the eighth Legislative Assembly the full roll-out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme will come into effect in the ACT. This will affect services currently provided through the Health budget, such as non-clinical supported accommodation, outreach support and vocational training. There will be significant opportunity for more people with serious and enduring mental illness to access these within the insurance-based system. The current mental health funding for these services will need to move into the ACT NDIS funding pool and hence impact on the apparent percentage of health funding allocated to mental health. The Commonwealth has also directly funded outreach and centre-based mental health services in the ACT that otherwise (e.g. in New Zealand) would have been counted in the ACT mental health budget (Personal Helpers and Mentors, PhaMS, and Day-to-Day Living programs). Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 213 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 33. The Committee recommends that the ACT Minister for Health report to the Legislative Assembly on what level of in-patient services the ACT Government provides to adults suffering eating disorders, and where ACT residents go if they need a higher level of service.Agreed. Inpatient services are provided for adults suffering from eating disorders in the medical wards of both the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Hospital (to enable medical support for these clients). In terms of mental health care and support, clients are admitted to Ward 2N at Calvary Hospital. Other inpatient services are provided in the private sector in both the ACT and New South Wales. All services at these facilities are voluntary admissions. 34. The Committee recommends the ACT Government advise the Legislative Assembly which local drug and alcohol services will be reduced as a result of cuts in Commonwealth funding, and what strategies will be implemented to cope with the unmet client need caused by these reductions.Not agreed. This matter should be referred to the Commonwealth Government.No further action required. 35. The Committee recommends that all Alexander Maconochie Centre detainees with Hepatitis C have timely access to Hepatitis C treatment, if they have the gene and body weight that makes them treatable with this treatment.Agreed in principle. Justice Health Services currently treats 10 people for Hepatitis C infection at any time. As part of the treatment protocol, patients consent to serial testing for Hepatitis C virus. Admission to gain access to the treatment program includes an understanding of, and a commitment to, complete treatment; a reasonable body mass (as obesity is a predictor of poor treatment response); and the specific genotype of the person's virus (genotypes 2 and 3 have better treatment outcomes). Potential patients 'awaiting assessment for the treatment programs' and those 'awaiting admission to the treatment program' are monitored with liver function testing at periods between six and 12 months. If there is a change in severity of the secondary liver effects, then re-prioritisation occurs, in consultation with the gastroenterology clinic at the Canberra Hospital. This is consistent with community standards. 36. The Committee recommends that a needle and syringe program be trialled in the Alexander Maconochie Centre so as to prevent further spread of blood borne diseases.Agreed. On 15th August 2012, the Chief Minister released a draft blood borne virus management strategy for the Alexander Maconochie Centre which includes a proposal for detainees to be given regulated access to sterile injecting equipment on a 'one-for-one' exchange basis with the medical officer having responsibility for the equipment exchange. Consultation with industrial organisations on the proposed model for implementation will commence immediately to work through any concerns related to the model and to seek agreement with a view to the exchange being implemented in 2013.Consultation is ongoing.214 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 37. The Committee recommends the ACT Government take greater steps to target anti-smoking campaigns and programs to low income and vulnerable people.Agreed in principle. The Health Directorate will explore options within its current campaigns and programs to target low income and vulnerable people.On 31 May 2013 the Minister for Health launched Future Directions for Tobacco Reduction 2013-2016 . Future Directions informs the Canberra community of the 12 initiatives proposed by ACT Health in tobacco control. These initiatives aim to investigate restricting access to tobacco to reduce demand and control supply, and restrict places of tobacco use. The areas that will be looked at include outdoor areas at public swimming pools and children's playgrounds, among many others, where measures could be taken to reduce smoking and protect non-smokers from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. The ACT Government committed additional funding in the 2013-14 budget to enable continued implementation of the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tobacco Control Strategy, including delivery of the Beyond Today campaign. Beyond Today is a social marketing campaign developed by the Health Directorate to encourage the uptake of healthy lifestyle behaviours and smoking cessation among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the ACT. The development of this campaign has been in close collaboration with the policy division's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Unit and it is a key component of: the ACT Government Health Directorate's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tobacco Control Strategy 2010-11 to 2013-14 ; the ACT Implementation Plan for the COAG National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Outcomes ; and the ACT Government Health Directorate's Implementation Plan for the national Measure Up campaign under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. The campaign was launched in December 2012. ACT Health, through a service funding agreement, continued to provide funding to Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service for delivery of a multi-component smoking cessation and reduction program based on family, social and workplace networks. From 1 January 2012 there has been a smoke-free environment in the Division of Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services. This includes inpatient areas such as the Adult Mental Health Unit, the Alcohol and Drugs Withdrawal Unit, the Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre and the Mental Health Assessment Unit. The aim of implementing a smoke-free environment is to provide a healthy and safe environment for all employees, patients, visitors and contractors. The Healthy Communities Initiative is a targeted campaign focusing on better health for low socioeconomic communities, which includes encouraging smoke-free behaviours. Work is also being undertaken in capacity building for allied health staff, such as podiatrists, in short smoking interventions for their patients.Section B Consultation and scrutiny reporting 215 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 38. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government develop a men's health plan and appropriate associated literature to improve men's health in the ACT.Agreed in principle. The ACT Government is supporting men's health issues in line with a national men's health policy statement and specifically in the ACT across the suite of existing health strategies and plans, including: Towards a Healthier ACT 2010-15, ACT Chronic Diseases Strategy 2008-11 (under revision), ACT Corrections Health Plan 2008-12, Managing the Risk of Suicide 2009-14, and the ACT Primary Health Care Strategy 2011-14.The ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy has been updated for 2013-18. 39. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide the Legislative Assembly with a copy of the report on the review of Lymphoedema services as soon as it is available.Agreed. This report was commissioned by Calvary Health Care and related largely to the services provided at Calvary. The Territory is working with Calvary and the Medicare Local to determine ways to provide best practice services to consumers. The outcome of this work will be provided to the Minister and the report and recommendations will be provided to the Assembly.The report has been provided to the committee. The Health Directorate is preparing a response to this report, which will include recommendations for progressing the need to meet unmet lymphoedema demand. 40. The Committee recommends the ACT Government establish more timely administration processes for Home and Community Care growth and indexation funds.Agreed. 30 June 2012 marked the end of the national joint funding program for Health and Community Care. After that date, the ACT became responsible for services to Canberrans under 65 years of age (and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under 50 years). Administration processes in conjunction with these services will continue to be refined over the coming year.The full level of community CPI has been paid to NGOs funded under the ACT HACC Program, with effect from 1 July 2013. A new Schedule B of the NPA outlining cross-billing arrangements for 2012-13 was issued on 14 June 2013. The new schedule was endorsed by the Chief Minister on 19 June 2013. Due to the late advice regarding the quantum of growth funds available under the NPA, there was insufficient time to allocate funds via an open tender process and ensure the funds were allocated to community service providers before 30 June 2013. A decision was made to utilise unallocated ACT HACC growth funds for 2012-13 as one-off funding in 2013-14 to develop and implement a coordinated service response for patient discharge targeted at the under-65s. The amount of growth funds available for 2013-14 and the timing of any funding process are dependent on finalisation of the NPA. Negotiations between the states and territories and the Commonwealth will continue to develop a Schedule B to reflect funding movements with greater accuracy. Under the NPA, 2013-14 is the final year of cross-billing. 41. The Committee recommends that the ACT Government develop a long-term strategy for the provision of staff for geriatrician services in the ACT.Agreed. There is still a shortage of geriatricians in Australia such that it has been difficult to recruit sufficient specialist staff from other cities. Regular advertising of positions has continued, with a new ad pending in July 2013. Through training and mentoring, a career in geriatric medicine will be promoted to JMO staff and medical students. The Department of Geriatric Medicine has received a Best Clinical Unit for Teaching nomination from ANU Medical School for the past three years and on one occasion won the award. In 2013 we recruited three Advanced Trainees in Geriatric Medicine and have others interested for 2014. We are expecting that some will move to long-term specialist careers in the ACT.216 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Recommendation Government response Directorate implementation 42.

The Audit and Risk Management Committee plays an essential role by providing assurance to the Director-General on ACT Health's governance and oversight in relation to risk management, internal systems and legislative compliance. ACT Health's Audit and Risk Management Committee's ability to consider the internal control environment, governance and risk management activities objectively is facilitated by the mix of internal and external members, who are and supported by ACT Health's Manager, Internal Audit and Risk Management. ACT Health's Audit and Risk Management Committee consists of five members: an independent chair, three senior executives from within ACT Health and one external member. Observers from ACT Health and the ACT Auditor- General's Office also attend meetings. The Audit and Risk Management Committee held five meetings in 2012-13. The committee's attendances are set out below: Name of member Position Duration Meetings attended Geoff Knuckey Independent Chair 2 years 5 Ian Thompson Deputy Chair 6.5 years 5 Tina Bracher Member 2 months 1 Jeremy Chandler External member 6 months 2 Judi Childs Member 5.5 years 3 Stephen Goggs Member 10 months 4 Bruce Jones External member 6.5 years 3 The Internal Audit and Risk Management Branch of ACT Health promotes and improves ACT Health's corporate governance by conducting and coordinating internal audits, investigations and making recommendations for improvements. ACT Health's Strategic Internal Audit Program for the period from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2013 is designed to align with ACT Health's strategic priorities and risks. The program is reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to be effective. In 2012-13, 10 internal audit assignments were completed. Two special reviews were also commissioned in response to issues of concern identified during the year. Audit findings and recommendations are rated in line with ACT Health's Integrated Risk Management Guidelines. Throughout the year, the Manager, Internal Audit and Risk Management reported developments in implementing the Strategic Internal Audit program and implementation of audit recommendations to the Audit and Risk Management Committee. The Audit and Risk Management Committee is also kept informed on implementation of recommendations made by the ACT Auditor-General's Office, where these apply to ACT Health. In 2012-13, the ACT Health Risk Management Policy and Guidelines were reviewed in line with the International Standard for Risk Management AS/NZS ISO 31000. The revised documents clarify the governance arrangements and include clear responsibilities and measurable key performance indicators. An Executives' Risk Management workshop was also held in 2012-13 to review the directorate's organisational risks. ACT Health's Executive Director's Council is responsible for: monitoring timely, effective management of organisational level risks managing escalation of risks to organisational level. Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 223 C.2 Fraud prevention ACT Health Fraud Management Framework, Policy and Plan govern the fraud management and prevention work across ACT Health. Divisions of ACT Health regularly undertake fraud risk assessments together with integrated risk assessments. Mitigating controls are put in place to address identified fraud threats and risks. The Executive Directors are responsible for managing fraud risk in their respective divisions. The ACT Health Senior Executive Responsible for Business Integrity Risks is required to provide reports on fraud control activities to the Audit and Risk Management Committee at an agreed interval. Staff receive fraud control and prevention training during orientation and through an eLearning program. Managers are provided with further fraud control and prevention information and training during the manager's orientation program. This is supported by targeted information that is provided to alert staff to responsibilities and protocols intended to improve systems or to mitigate identified fraud threats and risks. There was one allegation of fraud made against an ACT Health employee during 2012-13. This allegation was investigated by the Commissioner for Public Administration. Following a preliminary investigation, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to progress to a formal investigation.224 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 C.3 Public interest disclosure Public interest disclosure is managed in ACT Health in accordance with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2012 . Procedures for actioning public interest disclosures are carried out according to the Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate guidelines. ACT Health's public interest disclosure policy and procedures are available to all staff and the community on the Health website. The Senior Executive Responsible for Business Integrity Risk receives disclosures and determines the appropriate action in accordance with the Act. Of the six disclosures unfinalised at the end of 2011-12: one was dismissed as the allegations lacked substance following the gathering of preliminary evidence one was subject to external review as part of an Auditor-General Performance Review, and recommendations from that review were translated into an action plan three were the subject of external investigation, with one revealing no evidence of misconduct, and the other two resulting in findings of misconduct and proposed disciplinary action one was discontinued following staff relocations and exits. Of the two matters where the external investigation found misconduct substantiated: one related to bullying and harassment, failure to exercise reasonable care and skill, and failure to abide by lawful directions the other related to failure to exercise reasonable care and skill and failure to abide by lawful directions. In each case the events described were restricted to the conduct of particular individuals and not considered to be a high risk of systematic recurrence. No disclosures relating to disclosable conduct were received by ACT Health in 2012-13.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 225 C.4 Freedom of information The ACT Freedom of Information Act 1989 gives citizens a legally enforceable right of access to official information in a documentary form held by ACT Ministers and agencies, except where an essential public interest requires confidentiality to be maintained.

This chart includes the names of the senior executives responsible for each of the organisation's output areas. Executives in the ACT Public Service are engaged under contract for periods not exceeding five years. Their remuneration is determined by the Australian Capital Territory Remuneration Tribunal. Senior executive and organisational changes ACT Health underwent an internal restructure during 2010-11. The purpose of this restructure was to improve the delivery of family- and patient-centred care, achieve good governance and accountability, and position the organisation to meet demand for services now and into the future. Prior to implementation of the restructure, extensive consultation occurred with staff and stakeholders. One of the commitments coming out of this consultation was that a number of factors and decisions would be reviewed one year after implementation. In 2012, ACT Health engaged the Nous Group to conduct an external review of ACT Health's 2011 restructure. Its purpose was to determine the effectiveness of the restructure and how well it was meeting its primary objectives. Following consideration of the considerable amount of feedback received during the six-week consultation process earlier in 2013, a detailed response to each of the recommendations in the final Nous report has been developed. The review acknowledged that the majority of staff have been supportive of many of the structural changes put in place over the last two years, but opportunities have been identified for further refinement. A total of 36 recommendations were made in the review report. These will be a focus for ACT Health in the next 12 to 18 months to ensure that the structure continues to be a strong basis for the delivery of our diverse health services. Consultation has been undertaken with relevant staff and unions to discuss the details of how changes can best be implemented. Senior executive ACT Health is organised into groups and operational areas which report directly to the Director-General. The two groups\u2014Canberra Hospital and Health Services, and Strategy and Corporate\u2014are led by the Deputy Directors-General and are divided into direct clinical service divisions and strategic and corporate support branches.

The council was established under amendments to the Health Act 1993 , passed by the Legislative Assembly on 29 March 2011. It is responsible for providing strategic advice to the Director-General of ACT Health on matters critical to the ACT Local Hospital Network's success. The council's specific functions are set out in section 14 of the Act. Each financial year the council is required to present to the Minister for Health a report on the state of the local hospital network and any recommendations relating to the improvement of health services by the local hospital network that the council considers necessary. Part 3A of the Act requires that the council consist of not more than 10 members, appointed by the Minister. The council must include members who bring the necessary skills and experience to allow the council to perform its functions under the Act and include members who have expertise or experience in several areas, including, but not limited to: health management experience; expertise in clinical matters; and academic, teaching and research experience in the field of health services and consumers. The Act requires the council to meet at least six times a year. ACT Health provides secretariat support to the council. Clinical Senate The role of the Senate is to provide a forum for a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, health experts and consumers with diverse perspectives to share their collective knowledge in discussing strategic clinical issues. The Clinical Senate makes recommendations and reports to the Director-General, ACT Health, and the Chair of ACT Medicare Local, who consider and respond formally and transparently to all recommendations. The membership of the Senate reflects the range of views that would be encountered across the full breadth of the community on significant clinical strategic issues. Members are appointed following due consideration of clinical skills and/or knowledge, capacity to make a contribution, clinical influence, consumer input and multidisciplinary coverage. The Senate comprises up to 40 members, the majority of whom are clinicians with direct clinical duties. In addition to ex-officio members, membership consists of specialist medical practitioners, junior medical practitioners, specialist dental practitioners, nursing and midwifery representatives, academic staff, allied health professionals and consumer representatives. Meetings are held three or four times a year. ACT Health provides secretariat support to the Senate. Corporate and operational plans (and associated reporting and review) Corporate Plan 2012-2017 The Corporate Plan 2012-2017 replaces the Corporate Plan 2010-2012. The plan articulates the key focus areas, priorities for improvement, key strategies for achieving the priorities, and achievements planned for the long term (five years). The priorities of ACT Health are organised under four key focus areas. Community and consumers\u2014Partnering for better health outcomes Deliver patient and family-centred care Continue and strengthen partnerships Promote good health and wellbeing Improve access to appropriate health care Have robust safety and quality systems236 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Our resources\u2014Building sustainability and improving efficiency Design sustainable services to deliver outcomes efficiently Strengthen decision support Embed a culture of research and innovation Our processes\u2014Strengthening governance Be accountable to government and the community Continue to strengthen clinical governance Our people\u2014Supporting and strengthening the teams Support our staff to reach their potential Promote a learning culture Provide high-level leadership In 2012-13, ACT Health continued to measure performance against these areas through key performance measures identified in the ACT Public Health Service's quarterly performance report, ACT Health's strategic and accountability indicator sets in the ACT Budget Papers and the Public Hospitals Scorecard. The target achievements for each year are contained in ACT Health's Business Plan. Clinical Services Plan There is recognition that the demand for health services is increasing every year. Expanding health technologies, greater consumer expectations and an increasing and ageing population all contribute to this demand for public health services. Following extensive consultation with our stakeholders towards the end of 2012, the Clinical Services Plan is now being finalised. The plan will provide strategic guidance for the development of publicly funded health services in the ACT. The strategies in the plan have been developed to position ACT Health to meet future demand for health services and improve access for those most in need. There are a number of specific health services plans which cascade and align strategic directions from the Clinical Services Plan to enable the delivery of an integrated service and offer a continuum of care to patients. The focus areas of the plan are to: meet increasing demand for health services improve the patient journey improve the health of vulnerable people build and nurture a sustainable health system ensure the planning and delivery of health services is underpinned by the ACT Health Safety and Quality Framework. ACT Primary Health Care Strategy 2011-2014 The Health Minister launched the ACT Primary Health Care Strategy 2011-2014 on 14 December 2011, building on the previous health care strategy and setting the direction for primary health care into the future. The strategy aims to improve integration between general practice and the wider primary health care sector in the provision of primary health care. The Primary Health and Chronic Disease Strategy Committee (PH&CDS) oversees implementation of the strategy. Six-monthly reports outlining progress against the annual implementation plan are provided to the ACT Health Executive Council and primary health care stakeholders. Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 237 Action areas where progress is being made include: improving access and reducing inequity improving continuity and coordination of care, especially for people with chronic conditions increasing the focus on health promotion, prevention, early intervention and consumer empowerment improving quality, safety, performance and accountability information management workforce infrastructure. Successful ongoing activities include: the General Practice Aged Day Service (GPADS), which provides access to GPs for patients who are homebound or in residential aged care facilities the nurse led Walk-in Centre, which successfully meets health care needs in the community while relieving pressure on the public hospital system the GP Marketing and Support Officer role, which aims to increase the number of GPs living and working in the Canberra region, via an online, print and in-person campaign. Implementation highlights include: provision of mini-health checks and follow-up reviews for the vulnerable or disadvantaged at the Early Morning Centre in central Canberra and at Ainslie Village provision of three full-time care coordinators to assist local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to manage the health system in relation to their chronic conditions establishment and promotion of the Get Healthy information and coaching service, which provides targeted messaging and a free personal health coach, and the ACT-wide Healthier Work Service, which supports employers to develop health and wellbeing initiatives in their workplaces provision of the Health Services Directory, which lists the majority of ACT Health's services as well as all ACT GP and pharmacy localities development and promotion of ACT Health policies and procedures to ensure better sharing of clinical information between and within the acute and primary health care sectors funding for the ACT Medicare Local to undertake the GP Workforce Scoping Study to provide jurisdictional information and mapping of the GP workforce across the ACT. ACT Chronic Disease Strategy The new ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy\u2014Improving Care and Support 2013-2018 ( www. health.act.gov.au/c/ health ?a=dlpubpoldoc&document=2825 ) will provide overarching direction for chronic condition care and support in the ACT over the next five years and outlines the requirement for a coordinated approach across the government and non-government sectors. It concentrates on improving care and support services and is based on the commitment goals that every person living with a chronic condition: receives appropriate screening and early detection receives the right care in the right place at the right time from the right team has a plan which supports active participation in their care is aware of relevant support options and how to access them is provided with information and support to stay healthy and/or minimise the risk of other diseases does not have to repeat their story unnecessarily.238 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The key priorities in the draft strategy are to: optimise existing services through enhanced integration improve access better support those in the community improve person-centredness enhance detection and secondary prevention enhance governance and system enablers. The Primary Health and Chronic Disease Steering Committee oversees implementation of the strategy and provides oversight and central coordination of related policies and initiatives. The committee is chaired by the Policy and Government Relations Branch and includes representation from relevant operational areas of ACT Health, the ACT Medicare Local, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia (ACT), the Health Care Consumers' Association of the ACT, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service, ANU Medical School, the Heart Foundation ACT, and Diabetes ACT, the University of Canberra, the Australian primary Health Care Research Institute and the Community Services Directorate. Six-monthly reports outlining progress against the annual implementation plan are provided to the ACT Health Executive Council and key stakeholders. ACT Palliative Care Services Plan The ACT Palliative Care Strategy 2007-2011 provided overarching direction for the delivery of palliative care services in the ACT in accordance with Palliative Care Australia's National Palliative Care Standards. From 2007 to 2011, the strategy made considerable progress in promoting coordinated palliative care services. In particular, achievements were made in: the availability of palliative care and bereavement information and education resources for community members increased liaison between palliative care services, residential aged care facilities and primary health care implementation of Australian Government-funded palliative care projects. The development of the new draft ACT Palliative Care Services Plan 2013-2017 included extensive community consultation and an examination of likely future demand for palliative care, existing workforce needs and future needs, community education, support for non-government organisations and identification of possible future models of care. As a result, the draft plan outlines a vision that 'people with a life-threatening illness in the ACT and their families and carers will have timely access to quality palliative care that is consumer and carer focused, respects their choices and is appropriate to their need'. It also outlines six key goals for the future development of ACT palliative care services, along with 16 associated strategies to achieve them. The six key goals are as follows: 1. ACT Health plays a leadership role in ensuring reliable access to quality palliative care in the ACT. 2. To ensure that palliative care services provide continuity of care and smooth transitions between settings. 3. The ACT community is well informed about all aspects of death and dying and individuals and families are able to make an informed choice about their treatment options. 4. To build capacity of palliative care services to meet the current and projected population demand. 5. To ensure an appropriately qualitative and sustainable workforce to provide the projected level of palliative care services in the ACT. 6. To develop the knowledge base to inform service and workforce development and quality improvement. The draft plan is aligned with the draft Clinical Services Plan and in particular suggests the establishment of a single ACT Palliative Care Clinical Network, a proposal which was well received during the public consultation of the plan. As this is a services plan, the document is long and contains technical language that may be a barrier to some consumers and time-poor clinicians. As a result, a one-page summary and a shortened version of the plan, which will be known as the ACT Palliative Care Services Plan 2013-2017, have been developed. The full technical paper will also be available. The ACT Palliative Care Services Plan Steering Committee oversaw the development of this services plan. This committee included representatives from ACT Health, the ACT Medicare Local, the Southern New South Wales Local Health District, Calvary Health Care, Palliative Care ACT and the Health Care Consumers' Association of the ACT. The plan is expected to be endorsed by the Minister in September 2013.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 239 HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, Sexually Transmissible Infections: A Strategic Framework for the ACT 2007-2012 The HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, Sexually Transmissible Infections\u2014A Strategic Framework for the ACT 2007-2012 (www. health.act.gov.au/c/health ?a=dlpubpoldoc&document=915 ) outlines a strategic approach to the management of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and sexually transmissible infections and provides a framework to guide cooperation between ACT Government and non-government organisations, private practitioners, researchers, service providers, community groups, affected communities and the broader ACT community. The ACT framework confirms ACT Health's commitment to guiding principles such as harm minimisation and health promotion, a partnership approach, an evidence-based approach, access and equity, social determinants of health, a population health approach and human rights. Progress has been made towards the ACT framework's goals of: reducing the transmission in the ACT of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) increasing access for ACT residents to testing and treatment for HIV, HCV and STIs improving the health and wellbeing of ACT residents living with HIV/AIDS and HCV and reducing the morbidity associated with undiagnosed and untreated STIs. The ACT Ministerial Advisory Council on Sexual Health, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases (SHAHRD) advises on the implementation of the ACT framework. It was agreed that the ACT framework be extended beyond 2012 to correspond with the development of the National Strategies for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Sexually Transmissible Infections and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Blood-Borne Virus and Sexually Transmissible Infections. The national strategies will be under development in 2013 for an estimated launch in July 2014. The new ACT framework will align with these strategies. ACT Children's Plan The ACT Children's Plan was launched in June 2010 to provide an aspirational whole-of-government and whole-of- community vision to make Canberra a great and safe place for children and to ensure their needs are a priority for the government and community. The ACT Children's Plan is operational from 2010 to 2014. The aim of the ACT Children's Plan is that Canberra is a child- and youth-friendly city that supports all children and young people to reach their potential, make a contribution and share the benefits of our community. The plan proposes six building blocks to make Canberra a child-friendly city: opportunities for children to influence decisions about their lives and their community and to actively participate in their communities advocacy, promotion and protection of children's rights processes to assess the impact of law, policy and practice on children regular monitoring of the state of children's health, wellbeing, learning and development services, programs and environments that support children's optimal development and enhance parental, family and community capacity effective governance mechanisms across government and community. Strategies, actions and projects fully implemented at the end of June 2012 A Picture of ACT's Children and Young People 2012 (www.children.act.gov.au ) was released. Major goals and projects commenced in 2012-13 ACT Health contributed to the development of the 2013 A Picture of ACT Children and Young People , which will be the third report on children's health, wellbeing, development and learning indicators. Drafting commenced for a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on Neglect of Medical Needs of Children and Young People to improve ACT Health's capacity to meet the needs of vulnerable children and their families. The ACT Health Child Protection Policy was reviewed and a Child Protection Practice Paper and SOP were drafted .240 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 The ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 is a strategic-level document giving broad direction for the future development of public mental health services in the ACT. It was developed in consultation with stakeholders over a two-year period. The plan covers the years 2009 to 2014 but conveys a vision for how mental health services will be delivered in the ACT in 20 years' time. The guiding vision for mental health services in the ACT is that by 2020 the mental health needs of the community will be met by a comprehensive network of complementary and integrated mental health services that: enhance knowledge and understanding intervene and provide support early and for as long as is necessary as far as possible, address mental health issues in community settings, working with and developing natural systems of support. The ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 states that consumer and carer participation will be richly woven through all aspects of service planning, delivery, research, teaching and evaluation, while peer support and advocacy services will be available as required to support consumers in their journey of recovery. The plan aligns services with four developmental stages that, rather than promoting service delivery along age lines alone, will focus on developmental and life milestones to determine the most appropriate point of service. Strategic directions The plan sets goals for change and improvements in the mental health sector. Timelines for implementation have been indicated throughout the five-year life of the plan. Oversight of the implementation process was allocated to the Strategic Oversight Group (SOG). Co-chaired by a consumer representative and an ACT Health representative, the SOG includes consumer, carer, community and primary care representatives, with participation from ACT and Australian Government agencies. The SOG reports annually on implementation of the ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014. In 2012-13, the ACT Government, in partnership with the community sector, consumers and carers, continued to work towards the guiding vision of the ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 by focusing on the four priorities outlined in it: 1. reinforcing capacity in the mental health sector 2. extending the mental health service system 3. innovating in the mental health service system 4. planning implementation of change. Building a Strong Foundation: A Framework for Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing in the ACT 2009-2014 Building a Strong Foundation: A Framework for Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing in the ACT 2009-2014 aims to guide the implementation and development of activities to promote mental health and wellbeing, prevent mental illness and, where this is not possible, intervene early to detect and treat mental disorders. The framework has three priorities: 1. Promoting mental health and wellbeing is everybody's business. 2. Preventing mental illness is a shared responsibility. 3. Early intervention requires strong inter-sectoral cooperation. Oversight of the process is undertaken by the Mental Health Promotion, Prevention and Early Intervention Implementation and Evaluation Working Group, which includes consumer, carer, community, education, primary care and directorate representation.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 241 The evaluation report, Building a Strong Foundation: Evaluation Findings 2010-2011 , was finalised in 2013 and summarises the implementation findings from the second-year evaluation of the framework. Evaluation reports are available on the ACT Health website at www. health.act.gov.au/health-services/mental-health-justice-health- alcohol-drug-services/mental-health-policy/suicide-prevention/implementation -and-evaluation . Highlights include: Twenty-four agencies reported that they had successfully embedded activities to promote mental health and wellbeing into their strategic plans and strategies. A review of international and national social marketing campaigns was completed in order to better inform future ACT integrated physical and mental health and wellbeing campaigns. A total of 5,500 people were successfully trained in workplace mental health literacy. The Alexander Maconochie Centre introduced extended visiting hours for families and set aside two private units in the Visitors' Centre for family visits. This is to encourage detainees to maintain and strengthen their family relationships while incarcerated. Managing the Risk of Suicide: A Suicide Prevention Strategy for the ACT 2009-2014 Managing the Risk of Suicide: A Suicide Prevention Strategy for the ACT 2009-2014 provides a service development framework to guide an integrated, whole-of-community approach to suicide prevention across the lifespan. The strategy's main strategic directions are to: reduce rates of suicide and self-harm in the ACT increase resilience, coping skills and connectedness improve awareness of and access to suicide prevention training, education and information increase collaboration and partnerships between organisations providing suicide prevention and postvention services in the ACT. The evaluation report, Managing the Risk of Suicide: Evaluation Findings 2010-2011 , was finalised in 2013. This report summarises the implementation findings from the second-year evaluation of the strategy. Evaluation reports are available on the ACT Health website at www. health.act.gov.au/health-services/mental-health-justice- health-alcohol-drug-services/mental-health-policy/suicide-prevention/implementation -and-evaluation . ACT Health, in conjunction with the Centre for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University, is leading the way internationally in evaluating the outcomes of implementation and identifying the factors that affect implementation of both Building a Strong Foundation: A Framework for Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing in the ACT 2009-2014 and Managing the Risk of Suicide: A Suicide Prevention Strategy for the ACT 2009-2014 . Outcome and process evaluation data, collected from agencies identified as having responsibility for implementing actions, is collated and the findings from the surveys used to compile an annual report to the Legislative Assembly. National Partnership Agreement Supporting National Mental Health Reform The Council of Australian Governments signed a National Partnership Agreement Supporting National Mental Health Reform in 2012. This agreement provides $200 million in Commonwealth funding, alongside investments by the states and territories, to improve outcomes for people with severe and persistent mental illness. The two ACT projects being funded under the agreement are: 1. The Adult Mental Health Step-up, Step-down Outreach Support. Woden Community Services has been engaged to provide short-term early intervention to avoid acute hospital admission, and post-discharge follow- up support. Funding under the agreement allows for support for up to an additional 60 consumers per annum. 2. Supported Accommodation Outreach targeting people with serious mental illness and recent experience of involuntary institutional care. St Vincent de Paul has been engaged to provide supported accommodation and outreach for an additional 18 people annually who have serious mental illness and a history of involuntary institutional care.242 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Roadmap for National Mental Health Reform 2012-2022 The Council of Australian Governments endorsed the Roadmap for National Mental Health Reform 2012-2022 in December 2012 . The roadmap recommits the Australian Government and states and territories to whole-of-government and whole-of-lifespan approaches to mental health reform and to maintaining mental health as an ongoing national priority. A key commitment of the roadmap is the development of the successor to the Fourth National Mental Health Plan. The ACT Government is a member of the working group charged with this responsibility. Fourth National Mental Health Plan The Fourth National Mental Health Plan: An Agenda for Collaborative Government Action in Mental Health 2009-2014 demonstrates a commitment to ongoing national mental health reform and identifies key actions to advance the vision of the National Mental Health Policy 2008. While led by health ministers, the plan takes a whole-of-government approach by involving sectors other than health. It provides a basis for governments to advance mental health activities in the various portfolio areas in a more integrated way, recognising that many sectors can contribute to better outcomes for people living with mental illness. Two significant elements of the Fourth National Mental Health Plan have been progressed in 2012-13: the development of the National Mental Health Services Planning Framework and the National Mental Health Recovery Framework. When finalised, these two frameworks will appreciably contribute to the culture and provision of mental health services into the future. A New Way\u2014Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Wellbeing Plan 2006-2011 The ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Family Wellbeing Plan 2006-2011 was developed in response to the requirement of the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NSFATSIH) for each jurisdiction to develop a local implementation plan. A review of the plan was undertaken in 2012-13 by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Forum, which includes membership from ACT Health, the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and ACT Medicare Local. In this process, many factors were identified as affecting its implementation, most significantly the Closing the Gap Indigenous reform agenda, which was introduced halfway through implementation of the plan in 2008. Development of a new ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan commenced in 2013. The plan will incorporate learning from the review of the previous plan and outstanding action items which have been identified as ongoing strategies requiring implementation by the Health Forum. The new plan will also be informed by the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes and will seek to form linkages with the other national health-related plans developed in 2013: National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social and Emotional Wellbeing Plan National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Strategy National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Blood-Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmissible Infections Strategy National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Drug Strategy. The new health plan aims to promote a holistic approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health planning for the ACT and surrounding community. Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 243 Health Workforce Plan 2013-18 The ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 was released in 2012-13, aligning with national health workforce reform, including the Health Workforce Australia (HWA) National Health Workforce Innovation and Reform Strategic Framework for Action 2011-2015 . The principles that underpin the plan include workforce initiatives driven by consumer needs and cost-effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. The plan provides a framework for actions by providing medium-term sustainable workforce planning strategies and associated actions which support the continued delivery of high-quality health services to the ACT region in an environment of increasing workforce challenges. The focus areas of the plan are strongly linked to ACT Health strategies and service plans which support more specific local needs. The plan seeks to address health workforce issues through the use of five areas focus areas: 1. health workforce reform: improving service delivery 2. health workforce capacity: skills development 3. leadership and culture improvement for health system sustainability 4. health workforce planning 5. policy, funding and regulation. The plan provides strategies under each focus area which provide direction, actions, accountabilities and measures of success which are able to be applied for operational workforce planning in all areas of ACT Health. ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework 2010-2015 The ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework 2010-20 15 (www.health.act.gov.au/c/health ?a=dlpubpoldoc& document=2777 ) sets the context for the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding in the ACT. The framework is consistent with, and supports the implementation of, the action areas in the Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy 2010-2015 . While ACT Health is the lead agency to guide implementation, there is a whole- of-ACT Government commitment to this project, including the identification of strategies to support breastfeeding- friendly workplaces (BFW) across ACT Government directorates. Significant achievements in 2012-13 include breastfeeding-friendly workplace accreditation for three directorates, including ACT Health, with others considering accreditation. An inclusive DVD for young parents was produced in 2012 as a collaborative initiative between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Unit, Gugan Gulwan Aboriginal Youth Corporation, Canberra College Cares and young parents in the ACT. There has been substantial support for health professional education, including support for candidates sitting for the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLCE). There has also been considerable collaboration with non-government organisations, including the Australian Breastfeeding Association. Both public hospitals in the ACT are Baby-Friendly Health Initiative (BFHI) accredited. All breastfeeding resources developed are web compatible and most resources utilise 'apps' to be user-friendly for a young target audience. Enhanced breastfeeding data has been collected since July 2011, with capability to report against the nationally agreed indicators: 'exclusive', 'predominant' and 'any' breastfeeding. A dedicated project officer oversaw implementation of the framework in 2012-13, guided by a multidisciplinary Breastfeeding Initiative Steering Committee. ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Strategy 2010-2014 Actions from the ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Strategy 2010-2014 progressed in 2012-13 included: smoking reduction and cessation programs for target populations: - The Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Association ACT (ATODA) received funding in the 2012-13 ACT Health Promotion Grants Program Community Funding Round to conduct the Under 10% project. The project aims to support the ACT to be the first jurisdiction in Australia with a smoking prevalence under 10 per cent by providing targeted tobacco management and support to community services workers and clients with high smoking rates who experience disadvantage.244 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 - ACT Health, in collaboration with a small reference group, developed a Brief Intervention Smoking Cessation E-learning Package, which has been available to ACT Health staff online since December 2012. - ACT Health's 'Beyond Today ... it's up to you' social marketing campaign to promote tobacco cessation and healthy lifestyle behaviours among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities of the ACT and surrounding regions was launched in December 2012. drug treatment for people experiencing withdrawal, including those continuing on opioid maintenance treatment programs or choosing to cease opioid maintenance treatment: - ATODA developed a discussion paper on expanding access to all ACT alcohol, tobacco and other drug residential treatment for people receiving opioid maintenance therapy and engaged with key people nationally working in this area, including We Help Ourselves (WHOS), an interstate provider of residential treatment for people receiving opioid maintenance therapy. - Karralika Programs Inc. received three years of federal government funding to plan, implement and evaluate a pilot program admitting people on opioid maintenance therapy to its residential rehabilitation program. Implementation began in mid-2013. peer-based models of service delivery, support advocacy and community development: - The Canberra Alliance for Harm Minimisation and Advocacy (CAHMA), in collaboration with ATODA and ACT Health, developed and implemented Australia's first overdose management program, which provides naloxone on prescription to potential overdose victims. The program is being evaluated by Professor Paul Dietze (Burnet Institute), Professor Simon Lenton (National Drug Research Institute), Dr Anna Olsen (Kirby Institute, UNSW) and Mr David McDonald (Social Research and Evaluation and Consultant to ATODA). drug diversion programs: - An external evaluation of ACT police and court drug diversion programs was undertaken. The evaluation was conducted by the Drug Policy Modelling Program, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre and University of New South Wales and was completed in February 2013. Sustainability Strategy ACT Health continues to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of sustainability by monitoring its use of resources and integrating economic, social and environmental considerations into implementing measures to minimise the impact of agency activities on the environment. In 2012-13, it: continued to embed the ACT Health Sustainability Strategy into governance processes implemented the first phase of the Sustainability Action Plan by incorporating sustainability actions into key focus areas of ACT Health business activity. All actions have been classified as short-, medium- and long-term. Of the short-term actions (1-3 years), 93 per cent have now been completed. This equates to 59 actions. developed and endorsed Sustainability\u2014Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Building and Infrastructure Projects, a document designed to guide and inform all future development of healthcare facilities, including sustainability checklists for master planning, building design, the construction phase and the operational stage implemented additional bicycle storage for visitors and staff on the Canberra Hospital campus used a restricted OfficeMax stationery catalogue to ensure cost minimisation, maximising value for money and embedding the principles of purchasing sustainable products conducted community consultation forums on future energy options for the Canberra Hospital campus as part of a feasibility study to best meet the sustainability goal of minimising CO2 emissions associated with future infrastructure growth became a member of the Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance Environmentally Sustainable Design Subcommittee, a forum whose mission is to share best practice between jurisdictions, pool resources to deliver infrastructure projects, leverage existing state-based projects at a national level and implement a common and unified understanding of sustainability in health care. Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 245 Quality and Safety Framework 2010-2015 The Quality and Safety Framework 2010-2015 describes a vision and direction to improve safety and quality in ACT Health and sets out the key activities that will happen throughout the organisation to improve the safety and quality of services provided to consumers. The plan includes a set of actions divided into three themes, which align with those of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care in its framework for a vision for safe and high-quality health care for Australia. These themes are that care will be: consumer-centred driven by information organised for safety. To meet these themes, the Quality and Safety Unit has achieved the following: partnered with the Health Care Consumers' Association ACT to provide forums on 'how to complain properly', consumer representative training and advocacy training supported ACT Health through the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) Organisation-Wide Survey to retain its accreditation status. ACT Health met all criteria to achieve accreditation for another four years, with 28 marked achievements, 18 extensive achievements and one outstanding achievement implemented and evaluated training in bedside handover as part of the Effective Communication in Clinical Handover (ECCHO) project, a national Australian Research Council funding project in collaboration with the University of Technology Sydney and three other jurisdictions. Training is now being piloted in another ward. The project team presented at the International Council of Nurses Conference in May 2012 supported the establishment of the 10 National Safety and Quality in Health Services Standards Groups to provide strategic direction for the implementation of these standards and monitor progress on key activities developed clear policy documents on important safety and quality issues such as: - consent and treatment policy and standard operating procedures - responding to the use of non-prescription alcohol and other drugs in health settings - open disclosure - work health and safety, and the safety management system - dangerous substance management held Open Disclosure Master Classes for senior clinical and executive staff. These classes provide targeted skills to support staff when open disclosure discussions with patients and families are required supported and monitored the quality of policy documents through the Policy Advisory Committee and staff training sessions on policy governance and policy writing provided education and training to staff on implementing the 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (NSQHSS) facilitated the ACT Quality in Healthcare Awards, which showcase patient safety and quality initiatives across the territory and the ACT Health Better Practice Awards, which celebrate local quality improvement activities developed an ACT Health Quality Improvement and National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (NSQHSS) education strategy to improve understanding of change management and quality improvement methodology to support improvements in quality and safety practices worked to update the Safety and Quality Framework to include the new National Safety and Quality in Health Services Standards. A consultation draft will be issued in early 2013-14 appointed a Patient Experience Leader completed a project on behalf of the Local Hospital Network (LHN) Council to collect patient stories relating particularly to bedside handover and discharge planning to allow the LHN Council to make recommendations for improvements developed a toolkit to support chairs and secretariats of committees who have consumer representatives on the committees made a successful budget bid to allow increased resourcing for the Respecting Patient Choices program to increase community awareness and uptake of advance care plans246 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 held an annual Thank You celebration for consumer representatives on ACT Health committees held regular liaison meetings with the Human Rights Commission to discuss processes and training opportunities for staff completed the divisional progress report, providing weekly updates of consumer feedback and status arranged guest presentations at Medicare Local Aged Care Forums and the Council on the Ageing ACT rolled out education and training on the National Recommendations for User-Applied Labelling of Injectable Medications, Fluids and Lines completed a training strategy to further support the implementation of open disclosure in ACT Health ACT Health coordinated and monitored preparations for the November 2012 Australian Council on Health Standards organisation-wide survey developed and implemented Canberra Hospital and Health Services-wide clinical audits that align with the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards revised ACT Health incident management policy and associated standard operating procedures (SOP), including the Incident Management SOP, Significant Incident SOP and Open Disclosure SOP completed the first ACT Audit of Surgical Mortality Annual Report. The framework is being reviewed for progress against the areas for action and alignment with the 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards. General Practice and Acute Sector Interaction Surveys Several new services, communication strategies and process refinements have been put in place to improve the interaction between general practice and ACT Health, following two GP and acute sector interaction surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010. The combined report made 25 recommendations, which have now been implemented or are ongoing. Improvements have been wide-ranging and have included: expansion of the ACT Health GP website to include common external resources, integration with outpatient and surgical waiting times and referral guidelines for outpatient services across ACT Health establishment of an e-referral system, which allows clinician-to-clinician communication improvements to the quality and timeliness of discharge summaries, including education, clinical support and discharge summary awards development, endorsement and promotion to all staff of policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure better access and sharing of clinical information between and within the acute and primary health care sectors improved communication and referral practices facilitated by interaction between the General Practice Liaison Unit, ehealth staff and general practices. Formal communication channels between general practice and ACT Health continue to operate through the ACT Health and ACT Medicare Local quarterly meetings, GP Liaison Network quarterly meetings and the ACT GP Workforce Working Group.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 247 C.6 Human resource performance In 2012-13, the People Strategy and Services Branch in ACT Health focused on embedding the new branch structure to better support service delivery and planning for the future workforce. The branch has worked hard to implement continuous improvement and quality activities, including a major review of all policies and procedures and refinement of business processes in support of efficient and effective service delivery. Key strategies for the branch are to improve employee engagement and performance through effective performance management and development; to improve the quality of management, leadership and organisational culture; and to implement specific strategies for the creation of new and innovative employment strategies. Key achievements and major activities in 2012-13 are listed below. The completion of the ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 was a significant milestone for People Strategy and Services (PSS) in the reporting year. In conjunction with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018, it establishes a strategic framework for innovation and reform in the workforce. Health Workforce Australia (HWA) released the Health Workforce 2025 series of reports, which clearly forecast the emerging workforce shortages in the domains of nursing and midwifery, medicine and allied health disciplines. These important reports make a substantial contribution to the evidence base driving significant national workforce reforms across the health sector. ACT Health strategies are described in more detail in Section A.9 of this report, under 'Health workforce'. The staff in the branch have worked with colleagues in Health Service Planning to improve the effectiveness of workforce planning in tandem with support service planning and infrastructure development. The ACT Health Leadership Network continued to create opportunities to build collaborative relationships and partnerships across the directorate. The group met three times during the year, with speakers and presentations encouraging participants to develop their leadership skills, with a particular focus on change and resilience, ethics and self-awareness. HWA initiatives and projects to support the development of the future workforce are centrally coordinated by an HWA-funded team embedded within PSS. Within this team are the ACT Region Integrated Clinical Training Network (ICTN) coordinator and secretariat and the Simulated Learning Environment (SLE) project staff. Major achievements in 2012-13 include: - establishment of the ACT Region ICTN website - development of the web-based SLE lending library - commissioning of six two-bedroom units for the use of interstate students on clinical training placements, and - increasing clinical training placements across the region. In 2013, negotiations commenced on a number of replacement enterprise agreements covering all staff employed by ACT Health. Additionally, the renegotiation of the Visiting Medical Officer core conditions was undertaken. Significant investment in and commitment to the Respect, Equity and Diversity (RED) framework continued during 2012-13, with the RED contact officer network expanding to 90 officers and training now having been delivered to approximately 75 per cent of staff in the organisation. The RED contact officer network provides an important support to staff members who may be experiencing bullying and harassment, including the provision of information about potential next steps to address the behaviour. The results of the Australian Council on Health Standards Accreditation survey held in November 2012 were a gratifying affirmation that human resource practice within ACT Health is on track. It was awarded four Extensive Achievements and one Marked Achievement for the five human resource criteria in the standards. The Executive team of PSS was awarded an ACT Health Australia Day Award in recognition of this outcome.248 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 The Employment Inclusion Officer has developed a number of employment activities to facilitate the achievement of the ACTPS Employment Strategies. This officer also coordinates ACT Health's participation in the ACT Government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traineeship Program and has developed a Traineeship Program for People with a Disability. To date, four Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traineeships and seven traineeships for people with a disability have been enabled. New programs are planned for implementation in the coming year, along with an expansion of the current programs. - The development and successful pilot of the People Manager Program was another highlight. This program focuses on developing and supporting front-line managers in a range of skill areas. The program will now be rolled out more extensively in the new financial year. - The continued commitment to ongoing development and enhancement of the workforce through a comprehensive and rigorous learning and development strategy delivered significant rewards in terms of qualifications and traineeships, as described in section C.8, Learning and developmen t.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 249 C.7 Staffing profile Full-time equivalents (FTE) and headcount Female Male Total FTE by 4,272.71 1,476.36 5,749.07 Headcount by 6,540.00 % of workforce (headcount) 76% 24% Classifications Classification group Female Male Total Administrative Officers 771 169 940 Dental 13 4 17 Executive Officers 14 8 22 General Service Officers and equivalent 199 273 472 Health Assistants 58 6 64 Health Professional Officers 781 234 1,015 Information Technology Officers 0 2 2 Legal Officers 0 1 1 Medical Officers 383 431 814 Nursing Staff 2,357 269 2,626 Professional Officers 7 5 12 Senior Officers 249 124 373 Teacher 1 0 1 Technical Officers 127 50 177 Trainees and apprentices 2 2 4 TOTAL 4,962 1,578 6,540 Employment category by gender Employment category Female Male Total Casual 280 96 376 Permanent full-time 2,322 887 3,209 Permanent part-time 199 35 234 TOTAL 4,962 1,578 6,540250 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Average length of service by age group by gender Average length of servicePre-Baby Boomers Baby Boomers Generation X Generation Y Total F M F M F M F M F M 0-2 4 2 177 43 427 191 745 313 1,353 549 2-4 2 3 179 40 305 121 377 106 863 270 4-6 3 2 175 61 249 98 214 43 641 204 6-8 5 0 140 41 215 65 93 17 453 123 8-10 5 2 148 41 160 61 48 9 361 113 10-12 2 1 152 38 124 32 21 3 299 74 12-14 1 1 95 27 78 18 8 0 182 46 14+ years 5 5 577 139 227 55 1 0 810 199 Generation Birth years covered Generation Birth years covered Pre-Baby Boomers prior to 1946 Generation X 1965 to 1979 inclusive Baby Boomers 1946 to 1964 inclusive Generation Y from 1980 and onwards Total average length of service by gender Gender Average length of service Female 7.4 Male 6.2 Total 7.1 Age profile Age group Female Male Total <20 32 12 44 20-24 325 113 438 25-29 686 219 905 30-34 635 214 849 35-39 574 226 800 40-44 640 213 853 45-49 567 50-54 674 155 829 55-59 480 144 624 60-64 270 345 65-69 67 28 95 70+ 12 9 21Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 251 Agency profile Branch/division FTE Headcount Canberra Hospital and Health Services 4,626.53 5,326 Director-General Reports 300.62 320 Special Purpose Account 13.56 17 Strategy and Corporate 808.36 877 Total 5,750.07 6,540 Agency profile by employment type Branch/division Permanent Temporary Casual Canberra Hospital and Health Services 3,904 1,096 326 Director-General Reports 283 35 2 Special Purpose Account 5 9 3 Strategy and Corporate 665 167 45 Total 4,857 1,307 376 Equity and workplace diversity Category A Category B Category C Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander Culturally and linguistically diverse People with a disabilityEmployees who identify in category A, B or C* Women Headcount 65 1,446 126 1,609 24.60% 75.87% *NB: Employees who identify in more than one equity and diversity category are counted only once.

This includes the ACT Health Learning Development Framework and reporting and associated policies, which support a learning culture to enhance staff capabilities, competency and legislative compliance. The Education Activity Register monitors executive approval for programs, annual evaluation and revision. A comprehensive calendar of learning opportunities is provided to staff on the intranet and the learning management system and annual data demonstrates a high degree of uptake of education and training. In 2012-13 achievements included: Australian Council on Health Care Standards (ACHS) 2012 accreditation rating of EA (Extensive Achievement) for learning and development revision and implementation of the ACT Health Learning and Development Framework and assessment tool based on learning organisation principles significant revision of the essential education policy (mandatory training) and procedures. This policy also enunciates requirements for students, volunteers and contractors an extensive evaluation and revision of clinical programs to comply with the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards and an increase in competency-based training to comply with the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, including revision or development of education and piloting of new assessment tools\u2014for example, in life support programs and in aseptic technique. ACT Health is committed to ensuring the quality of its education and training. This includes: auditing of the Education Activity Register, which monitors programs on the ACT Health learning management system to ensure they are reviewed, updated annually, linked to evidence-based practice and approved by an executive director. In 2012-13, 153 programs were listed on the Education Activity Register maintaining compliance with the Standards for NVR Registered Training Organisations 2011, with two nationally recognised programs offered in 2012-13 evaluating learning and development programs\u2014assessing outcomes and reporting to stakeholder groups providing professional development and networking for staff across the organisation engaged in work-based training and education initiatives, student clinical supervision, graduate support, and competency assessment to support the provision of safe, quality health care, as shown in the table below. Program Enrolments and attendees 2012 -2013 TAE40110 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment72 enrolments from nursing, midwifery, allied health, technical and administrative roles Clinical support and supervision essentials 67 attendees (54 nursing and 13 allied health staff) Trainers and Educators network 158 attendees over 5 meetings Leadership and culture programs The ACT Health Leadership Network is composed of around 100 employees identified by the Health Executive as leaders and potential leaders who could most benefit from the network and contribute to its objectives. The three workshops held during the 2012 calendar year had leadership themes of identifying and focusing on strengths, positive organisational stories, ethical decision making, collaboration/teamwork and courageous leadership. Inspiring and informative guest speakers included Michael Milton (Paralympian), John Hill (St James Ethics Centre), Rechelle Hawkes (former Hockeyroos captain), Andrew Kefford (Deputy Director-General, Workforce Capability and Governance Division & Commissioner for Public Administration, ACT Public Service), and Margie Warrell (CEO, Global Courage Institute), with Health executive and staff also contributing strongly. Participants were encouraged to develop their individual and group thinking on these topics as well as to continue forming constructive partnerships with each other and across the organisation.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 253 The People Manager Program, developed and commenced in 2012-13, aims to develop knowledge and skills in people management, underpinned by Health's values. The PMP is for clinicians and non-clinicians in frontline supervisor and middle management positions who have people management responsibilities. It has received excellent evaluations from participants, who have appreciated the Health-focused examples and contexts used. The Critical Care Leadership Program is an inter-professional leadership program attended by Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Department clinical staff from the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Hospital. In 2012-13, two programs were attended by 50 staff. The Clinical Leadership and Communication Skills Development Program targets participants from graduate programs, nursing night duty, clinical development nurses and midwives, and upcoming nursing team leaders. The program was developed in response to evaluation and needs analysis of these groups. A total of 293 staff attended these sessions, which received positive evaluations. Managing and preventing bullying, harassment and discrimination training is available to all managers and all staff. More than 4,600 staff in the ACT Health workfoce have been trained since the program begun in 2011. All-staff workshops Managers' seminar Total number of staff trained in 2012-13 1,385 101 1,486 The number of Respect Equity and Diversity (RED) contact officers at 30 June 2013 was 90. RED contact officers include nurses, allied health professionals, administrative staff and staff who work outside traditional business hours. ACT Health's combined efforts on RED training, policy development, case management and other initiatives resulted in it being shortlisted for an ACTPS Award for Excellence in the Respect category. Recruitment and transition to practice programs ACT Health implements highly successful programs to transition new nurses from student life to practice, including a Graduate Registered Nurse program, Enrolled Nurse program, and Allied Health Graduate Program. The programs provide a high level of clinical and professional support, care, feedback and guidance during the transition year. The evaluations demonstrated that the programs met participants' expectations and those of the clinical areas. Participants' comments in evaluations included the following: 'Learning a lot about nursing in a practical capacity and becoming responsible for my own learning and my own actions. I also feel that I have made a positive contribution to other people's lives, and it is nice to know that my career can do this for people'. 'being able to work as a nurse, learning nursing skill from all different areas of the hospital and experiencing different types of nursing such as ward and clinic'. 'Gaining so many valuable skills whilst being supported'.

New junior medical staff undertake COMPASS in the annual January medical orientation for junior doctors. A new family-activated escalation program, Call and Respond Early (CARE) for patient safety, has been developed. This training included a 1.5-hour in-service for ward nursing staff, and an eight-hour CARE skills day was developed and delivered in conjunction with Organisational Development for CARE responders and senior ward nurses. There were 50 CARE in-services for 458 participants and five CARE skills days for 51 participants. The Neonatal Early Warning Score (NEWS) pilot training has commenced for staff in the maternity unit. This training, developed by the NEWS project team, was led and delivered by neonatal and maternity clinical support nurses and clinical development nurses. To date there have been seven two-hour sessions for 48 participants.256 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Clinical programs ACT Health provides a large number of clinical education programs. Some key programs are described below. Night Duty Program Night Duty Program is offered once or twice a month for 11 months of the year for nursing staff working night duty. The program includes professional issues, clinical education, invited guest speakers and competency assessment for clinical education. The Night Duty Program was conducted on 30 occasions during the year, with 962 staff attending. Introduction to Perioperative Nursing Program The Introduction to Perioperative Nursing Program was first developed to attract and retain nurses in response to staffing shortages in the Perioperative Unit. In February 2012, 16 nurses commenced the program, including eight graduate nurses and nurses from other areas in Canberra Hospital and regional New South Wales hospitals. The program is 12 months long and is completed in the following February, in line with the new graduate program. All graduate nurses elected to continue to work in the perioperative area. The 2012 program was extensively evaluated, indicating that the course had delivered orientation, provided basic skills and knowledge, and retained staff in the perioperative nursing specialties. Feedback from regional hospital participants was very positive, and places will continue to be offered to them. In February 2013, 13 nurses (including eight graduate nurses) commenced the program, including two participants from regional New South Wales. The program will continue until February 2014. Perioperative Team Leader Program The Perioperative Team Leader (TL) Program was developed to attract and educate nurses to fulfil the role of Scrub TL after hours. Following evaluation the program was changed to deliver a broader, team-orientated approach, providing education modules encompassing all perioperative nursing specialties. These include Scrub, Anaesthetics, the Extended Day Surgery Unit (EDSU) and the Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit. Perioperative level 1 registered nurses with a minimum of two years experience (12 months for EDSU) or level 2 perioperative registered nurses who have not yet worked as a team leader are the target groups for this program. Twelve nurses attended the first four modules and seven nurses attended the final module. The revised 2013 program was well received. Paediatric Foundation Program The Paediatric Foundation Program is aligned with the Nurse Graduate Program. The program allows the novice paediatric nurse to develop and consolidate their skills through workshops and learning modules. In 2013, there were two intakes and a total of eight graduates. In August 2013, the first intake will complete the program. The second intake is due to complete it in November 2013. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Program This three-day program is run in conjunction with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and provides health professionals with knowledge and management skills used in the care of the child and young person with an acute mental health problem. In 2012, 18 participants completed the program and paper-based evaluations demonstrated 100 per cent satisfaction, with ratings of 'good' to 'very good'. This program is re-scheduled for September 2013. Peripheral Intravenous Cannulation Program The program is for registered nurses and midwives, medical students and medical officers and radiographers, and third year student nurses in their final placement may also apply. In 2012-13, 10 workshops were conducted, with 159 participants, and 13 per cent completed all requirements. The focus is now on revising the content to more closely align with the 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, ACT Health policy and current literature, and on the development of an e-learning program for the theory component to encourage a higher rate of completion of all aspects of the program requirements.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 257 Central Venous Access Devices Workshop This program provides an overview of ACT Health policy and procedures in the care and management of central venous access devices and is available as a workshop and e-learning package. In 2012-13, 21 participants attended workshops and 69 staff completed the e-learning program. Postgraduate Certificates for Nurses and Midwives Two Postgraduate certificates are offered to nurses and midwives through the Australian Catholic University (ACU) in partnership with ACT Health. The ACU delivers an online component for two units, and an educator in the Staff Development Unit teaches an approved curriculum for the remaining two units. This education model combines theory and experiential learning. The advantages for ACT Health of using this model are that postgraduate study is tailored to work area need, students can work and study at the same time, and there are no fees for the ACT Health component. Graduate Certificate in Neonatal Nursing: In 2012, four students completed the online component through the Australian Catholic University. In 2013, nine students were enrolled in the ACT Health program, including the four students who completed the online subjects in 2012. Two students have continued on to study for a master's degree. Child and Adolescent Health Graduate Certificate: The course curriculum was revised and approved by the ACU in 2013. In 2012 six students were enrolled, five specialising in acute paediatrics and one in maternal and child health. All students completed the course and five went on to study for a master's degree. A further three students started in mid-semester, two specialising in acute paediatrics and one in maternal and child health. In 2013, 11 students enrolled, five specialising in acute paediatrics and six in maternal and child health. Three students completed the course at the end of semester 1, 2013, with two going on to a master's degree. E-learning Seven new e-learning programs were implemented in 2012-13 to support clinical and non-clinical areas and a further six are in final development. Ten programs were reviewed and updated as a result of evaluation feedback and changes to legislation or clinical practices. These developments with e-learning are set out in the table below.

The aim of the program is to give students a realistic idea of what it is like to work in health care and encourage them to choose career paths in health. In 2012-13, Health placed 251 secondary students. Positive feedback was received from students, teachers and workplaces. Secondary students' comments included the following: 'I got the chance to see a very broad range of professionals within the ward, which was interesting and beneficial. I also got to interact a lot with patients and was able to do many activities with them.' 'I loved the people who I worked with because they were so friendly, accommodating and willing to educate me.' 'When the patients showed improvements, the excitement expressed by them was great. The therapist/patient relationship. The patients were really friendly. The personality of the nurses and observing the daily requirements and abilities a nurse is expected to provide. The nurses are such beautiful women and men who were continuously devoted and always shared such friendly smiles and words together.' The Student Placement Unit assists with the management of clinical placements for nursing, midwifery, medical and allied health students. It provides a platform for pre-placement preparation, including e-learning programs for legislative compliance prior to clinical placement commencement. The student placement management system also assists with the reporting requirements of Health Workforce Australia in relation to student clinical placement activity. In 2012-13, there were 523 allied health placements. In the same period, 23,770 clinical placement days were provided to nursing and midwifery students. Clinical placement opportunities were offered in a variety of acute and primary health care areas. The Allied Health Student Clinical Placement Mapping project commenced in 2012 to assess and identify capacity for growth in student numbers and clinical placements up to 2014 in allied health professions deemed to be in need of more clinical placements due to increased student numbers. This work was initiated to assist the Clinical Training Placements Reference Group, a subcommittee of the Integrated Regional Clinical Training Network (IRCTN). The project's initial focus has been on the collection of information relating to current and planned clinical placement activity and student numbers in physiotherapy at both ACT Health and Calvary Health Care ACT (public). The project has included the identification of barriers and enablers to increasing the number of placements offered, and highlighted the resources required to maintain and enhance the quality of the placements offered. The project will be finalised in late 2013. Scholarships for allied health, nursing and midwifery Allied health The Office of the Allied Health Adviser supports and promotes ACT Health's commitment to ongoing learning and development through the Allied Health Postgraduate Scholarship Scheme. Scholarships are awarded to support recipients in their pursuit of further learning in clinical practice, education and training, research and/or management and leadership. Scholarships are awarded annually over academic (calendar) years, with the budget spread over two financial years. The 2012-13 budget committed $71,345 to support 25 recipients completing their Semester 2, 2012, postgraduate study. However, actual payment for this study period was $50,194 due to the withdrawal of seven recipients. In Semester 3, 2012, a total of $18,277 was committed to seven recipients. However, following two withdrawals, actual payment made was $15,311. In the 2013 academic year, allied health postgraduate scholarships were awarded to 13 new applicants and 13 continued their study from 2012. Of the postgraduate courses being undertaken by the 2013 recipients, five are at Graduate Certificate level, one is at Graduate Diploma level and 20 are at Master's level. Twenty-five recipients commenced their study in Semester 1, 2013, representing a commitment of $62,326 and resulting in a total investment of $127,832 in allied health postgraduate scholarships for 2012-13.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 259 Nursing and midwifery The Nursing and Midwifery Post-Registration Scholarship Scheme, offered since November 2000, provides financial assistance with course tuition fees to support studies in a clinical, education, research and leadership or management area for enrolled and registered nurses and midwives, through the following scholarship programs: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Enrolled Nursing Scholarships Joanna Briggs Institute Clinical Fellowship Scholarships Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Enrolled Nursing Scholarship Jennifer James Memorial Honours Degree Scholarship Nursing and Midwifery Travel Scholarship.

Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 261 C.9 Workplace health and safety Our priority\u2014a safe and healthy working environment for all employees Workplace safety within ACT Health is a shared responsibility between managers, staff and the Workplace Safety section. The Workplace Safety section: has overarching responsibility for ensuring that ACT Health has an effective workplace safety management system to identify, manage and monitor and report safety risks provides a holistic early intervention physiotherapy service to staff who have sustained a musculo-skeletal accident or injury in the workplace provides occupational medicine services across ACT Health to prevent the potential transmission of infectious disease to healthcare workers. These services include pre-employment screening, a vaccination program (including annual influenza vaccinations), an immunisation drop-in clinic, occupational risk exposure (ORE) and follow-up management, counselling and advice, cytotoxic screening, a mobile clinic for seasonal influenza vaccinations and product monitoring on safety devices, surveillance and education. In addition to promoting workplace safety, ACT Health provides staff with health promotion opportunities. These aim to enhance the efforts already achieved in keeping directorate staff healthy and safe and ensure this is a sustainable goal. Measures taken during 2012-13 Workplace safety measures undertaken during 2012-13 are set out below. The ACT Health Work Health Safety Management System was amended during the year to reflect changes to legislation and to focus on risk management. It includes enhanced asbestos management and removal procedures and an update of cytotoxic drug procedures. This system was designed to meet the Australian Standard 4804 and enables ACT Health to have an integrated safety system. Auditing against Australian Standard 4801 will enable ACT Health to continuously improve its safety management system. The ACT Health Workplace Safety Committee (the peak organisational body for occupational health and safety in ACT Health) met four times during the year. It is chaired by the Director-General and includes management and workplace health and safety representatives. The fourth year of electronic staff accident and incident reporting has resulted in consistent reporting and enabled ACT Health to quickly identify and implement relevant controls, as well as report to management and workplace health and safety representatives. Safety training remains a priority and continues to be provided for health and safety representatives, managers and new staff. E-learning packages were developed for work safety legislation, work station setup, and violence and aggression. The ACT Health Capital Asset Development Plan, and the resultant capital construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings, has created a need to increase the level and extent of safety advice provided by Workplace Safety staff. The Dangerous Goods and Hazardous Substances Manual was re-issued in April 2013. This was supported by a Respiratory Policy.262 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Target 2 \u2014 Reduce the incidence of claims resulting in one or more weeks off work by at least 30 per cent 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 New 5 day claims per 1000 employees HD rate per 1000 employees ACTPS rate per 1000 employees HD Target 2 ACTPS day claims60.0 71 HD rate per 1000 employees12.03 5 day claims304.3 274 ACTPS rate per 1000 employees15.66 13.87 Over the last 10 years ACT Health has consistently reduced the number of new claims that have exceeded five days incapacity per 1000 employees. This improvement varies on a year-to-year basis depending on the nature and complexity of a small number of claims. A small deterioration has occurred in overall performance between the 2009-2012 average and 2012-13. However, 2012-13 figures are still reflective of historical trends. Overall performance is very good against the ACT Public Service figures. Target 3 \u2014 Reduce the incidence of claims for musculoskeletal disorders (MSK) resulting in one or more weeks off work by at least 30 per cent 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 New 5 day claims per 1000 employees HD rate per 1000 employees ACTPS rate per 1000 employees HD Target 2 ACTPS claims31.0 36 HD MSD rate per 1000 employees6.21 6.52 HD Target 3 rate per 1000 7.48 7.24 7.00 6.76 6.53 6.29 6.05 5.81 5.57 The report includes accepted claims only. Dates are based on those claims received by Comcare in each financial year. Both reports are based on injury or disease which results in one or more weeks off work. ACT Health's performance has indicated a small deterioration compared with the preceding four years. This is reflective of the incidence of musculoskeletal claims in line with the risk profile for these types of injuries within ACT Health. ACT Health manages this risk through investing in proactive approaches to ensure that long-term trends do not reflect 2012-13 statistical performance. The overall trend in performance on these claims is improving with these early intervention strategies and proactive case management. Other key performance indicators Incidents, accidents, investigations and notices in 2012-13 were as follows: 1355 accident/incident reports were lodged during the 2012-13 financial year (not including non-individual or Redevelopment Unit contractors). This compares with 1209 lodged during 2011-12. Of these reports, 164 resulted in lost time of one day or more, compared with 153 in 2011-12. 74 accidents/incidents relating to ACT Health staff were notified to WorkSafe ACT under section 35 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 , compared with 14 in 2011-12. In addition there were a number of instances where contractors working for ACT Health reported incidents directly to WorkSafe ACT. There was one outstanding provisional improvement notice (PIN) issued in 2011-12 (27 March 2012). The notice was in relation to potential unknown contaminants in level 5, 1 Moore Street affecting staff working there. The PIN was lifted by WorkSafe ACT on 6 September 2012. ACT Health has since relinquished occupancy of this floor. One further PIN was issued on 7 December 2012. This was because of an ongoing chemical smell that had been detected in the ACT Research School Endocrinology and Diabetics Laboratory in Building 10, level 6, TCH. This was lifted by the Health and Safety Representative on 5 March 2013 when the odour had been eliminated. At 30 June 2013, there were 243 elected Health and Safety representatives within ACT Health. There were 194 Health and Safety Representatives during the 2011-12 period. There were 304 workstation assessments completed by the Workplace Safety Early Intervention Physiotherapy Program during the 2012-13 financial year. Workstation assessments are conducted as part of workers, compensation return-to-work plans as well as for non-compensatory purposes. This is an increase from the 129 completed the previous year. Five improvement notices, failure to comply notices, prohibition notices or notices of non-compliance were issued to ACT Health under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 . 264 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 C.10 Workplace relations Details of the Health Directorate's Special Employment Arrangements (SEAs) and Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) are set out in the table below.

The Human Rights Commission provides regular training sessions on human rights matters for all ACT Health employees, which are widely advertised within the agency. Staff are encouraged to attend training sessions, which are provided free of charge. In addition, representatives from the Human Rights Commission attend ACT Health managers and staff orientation induction modules and provide information on the human rights responsibilities of staff. ACT Health is committed to building a human rights culture in the delivery of health services and to ensuring that ACT Health managers work within a human rights framework. In ACT Health, education on the Human Rights Act 2004 has been identified as essential for policy writers and for manager-level staff and above. The human rights training for managers program is conducted throughout the year by the Staff Development Unit. In addition, in consultation with the ACT Human Rights Commission, ACT Health has now developed an e -learning program to allow an alternative method of training, as well as the face-to-face sessions. The face-to-face training, delivered by internal trainers, was completed by 95 staff in 2012-13: 27 senior officers, 20 health professionals, 11 administration officers, 35 nurses, one medical scientist and one medical officer. Course evaluations completed by participants indicate that the training increased participants' awareness of their obligations under the Act. In respect of the e-learning program, 57 staff enrolled online and 34 completed the module. In total, 129 staff completed human rights training in 2012-13. In 2012-13 ACT Health developed and published a number of brochures dealing with human rights issues of concern to the organisation. ACT Health printed 10,000 copies of the Healthcare Rights brochure, 30,000 copies of the Listening and Learning Consumer Feedback brochure, 10,000 copies of the Guide to Patient, Consumer, Carers and Family brochure, 500 copies of the Mental Health Charter of Rights brochure and 100 copies for each of the 12 language groups of the Victims Support Multilanguage brochure. The Consumer Feedback and Engagement Team (CFET) of ACT Health values the partnership it has developed with the Human Rights Commission. The two bodies meet twice a year to discuss how they can work together to achieve positive outcomes. The commission regularly contacts CFET to find out whether a complaint it has received has also been submitted through the ACT Health consumer feedback management process. This is important as it assists to resolve issues as soon as possible for the consumer. Liaison with the Human Rights and Regulatory Policy Unit of the Justice and Community Safety Directorate is initiated where staff developing legislation are uncertain about human rights issues and for the routine vetting of draft Bills. Issues identified in any ACT Health Bills as a result of the Legislative Assembly's scrutiny process are also brought to the attention of relevant staff. In 2012-13, ACT Health prepared 16 Cabinet submissions, two of which related to legislative proposals for which human rights compatibility statements were sought. In 2012-13 ACT Health continued its major review of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 , which engages a number of significant human rights issues. Drafting instructions are being completed for the final amendment Bill following release of two exposure draft bills for public consultation in August 2012 and April 2013. Recommendations for these amendments were made by a Review Advisory Committee comprising more than 40 stakeholder groups, including consumers and carers and ACT Human Rights Commission representatives. The amendments were also endorsed by a Policy Management Team comprising members of the government agencies involved in developing the final amendment Bill and including human rights law policy representation. Compatibility with the Human Rights Act 2004 will be addressed as part of the explanatory statement accompanying the Bill. In respect of litigation, one application involving ACT Health which raised issues arising under the Human Rights Act came before the ACT Supreme Court in 2012-13. The application arose from the administration of electro- convulsive therapy without the consumer's consent. The application before the court claims general damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages for false imprisonment, assault and battery, and a breach of section 18 of the Human Rights Act 2004 . The matter is still before the court.266 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 C.12 Strategic Bushfire Management Plan During 2012-13, ACT Health did not have any facilities located in rural or ember zones and was therefore not required by the ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA) to prepare a Bushfire Operational Plan under the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan. In 2010, the ESA completed fire/ember risk assessments to identify at-risk ACT Government owned and operated facilities during high fire danger periods for the ACT Elevated Fire Danger Plan. Assessments were made of government-owned or regulated properties where normal activities should be suspended when a catastrophic bushfire danger alert is in place. One ACT Health facility was identified by the ESA assessment\u2014the proposed rehabilitation centre known as the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm, located at Miowera, in the foothills of the Brindabella ranges, in the far west of the ACT. Work progressed in 2012-13 to develop a Bushfire Operation Plan and a Bushfire Action Plan for the property and facility. It is anticipated these will be submitted to the ESA in 2013-14. In addition, a Bushfire Assessment and Compliance Report was submitted as part of the development application process for the proposed facility.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 267 C.13 Strategic asset management Assets managed The Health Directorate managed assets with a total written down value of $707.919 million as at 30 June 2013, including: Built property assets $620.485 million Land $36.827 million Plant and equipment $43.978 million Leased plant and equipment $6.629 million.

Property, plant and equipment are maintained to a high standard to meet health requirements. Expenditure on repairs and maintenance (excluding salaries) was $11.862 million, which represents 0.84 per cent of the replacement value. Building audits Ninety-six building condition assessments, hazardous materials audits and fire reports have been undertaken as part of a rolling three-year program to assess all buildings managed by the Health Directorate. These audits are used to inform the directorate's ongoing asset management program. The condition audits assessed these properties as being in normal or average condition.

The Service and Capital Planning Branch is responsible for the delivery of the Health Infrastructure Program (HIP)\u2014a significant investment in the future health services for the ACT community and surrounding region\u2014as well as the Strategic Accommodation and Capital Upgrades Program. In September 2012 upon the natural expiration of the contract with Thinc Health Australia to provide Project Director services for the HIP, ACT Health progressed plans for the integration of the Project Director role into the governance for the HIP. The Service and Capital Planning Branch grew significantly in the latter half of 2012, with the direct engagement of staff with industry experience and expertise to support the work of the HIP. The HIP, a major capital infrastructure program, is based on a complex mix of population growth and ageing, changing technology and provider and consumer expectations\u2014all of which contribute to a significant increase in demand for health services in the ACT. Demand for health services is projected to increase rapidly over the next 10 years and beyond and the HIP is a planned, comprehensive and structured response to these pressures. Underpinned by future health services demand projections, the HIP encompasses models of care and service delivery, technology, workforce and infrastructure redesign work in conjunction with a significant capital works program over a 10-year period, up to 2022. This reporting year marked the fifth year of the HIP. The ongoing program of capital works to buildings and plant to maintain and improve the existing infrastructure supporting the Health Directorate was transferred from the Business and Infrastructure Branch to the Service and Capital Planning Branch on 1 January 2013. The Capital Upgrades Program is funded annually, with prioritisation of work being determined by the ACT Health Executive under the following categories: building upgrades safety/security upgrades medical facility upgrades patient facility upgrades ambulatory care improvements augmentation of medical and administration offices. Projects completed in 2012-13 under the HIP were as follows: Stage 1 of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC) was completed in August 2012 and clinical services commenced on 21 August 2012. Stage 1 of the facility provides permanent accommodation for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Special Care Nursery, Birth Centre, maternity and gynaecology inpatient ward areas and administration. Ronald MacDonald House is also incorporated within this facility. It provides overnight accommodation for families and carers of children who are inpatients within the CHWC. The Calvary Hospital emergency department expansion was completed in December 2012, with capacity created for an additional six treatment spaces (four chair areas and two consulting rooms). The Gunghalin Community Health Centre was completed in August 2012, with service delivery commencing on 3 September 2012. The facility provides health services for the Gunghalin Community in the areas of dental health, allied health and community nursing. Duffy House was completed in August 2012. It provides accommodation for interstate cancer services patients and carers. The facility was developed with funding support from the Australian Government. 270 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Works in progress under the HIP at 30 June 2013 were: Staging, decanting and continuity of services: these works are continuing. This project consists of multiple sub-projects that aim to relocate occupants of ACT Health facilities to allow building works to progress. Canberra Region Cancer Centre: this facility is nearing the final stages of construction. The facility is expected to be completed in September 2013. The new facility will provide an integrated treatment centre for cancer services for the Canberra region. University of Canberra Public Hospital achieved a number of milestones, with a site on the University of Canberra campus identified as the preferred location for the facility. A 'Heads of Agreement' was signed in September 2012 to support the agreement. Negotiations relating to acquisition of the land commenced during the reporting year. In addition, a draft service delivery plan to inform a concept design for the facility was developed based on user group consultation; site studies were undertaken on the preferred site; a report was prepared on possible procurement delivery models to be adopted; and an expression of interest for the principal consultant was advertised, with 18 submissions received. Tuggeranong Health Centre (refurbishment and stage 2): this project involves the refurbishment and extension of the physical infrastructure of the Tuggeranong Community Health Centre and the expansion and enhancement of services provided at the Tuggeranong Health Centre. The extension and refurbishment have been designed to meet the future health needs of the local population to 2021-22. Belconnen Community Health Centre (BCHC): physical works commenced in January 2012, with completion of construction expected in September 2013. The BCHC will provide an increased number of traditional community health services, such as dental, community nursing and community mental health. It will also provide an expanded range of higher order clinical services that were previously provided on hospital grounds, such as renal dialysis, some specialist outpatient services and chronic disease management. Stage 2 of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children is nearing completion, with handover to ACT Health expected in late 2013. Adult Secure Mental Health Unit\u2014Forward Design: work is proceeding to prepare a health facility brief before proceeding to design. The new purpose-built facility will be located on the former Quamby site at Symonston. It is expected that design works will commence in 2014. The Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm project experienced delays relating to its development application (DA) process. During the reporting year, the model of care (phase 2) and the preliminary and final sketch plans for the facility were endorsed by the Redevelopment Committee. Construction documentation has been completed for the tendering of construction works. After community consultation and an initial submission of a DA in mid-2012, amended development applications were lodged for lease variation, design and siting of the facility in February 2013. In May 2013 the lease variation was approved with conditions by the Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate\u2014ACT Planning and Land Authority. In June 2013 ACT Health was advised that applications for a review of this decision had been received by the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. At 30 June 2013, the outcome of the design and siting DA was pending. In addition to this work, land management activities on the Miowera property have been ongoing, and planning for construction has progressed.

The Records Management Program has been lodged with the Director of the Territory Records Office and continues to be the instrument under which ACT Health works. Records management procedures The Records Management Program comprises ACT Health's policy statement, detailed procedures, the Business Classification Scheme and a set of disposal schedules. In line with the Territory Records Act 2002 , the directorate's Records Management Policy outlines a Records Management Program for ACT Health and details how the agency will adhere to the requirements of the Act. This procedure provides a framework for ACT Health to create, systematically capture, register, classify, use, store, dispose of and retain records. During 2011-12, a review commenced of ACT Health's Administrative Records Management Procedures Manual 2005 in consultation with the Territory Records Office. The revised Records Management Procedures and Guidelines have now been placed on the intranet and are available for all staff to view. The Records Management intranet site is under review. The updated site will include links to the Territory Records Office's standards and guidelines. Records disposal schedules A list of approved records disposal schedules is outlined below.

As a result of these evaluations, a number of improvements to the training program have been implemented, as noted. The training provided will continue to be evaluated and adjusted as required. Preservation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander information Administrative records containing content about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people mainly belong to the general record series about Health Community Programs, Health and Welfare Issues and Policy. All Records Management staff understand the sensitivities relating to records about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the need for these records to be preserved for possible future access and reference. The current disposal schedule has identified a small selection of records for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for permanent retention. Public access to Territory records In 2012-13, Health Records Management staff liaised closely with the Territory Records Office's Reference Archivist in response to public access requests under section 26 of the Territory Records Act 2002 . During this period, six requests were received for access to records.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 289 C.18 Commissioner for the Environment ACT Health is responsible for reporting against the following recommendation from the State of the Environment Report 2007-08 : Community wellbeing and safety is strengthened by ... Encouraging community health programs, particularly those aimed at exercise, healthy eating, mental wellbeing and minimising the excessive alcohol consumption. The ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Family Wellbeing Plan 2006-2011 was developed in response to the requirement of the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health for each jurisdiction to develop a local implementation plan. A review of the plan was undertaken in 2012-13 by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Forum, which includes membership from ACT Health, the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and ACT Medicare Local. Through this process, many factors were identified as affecting its implementation, most significantly the Closing the Gap Indigenous reform agenda, which was introduced halfway through implementation of the plan in 2008. Development of a new ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan commenced in 2013. The new plan will incorporate learnings from the review of the previous plan and outstanding action items which have been identified as ongoing strategies requiring implementation by the Health Forum. These areas relate to, but are not limited to, early intervention, health promotion, service provision, workforce planning, local research, reporting and leadership. Please refer to C.21, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Reporting, for further details. Beyond Today\u2014it's up to you , a smoking cessation and healthy lifestyle social marketing strategy targeting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities of the ACT and surrounding region, was launched in December 2012. The campaign is the culmination of a significant engagement process with the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The campaign features local members of the community telling stories across a range of materials, including posters, banners, a brochure, short videos and songs created locally and performed by local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. Progress continues in the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Alcohol and Other Drug Residential Rehabilitation Service (Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm). This service will seek to improve health outcomes by addressing the complex issues that relate to drug and alcohol abuse. The service will provide culturally appropriate prevention, education, rehabilitation and outreach programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples aged 18 years and over. Work is occurring to finalise the pre-tender cost estimate, construction program and governance arrangements for the service. Please refer to C.21, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Reporting, for further details. ACT Health has initiated a number of measures to improve community health in line with the commissioner's second recommendation relating to health promotion and care services. These include: the launch of Beyond Today\u2014it's up to you promotion of tap water as the drink of choice to the ACT community, including lending portable 'Tap into water every day' water-dispensing units to community events, and working in partnership with the ACT Education Directorate to trial fixed water units in schools the Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service \u00ae, a free information and telephone-based health service to assist adults to identify and reach their health goals local support for the Australian Government's Swap It, Don't Stop It social marketing campaign, which encourages people to make sustainable, incremental changes in their lifestyle choices funding for a wide range of community-based health promotion activities through the ACT Health Promotion Grants program Kids at Play Active Play and the Eating Well Early Childhood project, which provides organisations responsible for early childhood services with support to promote healthy childhood habits SmartStart for Kids Program, funded to screen children for health risk factors and provide a school-based program for higher-risk child care290 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 the Healthy Food at Schools project, including support for schools to implement National Healthy Schools Canteen Guidelines in partnership with Nutrition Australia the Healthy Food at Children's Sports project, in partnership with Sport and Recreation and local sporting organisations the Active Travel to Schools project funding of the Heart Foundation's Active Living agenda\u2014Heart Foundation Walking and the Heartmoves program ongoing implementation of the Australian Government's Healthy Communities Initiative implementation of a variety of workplace health promotion activities, including ACT Health Smoke-Free Workplace policy, and the development and piloting of a number of resources to support workplace health and wellbeing programs My Health\u2014the Health Directorate's staff health and wellbeing program.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 291 C.19 Ecologically sustainable development The ACT Health Directorate actively supports whole-of-government sustainability initiatives and in 2012-13 continued to work closely with the Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate to embed climate change policy, energy policy and environmental sustainability into the delivery of service. Sustainability planning To assist with its planning processes, ACT Health developed the ACT Health Directorate Sustainability Strategy (2010), which outlines the current environmental challenges presented by increasing demands on health care in the ACT and provides a roadmap for a collaborative sustainable future. It encapsulates a picture of where the directorate wants to be in 30 years' time and takes into account all the key elements contributing to a sustainable and dynamic future. The Sustainability Strategy contains seven focus areas (Models of Care, Buildings and Infrastructure, the Digital Health Environment, Transport, Regulatory Environment, Workforce, and Partnerships and External Service Delivery). During 2012-13, ACT Health undertook extensive work on finalising the Sustainability Action Plan, in line with the Sustainability Strategy. Development of the Action Plan was supported by ACT Health's Leadership Network, which consists of the agency's future leaders. These staff embraced development of the Action Plan, which contains short-, medium- and long-term actions to be implemented across the directorate, with 93 per cent of the short- term actions (1-3 years) already completed. These actions include: significant reduction in operating costs improved quality of the internal environment for staff and visitors future-proofing of buildings so that they are able to adapt to future requirements informed design choices, based on whole-of-life considerations reduction in carbon emissions. ACT Health continues to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of ecologically sustainable development by: closely monitoring its use of resources integrating economic, social and environmental considerations into decision-making implementing measures to minimise the impact of agency activities on the environment. ACT Health developed the Sustainability-Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Building and Infrastructure document to inform all capital projects and major refurbishment works regarding sustainable design and functionality that aligns with the ACT Government's targets. For the purpose of the Agency Resource Use Data Table at the end of this section, office space is classified as it is in section C.13 of this Annual Report; that is, fully inclusive of new office space. The Canberra Hospital campus buildings' housing office space has also been included this year. Energy use Total energy use in 2012-13 increased by 5,410,420 megajoules (approximately 2.35 per cent) compared with 2011-12, due to: increased building and clinical space associated with the Health Infrastructure Program (HIP) an increase in clinical demand across the directorate, both in the acute and non-acute areas. New space in 2012-13, which had an impact on energy usage, included: the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Stage 1, which opened in September 2012292 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 the Gungahlin Community Health Centre, which opened in August 2012 the fully operational Adult Mental Health Unit additional beds implemented across the Canberra Hospital. Other developments nearing completion which will increase energy usage in the near future include: Stage 2 of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Canberra Region Cancer Centre additional Canberra Hospital (TCH) beds currently being constructed the new Belconnen Enhanced Community Health Centre Tuggeranong Community Health Centre extension. In 2012-13, the following initiatives to improve energy management were either implemented or continued across ACT Health: replacement of several gas-fired boilers at Canberra Hospital replacement of air-conditioning fan coil units throughout Building 1 at Canberra Hospital ongoing upgrade of electrical distribution boards across many areas of the directorate ongoing installation of energy-efficient, occupancy-sensor or time-controlled lighting for non-critical building lighting and air-conditioning systems continued review, monitoring and tracking of large plant equipment (e.g. high-energy use chillers and boilers), with programming adjustments made, where possible, by the building management system to maintain peak efficiency replacement of older, larger electrical equipment in non-acute areas with more energy-efficient units, e.g. pan flushers and utensil washers installation of boiler heat recovery and burner management systems. Water consumption ACT Health's main use of water is for the provision of clinical treatment and associated services for patients and clients. The most significant consumption of water is attributable to: patient services, clinical use associated with a 24-hour service, including bathrooms chilled and hot water services for air-conditioning systems for wards, operating rooms and treatment areas operations within the kitchens and preparation of patient meals an increase in building-related activities associated with the Health Infrastructure Program sterilisation of surgical instruments, including water used in autoclave units renal dialysis treatments ACT Health's total water consumption increased from 186,552 kilolitres in 2011-12 194,088 kilolitres in 2012-13, an increase of 7,536 kilolitres or 4 per cent. This increase is attributable to: operational activity associated with the use of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children Stage 1 and the Adult Mental Health Unit. Both buildings add additional bathrooms and clinical requirements. construction requirements for the Canberra Region Cancer Centre and Stage 2 of the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children additional beds at the Canberra Hospital increased service delivery across ACT Health operational activity associated with the Gungahlin Community Health Centre. The graph below summarises total water consumption data for ACT Health, represented as total kilolitres used, from 2008-09 when it was 154,711 kilolitres to 2012-13 when it was 194,088.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 293 ACT Health Annual Water Consumption 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 2008/2009 2009/2010 2010/2011 2011/2012 2012/2013 The ongoing implementation and review of a variety of water efficiency initiatives continued through 2012-13, including: installation of flow restrictors on a range of plumbing fixtures (e.g. showers, hand basins and toilets for all new works and refurbishments) installation of six-star energy rating fixtures as replacements, where practical replacement of heating pipe work and associated works at TCH boiler upgrades at TCH continuation of restrictions on the use of potable water for outside watering at all Health Directorate facilities and deactivation of all garden sprinklers and decommissioning of fountains monitoring of water meters for cooling towers usage use of newly-installed tank water for outdoor garden watering and external washing of facilities, buildings and pavements. Greenhouse gas emissions ACT Health supports and participates in the Australian Government Department of Climate Change benchmarking through the Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting (OSCAR) database. OSCAR standardises the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions to produce comparable data sets on environmental performance. Improved data gathering implemented during 2011-12 and 2012-13 enabled enhanced monitoring of greenhouse gas emission trends across ACT Health in future years. Transport In 2012-13, the Health Directorate vehicle fleet increased in number by one vehicle. The following transport data was reported for 2012-13: Total fuel use reduced from 365.2kilolitres (petrol and diesel combined) reported for 2011-12 to 362.4 kilolitres for 2012-13. This is a reduction of 0.76 per cent. Total petrol fuel use was reported as 228.1 kilolitres; total diesel use was 134.4 kilolitres. Total number of vehicle kilometres travelled remained relatively static at 4,046,311 kilometres, compared to 4,056,252 kilometres reported for 2011-12, a reduction of 0.25 per cent. Vehicle utilisation decreased from 12,636 to 12,566 kilometres (0.6 per cent). Average fleet fuel consumption remained static at 8.97 litres per 100 kilometres relative to the 2011-12 figure of 9.00 litres per 100 kilometres.294 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Total transport greenhouse gas emissions (all scopes) reduced from 987 tonnes CO2-e to 975 tonnes, a reduction of 1.22 per cent. Transport greenhouse gas intensity improved from 0.16 tonnes CO2-e per headcount to 0.15 tonnes per headcount (5.4 per cent). Total transport energy use was 12,988 gigajoules. Fuel June 2010, the Health Directorate entered into a contract with Carpool-It.com (Australia) Pty Ltd (also known as MyCarpools ) for the development and hosting of a car-pooling system for staff. Subsequently the ACT Government introduced MyCarpools across ACT Government directorates and since June 2012 ACT Health has been participating in this program. Usage of the ACT Government's MyCarpools has steadily increased since its inception. Since 2012, 301 users have registered, with 110 of those users being staff of ACT Health. There are currently 15 car-pooling groups registered with MyCarpools, of which 13 are made up of ACT Health staff, resulting in ACT Health having the largest number of active car-pooling staff across the ACT Government. ACT Health will acquire two electrical vehicles in the next financial year. New bicycle facilities at Canberra Hospital have helped staff to use this mode of transport to work. Waste minimisation (NoWaste) ISS Health Services (ISS) provides a waste management solution for the Health Directorate under the terms of the ACT Health Domestic and Environmental Services Contract. ISS services are provided to 17 sites, including the Canberra Hospital. Health Directorate and ISS developed and implemented a Health Waste Management Plan, which was endorsed in August 2012. The management of all waste services by one provider and in accordance with the waste plan facilitates the delivery of a uniform approach to waste management activities. The Health Waste Management Plan complies with the principles of the ACT Sustainable Waste Strategy 2010-2015, which builds on the success of the NoWaste by 2010 ACT Government strategy released in 1996 and provides for: monitoring and measuring of all services through internal benchmarking activities, target setting, waste audits, waste data collection and reporting improved systems to recycle, reduce and reuse as many resources as possible from waste streams, including paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, cans, fluorescent tubes, metal, batteries, toner cartridges, and biodegradables.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 295 ACT Health is also a signatory to the ACT Government ACTSmart program, which aligns with and supports the initiatives of the Health Waste Management Plan, specifically in increasing recycling outputs. ACT Health and ISS are working closely with ACTSmart representatives to increase recycling outputs through education for staff and the implementation of recycling systems within administrative areas. ACT Health introduced waste streaming stations into the design of all new buildings coming on line through the Health Infrastructure Program (HIP). ACT Health collaborated with Australian National University (ANU) Medical School students on the ACT Green Hospitals Project 2010-2013. One of the aims of the project was to encourage and increase correct streaming of waste at the point of disposal in the Canberra Hospital theatres. The project delivered a 4.6 per cent reduction of waste incorrectly disposed of into the clinical waste stream, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with clinical waste treatments and disposal. ACT Health received an EA rating (excellent achievement) from the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) for Waste and Environmental Management in relation to Criterion 3.2.3 EQUIP5 of the accreditation process undertaken in November 2012.

Across all Health sites.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 297 C.20 Climate change and greenhouse gas reduction policies and programs The ACT Health Sustainability Strategy was developed in response to the ACT Government's Climate Change Strategy 2007-2025: Weathering the Change (2007), the Canberra Plan (2008) and the Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act 2010 . These documents and legislation outline the government's commitment to sustainability and detail the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of zero net emissions (carbon neutrality) by 2060. Due to the nature and scale of its operations, the Health Directorate is a major consumer of energy and water, and generates a significant amount of waste. The Health Infrastructure Program \u2014a major hospital redevelopment initiative\u2014provides an important opportunity to create ecologically sustainable health facilities. The challenge is to build intelligently, so that buildings use a minimum of non-renewable energy, produce a minimum of pollution and waste, and cost a minimum of energy dollars, while increasing the health, safety, and welfare of everyone who works in, visits or resides in them. These are the key components of sustainable design. New health facilities have incorporated many environmentally sustainable design principles such as: energy efficient lighting systems, including LEDs clean energy options cyclist facilities for sustainable transport. ACT Health will strive to achieve higher levels of environmental performance in the future as we work toward meeting the Government's greenhouse gas emission and water consumption targets. Sustainability in healthcare facilities need not compromise functionality, nor significantly increase the cost of designing and operating buildings. Well-designed sustainability initiatives can provide the following benefits: significant reduction in operating costs improved quality of the internal environment for staff and visitors future proofing of buildings so that they are able to adapt to future requirements informed design choices, based on whole-of-life considerations reduction in carbon emissions. ACT Health's Sustainability Strategy (2010) outlines the current environmental challenges presented by the increasing demands in health care in the ACT and provides a vision for achieving a sustainable future. Through delivery of the Sustainability Action Plan, ACT Health will progressively reduce its carbon footprint by embedding sustainability in all elements of its core business throuh the following business functions: Models of Care; Buildings and Infrastructure; The Digital Environment; Transport; Regulatory Environment; Workforce and Partnerships with External Services. To date, ACT Health has completed 93 per cent of the short-term actions (59 short-term actions in total) towards a sustainable future, including: development of the Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Building and Infrastructure Projects under the Health Infrastructure Program improvement of access to information to consumers through the ACT Health consumer portal development of models of care in conjunction with consumers and staff, taking into account evidence-based design, supportive leadership and teams, and optimising patient/staff experiences establishment of new processes in community health centres that enable strong links with their local communities, improving communictaion flows and information and adapting services to local needs establishment of secure bicycle sheds, shower/change room facilities into current and future builds to support healthy transport options. 298 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 C.21 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reporting Early child development and growth (prenatal to age 3) ACT Health continued to fund Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service to deliver the Aboriginal Midwifery Access Program (AMAP) to ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The program is funded as part of Element 3 of the Council of Australian Governments' National Partnership Agreement on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Early Childhood Development. Comprehensive antenatal, postnatal and maternal and child health support is provided to women and their families through: outreach clinical and non-clinical assessments at home; referral to, and support in accessing, mainstream and specialist services; and the provision of information on mainstream services. From 1 July to 30 December 2012, 39 women received antenatal care and 44 women received postnatal care. The proportion of women smoking in pregnancy from 1 July to 30 December 2012 was 50 per cent and for the same period the proportion of women using alcohol in pregnancy was 10 per cent. From 1 January to 30 June 2013, 44 women received antenatal care and 35 women received postnatal care, For the same period the proportion of women smoking in pregnancy was 45 per cent and the proportion of women using alcohol in pregnancy was 7 per cent. ACT Health engaged with key stakeholders in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the 'Beyond Today ... it's up to you ' social marketing campaign, which promotes tobacco cessation and healthy lifestyle behaviours, including providing information on the effects of smoking in pregnancy and in families. Early school engagement and performance (preschool to Year 3) ACT Health continued to fund Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service to deliver a Hearing Health Program for infants and children, which included provision of a comprehensive school-based screening service and the development and provision of appropriate education and treatment, including referral for surgical interventions. From 1 July to 30 December 2012, 514 infants and children (aged 0 to 14) were screened by an audiologist (some children were assessed more than once during the reporting period), 24 infants or children were seen by a GP for otitis media and seven were referred to other hearing specialist centres, and 28 schools were visited (including preschools), with 171 students receiving hearing assessments. Between 1 January and 30 June 2013, 246 infants and children were screened by the audiologist, 33 were seen by a GP for otitis media and four were referred to other hearing specialist centres. Thirteen schools were visited, with 116 students receiving hearing assessments. Positive childhood and transition to adulthood ACT Health provides funding to Gugan Gulwan Youth Aboriginal Corporation to deliver: the Youth Outreach Network\u2014Street Beat; alcohol and other drug treatment support services, a Healthy Future preventative health program; and a Mental Health and Social and Emotional Wellbeing Program. From 1 July to 30 December 2012, the Youth Outreach Network\u2014Street Beat conducted 27 night patrols and 460 clients accessed the network. Between 1 January and 30 June 2013 there were 38 night patrols, with 736 clients accessing the service. The network supports early diagnosis, treatment and advice for young people on a range of health problems that relate to at-risk behaviour. Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 299 ACT Health is responsible for Element 2 of the Early Childhood Development National Partnership Agreement. The Antenatal Care, Pre-pregnancy and Teenage Sexual and Reproductive Health Project is progressing in line with agreed outcomes. An advisory group continues to meet bi-monthly to provide overall governance and project direction. A project working group meets as needed to provide input to strategies and resource development. Three key strategies were introduced to guide the project, including: Strategy 1: Support was provided for a workforce training initiative for teenage sexual and reproductive health through Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT. Training was delivered to workers from Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and Gugan Gulwan Aboriginal Youth Corporation. Following this training, consultation occurred with Canberra Sexual Health Centre to secure a project officer to deliver sexual health education, training and opportunistic testing for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Strategy 2: There was continued implementation of Core of Life (COL), a comprehensive life education program with a focus on the realities of pregnancy, birth and early parenting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people and their peer groups. In 2012-13, the program, which is facilitated by a midwife, was delivered in schools, community services, health services, refuges and youth detention centres. Over 460 young people participated, approximately 40 per cent of whom identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Three COL facilitator training workshops were held, where 58 people were trained to deliver the program in partnership with the midwife, and a facilitators' network was established to provide professional support. Strategy 3: Resources developed to support strategies 1 and 2 between July 2012 and June 2013 include: installation of a HitNet Kiosk at the Gugan Gulwan Youth Aboriginal Corporation; investigations undertaken for another two kiosks for Bimberi Youth Justice Centre and the Junction Youth Health Service; development of an inclusive breastfeeding DVD for young people; and development of Health in Pregnancy and Sexual Health information booklets. Substance use and misuse ACT Health continued to fund Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service to deliver a range of alcohol- and drug-related programs, including: Dual Diagnosis; the Youth Detoxification Support Service; the Opiate Program; Tackle Smoking; and Mental Health Liaison. Funding is also provided for a dedicated tobacco control worker to address priority areas of the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tobacco Control Strategy. ACT Health has progressed with the development of the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm, a residential rehabilitation service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the ACT, which seeks to address the complex issues related to drug and alcohol abuse. The service will provide culturally appropriate prevention, education, rehabilitation and outreach programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples aged 18 years and over. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, whose membership includes the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, United Ngunnawal Elders Council, community-organisations and ACT directorates, continued to provide advice and guide the development of the Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm. An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Alcohol and Drug Liaison Officer is employed by ACT Health, providing support and education to alcohol and drug sector services and other services to assist in providing appropriate care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Functional and resilient families and communities The ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Family Wellbeing Plan 2006-2011 was developed in response to the requirement in the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NSFATSIH) for each jurisdiction to develop a local implementation plan. A review of the plan was undertaken in 2012-13 by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Forum, which includes membership from ACT Health, the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Services, ACT Medicare Local and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. Through this process, factors affecting its implementation were identified, most significantly the Closing the Gap Indigenous Reform Agenda, which was introduced halfway through the implementation of the plan in 2008.300 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Development of a new ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan has commenced. This will incorporate what was learnt in the review of the previous plan, as well as outstanding action items identified as ongoing strategies requiring implementation by the Health Forum. The new plan will also be informed by the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes and will seek to form linkages with these other national health-related plans developed in 2013: National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social and Emotional Wellbeing Plan National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Strategy National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Blood-Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmissible Infections Strategy National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Drug Strategy. In July 2012, ACT Health launched its three-year Reconciliation Action Plan 2012-2015 . The plan has a range of actions to bring about change and create a health environment that is culturally sensitive, where staff are aware that closing the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander life expectancy is an important part of our organisation's business. ACT Health's Reconciliation Action Plan Working Group and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Coordination Group provided support and guidance on the development of the plan. Consultations were undertaken internally with ACT Health line areas and externally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders. Effective environment health systems Infrastructure, water sanitation, fresh food and housing are of a consistently high standard in the ACT when compared to those of rural and remote environments. The ACT Government funds a range of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and mainstream programs which ensure access to and availability of appropriate healthy living environments. Economic participation and development ACT Health progressed the development of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018 that responds directly to: the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework 2011-2015 ; and the ACT Public Service Employment Strategy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People\u2014Building a culturally diverse workforce 2010 . The plan is formally linked to ACT Health's Workforce Plan 2013-2018 and was endorsed by ACT Health's Executive Council in June 2013. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Support Network continued to provide support and advice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff employed in the health workforce and included members from ACT Health, ACT Medicare Local, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service, Gugan Gulwan Youth Aboriginal Corporation and Calvary Health Care ACT. An Employment Inclusion Officer continued to facilitate ACT Health's involvement in the ACT Public Service Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traineeship Program. In the July 2012 intake for the program, ACT Health employed four trainees. All trainees were assigned ACT Government mentors. ACT Health implemented an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Awareness and Skills Development Program in line with its Essential Education Policy. The training consists of three elements: staff orientation, an e-learning module and a skills development workshop. In 2012-13, 1,033 health staff participated in staff orientation sessions and 991 staff completed the e-learning module and quiz. An evaluation of the pilot workshops was completed to inform the content and delivery of future workshops.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 301 C.22 ACT Multicultural Strategy 2010-2013 A new Multicultural Health Policy Unit has been established and will commence operations from 1 July 2013. The unit will be placed alongside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Unit within the Policy and Government Relations Branch. The Multicultural Health Policy Unit will provide guidance across ACT Health to ensure that all ACT Health services (including primary health care, clinical health services and population programs, including health promotion and prevention) are delivered in culturally safe and appropriate ways. It is anticipated that all divisions and branches will work with the unit to: improve data collection; deliver culturally safe and appropriate services and information; engage culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) consumers in providing feedback and participating in service planning and evaluation; and develop the cultural competency of all staff. Focus area Progress LanguagesACT Health continued to promote service accessibility to people from multicultural backgrounds by promoting access to interpreter services. After a review involving significant consultation, the internal Migrant Health Unit, which provided in-house interpreting of Mandarin, Cantonese and Vietnamese, ceased operation in December 2012. All interpreting services are now accessed through the national Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS), and a revised standard operating procedure provides guidance on accessing this service. In 2012-13, expenditure on TIS telephone and on-site interpreting services totalled $410,000, with Mandarin, Arabic, Vietnamese and Cantonese interpreters most frequently accessed. Key Performance Indicator (KPI)\u2014That 100 per cent of ACT Government publications include accessibility block information\u2014that is, information in alternative formats such as other languages. One hundred per cent of ACT Health publications (but not all posters, because of space limitations) include 'accessibility block' information. Translated documents, including alternative formats such as large print or audio, can be requested by the client. The Office of Multicultural Affairs is informed accordingly. Health Promotion Grants were awarded to support the Health Care Consumers' Association Inc. for Health Literacy for All, a project to develop a series of health literacy modules, including modules in an e-learning format that include a 'translate' function so material can be accessed in community languages; and the introduction of a multicultural QUIT module and training local bilingual presenters to deliver it. The Health Protection Services finalised a food safety guide for businesses, which was translated into 11 languages to ensure food safety information was available to CALD communities. The guide provides comprehensive information about the most common food safety requirements. Guidelines for temporary food stalls were also developed and translated into 12 languages. The guidelines are designed to assist organisers of food stalls at outdoor events in the ACT to meet all food safety requirements. Children and young peopleHealth Promotion Grants supported Football United to deliver Empowered for Healthier Communities, which provides regular physical activity and leadership or life skills training for over 1,000 children and youth from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds in the West Belconnen and Dickson regions of the ACT. In 2012-13, refugee children and youth were a focus of the project. Adults, older people and aged careHealth Promotion Grants supported the Asian Women's Friendship Association to provide Stay Firm and Be Active for CALD Background Seniors, a program to provide seniors and their carers from CALD backgrounds, specifically those from Asian backgrounds, with informative and constructive weekly Tai Chi classes.302 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Focus area Progress WomenThe Health Directorate has continued to address the specific needs of women from multicultural backgrounds by: providing women's health services across the ACT to enhance access by women of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds delivering a women's health talk to 195 women at the CIT English as a Second Language course developing a project plan to increase liaison with cultural communities in which female circumcision is practised with identified funding, commencing recruitment to a part-time women's health nurse position to provide holistic health promotion on women's health, including the impact of female circumcision. Nursing, medical and counselling services are provided to women who experience significant barriers to accessing health services, including language and culture. KPI\u2014Proportion of clients attending Well Women's Checks at the Women's Health Service from multicultural backgrounds. In 2012-13, 266 CALD women (40 per cent of all clients) accessed this service. The BreastScreen ACT program has continued to address the specific needs of women from multicultural backgrounds by providing free breast screening services to all women in the ACT aged over 40. BreastScreen ACT recommends regular screening of the target group\u2014women aged 50 to 69 years\u2014which has been effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer through early detection. The program has implemented a recruitment plan (in consultation with multicultural representatives) with specific strategies that aim to increase the participation of women in this group. Work has also occurred to develop and produce general breast screening information brochures in Chinese, Vietnamese, Croatian, Greek, Italian and Spanish. KPI\u2014Percentage of women with multicultural backgrounds in the BreastScreen ACT program. In 2012-13, 767 CALD women (5.5 per cent of all clients) accessed the BreastScreen ACT service. Health Promotion Grants supported the Australian Breastfeeding Association ACT/SNSW to improve breastfeeding rates (initiation and duration) among specific target groups, including women from CALD backgrounds. This is done by delivering targeted peer support training programs and breastfeeding information sessions and increasing the number of establishments or organisations in the ACT that are Breast-Friendly Workplace accredited. ACT Health supported the Health Care Consumers' Association to employ a Consumer Coordinator/ Multicultural Liaison Officer in 2012-13 to facilitate involvement and perspective from consumers in the development of service planning for the Health Infrastructure Program. The Consumer Coordinator/ Multicultural Liaison Officer fostered networks with multicultural community organisations and diverse communities about the health system, particularly regarding the Health Infrastructure Program, consumer participation and health literacy, including the development of suitable information resources. Refugees, asylum seekers and humanitarian entrantsACT Health continued to seek to meet the needs of refugees, asylum seekers and humanitarian entrants by providing access to health and wellbeing services so that this target group can maintain their dignity and physical and mental health. It did so by: continuing to provide Medicare-ineligible asylum seekers with the same access as Health Care Card holders to public dental and community health services collaborating with the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and Citizenship in accommodating the housing and health care needs of 50 immigration detainees in the ACT community continuing to promote awareness of the ACT Services Access Card introduced for refugees in October 2011. The card is designed to provide access to services, without the need for refugees to re-tell their trauma or refugee story. Health Promotion Grants supported Arthritis ACT, incorporating Osteoporosis ACT, to deliver Lowering the Barriers, which involved finding representatives from a range of disadvantaged groups, including refugees, to share their life stories with one another in the context of workshops with one simple health message: 'You are the most important health provider for you.' Intercultural harmony and religious acceptanceACT Health promoted or conducted general programs for staff to enhance their understanding of the rights of their colleagues and clients. These initiatives included: Respect, Equity and Diversity (RED) training, and establishment of the RED contact officer network Human Rights Act training workshops on managing and preventing discrimination, bullying and harassment Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights training e-learning packages on managing work aggression and violence. The Health Directorate has implemented cultural awareness training for staff, to promote a caring and competent health workforce.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 303 C.23 ACT Strategic Plan for Positive Ageing 2010-2014 Focus area Progress Information and communicationACT Health promotion communication campaigns aim to reach a wide population, including seniors, to influence behaviour. Many messages are focused on preventing chronic disease. There has been local promotion of the national Measure Up and Swap It, Don't Stop It social marketing campaigns, including websites providing people with information on how they can change their lifestyles to become more active and have a healthy diet: www.measureup.gov.au and www.swapit.gov.au . The 'Beyond Today ... it's up to you ' campaign was developed to encourage healthy lifestyles and smoking cessation among the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Messages were designed to reach the elders in this community to facilitate behaviour change (www.health.act.gov.au/health- services/aboriginal-torres-strait-islander/information/beyond -today). The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service \u00ae (GHICS) is a free ACT Health telephone coaching service staffed by qualified health coaches and aimed at helping adults to make lifestyle changes regarding healthy eating, physical activity and how to reach and maintain a healthy weight. Between 1 July 2010 and ongoing. 18.4 per cent or nearly one in five people using the service were aged over 60 years and approximately two in five (40.1 per cent) were aged 50 or over. The 'Find an ACT health service' page includes up-to-date information about aged care health services in Canberra and surrounding regions ( www.health.act.gov.au/health-services/find -a-health-service ). Heart Foundation Heartmoves is a gentle physical activity program which receives funding through ACT Health. It is designed to be safe for people with stable long-term health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity and is suitable for anyone who has not exercised in a while. Two Heartmoves groups are based at Canberra Senior Centre in Turner. Heart Foundation Walking receives funding through ACT Health. The Heart Foundation supports Australians to lead active, healthy lives by encouraging them to join or start Heart Foundation Walking groups, which are fun and a great way to meet new people. Some walking groups target, among others, people aged over 50. 304 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Focus area Progress Health and wellbeingFunded by the ACT Government, Carers ACT released over 20 Mental Health E-bulletins for Carers in 2012-13. Carers ACT also held numerous forums for carers on such topics as: the second exposure draft of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act ending homelessness based on the common ground model the prevalence and disease burden of tobacco addiction on people living with mental health issues and research findings on implementing smoke-free policies in mental health services medicines and mental health carers navigating the mental health system. In addition, throughout the reporting period, Carers ACT hosted a moderated Mental Health Carers Voice Online Discussion Forum, which covered many topics relevant to carers. In the reporting period, 100 per cent of Mental Health Service committees had representation from consumers and carers. ACT Health is continuing to prepare for the introduction of an electronic medication management (EMM) solution, which will: support transparent communication of medication history across care settings; enable electronic prescribing, management and administration of medications; and support high-quality patient care through improved medication safety. Following a request for quotation, a preferred vendor was selected. Contract negotiations are underway. An implementation planning study and a review of high-level requirements will be undertaken prior to implementation of the EMM solution. ACT Health is continuing to work with the Department of Health and Ageing and the National E-Health Transition Authority in relation to the national PCEHR system. ACT Health began submitting discharge summaries to the national e-health record system on 22 March 2013. Healthcare consumers who are admitted to the Canberra Hospital are now asked to indicate whether they would like their discharge summary sent to their national e-health record. Consumers can change their preference at any time prior to discharge. ACT Health is working collaboratively with the Department of Health and Ageing to enable provision of an assisted registration service for ACT Health consumers. This would enable healthcare consumers to quickly and easily register for an e-health record. A discharge support Allied Health Assistant (AHA) was employed in the acute care of the elderly ward (11A) to facilitate the implementation of care plans and follow-on referrals for elderly clients discharged home from the hospital. The role of the 11A discharge support AHA is to: make contact with the client and carer/family while they are still in hospital and explore their needs after discharge ensure that the arranged services are implemented and appropriate liaise with the client and carer/family and provide further information post-discharge work with the occupational therapy team in assessing the need and provision of equipment after discharge. The 11A discharge support AHA has supported many clients to return home. In 2012-13, the 11A discharge support AHA received 179 referrals and conducted 731 occasions of service. The Respecting Patient Choices (RPC) program works with community agencies and groups, peak bodies and other government agencies to promote and improve the uptake of Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the ACT. A total of 298 advance care plans were processed through the program. A total of 215 consumer consultations/referrals and information queries/packs were undertaken or processed through the program. Over 26 RPC/ACP presentations were given to ACT Health, community and professional groups. The RPC program participated in the COTA Seniors Expo at EPIC on Thursday, 21 March 2013. The RPC program staff were invited to participate in a Local Hospital Network sponsored End of Life Issues and Decision-Making Community Engagement Forum, held on the 4 May 2013. The RPC program hosted two facilitator training workshops and 14 participants completed their training. A facilitator peer education group was also hosted, with five attending.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 305 Focus area Progress Health and wellbeing (continued)The RPC submitted a successful budget proposal for increased RPC program resources to enhance and improve the uptake of ACP in the ACT. The RPC program negotiated a successful partnership arrangement with Medicare Local ACT to support and promote advance care planning to the wider ACT community and health professionals. Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care provide a Falls and Falls Injury Prevention Assessment Clinic. This is a free ACT Health service targeting people over the age of 65, or 55 years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who are at high risk of falling. Falls Prevention Clinics are designed to provide a multi- disciplinary assessment and intervention service. Clinic staff work with older adults to assess individual fall risks and provide a comprehensive falls reduction plan. The clinic health professional team comprises a registered nurse, occupational therapist and physiotherapist. Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care also provides Stepping On, a seven-week program run three to four times per year for people over the age of 70 who are active and well but fear falling or have previously had a fall. The program focuses on exercise, education and preventative strategies. It is also staffed by a multi-disciplinary team, including an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist and other educators. In 2012-13, the Falls and Falls Injury Prevention Service continued to promote falls awareness through involvement in community expos, including the Seniors Week expo, as well as running a month-long initiative at the Canberra Hospital and community health centres to link in with the New South Wales April Falls Day initiative. These activities promoted the service through access to falls prevention staff and the provision of fact sheets for community, clients and staff. The Falls and Falls Injury Prevention Service has commenced a joint initiative with the community Renal Service to provide targeted falls prevention advice to people receiving dialysis in community settings. In 2012-13, 488 people were assessed in falls clinics.

The BreastScreen program provides free breast screening services to all women in the ACT aged over 40. Work has occurred to develop and produce general breast screening information brochures in Chinese, Vietnamese, Croatian, Greek, Italian and Spanish. In 2012-13, 767 CALD women (5.5 per cent of all clients) accessed the ACT BreastScreen service. ACT Health is implementing Element 2 of the Council of Australian Governments' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Early Childhood Development National Partnership Agreement's antenatal care, pre-pregnancy and teenage sexual and reproductive health project. This includes implementing the Core of Life reality-based education program for young people on pregnancy and parenting and supporting sexual health information and education activities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people. ACT Health funds the Women's Centre for Health Matters, which provides support to conduct research related to women experiencing disadvantage, social exclusion and isolation\u2014for example, Women with Disabilities ACT and the Women and Prisons Group. Karralika Programs Inc. supports adults and their families through a range of alcohol and drug programs. Karralika offers access to subsidised childcare for parents undertaking their programs from Communities@Work. The arrangement with Communities@Work was established a number of years ago, when Karralika Programs Inc. ceased to provide childcare internally. ACT Health is actively looking at opportunities to improve access to subsidised childcare for parents undertaking drug treatment programs in the ACT. The Women's Health Service gives priority to women who experience significant barriers to health service access. The ACT Healthcare Survey includes a section on results by gender. The questions cover being treated with respect, respect for privacy, respect for cultural, social or religious needs, personal safety, and ease of access to consumer information. Survey results guide service improvement. Canberra Hospital and Health Services participated in a benchmarking study for inpatients through Best Practice Australia in February 2013. The two separate surveys measured information related to the new National Safety and Quality Standards and asked a series of questions related to patient experience, including patients' greatest expectations and how they rate those expectations. ACT Health is making consistent progress towards the agreed milestones of the National Perinatal Depression Initiative (NPDI). Progress and improvements against all outputs in the implementation plan are on track, with no significant risks or issues emerging. ACT NPDI activities continue to support maternity services, including the community-based Maternal and Child Health Service, the Antenatal Clinic, Continuum of Care at the Canberra Hospital, the Canberra Midwifery Program at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, Canberra Hospital, the Calvary Health Care Maternity Unit, Mental Health Services and related non-government services. 308 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Health also funds the Pre- and Ante-natal Depression Support and Information Service (PANDSI) to provide psychosocial support and information for women at risk of perinatal depression. The Perinatal Mental Health Consultation Service (PMHCS) is a consultation and referral service for women with moderate to severe mental health presentations in the perinatal period. The PMHCS is a tertiary service that provides specialist opinion and treatment planning for expectant and postnatal women for up to 12 months postpartum. The service aims to improve perinatal mental health by working in collaboration with existing antenatal and postnatal services and other community health agencies. Psychiatry clinics, staffed by a multidisciplinary health professional team, provide structured therapies for women likely to benefit from a time- limited psychological approach. PMHCS has implemented an Outreach Assessment Clinic linked to the Antenatal Clinic at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, Canberra Hospital. A PMHCS health specialist provides assessments for referred women who are unlikely to engage over the telephone or attend the PMHCS. This initiative also serves to strengthen the skills and knowledge of midwives at the clinic in perinatal mental health issues. Trauma-informed care seminars for health professionals: The Women's Health Service provides interprofessional and holistic medical, nursing and counselling services for women affected by violence. The ACT Health Family Violence policy was developed for implementation in 2013-14. Environmental priority Strategic outcome Women and girls equally and fully participate in planning and sharing a safe, accessible and sustainable city. Nil response from ACT Health. Improving women's access to health care services and information: A strategic framework 2010-2015 Improving women's access to health care services and information: A strategic framework 2010-2015 informs the directions for the delivery of health services to ACT women up to 2015. Improving women's access to health care services and information benefits not only women but also the whole community through the diverse roles that women play. For disadvantaged and vulnerable women, improving access to health services is a significant contributor to improved health outcomes. The Women's Health Advisory Group, which comprises key community and consumer members, oversees implementation of the framework. Highlights in 2012-13 are set out below. ACT Health is implementing triple bottom line annual reporting, including, where appropriate, gender impact statements. The national Pregnancy, Birth and Baby website is being enhanced and will include ACT-specific links to maternity information. The ACT Maternity Services Advisory Network is guiding the implementation of action in the national Maternity Services Plan and advising on priorities and improvements to maternity care in the region. The Centenary Hospital for Women and Children opened in 2012. The new hospital co-locates services, including paediatrics, maternity services, the neonatal intensive care unit, gynaecology, foetal medicine, the birth centre and specialised outpatient services, in a purpose-built three-storey building. Antenatal care, pre-pregnancy and teenage sexual and reproductive health (APTSRH) project: the Core of Life realities-based life education program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth is well established across the ACT. Negotiations are underway to offer sexual health information, education and clinical services to young people in the coming year. National Perinatal Depression Initiative (NPDI): ACT Health services continue to offer routine and universal screening using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale for PND at antenatal and postnatal visits. In September 2012, ACT Health achieved Breastfeeding-Friendly Workplace accreditation.Section C Legislative and policy-based reporting 309 C.25 Model Litigant Guidelines The Health Directorate is committed to upholding the principles of the Model Litigant Guidelines by acting honestly, fairly and with propriety in the conduct of all civil claims and litigation, arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution processes. The Health Directorate understands its role as a model litigant and places significant emphasis on maintaining effective communication with healthcare consumers who have complaints about, or have suffered adverse outcomes as a result of, treatment in the public health service. Open communication may also minimise the need for consumers to seek resolution of complaints or claims through formal legal avenues. The Health Directorate is committed to responding to complaints about public sector health services in a timely and systematic manner. Complaints are a valuable part of the quality improvement system, which aims to optimise patient care and safety, promote positive system changes and ensure resolution of the complaint to the satisfaction of the consumer, where possible. Consumers are invited to provide feedback about the care they received at the point of service, or by telephone, letter, email or through the Health Directorate internet site. The Health Directorate has an independent Consumer Feedback and Engagement Team (CFET) and ensures that all consumer feedback is responded to and resolved, where possible, in a timely manner. The CFET acknowledges consumer complaints within five working days, coordinates investigations and aims to inform the consumer of the outcome within 35 calendar days. If the consumer is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, the consumer is advised of assistance available though the ACT Human Rights Commission (HRC). The HRC provides an independent means for dealing with complaints about health services through the Health Services Commissioner. In some instances, an alternative method of dispute resolution such as conciliation is considered. This involves the HRC acting as an impartial third party to help the consumer and health staff clarify issues and resolve matters raised in a complaint. Sometimes, in resolving a complaint, a financial settlement may be considered and agreed to in a formally binding agreement, reducing the risk of complaints developing into legal claims and thereby reducing claim costs for both parties. The Health Directorate acknowledges that early resolution of a claim not only can have benefits for the plaintiff's health and wellbeing but also reduces the costs associated with litigation. The Health Directorate is committed to working with the ACT Government Solicitor (ACTGS) to ensure that its conduct in matters that progress to litigation is timely, efficient, effective and in accordance with the Model Litigant Guidelines. It is important to note that, while the obligation to comply with the Model Litigant Guidelines is conferred on the agency, the ACTGS acts on behalf of the Health Directorate in all litigation and provides advice in accordance with the obligations applying under the Law Officers Act 2011 . The ACTGS has advised that it is not aware of any breaches of the Model Litigant Guidelines in Health Directorate matters during 2012-13.310 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 C.26 Notices of non-compliance In 2012-13 the Health Directorate did not receive any notices of non-compliance in relation to the Dangerous Substances Act 2004 . Five notices of non-compliance were issued in relation to the Work Health and Safety Act 2011: Notice 5824 was issued on 14 August 2012 to the Director-General of the ACT Health Directorate. Worksafe ACT has advised that it is satisfied that all the requirements have been met and that the notice has been complied with. The notice required the directorate to review and amend its work safety systems to ensure that, if any further notifiable incidents occur at the Canberra Hospital, the incident site is not disturbed until an inspector arrives at the site or any earlier time the inspector directs. This does not prevent any actions prescribed by section 39(3) of the Act. Notice 5825 was issued on 14 August 2012 to the Director-General of the ACT Health Directorate. Worksafe ACT has advised that it is satisfied that all the requirements have been met and that the notice has been complied with. The notice required the directorate to ensure that the regulator is notified immediately, by the fastest possible means, after becoming aware that a notifiable incident out of the conduct of the business or undertaking has occurred at the Canberra Hospital. Notice 6072 was issued on 3 May 2013 to the Executive Director, Business and Infrastructure of the ACT Health Directorate. Worksafe ACT advised on 27 June 2013 that it is satisfied that all the requirements have been met and that the notice has been complied with. The notice directed the Health Directorate to implement control measures at the Canberra Hospital to eliminate or minimise risks to health and safety associated with the use of electrical equipment supplied through a socket outlet. These measures include installing appropriate residual current devices (RCD) to switchboards or portable RCD cord sets/plug adapters until switchboards have been upgraded. All reasonable steps must also be taken to ensure that the RCDs used at the workplace are tested regularly by a competent person to ensure they are operating effectively. Notice 6073 was issued on 3 May 2013 to the Executive Director, Business and Infrastructure of the ACT Health Directorate. Worksafe ACT advised on 27 June 2013 that it is satisfied that all the requirements have been met and that the notice has been complied with. The notice required the directorate to have a competent person undertake an electrical audit of the food preparation area and bio-medical workshop as a matter of urgency and disconnect (or isolate) any unsafe electrical equipment from the electrical supply until it is repaired or tested and found to be safe. Notice 6074 was issued on 3 May 2013 to the Executive Director, Business and Infrastructure of the ACT Health Directorate. Worksafe ACT advised on 27 June 2013 that it is satisfied that all the requirements have been met and that the notice has been complied with. The notice required the directorate implement control measures at the Canberra Hospital to eliminate or minimise risks to health and safety associated with the use of electrical equipment supplied through a socket outlet.

The ACT Local Hospital Network receives Activity Based Funding from both the Commonwealth and the ACT Governments and Block Funding including training and research. The ACT Local Hospital Network purchases public hospital services from four ACT public hospital providers: Canberra Hospital and Health Services; Calvary Public Hospital; Clare Holland House; and Queen Elizabeth II Hospital. Changes in administrative structure The ACT Local Hospital Network commenced operation on 1 July 2012 and is administered by the Director-General of the Health Directorate and supported by Health Directorate staff. Risk management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risks that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate: Estimated public hospital activity is higher than the actual activity delivered by the entities in the ACT Local Hospital Network that results in a reduction to funding from the Commonwealth Government; and The Commonwealth Government revises the National Healthcare Specific Purpose Payment for 2013-14. The Specific Purpose Payment funding can change due to population estimates and indexation factors. The Government and the Directorate have responded to these risks by including in the implementation of the National Health Reform Agreement two years of transition with the Commonwealth Government funding contribution limited to the Specific Purpose Payment in 2012-13 and 2013-14. The Commonwealth Government will fund 45 per cent of the growth in public hospital activity from 2014-15 and the ACT Government and the Directorate will agree on the process for managing fluctuation in activity and costs from 2014-15 during development of the budget. In the event that there is a material reduction to the Commonwealth Government Specific Purpose Payment during 2013-14, the Directorate will consider alternative funding options including working with the Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate as necessary. The above risks are monitored regularly throughout the year.Annexed Reports 315 Financial performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 2012-13, and the forward estimates contained in the 2013-14 Budget Paper Number 4. Total net cost of services 594.2 Comparison to budget The Directorate's net cost of services for 2012-13 of $548.8 million was $119.7 million or 27.9 per cent higher than the 2012-13 budget (refer to Attachment A). The increase relates to delays in the enactment of legislation to enable the establishment of the Local Hospital Network's National Health Funding Pool bank account. As a result of the delays in legislation, Commonwealth Government funding which was to be received as Own Source Revenue was instead paid to the Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate and on-passed to the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate as Government Payment for Outputs. Comparison to 2011-12 actual expenses The Directorate began operations in 2012-13 so there are no comparisons for 2011-12.

Grants and Purchased Services 99.3% Other expenses 0.7% Figure 2: Components of Expenditure Comparison to budget Total expenses of $713.8 million were ($4.9 million), or 0.7 per cent lower than the original 2012-13 budget of $718.7 million. This variation was predominantly due to: a reduction in Commonwealth Government National Healthcare funding of $3.1 million associated with population and indexation factors, and a change to the method for Cross Border Health payments between States and Territories. Under the new arrangements, the Commonwealth Government funded component of cross border activity is subtracted from the residents State/Territory's National Healthcare Specific Purpose Payment and paid to the provider State/Territory. Comparison to 2011-12 actual expenses The Directorate began operations in 2012-13 so there are no comparisons for 2011-12. Future trends Expenses are budgeted to steadily increase until 2015-16.Annexed Reports 317 Total revenue Components of revenue Figure 3 below indicates that for the financial year ended 30 June 2013, the Directorate received 77.2 per cent of its total revenue of $725.3 million from Government Payment for Outputs ($560.3 million), 11.5 per cent from Cross Border User Charges ($83.3 million), with the remaining 11.3 per cent made up of Grants from the Commonwealth ($81.7 million). User Charges 11.5%Grants from the Commonwealth 11.3% Government Payment for Outputs 77.2% Figure 3: Components of Own Source Revenue Comparison to budget Own source revenue for the year ending 30 June 2013 was $165.0 million, which was $124.6 million or 43.0 per cent lower than the 2012-13 budget of $289.6 million. The reduction is due to delays in the enactment of legislation to enable the establishment of the Local Hospital Network's National Health Funding Pool bank account. As a result of the delays in legislation, Commonwealth Government funding which was to be received as own source revenue was instead paid to the Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate and on-passed to the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate as Government Payment for Outputs. In addition, there was a reduction in Commonwealth Government National Healthcare funding of $3.1 million associated with population and indexation factors. Comparison to 2011-12 actual income The Directorate began operations in 2012-13 so there are no comparisons for 2011-12. Future trends Total own source revenue is expected to increase steadily until 2015-16.318 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Financial position The purpose of the Directorate is to receive Activity Based and Block Funding from the National Health Funding Pool created under the National Health Reform Agreement, and to purchase hospital services from ACT public hospitals. The ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate was never intended to have assets nor liabilities on its balance sheet, therefore no budget was set. Total assets Components of total assets Figure 4 below indicates that, as at 30 June 2013, the Directorate held 97.3 per cent of its assets in receivables. Receivables 97.3%Cash and Cash Equivalents 2.7% Figure 4: Total Assets as at 30 June 2013 Comparison to budget The total asset position as at 30 June 2013 is $86.8 million, which is $86.8 million higher than the 2012-13 budget of $0 million. The variance reflects the increase in: Cash and Cash Equivalents ($2.3 million) \u2014due to the provision of a cash buffer from Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate to allow for the timing of Goods and Services Tax (GST) transactions; and Receivables ($84.5 million)\u2014which relates to the cross border receivables from New South Wales and an Australian Taxation Office refund for GST. Comparison to 2011-12 actual The Directorate began operations in 2012-13 so there are no comparisons for 2011-12.Annexed Reports 319 Total liabilities Components of total liabilities Figure 5 below indicates that 100 per cent of the Directorate's liabilities relates to payables. Payables 100% Figure 5: Total Liabilities as at 30 June 2013 Comparison to budget The Directorate's liabilities as at 30 June 2013, of $71.8 million, is $71.8 million higher than the 2012-13 budget of $0 million. This is due to higher payables ($71.8 million) which relates to cross border payments to the New South Wales Government and the ACT Health Directorate. Comparison to 2011-12 actual The Directorate began operations in 2012-13 so there are no comparisons for 2011-12. Net assets The Directorate's net assets as at 30 June 2013 was $15.0 million higher than the nil position budgeted. This is mainly due to cross border revenue of $114.1 million being higher than the budget of $102.6 million, and capital injection of $3.5 million to cover timing of GST refunds from the Australian Taxation Office.320 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Attachment A\u2014Comparison of net cost of services to budget 2012-13 Original BudgetPlus AAO TransfersTotal Funding Less $'000 $'000 Revenue User Charges 120,000 - 120,000 83,300 36,700 30.58% Grants from Commonwealth 169,605 - 169,605 81,695 87,910 51.83% Other Revenue - - - - - - Total Own Source Revenue 289,605 - 289,605 164,995 124,610 43.03% Total 429,135 548,755 - 119,620 -27.87%Annexed Reports 321 322 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Annexed Reports 323 324 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Annexed Reports 325 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Controlled Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Operating Statement For the Year Ended 30 June 2013 Note No.Actual 2013 $'000Original Budget 2013 $'000 Income Revenue Government Payment for Outputs 3 560,272 429,135 User Charges - Non-ACT Government 4 83,300 120,000 Grants from the Commonwealth 5 81,695 169,605 Total Revenue 725,267 718,740 Total Income 725,267 718,740 and Purchased Services 6 708,909 696,592 Other Expensesa- 17,418 Transfer Expenses Expenses 713,751 718,740 Operating Surplus 11,516 - Total Comprehensive Income 11,516 - The above Operating Statement should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.

Column Heading Explanations The Original Budget column shows the amounts that appear in the Cash Flow Statement in the Budget Papers. This amount also appears in the Cash Flow Statement. The Total Appropriated column is inclusive of all appropriation variations occurring after the Original Budget. The Appropriation Drawn is the total amount of appropriation received by the Directorate during the year. This amount appears in the Cash Flow Statement. Variances between 'Original Budget' and 'Total Appropriated' Government Payment for Outputs The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated to the Directorate is due to delays in enacting legislation, the Health (National Health Funding Pool and Administration) Act 2013 , to establish the ACT State Pool account under the National Health Reform Agreement. The delays in establishing the ACT State Pool Account resulted in Grants from the Commonwealth under the National Health Reform Agreement (including a component of cross border revenue) not being able to be received by the Directorate. This amount was paid to the Chief Minister and Treasury Directorate until March 2013, amounting to $131.1 million, which was then paid to the Directorate as Government Payment for Outputs. Capital Injection The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated to the Directorate is due to the need for provision of a cash buffer to deal with the delay between outflows of GST and the receiving of input tax credits from the Australian Taxation Office.330 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Controlled Note Index Note 1 Objectives of the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Notes Note 3 Government Payment for Outputs Note 4 User Charges - Non-ACT Government Note 5 Grants from the Commonwealth Expense Notes Note 6 Grants and Purchased Services Note 7 Transfer Expenses Note 8 Auditor's Remuneration Note 9 Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs Note 10 Act of Grace Payments Asset Notes Note 11 Cash and Cash Equivalents Note 12 Receivables Liabilities Notes Note 13 Payables Other Notes Note 14 Financial Instruments Note 15 Commitments Note 16 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Note 17 Events Occurring After Balance Date Note 18 Cash Flow Reconciliation Note 19 Service Concession AssetsAnnexed Reports 331 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 1. Objectives of the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Operations and Principal Activities In 2011 the ACT Government become a signatory to the National Health Reform Agreement which introduced new financial and governance arrangements for Australian public hospital services and new arrangements for primary health care and aged care. On 29 March 2011, the ACT Government took the first step toward implementing the ACT Local Hospital Network when the ACT Legislative Assembly passed amendments to the Health Act 1993 . These amendments provided a legislative basis for the establishment of the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate (the Directorate) and a skill-based ACT Local Hospital Council (Council). The Directorate commenced operation on 1 July 2012 and is administrated by the Director-General of the Health Directorate and supported by Health Directorate staff. The Council provides advice to the Director-General on the clinical and corporate governance framework needed to support improvement of standards of patient care and services under the local hospital network and ways in which to support, encourage and facilitate community and clinician involvement in the planning of services that form part of the Directorate. The Council also reports to the Minister for Health on the state of the local hospital network and any recommendations relating to the improvement of health services provided by the Directorate that the Council considers necessary. The Directorate receives Activity Based Funding from the Commonwealth and ACT Governments and block funding for teaching, training and research. It purchases public hospital services from four ACT public hospital providers: Canberra Hospital and Health Services; Calvary Public Hospital; Clare Holland House; and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre.332 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Accounting The Financial Management Act 1996 (FMA) requires the preparation of annual financial statements for ACT Government Agencies. The FMA and the Financial Management Guidelines issued under the Act, requires the Directorate's financial statements to include: i. an Operating Statement for the year; ii. a Balance Sheet at the end of the year; iii. a Statement of Changes in Equity for the year; iv. a Cash Flow Statement for the year; v. a Statement of Appropriation for the year; vi. an Operating Statement for each class of output for the year; vii. a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted for the year; and viii. such other statements as are necessary to fairly reflect the financial operations of the Directorate during the year and its financial position at the end of the year. These general-purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' (GAAP) as required by the FMA. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i. Australian Accounting Standards; and ii. ACT Accounting and Disclosure Policies. The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises the effects of transactions and events when they occur. The financial statements have also been prepared according to the historical cost convention. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Directorate's functional currency. The Directorate is an individual reporting entity. (b) Controlled and Territorial Items The Directorate produces Controlled financial statements. The Controlled financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities over which the Directorate has control. The Directorate does not produce Territorial financial statements because it does not administer any resources on behalf of the Territory. (c) The Reporting Period These financial statements state the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Directorate for the year ending 30 June 2013 together with the financial position of the Directorate as at 30 June 2013.Annexed Reports 333 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (d) Comparative Figures Budget Figures To facilitate a comparison with Budget Papers, as required by the Financial Management Act 1996, budget information for 2012-2013 has been presented in the financial statements. Budget numbers in the financial statements are the original budget numbers that appear in the Budget Papers. Prior Year Comparatives Comparative information are not provided because the Directorate commenced operations on 1 July 2012. (e) Rounding All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($'000). Use of the \"-\" symbol represents zero amounts or amounts rounded up or down to zero. (f) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the Operating Statement. All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Directorate and the revenue can be reliably measured. In addition, the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Cross Border (Interstate) Health Revenue Revenue for cross border (interstate) health services is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of treatments provided can be measured reliably using the National Efficient price that is determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised is accounted for in the year of settlement. The National Health Reform Agreement specifies that each jurisdiction will make funding contributions through the National Health Funding Pool for services provided by other jurisdictions to its residents either on an ad hoc basis reflecting actual activity, or on a regular basis as scheduled through a Cross Border agreement. Commonwealth Grants Commonwealth Grants relate to Activity Based Funding and Block Funding under the National Health Reforms. They also include the Commonwealth funding component of cross border health costs for New South Wales residents treated in ACT public hospitals. Activity Based Funding refers to a system for funding public hospital services provided to individual patients using national classifications, price weights and nationally efficient price as set by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Block funding is provided to support public hospital functions that are recognised by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority as services acceptable to be funded on this basis and that conform to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's national pricing model. Commonwealth grants in 2012-13 were based on the former National Healthcare Specific Purpose Payment method. Commonwealth funding to states and territories becomes uncapped and will be informed by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's pricing model from 2014-15.334 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (g) Waivers of Debt Debts that are waived during the year under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996 are expenses during the year in which the right to payment was waived. Further details of waivers are disclosed at Note 9: Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs. (h) Current and Non-Current Items Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheet and in the relevant notes. Assets are classified as current where they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date or when the Directorate does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Assets or liabilities which do not fall within the current classification are classified as non-current. (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet, cash includes cash at bank and cash on hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. ( j) Receivables Accounts receivable are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. Accrued Cross Border revenue relates to the estimated number of New South Wales patients treated in an ACT public hospital for the 2012-13 financial year. Under the National Health Reform Agreement, States and Territories are required to pay for Cross Border activity using the National Efficient Price that is determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. The actual level of revenue will be subject to an acquittal process to be completed in subsequent years. The allowance for impairment losses represents the amount of receivables the Directorate estimates will not be repaid. The allowance for impairment losses is based on objective evidence and a review of overdue balances. The Directorate considers the following is objective evidence of impairment: becoming aware of financial difficulties of debtors; default payments; or debts more than 90 days overdue. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets' carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. The allowance for impairment losses are written back against the receivables account when the Directorate ceases action to collect the debt as it considers that it will cost more to recover the debt than the debt is worth. Receivables that have been renegotiated because they are past due or impaired are accounted for based on the renegotiated terms.Annexed Reports 335 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (k) Payables Payables are a financial liability and are measured at the fair value of the consideration received when initially recognised and at amortised cost subsequent to initial recognition, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. All amounts are normally settled within 30 days after the invoice date. (l) Employee Costs and Employee Benefits Liabilities The Directorate was established as a consequence of the ACT implementing the National Health Reform Agreement. The objective of the Directorate is to receive Activity Based Funding and Block Funding from the Commonwealth and ACT Governments, and to purchase hospital services from ACT public hospitals. The Directorate does not employ any staff. All staff providing administrative support are employed by the Health Directorate. Therefore, the Directorate does not incur any employee costs and does not have any employee benefit liabilities. (m) Equity Contributed by the ACT Government Contributions made by the ACT Government, through its role as owner of the Directorate, are treated as contributions of equity. Increases or decreases in net assets as a result of Administrative Restructures are also recognised in equity. (n) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Directorate has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements: Cross Border (Interstate) Health Receivables: is an estimation based on the number of interstate patients converted into a National Weighted Activity Unit and paid at the National Efficient Price consistent with the National Health Reform Agreement. Interstate patient numbers for the current year is an estimation based on the actual patient numbers for the nine months to 31 March 2013. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement.336 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (o) Impact of Accounting Standards Issued but Yet to be Applied The following new and revised accounting standards and interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but do not apply to the current reporting period. These standards and interpretations are applicable to future reporting periods. The Directorate does not intend to adopt these standards and interpretations early. Where applicable, these Australian Accounting Standards will be adopted from their application date. It is estimated that the effect of adopting the below financial statement pronouncements, when applicable, will have no material financial impact on the Directorate's financial statements in future reporting periods: AASB 9 Financial Instruments (application date 1 January 2015); AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (application date 1 January 2013); AASB 1055 Budgetary Reporting (application date 1 July 2014); AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 2010) [AASB 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 112, 118, 120, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 136, 137, 139, 1023 & 1038 and Interpretations 2, 5, 10, 12, 19 & 127] (application date 1 January 2015); AASB 2011-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Consolidation and Joint Arrangements Standards [AASB 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2009-11, 101, 107, 112, 118, 121, 124, 132, 133, 136, 138, 139, 1023 & 1038 and Interpretations 5, 9, 16 & 17] (application date 1 January 2013 for for-profit entities and 1 January 2014 for not-for-profit entities); AASB 2011-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 13 [AASB 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2009-11, 101, 107, 112, 118, 119, 120, 121, 128, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 1004, 1023 & 1038 and Interpretations 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 131 & 132] (application date 1 January 2013); AASB 2011-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 119 (September 2011) [AASB 1, AASB 8, date 1 January 2013); AASB 2012-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities [AASB 7 & AASB 132] (application date 1 January 2013); AASB 2012-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities [AASB 132] (application date 1 January 2014); AASB 2012-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle [AASB 1, AASB 1010, AASB 116, AASB 132 & AASB 2] (application date 1 January 2013); AASB 2012-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Mandatory Effective Date AASB 9 and Transition Disclosures [AASB 9, AASB 2009-11, 2013); AASB 2012-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Transition Guidance and Other Amendments [AASB 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 119, 127, 128, 132, 133, 134, 137, 1023, 1038, 1039, 1049 & 2011-7 and January 2013); and AASB 2013-3 Amendments to AASB 136 - Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (application date 1 January 2014).Annexed Reports 337 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 3.

Note 9. Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs Under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996 , the Treasurer may, in writing, waive the right to payment of an amount payable to the Territory. A waiver is the relinquishment of a legal claim to a debt over which the Directorate has control. The write-off of a debt is the accounting action taken to remove a debt from the books but does not relinquish the legal right of the Directorate to recover the amount. The write-off of debts may occur for reasons other than waivers. The Directorate had no waivers, impairment losses or write-offs.Annexed Reports 339 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 10. Act of Grace Payments Under Section 130 of the Financial Management Act 1996 the Treasurer may, in writing, authorise Act of Grace Payments to be made by a Directorate. Act of Grace Payments are a method of providing equitable remedies to entities or individuals that may have been unfairly disadvantaged by the ACT Government but have no legal claim to the payment. The Directorate made no Act of Grace Payments during the reporting period. Note 11. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Directorate holds a number of bank accounts on which it does not earn interest.

Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate is considered to have no exposure to interest rate risk, as it holds only cash and cash equivalents with Westpac Bank that generate no interest, and receivables are non-interest bearing. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the interest rate risk of the Directorate as it is not exposed to movements in interest rates. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets held less any allowance for impairment. The Directorate's financial assets consist of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are held with the Westpac Banking Corporation, a high credit, quality financial institution, in accordance with whole of ACT Government banking arrangements and the Directorate holds no investments. The Directorate's receivables consist of amounts owed from the New South Wales Ministry of Health. As the New South Wales Government has a AAA credit rating it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for these receivables. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is appropriation from the ACT Government which is paid on a fortnightly basis during the year. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting appropriation drawdown requirements to enable payment of anticipated obligations. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no financial instruments that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken.Annexed Reports 343 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2013Note 14.

Service Concession Assets The Directorate has entered into an agreement with Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for the provision of hospital and associated services. The original agreement was entered into by the Commonwealth on 22 October 1971 and does not stipulate any expiry date. This was subsequently amended in 1979 to include the Directorate (named at the time as Capital Territory Health Commission) with any duties or functions of the Commonwealth being transferred to the Directorate. The Agreement was for the facility to be used for a public hospital. This was varied, in 1988, by the Calvary Private Agreement to allow Calvary Health Care Ltd to use two floors of the facility for treating private patients. The Calvary Private Agreement sets the process and mechanism for Calvary Private to reimburse Calvary Public for any costs incurred in using public hospital facilities for treating private patients. These agreements were replaced on 7 December 2011 with the Calvary Network Agreement. Under the agreement, Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd is required to provide hospital services and make these services available to all persons irrespective of their circumstances and is to charge patients fees only in accordance with the scale of fees applicable at Health Directorate hospitals for comparable services. In the event that the agreement ceases, all land is to be returned to the Territory. The level of services that is required to be provided in a financial year, for the amount of funding provided, is stipulated in a Performance Plan agreed between the Directorate and Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for each year. The amount of funding provided for in the 2012-13 financial year was $167.8 million in recurrent funding, recognised in the Health Directorate's ($14.7 million) and ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate's ($153.1 million) grants and purchased services expenditure, and $0.7 million for capital upgrades of assets subject to these service concession arrangements. This is recognised as Territorial grants expenditure. The land, hospital buildings and other assets comprising the Calvary Public Hospital are not recognised in the Directorate's Balance Sheet.346 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate Statement of PerformanceAnnexed Reports 347 348 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Annexed Reports 349 Output Class 1: ACT Local Hospital Network Description The ACT Local Hospital Network receives funding under National Health Reform Agreement and purchases public hospital services from Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House and Queen Elizabeth II Hospital.

ACT Local Hospital Network strategic indicators On 29 March 2011, the ACT Government took the first step towards implementing the ACT Local Hospital Network (ACT LHN) when the ACT Legislative Assembly passed amendments to the Health Act 1993 . These amendments provided a legislative basis for the establishment of the ACT LHN and a skill-based ACT LHN Council. The ACT LHN consists of a networked system that will hold service contracts with ACT Health. The ACT LHN comprises the Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House (CHH) and the Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre (QEII). Under the reforms outlined in the National Health Reform Agreement, the ACT Government will continue to manage system-wide public hospital service planning and performance, including the purchasing of public hospital services and capital planning, and will be responsible for the management of the performance of the ACT LHN.352 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Performance of the ACT LHN will be subject to a national performance framework (the Health Performance Framework) to be administered by the independent National Performance Authority. The framework will include a range of performance indicators that will be publicly available on the MyHospitals website and will outline a remediation process to be implemented for underperforming LHNs. The ACT and the Commonwealth have agreed to a networked service arrangement. This means the ACT Government will not have a single service agreement with the ACT LHN but will have four separate service agreements with each constituent entity of the ACT LHN. The following strategic indicators include some of the major performance benchmarks implemented by the Commonwealth Government under the requirements of the national health reforms. These initiatives include a range of performance benchmarks and governance arrangements to be met by states and territories.

It also has provisions for the interstate application of mental health laws, including for the transfer of people to and from the ACT. The Crimes Act 1900 provides for the court to order removal of an individual to the Canberra Hospital for the purposes of an emergency assessment to determine whether immediate treatment and care are required.

In 2012-13, 876 people were apprehended and brought to the Canberra Hospital for assessment. This is a decrease of 7 per cent from the previous year, when it was 942. This likely reflects the increasing level of mental health education provided to the police and other stakeholders. Emergency detention revocations have decreased from 389 to 363, a 7 per cent decrease in comparison to the same reporting period last year. This reflects efforts to move to least restrictive care at an early opportunity if at all possible. Notwithstanding this, there was a greater number of applications for extension of further involuntary detention (of up to seven days), indicating the treating team's efforts to continue to appropriately stabilise an acute episode of illness. Increased stability during an admission provides a greater chance of successful ongoing management when a person is discharged to the community. The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) granted 924 psychiatric treatment orders (PTO). This is an increase of 6 per cent from 2011-12. Upon application by a consultant psychiatrist, or of its own motion, ACAT revoked 127 orders, compared to 148 in the previous reporting period. Community psychiatry is proactive in management without orders where possible. There were 14 electro-convulsive therapy applications authorised, a negligible decrease from the previous year. There was only one application for emergency ECT made to the tribunal and after a full hearing and review this application was able to be revoked. Thus, for the 2012-13 year, no emergency ECT needed to be authorised by the tribunal under the provisions in Part 7 of the Act, introduced in 2005. Eight cross-border agreements were made between the ACT and New South Wales. The ACT accepted four transfers from New South Wales and four transfers were made to New South Wales facilities. Breach of PTOs increased from 76 to 82. This amounts to an increase of 7 per cent from 2011-12. Thirty-five people were brought to the Mental Health Assessment Unit for medication or assessment purposes. Community teams make every effort to anticipate and manage crises early. Often, if this is successful, a breach is not required. The ACT Magistrates Court made 40 referrals for assessment pursuant to section 309 of the Crimes Act 1900 , a decrease of 25 per cent from the previous year. Of these, 24 people required admission to the Adult Mental Health Unit for assessment purposes, with 16 being returned to court on the same day. The Court Liaison Service is often able to provide assessment and advice to the courts at the time of the hearing, which in some circumstances means that a section 309 referral is not required. The review of the current Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 continues, and a revised amendment bill is expected to be presented to cabinet before the end of 2013. Dr Peter Norrie Chief Psychiatrist356 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Human Research Ethics Committee Annual Report 2012-13 The ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) continues its work of reviewing human research projects to ensure they meet the ethical standards set out in the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007), prepared by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the Australian Research Council and the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee. During the reporting period, HREC contributed to the NHMRC consultation papers on the McKeon review. The HREC and its subcommittees strive to provide ethical review and approval in the shortest possible time, conscious of the pressures on researchers and their teams. During the reporting period, HREC improved on its previous average of 30 days. In 2012, the average time taken from submission to approval was 23.5 days. There were 115 full and 174 low-risk applications in 2012-13. HREC has continued to prepare for the advent of national programs of single ethical approval of multisite research and, in September 2012, achieved NHMRC certification to act as lead HREC in the single review system. The Human Research Ethics Manager, Ms August Marchesi, has continued to represent HREC and the ACT Health Directorate on the Jurisdictional Working Group that is progressing the single review system. By the end of 2013, the ACT expects to sign the memorandum of understanding with other jurisdictions which will mark the start of the national single review system. The Ethics Committee has introduced a new Social Research Subcommittee (SRSC). After preparations in 2012, membership was established and the first meeting held in February 2013. SRSC has proved to be a valuable addition to the HREC process. Applications involving social research, including data linkage and internet-based programs, are increasing, and HREC is grateful to have the advice of expert members of the SRSC. The Clinical Trials Subcommittee (CTSC) and the Survey Resource Group (SRG) have continued to provide HREC with expert advice on the merit and integrity of research proposals. June 2013 saw the resignation of Associate Professor Zsuzsoka Kecskes as Chair of SRG. Associate Professor Kecskes was a long-serving and dedicated chair and I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank her for her inestimable work in growing this group, as a valued resource to HREC and ACT Health. HREC membership includes a lawyer, female and male laypersons, a minister of religion, a psychologist, a member providing Indigenous knowledge and expertise, and senior clinicians from Canberra Hospital. The chairman is a former specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology, a former dean and postgraduate dean and an adjunct professor of medical education. New members appointed in the past year have been a pharmacist, a hepatologist and a paediatrician. The work of the members of the main committee and various subcommittees is greatly valued. On behalf of HREC and its subcommittees, I thank the administrative staff for their tireless work in keeping HREC and its processes operating at the highest standards. August Marchesi, Sarah Flood and Gillian Fox have provided another year of exceptional work in supporting HREC.

Of the remaining 10 proposals, one was withdrawn by the applicant, one was declined due to ACT-specific legislative restrictions, and eight remain in consultation, progressing towards approval. Meetings of the Ethics Committee The committee met 11 times from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. Meetings are held monthly. Subcommittees The Clinical Trials Subcommittee (CTSC) reviewed 53 proposals, in each instance making recommendations to the main committee. The Social Research Subcommittee (SRSC), which first met in February 2013, reviewed 18 proposals, in each instance making recommendations to the main committee. The Low Risk Subcommittee (LRSC) reviewed 174 proposals and approved 157. Of the remaining 17, five were referred for consideration by the main committee, one was withdrawn by the applicant and 11 are in consultation. The Survey Resource Group (SRG) reviewed 70 proposals providing endorsement of survey tools and/or recommendations to the main committee and LRSC. Key points arising The work, over a three-year period, of preparing HREC for the national single review system has produced many reforms and innovations in processes and administration. In October 2012, the Chairman delivered presentations on this work to Canberra Hospital Grand Rounds and to the Society of Research Administrators International Conference in Orlando, Florida. In 2013, an article authored by the chairman and manager was published in the Journal of Research Administration in the United States of America. 358 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Mental Health ACT Official Visitors Annual Report 2012-13 Introduction Mental Health Official Visitors are appointed by the Minister for Health to visit and inspect psychiatric inpatient facilities and make inquiries as to the care and treatment of patients, as set out in the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 . Matters covered include: the adequacy of services for the assessment and treatment of persons with mental dysfunction or a mental illness the appropriateness of recreation, occupation, education, training and rehabilitation services whether services are provided in the least restrictive environment possible and in the least intrusive manner possible any contraventions of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act any complaint received from a person receiving treatment and care for mental illness or dysfunction. Currently, Mental Health Official Visitors' roles cover the mental health services provided at the Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre (BHRC), Ward 2N, the Older Persons Mental Health Inpatient Unit (OPMHIU) and Hyson Green (providing private mental services) at Calvary Public Hospital, as well as the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU), formerly the Psychiatric Services Unit (PSU), at Canberra Hospital. The Official Visitors enjoyed attending the New South Wales Official Visitors Conference in Sydney as guests of the New South Wales service in August. This served as an important liaison activity, and Official Visitors benefited from the educative function of the conference as well as from the informal discussions about the Official Visitor role. The Principal Official Visitor was reappointed during this period and one Official Visitor resigned. Visits Since December 2002, the Official Visitors have operated a monthly pre-determined schedule of formal visits to each of the facilities. Prior notice of the visit is given to the facility to reinforce a cooperative as opposed to an inspectorial approach with unit staff. In 2012-13, Official Visitors made 60 scheduled formal visits to the five mental health facilities. Formal visits by the Official Visitors were supplemented by follow-up visits as required. Other visits were made on request by patients of the facilities following contact either by telephone or through messages left in the Official Visitors' suggestion boxes, which are located in the facilities. A duty telephone service is provided to the public. This requires a mobile telephone to be staffed on a roster basis by the Official Visitors. A log of the calls is maintained by each rostered Official Visitor and responses to concerns sometimes include a visit to the care facility. Contact details for mental health services such as the Mental Health Crisis Team are provided if deemed appropriate. Staff at the facilities have been extremely cooperative and open with the Official Visitors. In many instances, staff have gone out of their way to assist the Official Visitors in carrying out their duties. Detailed reports are provided to the team leaders and to senior mental health staff after each visit. The reports summarise all matters raised during the visits by patients and staff and discusse d with the team leader. Half-yearly reports are provided to the Minister for Health. Adequacy of assessment and treatment services ACT Mental Health and its staff are committed to improving the quality of care at all facilities. The staff at the facilities endeavour to improve the experiences of their patients and to develop practices and procedures aimed at the long-term benefit of patients. After more than a year of operating, the AMHU at Canberra Hospital continued to be favourably commented on by many consumers. Annexed Reports 359 The Official Visitors continue to be impressed by Hyson Green and the OPMHIU, which present as very well equipped and well staffed. Both are modern, light, spacious and designed for comfort and safety. For the first time in three years, Hyson Green remained open during the Christmas period. The OPMHIU and BHRC facilitate their staff accompanying patients into the community after discharge and assisting in their follow-up. Calvary Ward 2N provides a wide range of activities for their patients, including discussion groups. Positive comments are consistently received from consumers at the unit. Staff are favourably mentioned and generally the patients comment that they experience a calm and pleasant stay. The new smoking bans have not posed too many problems. Appropriateness of recreation, occupation, education, training and rehabilitation services Each facility operates a range of these types of programs and made changes in 2012-13 to improve the relevance and effectiveness of these activities. The general direction is to enhance the services provided. BHRC's rehabilitation and recreation focus is on patient participation in community programs outside the facility\u2014for example, activities at the Belconnen Community Centre. Patients are encouraged to commence external courses. Within the facility, programs tailored to individual patient needs are offered, such as healthy cooking lessons, media studies, relaxation techniques and gardening. Computer access is also available. Consumer meetings have been held regularly. The facility has been challenged by managing forensic patients. Calvary Ward 2N has daily activities on weekdays for all patients and was recently commended by an accreditation team for its community engagement. Group programs run by Ward 2N and Hyson Green are very popular with inpatients and outpatients. The OPMHIU encourages patients to be as active and independent as possible, although activities are restricted by the age and disabilities of consumers. Whether services are provided in the least restrictive environment possible Inpatients in psychiatric facilities are admitted on a voluntary or involuntary basis. Enforcing involuntary detention involves a reduction of an individual's freedom while treating their mental illness. Patient safety is a paramount concern, as is the safety of the staff involved. While all facilities must primarily assist patients to improve their mental health, they focus on enhancing the skills patients need to reintegrate into the community and aim to discourage dependency on inpatient facilities and reduce the duration of their admission time. The AMHU continued to emphasise reducing both the frequency and the duration of seclusion, and during visits this year it was very evident that the rate of seclusion in the facility had been reduced. Commendably, BHRC has made many efforts to ensure its consumers are integrated where possible into community-based programs to facilitate their transition from the facility into the community. Any contraventions of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act No contraventions have come to the attention of the Official Visitors. Complaints received from persons receiving treatment and care for mental illness or dysfunction In general, patients and their carers provide positive feedback about their experiences in the facilities. Issues taken up with and acted on by the units include: treatment issues maintenance and cleanliness issues smoking bans discharge plans lack of stimulation360 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 gym access physical facilities access to staff or perceived inadequacies in treatment and interpersonal relationships adequacy or otherwise of food provided for patients any developing trends\u2014for example, in Absence Without Leave (AWOL), electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) treatment numbers and seclusions. Reports to the Minister for Health The Principal Official Visitor provided the following written reports to the Minister for Health: two half-yearly reports for the reporting year.

The Radiation Council has had a productive year and has continued to address issues concerning licensing, registration and radiation safety requirements to provide adequate radiation protection to the community. The council continues to address issues and update procedures to maintain compliance with the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . The council continues to monitor the development of codes of practice, standards and regulations from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) regarding radiation safety. Information received from ARPANSA is considered in decisions made by the council. The council welcomes Dr A Javaid, who was appointed from October 2012 for a three-year term. We also welcome the reappointment of Dr S Geoghegan for a further three years. I wish to express my appreciation to the members of the council for their expert contribution and to the staff of the Health Protection Service for their ongoing support. Council functions The Radiation Protection Act 2006 www.legislation.act.gov.au controls the safe use, storage, transportation and disposal of radioactive material and irradiating apparatus. The Radiation Council is established under Part 5 of the Radiation Protection Act 2006 , and has the following functions: issuing licences registering regulated radiation sources advising the Minister on radiation protection issues exercising any other function given to it under the Radiation Protection Act 2006 or another territory law. Council membership The composition of the Radiation Council is specified in the Radiation Protection Act 2006 and must consist of: one member who is a doctor registered under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (ACT) in the specialist area of radiology one member with expert knowledge of the physical properties or biological effects of radiation a person who, in the Minister's opinion, has qualifications or experience relevant to assisting the council to carry out its functions a member of the public A council member must not be appointed for longer than three years.

Meetings were held in July, September, October and November of 2012 and in January, February, April, May and June of 2013. Regulatory standards A number of standards, codes of practice, safety guides, and recommendations are used by the council as a reference when considering matters relating to radiation protection policies, practices, conditions to be attached to licences, registrations and exemptions from the application of the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . This includes the ARPANSA publications, such as the Radiation Protection Series (RPS) publications, which are available free of charge from www.arpansa.gov.au . National Directory for Radiation Protection The National Directory for Radiation Protection (the Directory) provides the basis for achieving uniformity of radiation protection practices and legislation across all Australian jurisdictions for both ionising and non-ionising radiation. The Directory is a constantly evolving document that reflects the best radiation protection practice of the time. The Directory is updated following a prescribed process, designed to meet the COAG Principles and Guidelines for National Standard Setting and Regulatory Action by Ministerial Councils and Standard-setting Bodies (November 1997), and after amendments are endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference. The Directory was republished in July 2011 to include Amendment No. 5. This amendment added two Codes of Practice to Schedule 11; the Code of Practice for Radiation Protection in Veterinary Medicine (RPS17) and the Code of Practice for Radiation Protection in the Application of Ionizing Radiation by Chiropractors (RPS19). The council is regularly briefed on developments with regard to the work of the National Radiation Health Committee (RHC) of ARPANSA. The ACT has a jurisdictional representative from ACT Health appointed to the RHC. Council activities Approvals and decisions Licences In 2012-13 the council issued 186 new licences to deal with a radiation source. Together with licences re-issued during the year, the total number of radiation licence holders in the ACT was 1057. Registrations In 2012-13 the council registered 52 new radiation sources. Together with sources re-registered during the year, the total number of registered radiation sources in the ACT was 553. Radiation incidents The following radiation incidents were reported to the council during the year: Radiotherapy: three incidents two* incidents involved misalignment of treatment area one incident involved equipment malfunction Nuclear medicine: one incident one incident involved the contamination with or dispersal of a radioactive material. Soil density gauges: one incident one* incident involved damage to, or malfunctioning of, a radiation apparatus or sealed source.Annexed Reports 363 Following investigation, three of the reported incidents (marked above with an asterisk\u2014*) were referred to ARPANSA for inclusion on the Australian Radiation Incident Register. In line with the ACT Health Risk Management Guidelines , the three incidents referred to ARPANSA were considered to be of minor consequence. The remaining two incidents were deemed insignificant. The areas involved undertook reviews of working systems and where necessary, amended procedures to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future. Enforcement and remedial actions by the council No investigations or legal proceedings were commenced in 2012-13.

Functions, aim and goals of the Board The ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board administers Schedule 12, Veterinary Surgeons, to the Health Professionals Regulation 2004. The Health Professionals Act 2004 charges the Board with responsibility for the registration of appropriately qualified persons as veterinary surgeons and veterinary specialists, enabling them to practise veterinary surgery in the Australian Capital Territory. The Board: ensures that the interests of the public and the welfare of animals in the ACT are protected ensures that only properly qualified persons are registered as veterinary surgeons in the ACT provides advice to government agencies and interest groups conducts inquiries, as required, to ensure professional standards of practice are met. Membership of the Board President Dr Kevin Doyle AM Deputy President Dr John Aspley Davis Members Dr Simon Morris Dr Roger Meischke Dr Sarah Webb Dr Steven Roberts Community Representative Ms Eileen Jerga AM Secretariat Health Protection Service All members serve the Board in a personal and honorary capacity. Meetings of the Board From 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, the Board met on eight occasions. Meetings were generally held monthly at Howard Florey Centenary House, 25 Mulley Street, Holder. President's report I am pleased to present the Annual Report of the Veterinary Surgeons Board for the year ended 30 June 2013. The Board previously reported its relocation from the Health Professions Registration Boards to the Health Protection Service (HPS) of the ACT Government Health Directorate, located at Howard Florey Centenary House in Holder. As a result of the relocation, a new database was required. This was developed to allow a better service for registered veterinary surgeons and the Board. The testing of the database was completed in 2012. Annexed Reports 365 The relocation created difficulties for the Board in that some records and corporate memory were lost. In addition, when managed as one of nine health profession boards served by a professional secretariat, the Board had access to resources beyond its part-time registrar/executive officer. This has not been possible within the HPS. While extra resources have been made available, their duties have had to be carried out in addition to their ongoing tasks. It has become clear that a part-time registrar/executive officer is not adequate. The Board agreed at its March 2013 meeting to appoint a full-time registrar. Efforts are being made to ensure that the move of the Board to the Territory and Municipal Services Directorate will provide access to the necessary resources. The Board reported last year that it was clear that changes must be made to the legislation to update it and to bring it into line with contemporary legislation. This included harmonising it with the legislation of the other jurisdictions and providing for national recognition of veterinary registration (NRVR). The Board supports NRVR and will continue to work on its implementation. The Board sets high standards for professional competence in order to ensure public protection, which includes supporting and enforcing the mandatory professional indemnity insurance. The Board has been active in the affairs of the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council (AVBC), on which it is represented by Dr John Aspley Davis. The Board supports AVBC efforts to promote cooperation in strategic planning for the future of registered veterinary surgeons and to help improve veterinary services provided to the community. This year the AVBC conference was held in Cairns. Dr Steven Roberts was appointed to the Board during the year and provides particular expertise on horses. My appreciation is extended to all members of the Board for their considerable efforts during the year and over the term of their appointments. As a result of the review into the ACT Government and the recommendation made in its final report, Governing the City State: One ACT Government\u2014One ACT Public Service , the Board's secretariat transferred to the Territory and Municipal Services Directorate on 9 July 2013, following the 2013-14 registration renewal process. The Board thanks the Health Protection Service for its support to the Board. Registration At 30 June 2013, 261 veterinary surgeons had current registrations in the ACT. The Board continued to process applications for initial registrations and registrations under the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Act. Number of registrants Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total 246 253 260 236 272 256 245 261 Activities The Board addressed issues related to the following topics during the year: professional standards matters recency of practice continuing professional development national recognition of veterinary registration policy review database.366 ACT Government Health Directorate Annual Report 2012-13 Complaints and disciplinary action The Board recognises that many complaints emerge from poor communication between parties about the service to be provided or the service that is provided. This can result in intransigence from both parties in resolving complaints. In 2012-13, the Board jointly reviewed the complaint process with the Human Rights Commission and the Government Solicitor's Office. The Board is pleased to report the success of the revised process. All complaints made to the Board have been processed and the vast majority resolved, with only three complaints ongoing. The Board investigated a number of complaints or professional standards issues throughout the year. Matters of significance National recognition of veterinary registration The Board supports the process being put in place by the AVBC and Primary Industries Standing Committee to move towards National Recognition of Veterinary Registration (NRVR). Each jurisdiction will retain its own board and legislation but will recognise registration in other jurisdictions as a right to practise in every jurisdiction without further registration. This will achieve mobility of veterinary surgeons between jurisdictions and assist in the aim of achieving consistency of standards. The Board hopes to introduce processes in the next financial year for NRVR in the ACT. Continuing veterinary professional development Continuing professional development (CPD) is compulsory in all the ACT health professions. The ACT is among a number of Australian jurisdictions to have compulsory CPD for veterinary surgeons. It is important that all registered veterinary surgeons demonstrate a commitment to continuing professional development if they wish to renew their registration. Australasian Veterinary Boards Council The annual general meeting of the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council (AVBC) was held in Cairns in May 2013. Dr John Aspley Davis is the Board's representative on the council. There was attendance by representatives and their registrars from the New Zealand Veterinary Council and all state and territory boards. Reports were submitted and discussed on issues concerning registration, uniformity of legislation, the National Veterinary Examination, National Recognition of Veterinary Registration and the accreditation of university undergraduate courses, both in Australia and with those whom we have a mutual recognition agreement\u2014namely, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the United Kingdom. AVBC also accepts graduates who have qualified under the remit of the American Veterinary Medical Association, which includes an increasing number of faculties not on the North American continent, and the South African Veterinary Board. This time, via Skype, all the states and territories signed off on a mutual recognition agreement with South Africa which entitles graduates of Australia and New Zealand to practise there without further examination. Previously, the recognition was only in favour of South African graduates. Finances The Board is not a territory authority for the purposes of the Financial Management Act 1996 (see the Financial Management (Territory Authorities) Declaration 2005 (No. 1)). The Board is self-funding, with account management undertaken by the Health Protection Service as part of its secretariat function. A summary of the Board's finances is provided for information. Carryover $139,093 Revenue $77,667 Expenditure $82,676 Carried forward $132,084Annexed Reports 367 Liaison with Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) The Board maintains liaison with the AVA to ensure a free exchange of views and information. The AVA provides continuing education, mentoring and other forms of assistance to veterinarians in the ACT. This is particularly important for new graduates. The Board takes this opportunity to acknowledge the cooperation of the AVA.
