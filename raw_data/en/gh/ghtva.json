They are intellectually and developmentally ready to establishconnections between practices and outcomes. We as educators have the responsi-bility to insure that young people are prepared to meet the health challenges theyface in this changing society.Subsequently, the elementary school years should be designed to develop the frame-work of health knowledge, reinforce positive health behaviors, and encourage skillsthat will facilitate healthy living. Young students need to understand that health edu-cation is an ongoing part of one's lifean area that substantially impacts each dimen-sion of one's being. Multi-sensory learning helps students personalize and internalizehealth concepts and arrange them in some meaningful order for themselves.Additionally, this \"hands on learning\" allows students the opportunity to submergethemselves into the health curriculum.Health education has changed dramatically over the last ten years. Health is not onlya subject taught but a set of principles from which one identifies and choosesbehaviors that will enhance healthy living. No longer do we rely on rote memoriza-tion, worksheets, movies, and textbooks to impart critical health information to thestudents. The health education learning process has evolved to actively includestudents in experiences that encourage the development of positive attitudes abouthealthful living.We also know that attitudes about health are strongly influenced by the media, peerrelationships, and societal conditions at an early age. As educators, we are activelycompeting with conflicting external forces to establish a \"positive health mind set.\"One of the greatest opportunities and challenges that we face, as educators, is tosuccessfully instill health promotion messages to the young adults of tomorrow.There are immense opportunities for health instruction in the school setting, whetherit be formal or informal. One needs to take advantage of them! The challenging partis designing learning experiences that are meaningful and relevant to the audience.Making health come alive in the classroom is not by chance but by design! This guidecontains innovative learning activities and teaching ideas that will enhance classroominstruction. The materials are divided into 12 different sections which include thefollowing topics: health content areas, health promotion, curriculum integration, andparent education.We thank all of the health professionals who took the time to share their ideas withus.Jane HakalaW.

Solmon 107 vii8 HEALTH ATTITUDESAND VALUES EXPLORING HEALTH VALUESOF SCHOOL-AGE CHILDRENt Students in health education classes are encouraged to optimize their personal health through posi-tive behaviors (Combs, 1983). Positive health behaviors can be defined as actions that an individualperforms to enhance or maintain good health. Students who place a high value on health will practicemore positive health behaviors than students who place a low value on health (Petersen-Martin,1985). However, research has also shown that holding health in high value does not necessarily resultin positive self-care behavior (Floria, 1982; Gramse, 1982). Intelligence, attitudes, decision-makingskills, familial background, socioeconomic status, and the environment have the potential to influencehealth behavior. Personal values also have the potential to influence health behavior. Values motivatebehavior because they are goal-oriented (Rokeach, 1973).How important is it to teach children in the fifth or sixth grades about health values? Healthvalues may seem rather remote and abstract to students unless the teacher introduces values in acreative and personal way.The overall objective of this 50-minute lesson is first to explore the health values of the teacher,then the health values of each student by a self-reflective, written activity. The ultimate outcome ofthisactivity,is to show students the relationship between their health values and their healthbehavior. At the end of this activity, students will understand that they have personal ownership oftheir values, which ultimately motivates their behaviors.Teaching MethodsThe activity begins with a lecture demonstration at the chalkboard. The teacher introduces theactivity by saying: \"Today we are going to explore our health values. As you know, boys and girls,my name is Mrs. (or Mr.) .But today, I'm going to let you in on a secret. I'm going to tell youmy first name. Does anyone know my first name?\" This moment of acknowledgment is often excitingto children. For this example, the name Valerie will be used.After making a general comment about the importance of health and wellness in her life, Valerietapes a large letter \"V\" made out of construction paper onto the blackboard. She then turns to herstudents and says: \"V stands for vigorous exercise. Daily exercise is important to me.\" The activitycontinues for several minutes until the letters spell out Valerie across the board and the identifiedvalue is written next to each letter (Table 1). Throughout the activity, Valerie describes the relation-ship between her personal values and her health behaviors. t By Dr. Valerie A. Ubbes, Ph.D., C.H.E.S., Department of Physical Education, Northern Illinois University,DeKalb, IL.1 2Health Attitudes and Values Next, each student will write his/hername vertically on a piece of paper and spend10 minutes thinking and writing health valueswhich begin with each letter of his/her name.For example, Ann might value apples forsnacks, naps, and nice friends. The teachershould move around the classroom to helpstudents, offering suggestions to students whoneed assistance on their acronyms of healthvalues. Students can also be encouraged topair up to help one another with their last fewletters. The dictionary can be used to triggerideas when students have difficulty complet-ing their acronyms. -In the final 10 minutes, students sharetheir health values letter-by-letter with theirpartners, then volunteer \"teams\" are asked toshare in front of the class. For example, Ed andBill start by holding each other's acronyms forclassmates to read. Ed introduces Bill and Billintroduces Ed. Using Ed and Bill as examples,the teacher reminds students about the rela-tionship between their personal values andhealth behaviors. The eight steps that com-prise this activity are shown in Table 2.Materials NeededThe following materials are needed tomake this activity a success: chalkboard, chalk,large block letters made out of constructionpaper which the teacher's name;masking tape; colored construction student; large felt-tipped for eachstudent; and dictionaries.DiscussionThis activity encourages students to ex-plore what they value in their lives and ulti-mately to reflect upon the behaviors they prac-tice in their lives. Students can be motivated todiscuss the many dimensions of health (e.g.,physical, mental, emotional, social, and spir-itual) in the context of their personal healthvalues. Initially, the teacher should encourageall responses as acceptable. Because conflictsin values and behaviors may result, the teachershould be prepared to explore and discussindividual situations when they arise. For ex-ample, an overweight student named Franklinmay opt to characterize the letter \"F\" in hisname for Fat or Fatty. The teacher must beable to respond to Franklin in a sensitive wayto capitalize on this teachable moment by-1111104110-10-10-10-40-10411-11-10-041.404oioli.1)4404044-1044-11-11.141.4.10 Table 1HEALTH shares his/her first name with stu-dents and writes name on the chalkboard.2.

In Franklin's case, the teachermight ask him a probing question to better understand the context of his chosen value after whichtime a supportive response from the teacher might be: \"Franklin seems willing to accept himself asbeing overweight, which is the first step to changing his behavior.\" The teacher might also need to besensitive to cultural issues. Some Hispanic or Black persons may value \"stockiness\" as being healthy.ConclusionThis activity helps students to identify and clarify some of their health values. This activity setsthe foundation for future health education lessons, because students are taught that their personalvalues determine what behaviors they practice with regard to their health.ReferencesCombs, B.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENTARY STUDENTS'PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH THROUGH THEUSE OF ARTWORK, NARRATIVE, ANDCLASSROOM DISCUSSIONt This article will present the benefits of using projective techniques during elementary school healtheducation classes to assess students' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about personal health. Thispaper is based on one part of a comprehensive community-based needs assessment completed in tworural South Carolina school districts during the spring of 1993. Research results were used to planeffective school health education instruction and health services. Middle school students illustrated orwrote about their perceptions of good and poor health and discussed their beliefs with peers. Groupinterviews with students permitted a more detailed understanding of students' health-related knowl-edge and beliefs than a quantitative paper-and-pencil questionnaire or examination. 1-By Brian F. Geiger, EdD., University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Education, Department of HumanStudies, Birmingham, AL. This research was funded by the South Carolina Health and Human Services FinanceCommission, Alternative Delivery Systems. 4Health Attitudes and Values The purpose of this article is to present a qualitative research method that was used as one part ofa community-based case study of fifth through eighth grade students. Using student-createddrawings and narratives as part of a school health class can be particularly useful to encourageparticipation by all students, particularly those in the younger grades who may be reluctant to speakfreely in the classroom. Combining information presentation with student exercises enriches healtheducation instruction. This teaching method can easily be used by elementary school health teachersto introduce health topics and assess students' health-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs beforeand after classroom instruction. There is only a minimal cost for instructional materials (Geiger, 1993a& 1993b).Explanation of Teaching IdeaStudents' perspectives about the meaning of good and poor health including the importance ofgood nutrition, physical exercise, abstention from the use of cigarettes, psychoactive drugs, andalcohol, and personal responsibility for health were revealed from their illustrations and narrativescreated during school health classes. The purpose of the classroom activity and ground rules wereexplained to students at the beginning of the class session. Two main ground rules emphasized tostudents were voluntary participation by individual students and respect for each student's personalbeliefs and opinions including prohibition against peer criticism or censure. Ground rules werehelpful to establish a nonthreatening and nonevaluative environment which 1993a; Stewart & & Fallek, 1993). Students were provided withletter-sized unruled white paper, colored pencils, and markers. Students were asked to illustrate orwrite about health using a set of statements that included general and specific directions (Figure 1).For example, students were instructed to \"draw or write down on your paper what the words 'goodhealth' mean to you.\" Students were told that there was no right or wrong way to illustrate or writeabout their beliefs.Students were encouraged to compare and contrast their personal beliefs about health by illus-trating the meaning of \"good health\" on one side of the page and drawing the meaning of \"badhealth\" on the opposite side of the page. Students were asked to prepare only one drawing, or writeone narrative at a time. Oral directions were brief to avoid biasing participants' responses.Following completion of the drawings ornarratives, students were guided in classroomdiscussion about the characteristics theyperceived as important to good and poorhealth. Students were not limited to responsesto the teacher's predetermined questions,instead, questions posed by the teacherguided class discussion. Students were encour-aged to describe their drawings or narrativesand ask questions about personal healthconcerns.The teaching idea was field tested during7 group interviews with 96 public school stu-dents in grades 5-8; nearly all of the studentswere African Americans. Students were veryinterested in this exercise and actively partici-pated in group discussions. Some of the stu-dents were eager to compare their completeddrawings with peers. According to classroomobservations and second-hand reports fromteachers, students greatly enjoyed the noveltyand informality of & TOASSESS STUDENTS' HEALTH-RELATEDKNOWLEDGE AND BELIEFS 1.Draw or write down on your paper whatthe words good health mean to you. 2.Draw or write down on your paper whatthe words bad health mean to you. 3.Draw or write down on your paper whathappens to somebody your age if theysmoke cigarettes. 4.Draw or write down on your paper whathappens to somebody your age if theydrink alcohol like beer or wine. 12 Sample Results of the Classroom Activityfor Health EducationThe middle school students displayed afundamental knowledge of good health thatincluded eating a balanced diet and avoidingjunk foods, playing sports and exercising,abstaining from tobacco, drug and alcohol use,and practicing good personal hygiene andself-care behaviors (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).Students displayed misconceptions about thephysical effects of cigarettes and cocaine.Nearly all of the students emphasized a desirefor social acceptance as integral to practicingpositive health behaviors. Family, environ-mental, and mental and emotional healthwere significantly less often identified bystudents as part of what \"good health\" meansto them.Understanding Elementary Perceptions of Health 2SAMPLE STUDENTS' BELIEFS ABOUTTHE MEANING OF GOOD HEALTHGood health is ...\"eating from the food groups, the meat group,the bread group, the dairy group.

This teaching idea can easily beincorporated as one exercise in an age-appropriate and comprehensive school health education cur-riculum. Students' drawings, narratives, and dialogue reveal their school health education needs. Stu-dents will often honestly discuss their personal health concerns and preferences for instructional con-tent and methods for school health education if they perceive that the classroom environment is safeand the teacher is trustworthy. Comprehensive health education should occur in a sequential manner,building upon foundations taught in previous grades. The health education research literaturedemonstrates that such instruction can positively impact on students' health-related knowledge, atti-tudes, and practices (Metropolitan Life Foundation, 1988; Walberg et al., 1986; Cortese & Middleton, 1994).16 Understanding Elementary Students' Perceptions of Health 9 ReferencesBeemer, C. & Fallek, J.(1993, Fall).

ASCD Curriculum Update, June, 4-6. 10Mental Health MENTAL HEALTH BUILDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY THROUGHFRIENDSHIP TRAINING IN THE CLASSROOMt Teachers can help students develop a sense of community through learning situations in the class-room. Students can be taught that by accepting others and cooperating with them, they can accom-plish more in their own lives while strengthening their sense of self-worth. Increasing classroomunity ultimately will lead to strengthening the community and society of which each child willbecome a part. Based on these concepts, the following strategies were developed to be used in theupper elementary grades (4-6).Introduction to the LessonsTo help facilitate development of friendships within the classroom, thereby enhancing classroomunity, three activities have been developed. These activities can be utilized to help point out theuniqueness of individuals, to emphasize qualities that make a good friend, and to help nourish asense of community and belonging.Strategy IWe Are Not All the SameBegin the first lesson by comparing the positive attributes of two people the students know.Possible examples would be a famous athlete and a well known political figure or a musician and thePresident. Talk about how these people are different, not only in looks or age, but also in lifestyledecisions, values, and personality. These differences can be listed on the board or on an overhead ace-tate. Contributions each makes to society should be considered and how or why these contributionsare important. After using well-known subjects, bring the discussion to a more personal level by thenselecting someone the students know, such as two teachers or community figures. Keeping thediscussion focus on positive attributes of the individuals, talk about and list characteristics of thesepeople that are similar and those that are different. Point out that all people have similarities anddifferences, and, even though they are not exactly the same, they still provide valuable input into theworld of which they are a part.Next, provide students with a worksheet (see Figure 1) and let them think of two people, such asa neighbor or family member they know. They then can list ways these people are similar and dif-ferent. At the conclusion, have students write a paragraph comparing themselves with the peoplethey have chosen. t By David J. Anspaugh,a professor of health sciences in the Department of HPER at Memphis State University,Memphis, TN, and Susan Hunter, an instructor in the Department of HPER at Memphis State University, Mem-phis. This article appeared in the Journal of Health Education, JulylAugust 1992, Vol. 23, No. 5, pp. 304-306.18 Questions for Processing andClosure for Strategy I 1.Are any two people you knowexactly the same? 2.If people are not the same, is itpossible for them to be friends? 3.If people are different, does thismake one person \"bad\" and theother person \"good\"?4. What are the qualities the peopleyou listed in the activity have thatyou find particularly attractive?Building a Sense of Community 11 Figure 1WORKSHEET FOR STRATEGY I Worksheet: Similarities and DifferencesThink of two people you know other than friends or classmates and describehow they are alike and how they are different. Some people you can comparemight be your parents, brothers, sisters, neighbors, and so on.Person #1 Person #2Similarities: Differences:1. 1.2. 2.3. 3.4. 4.5. 5.6. 6.How are you like these people? How are you different? Write one paragraph toexplain. Strategy 11The Chain of FriendshipReview the previous strategy on how people are different, yet realize that they all can have posi-tive qualities that make them special. Observe to the students that differences do not mean that differ-ent people cannot be friends, share, or cooperate with one another or that one is \"bad\" and the otheris \"good.\" Emphasize that each person can choose to view others from a positive perspective, seeingtheir good qualities, or negatively, focusing on what they feel are their shortcomings. When friend-ships develop with others, each person has someone else with whom he or she can share sorrows aswell as successes. By forging strong friendships in the classroom, the spirit and unity of the classmakes each student better prepared to do his or her work and face the challenges of that day. Oneway to strengthen the bonds of friendship in the classroom is to be able to see positive qualities ineach other. Provide each student with names of three other students in the classroom and three sheetsof colored construction paper (1\" x 1/2\" x 7\").Names should be assigned so that each student is included and will have at least three positivestatements written about him or her. Have students write the names they were assigned on the con-struction paper. Beside each name write an important quality that person exhibits. A list of qualitiescan be brainstormed and written on the board before names are assigned. This will provide variety,rather than having everyone be \"nice.\" Once finished, students take turns reading the names theywere assigned and qualities observed in these people. Then staple the slips of paper together likelinks in a chain. All links with all names should be stapled together to make a great chain of friend-ship that then can be displayed in the classroom.Strategy IIIBuilding the Bridge of FriendshipStrategy III focuses on developing friendships with others. Walls are built between people whenthey see the less desirable characteristics in each other and fail to see what is good. One way to build,strengthen, and maintain friendships between people is to remind themselves of the other person'sdesirable qualities.Have students count by twos and pair them with each other. Give each pair a bridge (seeexample) to build. Let them sign the handout, then insert words on the bridge that will strengthentheir relationship. Words should emphasize positive qualities but not be \"inhuman\"; terms should berealistic and meaningful, such as \"honest\" and \"easy to get along with\" rather than \"radical\" or\"awesome.\" Both students place words on the bridge about the other person until every plank in thebridge has been filled. When completed, bridges can be displayed in the classroom as a reminder ofhow to strengthen relationships.19BEST COPY AVAILABLE 12Mental Health Questions for Processing andClosure to Strategy II1.

What do you consider to be characteristics of a good friend?2. How do friendships build strength in each person? In the classroom?3. Why is it important that people overcome their differences?After discussing summary questions, students can list three things they have learned about oneor more of the following: being a friend; characteristics friends have; why friends are important; howto form friendships; and how friendships build strength and unity. By recognizing that people are alldifferent, by being able to accept those differences, and by looking for and emphasizing the positivein others, a solid foundation is laid for developing self esteem and recognizing each person'spotential impact on the classroom, their personal environment, their community, and the nation. THE SELF-ESTEEM AND THESELF-CONCEPT ADVERTISEMENTSt Grade Level:ElementaryTime Frame:One class periodMaterials:Paper, paper bag, and markersPreparation and ImplementationIt has been stated that most health problems center around a poor self-concept (Curtis & Papenfuss1980). Self-concept pertains to the mental image one has of oneself. A poor self-concept in studentsmay be evidenced by problems related to discipline, absenteeism, substance abuse, eating disordersand suicide.The importance of a positive self-concept in relation to the prevention of health problems is welldocumented. Classroom teachers can help build self-esteem by establishing classroom conditionswhich develop a sense of security, identity, belonging, purpose, and a sense of personal competence(Kentucky Department of Education 1989).\"Self-esteem,\" according to the California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and PersonalResponsibility (1990), \"is appreciating my own worth and importance and having the character to beaccountable for myself and to act responsibly toward others.\" The commission further states, \"Self-esteem is the likeliest candidate for a social vaccine, something that empowers us to live responsibly,and that inoculates us against the lives of crime, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, childabuse, chronic welfare dependency, and educational failure.\" (1990)According to Bean (1992), \"The goal of self-esteem work is to produce learning situations inwhich children experience a high level of personal satisfaction at the same time as they are learningand retaining the material you're teaching them.\" Bean (1992) believes that self-esteem has to do withfeeling satisfied while self-concept has to do with thinking about oneself. Porat (1988) indicates self-esteem grows through an inner feeling of positive self-concept and self-acceptance.The following activities are attempts to allow elementary students to describe their feelings per-taining to self-esteem and think about positive factors associated with their self-concept. Hayes and tBy Dr. Warren Mc Nab, Professor of Health Education, College of Human Performance and Development,University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV.21 14Mental Health Fors (1990) state that, \"If students feel better about themselves, they may be more likely to changehealth-related behavior. People who feel good about themselves act more positively about theirhealth because they feel they are worth it.\"Activity 1: FOR SALEAfter covering the definitions of self-esteem, self-concept, and personality, each student isassigned the task of writing a \"FOR SALE\" advertisement of oneself. They can choose any item andthen describe characteristics that reflect their personality or self-concept.The following are examples of advertisements students have written to describe themselves.Advertisement One:Kind, caring person with the personality of a rainbowRed for strength and powerWhite for peacefulness and understandingBlue for calmness and serenityYellow for fun and laughterWill add vivid color to your life with goals set above the clouds and the ability to shine throughany storm.Advertisement Two:I'm a fluffy, brown teddy bear, full of joy. I am just waiting for someone to pick me out of thebunch. My eyes are large with a sparkle of happiness. Happiness just waiting to be shared. Myears are open for any happy or sad tale my owner needs to express. All I ask is to be taken care ofwith love and affection as I will do for you.Advertisement and always ending up in the middle of things.These personality advertisements are then collected and read by the teacher to the class, keepingidentities unknown. The activity should be followed by discussions on how self-concept affects thechoices one makes relates to individual health. Ways to improve self-concept and the importance of apositive attitude should also be emphasized. Activity 2: WHO ARE YOU?A student is selected to stand and then 10 of his/her classmates ask the individual the followingquestion, \"WHO ARE YOU?\" The student needs to respond with one or two words which describestheir personality. Example responses might be strong, fun, happy, cool, etc. The objective is toemphasize that each person has many positive characteristics that make up their personality, and oneshould feel good about these unique qualities. Activity 3: THE SELF-ESTEEM GOOD BAGEach student decorates a large paper bag with things/drawings that represent their personalityand self-concept. Then each is given blank pieces of paper, enough for each student in class, and thestudent must put one, anonymous positive comment about each person in class in the bag each22 The Self-Esteem and the Self-Concept Advertisements 15 student has made. Students are then allowed to read all the good things their classmates have saidabout them.After these activities, the terms self-concept, self-esteem, and personality are reviewed empha-sizing the positive feelings and thoughts one can have about themselves and others.

CREATING A TEACHABLE MOMENTIN SUICIDE PREVENTIONt Logic would dictate that in order to teach a particular lesson successfully, the health educator shouldknow what it is that he or she is going to teach, the method to use to teach it, and how to determine ifhe or she has been successful. In some instances it may be important for the student or client to knowthese strategies as well. A well-organized teaching plan provides greater assurance that the\"objectives\" for the day can be met.In addition to having a well-organized plan, health educators sometimes must prepare the stu-dent to learn. The motivation to learn is a powerful tool that, if utilized effectively, can greatlyenhance learning. Educators have long touted use of the \"teachable moment\" as a key issue in moti-vating students to learn. One only has to think back to the 1986 Challenger explosion viewed byhundreds of thousands of school children. Many teachers reported that the rest of the day was spentdiscussing death, grief, and other issues related to the tragedy. Many teachers successfully used that\"teachable moment.\"While it is important for the health educator to know what he or she is going to teach, how toteach it, and how to determine if he or she is successful, there are times in which it is not advan-tageous for the student or client to know the primary purpose of a lesson. In addition, \"teachablemoments\" do not occur with any regularity, and often it is difficult to depend on that to help with theteaching process. The following is an example of a powerful teaching technique that can be a lead-inon discussion about suicide, and in a way, a technique that a health educator can use to create his orher \"teachable moment.\" t By Mark J. Kittleson, Associate Professor in the Department of Health Education, Southern Illinois Uni-versity, Carbondale, IL. Previously published in the Journal of Health Education, March /April 1994, Vol. 25,No. 2, pp. 110-111.3BEST COPY AVAILABLE 16Mental Health Starting the ActivityWhen you are about to start the activity, do not mention the word \"suicide,\" or even make anysuggestions that you will be discussing this topic. Make sure that your syllabus, assignments, or text-book readings do not focus on suicide.Start off by drawing a long horizontal time line on the chalkboard. This time line will represent aperson's life. At one end is birth and at the other end is death. Tell class members that they are goingto create a person and his or her life. First ask class members to name the person. For this example,let's imagine that the person's name is Rachel.After identifying Rachel as this person, ask the class to come up to the chalkboard and to mark atleast two main life events on Rachel's time line. Ask students not only to identify the life event, butalso to identify the age that it happened. Let students take time to identify special events. If studentsseem hesitant or unsure of what to put down, begin by identifying some key events, such as \"gettingdriver's licenseage 16\" and \"graduating from collegeage 23.\"It typically takes five minutes for the class to complete the timeline. Upon this line there will bemany life events that Rachel has experienced. An example of a time line appears in Figure 1. (Notethat Figure 1 is in a vertical format, but the activity is done best with a horizontal time line.) As youcan see, students identified key events such as the day that Rachel first menstruated, her first sexualexperience, her marriage, birth of children, completion of graduate school, opening of her own busi-ness, death of parents, divorce, or marriage, graduation of children from high school and college,marriage of her children, selling of business for large profit, birth of first grandchild, retirement,death of spouse, worldwide vacation, and eventually death at the age of 85.Step TwoNow that you have described Rachel's life,go through each key issue. Ask students whowrote the key life events to describe them inmore detailfor example, what did Rachel doon her first date; what was her major in college;talk about the tragedy of her third child whowas born as a stillbirth and Rachel's divorcefrom her first husband the next year. Try tomake this person as real to the students as pos-sible. Discuss the wonders of life that includesorrow and happiness. Point out the tremendousimpact that Rachel had not only on her childrenand spouse, but also on the many others thatRachel's life affected (friends, business associ-ates, clients). The strategy during this step is toget the class to know Rachel as a real person,with real life problems, successes, and struggles.Step ThreeAfter you feel you have successfully met therequirements from step two, pick up an eraser,silently walk to the end of the time line (thedeath end), and start erasing both the time line,age, and life event that has taken place. Make itmeticulous, slow, and deliberate. When you getto age 15 (or whatever age you decide to choose),stop erasing, take a piece of chalk, and draw avertical line. Indicate to the class that you forgotto tell them that Rachel had an argument withher folks at the age of 15. Rachel was beinggrounded for staying out past her 9:00 p.m. cur-few. Rachel felt the punishment was too harsh,so she killed herself. Typically, silence prevailsfor a few seconds at this time.Figure 1 Age8562TIME LINE EventDeathWorld cruise60Retirement56Spouse dies53Sells business for a child graduates from high schoolBusiness expandsRemarriesFather child as stillbirthOpening schoolFirst Moment in Suicide Prevention 17 Step FourYou now have an intense teachable moment. This is an excellent opportunity to discuss theeffects that suicide has on the people left behind, without actually having to experience a suicide. Thistechnique has been used with numerous groups including junior high, high school, and college.Reactions have included the following: some students were hostile and angry (they were upset thatRachel would end her lifeafter all, so many great things happened to her) that they actually sworeat the instructor; some students expressed great sadness (several times I have seen tears well up instudents' eyes); some students were in shock (in most instances the students are speechless after theyfind out that Rachel committed suicide); and many students simply displayed disbelief over the event(\"Why would Rachel kill herself over something so stupid?\"). One student even likened this activityto a modern day \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (a movie of the mid-1940s that showed the main characterseeing the impact that his life has had on others and his community).Although each health educator can determine how to move the lesson on, questions typicallyinclude: What was your reaction when you heard me say that Rachel killed herself? How do youthink Rachel's parents, family, and friends were affected by her suicide? If you could talk to Rachel,what would you tell her?SummaryAn important part of teaching is taking advantage of teachable moments. Sometimes those teach-able moments are unannounced. In some instances, you as the health educator can create your ownteachable moment. When you want to discuss the impact of suicide, this activity may prepare yourclass to discuss the impact that suicide has among the people left behind. 25 18Growth and Development GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT TEACHING YOUNG CHILDRENABOUT AGING' The U.S. population rapidly is becoming older. A child born today can expect to live to be 75 yearsold, 28 years longer than a child born in 1900 (American Association of Retired Persons, 1991). Theolder population, people 65 years or older, accounts for 31 million Americans (American Associationof Retired Persons, 1991). Unfortunately, Americans often reach old age with little education oranticipatory guidance about aging and with ageist attitudes in place (McGuire, 1986).Research has shown that ageist and ambivalent attitudes toward the elderly are evident even inpreschool children (Treybig, 1974; Click & Powell, 1976; Goldman & Goldman, 1981; Burke, 1981). Bythe time a child is 12 to 13 years old, these ageist attitudes become difficult to change (Lorge, Tuck-man, & Abrams, 1954; Bennett, 1976; Ivester Burke, 1981). These ageist attitudes oftenbecome self-fulfilling prophecies in later years.Aging education is important in helping children successfully adapt to aging. It should be inter-generational, developmentally focused, anticipatory education that promotes positive attitudestoward age and aging (McGuire, 1976). Aging education should teach children that there is potentialfor good health, activity, and creativity at all stages of life, and that the quality of life they will have atall ages depends largely on the decisions they make about their own lifestyle and habits (Pratt, 1987).The overall goal of aging education is to prepare youth for a long life (Pratt, 1986).Aging education materials for children arenot abundant. Two organizations that developand catalog such materials are the Center for Un-derstanding Aging (CUA) and Generations To-gether (see Figure 1). Generations Together hascompiled an annotated bibliography on agingcurricula for children (Wilson & Newman, 1987).The CurriculumIn preparation for implementing aging edu-cation units with preschool children, an agingeducation curriculum was developed. The cur-riculum was juried by a panel of experts. Thecontent of the curriculum focused on promotinghealthy aging and promoting positive attitudestoward aging. The curriculum did not focus onillness, disability, or death. These topics shouldbe dealt with separately from aging educationand are not synonymous with aging. The con-ceptual framework shown in Figure 2 was devel-oped for the curriculum. It actually could beimplemented with aging education across thelifespan.Figure 1AGING EDUCATION RESOURCES Center for Understanding Aging CT 06489-0246(203) 621-2079Dr. Donna Couper, Executive Director Special Projects Generations TogetherUniversity of Pittsburgh811 William Pitt UnionPittsburgh, PA 15260(412) 648-7150Dr. Sally Newman, DirectorJanet Wilson, Librarian/Compiler t By Sandra L.

Literature to be used in the classroom set-ting was screened carefully for ageism using the Ageism in Literature analysis form developed byDodson & Hause (1981). A booklist of non-ageist early children's literature was developed. An up-dated edition of this booklist, Non-ageist Picture Books for Young Readers: An Annotated Bibliography forPreschool to Third Grade (McGuire, 1990), is available from the Center for Understanding Aging, as anAge Share publication. Figure 2 HEALTH 2:Concept 3:Concept 4:Concept 5:Concept 6:Aging and lifelong process of growing and developing.Older people and younger people are similar in many ways.Older people are valuable and contributing members of society.Old and young can enjoy each other and learn from each other.People need to plan for becoming older.People have much control over the older person they become.Source: McGuire, S. L. (1988). Health and Aging CurriculumGrade Level: Preschool:Third Grade. Eric Document reproduction service ED 291 738. The Classroom ProgramFrom the curriculum six teaching units were developed for implementation with preschoolers(ages four to five years). These units were implemented in a preschool program with seven locationsover a tri-county area.The units were carried out over a 3-week time period with two units being implemented eachweek. In keeping with the attention span for this age group, units were designed to last approxi-mately 30-40 minutes. The children were provided with name tags for the units so that they could bereferred to individually.Unit activities were developed to be easily implemented, inexpensive, and time efficient. Theunits utilized discussions with the children, felt board activities, and pictures from magazines,catalogs, and newspapers. Non-ageist children's literature such as I Know a Lady (1984) by CharlotteZolotow, Miss Rumphius (1982) by Barbara Cooney, Song and Dance Man (1988) by Karen Ackerman,Good as New (1982) by Barbara Douglass, and The Crack-of-Dawn Walkers (1984) by Amy Hest wasused extensively throughout the units.Unit activities focused on curriculum concepts. For example, during classroom implementation ofone unit, the children were helped to understand that people aging is a natural and lifelong process.Pictures depicting people (infant through older adults) were used. The children arranged the picturesin chronological order and discussed how people grow and age, and how they were growing andaging. A children's book, When I Get Bigger (1983) by Mercer Mayer, was read and discussed.It was discussed with the children that people continue to develop, learn, and do things through-out life. During this discussion the children were shown pictures of older people in a variety ofactivities such as jogging, swimming, dancing, going to school, working, and reading. A children'sbook, Emma (1985) by Wendy Kesselman, was read and discussed. This book depicts an older womanwho begins to paint when she is 72 years old. The children talked about activities they have seenolder people do, activities they thought would be fun for older people to be involved in, and activitiesthey would like to be involved in as an older person.In relation to planning for becoming an older person, the children talked about \"lifespan\" activi-ties. Lifespan activities are activities that people can do throughout life. The children talked aboutpresent day activities that they would like to continue as older adults. Making this \"lifespan\" con-nection was fun for the children. Also, this was an opportune time for senior citizens to visit anddiscuss their activities.27 20Growth and Development Outcomes, Conclusions, and RecommendationsTo see if attitudes about older people had changed, the children were pre- and post-tested withthe Semantic Differential-Old People from the (CATE) (Jantz,Seefeldt, Galper, and Serock, 1976). The children's attitudes toward older people significantlyimproved following the teaching units.The children's response to the units was rewarding. They eagerly participated in unit activitiesand frequently did not want to stop when the unit was over. They especially enjoyed the books thatwere read. These books provided an excellent starting point for numerous discussions about growingup and growing older. Many of the children related the characters in the stories to older people theyknew.The teachers thought that the unit materials could be easily integrated into the classroom andwere pleased with the students' response. The units did not require a teacher to have an extensivebackground in gerontology. They required a teacher with positive attitudes about aging that couldassist students in developing their own positive attitudes. Teachers were interested in obtaining thebooks used in the units for libraries at the preschools.Aging education can promote more positive attitudes about aging. Children with positive atti-tudes toward their own and others' aging will live more fully each day and have the ability, under-standing, and self-confidence to adapt to aging (McGuire, 1987). They will understand that old agecan be a time of continued growth, development, and fulfillment.ReferencesAmerican Association of Retired Persons. (1991). A profile of older Americans: 1991.

Effective family life education seeks to develop an understanding and appreciationof self and members of the opposite sex, and to promote the responsibilities of functional familyliving. A family life program should begin early in the child's school experience and be more fullydeveloped each year. This type of program at the elementary level can be justified based on thenatural concern that children have for the developmental process at that age.The school classroom setting serves as a place where reliable and accurate family life informationcan be presented in a non-threatening, open atmosphere. Teachers must be very sensitive to their ownbiases and personal qualifications before undertaking sex education in order for objective material tobe presented. Bruess and Greenberg (1981) recommend that the following criteria serve as qualifica-tions for sex educators:1. The teacher must have come to terms with his or her own sexuality, and have admitted notonly to its existence but to its full status in the dynamics of his or her total personality functioning;2. The teacher needs to know the appropriate factual material associated with the subject matterthat he or she is to teach;3. The teacher of sex education needs to be able to use the language of sex easily and naturally,especially in the presence of the young;4. He or she needs to be familiar with the sequence of psychosexual development eventsthroughout life; and,5. The teacher needs an acute awareness of the enormous social changes that are in progress andof their implications for changes in our patterns of sexual attitudes, practices, laws, and institutions.These qualities will help to minimize embarrassment when teaching sex-related materials.One area many teachers are hesitant to discuss is that of the developmental process. This mayrepresent a serious concern to the teacher, particularly in the elementary school. Yet this is a naturalarea of interest and concern to students, especially those in the upper elementary grades. To aid theteacher in acquainting students with the developmental process, the writers have modified an activityoriginally developed by Planned Parenthood of Memphis. This activity may be taught either in mixedgroups or by separating the sexes. It is the feeling of the writers that the activity be taught in co-educational situations whenever possible; however, the activity may be adapted easily to individualteachers' situations.The 'Body Timetable' can be used to help children understand what is happening to their bodies.It is suggested that the teacher introduce the subject by discussing how everyone follows schedulesand how, at certain times, various activities take place. For example, throughout the school day'sschedule, reading, math, or physical education is taught at a prescribed time. Relate to the class thatthe body also has a timetable or schedule for maturation events to occur. The writers suggest that theteacher then proceed with a discussion regarding the fact that girls' timetables are slightly ahead ofthose of boys.The teacher should introduce the 'Body Timetable' to the class and ask them to place a number inthe square to show what order the body events occur. After the students have completed the time-tables, the teacher can more fully explain each event and the correct order in which the events usuallyoccur. Discussion and questions should be encouraged. One way of stimulating discussion would beto give each student an index card and allow each child to write questions anonymously on the cardsto be addressed by the teacher. t By David J. Anspaugh, professor in the Division of Health Science and Safety Education, Memphis State Uni-versity, Memphis, TN, and Gene Ezell, associate and distinguished professor, Health Education, University ofTennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN. Previously published in Health Education, MarchlApril 1984,15(2), 44-46.29 22Growth and Development Thisis an excellent introductory activity to help both the group and the teacher feel at ease. It alsoprovides much needed information for fourth through sixth grade children. The activity is a goodspringboard for further discussion to help students become aware of the physical signs of reachingreproductive maturity.The onset of puberty varies widely (boys from age 10 to 14, and girls from age 8 to 12). It may benecessary for the teacher to discuss the more subtle changes and how the beginning stages often gounnoticed. For the student, the activity and discussion provides assurance that all the changes do nottake place all at once, but rather occur over a period of time. The correct order of change is providedon the 'Body Timetables' shown in Figures 1 and 2.This activity was adapted from a larger curriculum developed by Planned Parenthood ofMemphis under a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The curriculumcontains over 40 activities and includes a series of films designed to promote discussion and decision-making.

Whether temporarily disabled or permanently handicapped or \"differentlyabled,\" the total population coping with disability is quite large and increasing as society ages(Ebersole & Hess, 1990). This growing segment has made us more aware of the difficulties involvedin daily life for those who do not have full use of their limbs or senses.Children can be made aware of these limitations through educational activities that allow them topersonally experience some aspects of the lifestyles of the disabled. All too often our educationalexperiences are limited to the cognitive domain, where we read or hear about situations or people.Activities like the following, which involve the affective domain, allow us to learn through personalexperiences. It is a simple activity that can be easily implemented and is adaptable for many agegroups, especially third grade and up.The SetupThis activity can take place in any classroom that can be rearranged to allow for four stations. Thebest way to set up the room is to put the stations in the corners, with the wheelchair activity con-ducted in the center of the classroom. Materials required for this activity include a television; blind-folds (approximately six); six pairs of household rubber gloves or any type of gloves other than surgi-cal gloves; a box of cotton balls; a 10-12' piece of any type of rope; 2-3 wheelchairs; and a variety ofobjects with different types of surfaces and shapes, such as sandpaper, an orange, paper clips and asmall box.The ProcessDivide the class into four groups, with each group starting at a different station and rotatingthrough the four stations in order. In order to facilitate groupings and maximize class time, theteacher may give each student a piece of paper bearing a number as they enter the classroom. Thisnumber will be their group number, as well as the number of their first station. Groups can thenprecede in numerical order.Each station's activity will require about eight minutes, with time variances depending on thenumber of students and groups. The entire activity, including discussion, can be accomplished in a50-minute class period.Station 1Hearing Deprivation. Have each student put cotton balls in their ears. Turn thetelevision on without the sound.Station 2Sight Deprivation. Blindfold each student except one, who will become the leader.Each of the blindfolded students will hold onto a section of the rope, with the leader at the beginning.The leader will walk around the room, leading the blindfolded students.Station 3Tactile Deprivation. Each student dons a pair of gloves and touches the sandpaperand orange, experiencing different sensations. To test dexterity they can pick up the paper clips andattempt to put them into the box.Station 4Mobility Deprivation. A student sits in a wheelchair, acting the part of a paraplegic,paralyzed from the waist down. The student then attempts to negotiate a row of chairs or desks, withthe row snaking, curving and eventually narrowing. t By Vivien C. Carver, Ed.D., Associate Professor Community Health, The University of Southern Mississippi,Hattiesburg, MS.33 26Growth and Development DiscussionAfter each group has completed all four stations, a classwide discussion is held. Questions areasked about the activities at each station. Appropriate questions include: How did you feel at eachstation? What station presented the most difficulty? the least? Which disability do you think would bethe hardest to live with? Why? Which disability would be the easiest to live with? Why?Discussion should also center around these questions: When you see a disabled person, howshould you interact with them? Has this exercise changed your perception of the disabled? How?ConclusionWhile this activity provides a great deal of enthusiasm and physical participation, it also allowsstudents to understand the difficulties experienced by the disabled. The tremendous amount ofdiscussion generated causes students to examine their beliefs and attitudes about handicapped indi-viduals. Hopefully, the students will develop empathy for the disabled and an appreciation for theirown healthy bodies.ReferenceEbersole, P., & Hess, P. (1990). Toward healthy aging: Human needs and nursing response. St. Louis, MO:C. V. Mosby Publishing Company. WHEN A CHILD IS BORNt The birth of a child should be a celebrated event. Social issues such as abortion, overpopulation, andteenage pregnancy divert attention from the positive aspects of childbirth. Health educators can playa constructive role in promoting a comfortable attitude about pregnancy and childbirth, and dispelsome of the misgivings, varied perceptions, and fears that children develop.One of the most intriguing ways to experience childbirth vicariously in the classroom is to simu-late the birth of a child. This lesson focuses on five major objectives: (1) to observe the birth of a child,(2) to develop a knowledge of the stages in the birth of a child, (3) to participate in the celebration ofthe birth of a child, (4) to present behaviors that represent a healthy prenatal environment, and (5) toengage pupils in activities related to raising a baby healthfully and lovingly.This activity is suitable for elementary grade levels; however, the scope and detail of the contentwill vary. Suggested prerequisite or follow-up activities are listed.MaterialsMaterials needed for this activity include a turtleneck sweater, two cabbage patch dolls, a hos-pital gown, stethoscope, doctors' and nurses' green gowns, face masks, hair caps, and rubber gloves.Additional detail can be included such as a water filled balloon, and red socks stuffed with othersocks.ProcedureThe children have been alerted of the mother's due date. As the date approaches, anticipation andpreparation increases. Energy and excitement builds. Parents are informed about this unit and invited t By Andy Anderson, instructor of physical and health education, University of Western Ontario, London,Ontario. 3 4 When a Child is Born 27 to observe and share in class activities and discussions. A pregnant mother might volunteer to cometo class to let the children hear about how it feels to have a baby inside someone Feeling the babykicking is an exciting sensation. The children also will be learning about stages of development of thebaby in the womb, what to expect in terms of needs of the mother, and how the rest of the family canhelp.When the mother goes into labor, the birthing session begins. Perhaps just before recess, tell thechildren the mother has gone into labor a few hours ago, and when they return to class the motherwill be brought in by ambulance for this event.This activity basically is role playing or simulation. A student volunteers to be the mother. Putthe two dolls inside the sweater, along with the red socks (placenta) and the water balloon (amnioticfluid). Turn the sweater upside down and tie it to the child. Cover this with a hospital smock, thendon your own hospital greens and face mask. Another child may wish to be the father who haschosen to be present. Soft relaxing music may be played to show the children that the environment ofa birthing room is a warm, friendly place. Ultimately, the detail presented during the birthing isdetermined by the teacher.Eventually the babies emerge. You need to manipulate the dolls physically so that birth is headfirst, but breach birth can occur. Dolls are brought out by hand and given to the mother. Surgical cordcan be attached to represent the umbilical cord and can be cut to explain the belly button. The excite-ment shared in this experience is amazing. Students all want to hold the baby, wrap it up, and put itin the cradle they have meticulously prepared. Sometimes, as a reward, a student can take home theclass baby for a night.Perceptions about pregnancy and how babies are born serves as a good lead-up to the event.Anatomical outlines provide appropriate terminology and vocabulary. Math classes can do somecatalogue purchasing of baby essentials and calculate yearly costs associated with child care.Language arts classes can prepare congratulatory cards, birth announcements, and organize a birth-day party. In primary classes the materials can be left at a center for children to use later. Discussionsabout the stages of fetal growth can help to solve mysteries about pregnancy. How humans are bornand cared for can be compared to how other mammals bear, nurture, and care for their young.Students also may study and keep track of changes a baby goes through the first year. For example,weight, length, ability to track objects visually, the ability to grasp, foods consumed, and so on relatewell to many other subject skills. These results may be compared to ways in which other animalsmature and why the human process is different.Extension activities include care and feeding of a baby. Health nurse and parent presentationsserve to demonstrate community concern and respect for babies. Members of the religious com-munity should be invited to share their traditional practices in the celebration and ceremony of chil-dren in the church, e.g., baptism. Discussions regarding the rights of children promote integrity andenhance self-esteem. A visit to the hospital and maternity unit will inspire discussions and consoli-date concepts.Older children can benefit from babysitting courses, infant nutrition, and exercise instruction.Play activities, toy design, and selection ideas can be distributed through newsletters to parents.Often classrooms or whole schools will adopt a child from a third world nation. Funds raised are sentto provide clothing, food, and educational materials. Appreciation of our global responsibility andconcern for children is an important aspect of citizenry.This activity is a rich opportunity to show males that the responsibility of caring for the baby canbe shared by both mother and father.I have found that this unit is a time to share warm feelings about family members and events sur-rounding the birth of younger brothers and sisters, cousins, and even neighbors. Also, class discus-sions abut family ancestry integrate well with social studies activities. This unit can help childrenwho are in blended families become a little more relaxed about their situation and realize how muchthey are loved despite their circumstances. Although the birth is the \"main event,\" the children soonrealize that it is part of a much larger concept.A note to parents before this event may prevent embarrassing questions. Also parents may alertyou to special situations such as adoption that may influence presentation of your message. 35BEST COPY AVAILABLE 28Anatomy and Physiology ANATOMYAND PHYSIOLOGY HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY:UNDERSTANDING THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEMt Grade Level:2-4Time Frame:35 minutesMaterials:Rolls of butcher paper (ideally in colors white, red, yellow, and green), scissors,colored marking pens, construction paper, and masking tapeBackground InformationEven before the publication of the SHES study in 1967, the understanding of the human body as avital component of health education was well established (Green, 1990). As a part of this on-goinghealth education emphasis in the school setting, the gastrointestinal system (aka Digestive System) isone of ten basic body systems that is taught in the elementary grades (Bender & Sorochan, 1989).This activity is designed to act as either an introductory or summary activity. Depending uponthe readiness of the learners, teaching about this system can be limited to the basic parts (mouth,esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine) or expanded to include the \"companion\"organs (gall bladder, pancreas, and liver). The materials can be prepared by either the classroomteacher, or can be a class project leading up to the strategy delineated below. The activity can beadapted easily for students with special needs whether physical or mental in nature. The majorobjective of the activity is to allow the students to obtain an understanding of the gastrointestinalsystem through a digestion simulation.PreparationSelect the number of organs involved in your model. (In this illustration, four are used.) Assignthe parts to four groups of students. The students with the mouth cut white butcher paper longenough and wide enough to cover the door to the classroom. The paper should be slit in the middleto allow for student groups of four or five to pass through without ripping the paper. The design onthe sheet should be an open mouth showing teeth, gums, and tongue. Written on the sheets are twoor three major functions of the mouth A second group prepares a long (red) esophagus that can beplaced upon the floor and wide enough for individual students to walk upon. The same \"functionrule\" applies with the esophagus as it did with the mouth. A third group of students prepares astomach model (e.g., on green paper) large enough for 5 to 10 students to stand upon at one time. 1-13y Dr. Charles Regin, Assistant Professor of Health Education, School of HPER, University of Nevada, LasVegas, NV.36 Human Anatomy and Physiology: Understanding the Gastrointestinal System 29 Again, the functions of the stomach are written upon the sheets. The final student group creates alarge intestine/small intestine model (e.g., on yellow paper). The model should be large enough toallow students to walk upon the intestinal system from start to finish. The functions of both systemsare written in appropriate areas. If more organs are used, they should be placed appropriately on theoutside perimeter with functions listed. It is then decided by the students or teacher which foods aregoing to be \"digested.\" Once determined, the major nutrient components of that food item must beidentified (e.g., a slice of enriched bread = protein, carbohydrates, potassium, and niacin). Thesenutrients are written on sheets of paper which can be taped to student clothes. Before the start of thelesson, the four model components are attached to each other leading from the classroom door andconcluding in the middle of the classroom floor.ImplementationFour or five students are assigned to be a food item. The single sheets of nutrient components ofthe food are taped to each student. Each food item group then bunches close together outside theclassroom door. To begin the process, the students read aloud the function information. The studentsthen proceed through the mouth and are \"broken up\" into individual parts and proceed single fileinto the stomach. Depending upon the size of the stomach, one or more food items can be \"chewedand swallowed.\" (Teacher note: Various additional informational items can be presented by theteacher as this activity progresses.) In the stomach, the digestive process continues as studentsremove the sheets from their clothing that are affected by stomach acids. Each student then passesinto the small intestine where the food item sheets are further digested or \"absorbed\" (i.e., thenutrient sheets are given to students who are standing around the model who represent cells or theblood stream). If other digestive organs are used, then sheets representing their digestive hormones(e.g., insulin, bile, etc.) should be given to the \"pieces\" of food for appropriate response. The studentsthen move into the large intestine, any final nutrients (e.g., water) are absorbed, and the remains\"move out of\" the model.VariationsCombinations with other body systems (e.g., circulatory) can be accomplished to trace the routeof the nutrients. Each system can have its own model created and students can role play the activecomponents of each specific system. The activity can be easily integrated into other academic areas(e.g., science). In addition, body systems are basic and can, depending upon the readiness of thestudents, be taught with either a great deal of information or using limited detail.ReferencesBender, S.

Sharing is bound tobe the best contributor to this search.In sharing, the author has found this play to be a highly motivating approach to the teaching ofthe digestive system. \"What Happened to the Apple\" is geared toward upper elementary aged stu-dents, but works quite well with \"low achieving\" junior high school students. Audience participationallows all class members to become involved and interested.After the narrator closes the play, students May want to try different roles. The play takes no morethan five minutes to perform and can easily be repeated. Hopefully, students will memorize theapple's path with enthusiasm.What Happened to the Apple?Characters: Apple, Stomach, Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Mouth and Teeth, and the entire audi-ence.Apple: That girl just picked me up. Oh No!Mouth and Teeth: Let's grind this apple into small pieces so the stomach won't have to do it. Teeth,when you're finished, have the tongue move the smaller pieces to the throat. Mouth, you turn onyour hoses and wet this food down with saliva so that the throat won't complain when it swallows.Apple: It sure is dark in here! Where am I anyway?Audience: You, apple, are in the stomach! and You look more like applesauce after what themouth and teeth did to you.Apple: But how did I get here?Audience: You came down the esophagus!Stomach: Oops! Looks like my rest is over. I've got to get busy and digest more food. It sure isrough work breaking up carbohydrates and protein. But, at least there is no fat coming in this time. Ihate breaking up fat!Audience: Hey, stomach. Do you like your job?Stomach: Most of the time my boss treats me pretty well, but every now and then he delivers thewrong kind of food and I go on strike!Apple: Whoo! Where am I going now? What's happening to me?Audience: Don't you know apple? Your time in the stomach is up now; you have to go to the smallintestine.Small Intestine: I can't wait to absorb you into my blood, apple!Apple: But what will happen to me when I'm in your blood?Small Intestine: Your carbohydrates will be burned for energy and your protein can be used forgrowth and repair of the body.Audience: Hey small intestine! How are you going to absorb the apple?Small Intestine: Well, I must admit, it won't be an easy task. I'll have to have help from my friends,Liver and Pancreas.Apple: There's not much of me left! But I'm still here. The small intestine didn't use all of me. I stillhave my roughage and some of my water.Audience: Here comes the large intestine.Large Intestine: I'm gonna be glad to get that apple in meI like roughage. I'll soak up thatleftover water as well.Narrator: The large intestine did soak up the apple's leftover water. Then the large intestine com-pacted and eliminated the roughage from the body. The body was grateful to the apple for providingso many good nutrients. tBy RichardA. Crosby, Department of Health Education, Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant, MI.

Andwhenever teaching is the topic, two questions always will be raised: (1) what should be taught? and(2) how should it be taught? This article suggests answers to these questions of hearing health cur-riculum and method.CurriculumThere is a lot of agreement, at least among authors of health textbooks, about what should consti-tute the elementary school hearing health curriculum. In general, this curriculum can be divided intofive categories of information:(1) the physical process of hearing(2) the nature of sound(3) what noise is and why it is a concern(4) signs and causes of hearing problems(5) how to protect one's hearing.Within each of these five areas of the curriculum is a set of concepts which define the content, that is,what is usually taught. Examples of concepts in each of these five areas are presented in the diagrambelow:I. Hearing Process ...Ear has three parts (diagram of ear)brain interprets sounds from earsII. Nature o f Sound ...is air moving or vibratingis wave motionvaries in loudness and pitchloudness is measured in decibelsinsulating materials reduce loudnessIII. Noise...can damage healthcan disturb sleep, cause stress, headachesis considered pollution if excessiveis caused by traffic, appliancescan be fought by lawscan be reduced at homeIV.

Protect Hearing by . ..turning down TV and radionot sticking things in earswashing earswearing hearing protectionhearing check-ups (doctors and nurseslook in ears, use audiometer andotoscope) While the concepts listed above can be thought of as a starting point or basic curriculum forteaching hearing health, there are many more concepts that could also be included in a completehearing health curriculum. Listed below are some additional concepts to consider: t By Alan M. Frager, Associate Professor in the Department of Teacher Education, Miami University, Oxford,Ohio. The article was previously published in Journal of Health Education, July /August 1992, 23(5), 310-311. 39BEST COPY AVAILABLE 32Anatomy and Physiology (1) Pain does not always accompany hearing loss.(2) Mild hearing losses can create frustrating communication situations.(3) A person might not know if he or she has a noise-caused hearing problem.(4) There are many different kinds of hearing loss.(5) An audiologist is a person who works at identifying and preventing hearing problems.(6) Audiograms tell a lot about a person's hearing health, but not everything about it.(7) Hearing protection is worn by workers in many professions, including: construction, airlinework, landscaping, and the military.(8) Hearing impairment ranges from mild loss of hearing to total deafness.(9) Hearing aids gather sound, electrically intensify it, and channel it to the ear.MethodsHaving students read relevant chapters in health textbooks is a widely used, traditional methodfor teaching about hearing health. Since the texts do contain basic curricular information, they can beuseful resources when teachers skillfully guide students' reading in them. However, for two reasonsat least, instruction should extend beyond texts: (1) to create and provide hands-on activities sochildren can experience concepts presented in texts, and (2) to provide additional information onhearing health because textbooks tend to sacrifice in-depth exploration of a topic like hearing healthin order to cover as many topics as possible. Below is a list of suggested activities and informationresources to help elementary school teachers go beyond health texts:Activities(1) Examining an audiogram. Most or all students have had their hearing tested with an audio-meter, but few ever get to see and explore an audiogram, which is a graph of results of an audiometerexam. Studying an audiogram can introduce students to many important concepts, such as soundintensity (measured in dB) and sound frequency (measured in Hertz). When students compare differ-ent audiograms they can learn how a hearing impaired person might be able to hear some soundsand not others. A good related activity would be to examine an audiogram of a person with a hearingloss that occurs at selected frequencies and then determine which familiar sounds the subject of theaudiogram would be unable to hear.(2) Examining headphones, ear plugs, and other hearing protection devices. Apply the principle of\"seeing is believing,\" or in this case, \"hearing is believing.\" Using a sound effects record or any loudsound source, create an opportunity for every child to experience how ear plugs or other hearing pro-tection devices cut down the volume of sound but still permit the wearer to hear enough to continuefunctioning safely at the task at hand.(3) Keeping a noise log. To increase students' awareness of sounds, ask them to \"just listen\" for twominutes or so and write, in a notebook, sources of sounds they hear. Do this activity in the lunchroom and outside, at recess; then share results in a discussion. Using a graph of intensities and fre-quencies of sound sources (watch tick-30dB; air conditioner-60 dB) from the health text or obtainedfrom the Environmental Protection Agency, have students find out the intensities and frequencies ofas many sound sources in their noise logs as possible.(4) Discovering noise-insulation. To demonstrate how some materials are better sound insulatorsthan others, drop a marble from the same height onto an empty metal container, a piece of carpet, afloor tile, an acoustic tile, and a piece of wood. Ask students to identify which material deadens thesound most and, as a class, try to explain why. Using their noise logs, children can note use orabsence of noise insulating materials throughout the school and in their homes.(5) Learning about hearing health professionals. Students should be aware that noise and hearing lossare serious problems in American society, and that people in many professions work to resolve theseproblems. One such professional usually is employed in the school systemthe speech, hearing, andlanguage professional. Invite this person to share with your class his or her experiences and knowl-edge of screening and referring persons with hearing impairment as well as of helping children over-come speech and language problems. For different perspectives on hearing health concerns otherprofessionals, such as lawyers, can be invited to explain how laws are written to limit excessive noise40 Teaching Children to Protect and Conserve Their Hearing 33 in public places; government officials, to explain how laws are written to limit excessive noise inpublic places; government officials, to explain how noise-limiting laws are enforced; and constructionand faculty managers, to explain what measures management and workers must take to protect theirhearing.Information ResourcesSounds Alive: DC: MetropolitanWashington Council of Governments for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of NoiseAbatement.

On the average, eachAmerican eats out almost 200 times a year. Out of every five dollars spent eating out, two dollars goto fast food restaurants (Pruitt & Stein, 1994). Fast food dining often equates to increased fat andsodium consumption and a decrease in nutrient dense and high fiber food choices.However, fast food restaurants have also provided Americans with convenient access to quick,inexpensive meals that are often a necessity in our sometimes hectic lifestyle. For some subgroups inour culture, such as adolescents, teenagers, and older adults, fast food restaurants have also served asa social center or community meeting place. In some cases the fast food restaurant or shopping mallfood court may present the first opportunity for older elementary school children to make their ownfood choices.While fast food restaurants continue to offer foods high in fat, sodium, and sugar, many haveresponded to the increasing nutritional awareness of Americans by adding to or modifying menuselections. Salad bars, fruit juices, low fat/skim milk, whole wheat rolls, and grilled or baked chickenand fish are examples of some of these changes. In many situations it is now possible to order fastfood meals with increased nutritional quality.The following teaching activities are intended to assist intermediate level elementary children inthe development of consumer skills related to fast food dining. Prior to participation in all of theseactivities, it will be important for students to develop a knowledge base related to the nutritionalvalue and fat, sodium, and sugar levels of different foods. Student should also be aware of the healthrisks associated with poor dietary habits.Fast Food FeelingsThe \"Fast Food Feelings\" activity provides an opportunity for students to share their thoughtsand feelings about fast food restaurants with each other and their teacher. In addition, the activityprovides an opportunity for the teacher to not only become familiar with students' feelings but also to gain an awareness of the role fast food restaurants play in the dietary lives of students.To begin the activity, the \"Fast Food Feelings\" sheet is distributed to students (See Figure 1). Stu-dents are first given a few minutes alone to write out answers to the items on the sheet. Then studentsshare their responses with each other in small groups. The entire class then discusses their responses with the teacher.Healthy ChoicesOften minor changes in food selection, food preparation, or choice of condiments can have animpact on the fat, sodium, or sugar consumed in a fast food meal. The purpose of this activity is to help students develop skills in making these minor changes. tBy David A. Birch, Ph.D., CHES, School of Health Physical Education and Recreation, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN.42 In this activity the children are given amenu sheet with several meals already identi-fied (see Figure 2). From the menu sheet chil-dren will make modifications and changes inthe foods listed to decrease the fat, sodium,and sugar in the foods. The changes are listedon the bottom of the sheet. Students can makethese changes individually or in small groups.Changes can then be discussed with the entireclass. It will be important to stress to studentsthat minor changes in a fast food meal canoften lead to a considerable reduction in fat,sodium, and/or sugar. Examples of substitu-tions/changes that students may make,include the following:A single hamburger without mayonnaisefor the double cheeseburger.A grilled chicken or fish sandwich for thefried fish sandwich or fried chicken nug-gets.A baked potato or salad with low-fat dress-ing for the french fries.Fruit juice, low fat or skim milk for the sodaor milkshake.An alternative or follow-up activity to theMenu Sheet could be the utilization of actualmenus from fast food restaurants. Most restau-rants will provide nutritional information fortheir foods. This information could be used inconjunction with the menus.Fast Food ConsumerismWhile some fast food restaurants havemoved in the direction of more food choicesand nutrition labeling, more consumer pres-sure may lead to even further changes. The fol-lowing activities are designed to assist in thedevelopment of consumer skills that can beapplicable to other areas in addition to foodconsumerism.Assign groups of students to write letters todifferent fast food restaurants asking fornutritional information for foods on theirmenus. Each group could then report theirfindings to the entire class. If a fast foodrestaurant is unwilling to provide the nutri-tional information then the group could fol-low the initial letter with a letter to therestaurant's main headquarters asking forthe information.Developing Fast Food Consumer Skills 35 Select certain items which may be missingfrom a specific fast food restaurant's menuor an existing item which could be preparedin a more healthful way (grilling or bakinginstead of frying, skin removed fromchicken breast, etc.). Have students begin aletter writing campaign to the restaurant orits headquarters requesting the changes.Discuss the progress of the campaign inclass.

Figure Substitute for one item in each meal to reduceeither fat, sodium, or sugar.Identify a complete fast food meal low in fat,sodium, and sugar. 43 36Consumer Health Fast Food AdvertisingAdvertisements for fast food restaurants often become well known in the media culture of bothchildren and adults. Seldom do these advertisements tout the nutritional quality of fast foods. For this activity students can create advertisements that promote healthy choices available at fast food restaurants. The advertisements created can be in the form of posters or even videotapes. Students should be encouraged to use variations of slogans or themes that are utilized in actual fast food advertisements. The actual advertisements can be displayed or shown to others in the school or to parents at parent/school functions.Fast food dining has become a regular event for many people including children. Through thedevelopment of specific skills related to fast food dining, individuals can still enjoy the advantages of quick meals while consuming moderate amounts of fat, sodium, and sugar.ReferencePruitt, B. E., & Stein, J. J. (1994). Healthstyles. Philadelphia: Saunders College Publishing. AM I REALLY GETTING THE MESSAGE?AN EXERCISE IN CONSUMER AWARENESSt[This Teaching Idea is presented as a high school/college activity, however,the Editors believe it can be easily adapted for use at the elementary level.]Since the profit motive is the driving force behind most of the advertising industry, the primary purpose of advertising is to persuade people to purchase products and services. Unfortunately, thisfrequently translates into creating needs and manipulating the behavior of ill-informed, gullible consumers who are easily misled by unsubstantiated advertising claims. In a one-month survey of American newspapers and magazines, the Food and Drug Administration found 435 questionable ads, over half of which were for weight-loss products (Miller, 1985).Assessment of messages contained in advertising is a critical aspect of consumer health. Only by being alert, aware, and analytical can consumers determine which claims are legitimate and which are fraudulent or dangerous. It is appropriate to develop these skills in college students becauseyoung adults have tremendous purchasing power and frequently are targeted as an audience by advertisers. Students at this level have expressed a special interest in fraudulent health practices(Gaines, 1984).This class activity was designed for use in high school and college-level classes. The objective wasto provide basic information about advertising techniques and strategies and to encourage students to use this knowledge by analyzing selected advertisements in small group discussions.Class PreparationOne week prior to the lesson, instruct students to clip or photocopy two advertisements to be brought to class on the day of the lesson. Suggest sources such as magazines, newspapers, tabloids, tBy M. DawnLarsen, Assistant Professor of Health Science, Mankato State University, Mankato, MN. Thisarticle was previously published in the Journal of Health Education, November /December 1991, 22(6), 363- 364.44 Am I Really Getting the Message? 37 pamphlets, and promotional fliers. Having them bring two ads will help guard against duplication ofads within groups.If the class text does not include material on advertising techniques, instructors should providestudents with appropriate information. The following information was adapted from Cornacchia andBarrett (1989). This material was presented in a brief lecture and summarized in a handout forstudents.Appeal Techniques Used in AdvertisingPuffery: Describes item vaguely or generally with subjective opinions, superlatives, or exaggerations,stating no specific facts. Examples: Bayer works wonders; Pepto-Bismol with the famous coatingaction.Power words: Use of words that mean little, but Examples: fights; works harder;improves; rely on . .; used in hospitalsand labs; used by millions; isn't it time you tried .. .?Endorsements or testimonials: Claims of effectiveness by physicians, dentists, entertainers, athletes,other celebrities.Generalizations: Grand statements that actually are vague and say little. Examples: Winning withAnacin; world-proven; many don't get the vitamins they need.Imagery/visuals: Subliminal persuasion through appeal to emotion. Examples: Effective use of color;beauty of people or environments; contrast, music, and animation (in commercials).Novelty/mystical aspects: Implication that a new, different, or mysterious ingredient increases effec-tiveness. Examples: Nature's beauty secret; contains X from Europe; special ingredients.Slogans, symbols, humor: Special lyrics, phrases, jokes that help you remember the product.Examples: Nothing runs like a Deere; STP is the racer's edge.Misleading comparisons: Encourage consumers to jump to conclusions. Examples: Contains twice asmuch; up to 8-hour relief; relieves pain faster; hospitals use Tylenol 18 times more than all otherbrands.Rebates/rewards: Financial incentives for purchasing something. Examples: Special rebate for thosewho act before May 1; free bonus for first 100 customers; second item for only $1 more!Scientific studies or evidence: Implication that research has shown a product to be superior.Examples: Clinical tests show; created by research scientists; studies have strongly indicated.Superiority: Implications that a product performs better than all others. Examples: Leading; best;increased; more of; stronger.Social appeal: Implications that a product makes you more socially acceptable or places you amongthe elite. Examples: Raise your hand if you're Sure; L'oreal .because I'm worth it!Discussion Formation Small GroupsRandomly assign students to small groups of five or six students each. Have each contribute onead for group analysis, avoiding duplication where possible. Distribute consumer health worksheets toall group members, instructing students to use them for collective analysis of the ads. Instructors maylist advertising techniques on a chalkboard or have students refer to their handouts for assistance inanswering question three. This discussion usually takes about 20 or 30 minutes of class time.Consumer Health Worksheet1. Explain the \"message\" the ad is trying to convey (What is your first reaction upon seeing orreading the ad?).2. To what \"part of you\" does the appeal?a. Basic needsb. Created needsc. Valuesd. Emotions45 38Consumer Health 3. What techniques does the ad use to convey the message?4. What are the suggested consequences of using or not using the product?5. Does the ad offer evidence to support these claims? If so, is it:a. Factual evidenceb. Scientific verificationc.Statistical Why?c. Accurate by misleading? ad convinced you to buy the product? How?If interaction develops slowly, it is helpful for instructors to visit each group to help clarify theassignment and stimulate discussion. Explain that the object of the assignment is not necessarily toachieve consensus but to promote productive and honest discussion of these techniques and theireffectiveness. Have students write brief notes and comments about each ad on their consumer work-sheets.Each group should choose one ad to present to the class and one individual to present discussionresults. Stress that these should include areas of disagreement as well as consensus. Dissentingopinions may, in fact, be of more interest, since they often lead to animated class discussions. Thesepresentations often overlap into the next class period, since group discussions may have taken 30minutes of a standard class. If so, give each group a number and have students place their names andgroup number on their individual consumer worksheets. Instructors then can collect the worksheetsand redistribute them by groups during the next class session. This ensures that worksheets will notbe lost and minimizes time needed to reorganize groups.ReferencesCornacchia, H. J., & Barret, S. (1989). Consumer health (4th ed.).

This strategy uses humor to ridicule and debunk the glamorous or machoimage of smoking. Few people realize the cigarette industry actually supported legislation to have itsadvertisements removed from television (Warner, 1985). Cigarette manufacturers did this becausetheir own analysis indicated the \"equal time doctrine\" mandating a small number of anti-smokingads on television was having an adverse effect on corporate sales. The cigarette industry supportedremoval of their ads on television in order to reduce public exposure to effective counter advertising.The cigarette corporations then shifted their television advertising dollars to other methods of adver-tising such as magazines, point of sale promotion, billboards and sponsorship of music or sportingevents. The total number of dollars spent on cigarette promotion last year was 3.27 billion (MMWR,1990).The classroom offers a unique opportunity to reuse this highly effective strategy of counteradvertising. The following teaching activity has been successfully conducted among fifth and sixthgrade students. It also has been used as the basis for a statewide contest.The objective of the activity is to emphasize the negative social and health liabilities of tobaccouse. This is accomplished by having students develop clever rhyming anti-smoking warning labelsthat could be hypothetically placed on cigarette packages. Negative images of tobacco and humorous,satirical blows to the tobacco industry are encouraged. This teaching activity requires paper, crayonsand an overhead projector. Approximately one hour of time is needed to complete the project.The teacher poses the following question to introduce the topic and test students' knowledge ofcigarette warning labels, \"What is required by law on all cigarette packages sold in the UnitedStates?\" Make students aware that the correct answer is no longer a warning label but a series of fourrotating warning labels. Have students verbally recall the content of these messages. Use an overheadto briefly review the following actual language of current warnings.Surgeon General's Warning: Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, andmay complicate pregnancy.Surgeon General's Warning: Quitting smoking now reduces several risks to your health.Surgeon General's Warning: Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide.Surgeon General's Warning: Smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury, pre-mature birth, and low birth weight. tBy Gordon B. Lindsay, Ph.D., Brigham Young University, Provo, UT; Gary Edwards, M.S., Director, Bureauof Health Promotion and Risk Reduction, Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT; and Chris Chalkley,M.S., Program Manager, Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, Utah Department of Health, Salt LakeCity, UT.47 40Substance Abuse Prevention The teacher then states that, while these ads are very accurate, they sound dull and boring. Students are challenged to see who can create the most flashy warning labels to recommend to the Surgeon General. The ads should appeal to youth and focus on short-term immediate consequencesof cigarette use. The teacher explains the assignment has the following four rules:(1) Each label must be four lines long.(2) The second and fourth lines must rhyme, as in a poem.(3) The warning must be written on the paper provided by the teacher.(4) The warning labels should address smoking and not demean smokers.The teacher sets a completion time and answers questions. Students are provided with a list of tobacco-related words to assist them with the challenge of making the warning labels rhyme. Students should be informed that this list of words associated with smoking is not comprehensive and to use their own ideas.Potential Words for the by sharing some past examples of rhyming warning labels. The following four are some of the better past entries and do a good job of launching student efforts in the right direction.Instead of smokingGo eat a twinkleYou might gain some weightBut you sure won't get stinky.It hurts little babiesIt makes them too smallAdvice for young mothersIs don't smoke at all.These cigarettes were madeFrom moldly horse poop.You're dumb if you smoke them.Love, Surgeon General KoopRoses are redTobacco is brown.Athletes don't use itCause it slows them down.43 Creative Anti-Smoking Warning Labels 41 After students have submitted their entry, conduct a vote to determine the best anti-smokingmessages. Place the ads in a conspicuous place in the school building.. Additional coverage of theclass activity can be gained by contacting the newspaper, television and radio media to share themore clever entries. Short humorous antidotes are sought for the local news programs. Local radiostations are willing to have students audiotaped reading their warning labels. These short spots canbe read at appropriate times such as The Great American Smokeout. Winning ads can be sent to statehealth departments for wider dissemination. The United States Surgeon General and the UnitedStates Office on Smoking and Health would also welcome your students' creativity and corres-pondence.SummaryCigarette counter advertising has been an effective public health education strategy for reducingthe number one cause of preventable death in the United States. The promotion of a rhymingwarning label contest is a meaningful activity that fosters students' creativity and reinforces thephysical, aesthetic and social liabilities of tobacco use. This activity has strong value for mediacoverage by local newspaper, radio, and television. This teaching technique should be used tocomplement the important resistance to peer pressure skills training and other necessary componentsof proven substance abuse curricula.ReferencesGreen, P.

Some ways are easier than others; some ways are more effective than others; some waysare more expensive than others. Think about the following two ways to deliver information aboutcocaine:\"Describe some of the possible effects of cocaine use on the community.\"\"...increase of violent crime, increase of businesses leaving the community, increase in the number ofgangs, and an increase in sickness.\"That's one way of doing it. Here's another way, from a grades seven-to-nine lesson calledCocaine, in the drug education curriculum Here's Looking At You, 2000 \u00ae, published by ComprehensiveHealth Education Foundation:(1) After reading about cocaine and its effects, and after sharing information with classmates,students organize into cooperative learning teams. Each team then gets a work sheet that will enablethem to determine how to help a community. tBy Neal Starkman, writer and developer at Comprehensive Education Foundation, Seattle, WA. This articlewas previously published in the Journal of Health Education, November /December 1993 Supplement, S-47-S48.49BEST COPY AVAILABLE 42Substance Abuse Prevention (2) The work sheet describes The Community,\" which has seen an increase in use of cocaine andother drugs, particularly among teenagers. The result is that The Community has become less safeand less healthy for the people living in it.(3) The work sheet describes in detail the people who are threatening The Community: the im-porters, the gang leaders, the gang members, the \"back-up\" (young teenagers who serve as lookoutsand runners), and the users.(4) The work sheet describes in detail the people who can help save The Community: police offi-cers, families, school administrators, community groups, and media representatives.(5) Students draw up a plan to save The Community. The plan must include who will beinvolved, what they will do, and how they will stop each threat.(6) Teams then present the plans to the class, and the teacher works with the class to implementat least part of the plans, for example, by selecting someone to speak at a PTA meeting.Think like an eighth grader: Which class would you rather be in? Which class do you think willretain the information longer? Which class do you think will be motivated to learn more?The point? Lecture and discussion is not every student's cup of tea. Nor is singing. Nor is watch-ing a video. Nor listening to an audio, reading a book, playing a game, doing a role play. But,together, now you've got a curriculum!Here are a few more examples, based on lessons already developed for curricula like Here'sLooking At You, 2000 \u00ae:AudiotapesThink about making an audiotape of sounds of activities that kids can take part in instead of tak-ing drugs. Then let students guess what the sounds represent: playing cards, bowling, dancing,swimming. The audiotape is engaging, and it also emphasizes safe, healthy, and fun alternatives todrugs.BooksIn a high school lesson on the AIDS prevention curriculum Get Real about AIDS', published byComprehensive Health Education Foundation, students read a book called Your Decision. The booklets the reader make decisions about relationships, drugs, and sex, select any of dozens of paths basedon those decisions, and explore the consequences of those decisions. Interactive books like YourDecision help students participate in their own stories.VideotapesVideotapes are not a magic formula, even though both students and teachers like them. Effectivevideotapes, like effective books, engage the student. Consider videotapes that model skills: The mosteffective videotapes will be ones in which students can relate to the situations portrayed.PostersAsk students to make their own posters, either as a cross-age activity (e.g., middle-school stu-dents can make posters for students in lower grades) or for their own classroom. Posters are effectivewhen they're dramatic, concise, and leave a lasting image. They can be used as springboards fordiscussions as well as closing thoughts.Board GamesIn Get Real about AIDSTm's upper elementary and middle school units, a game called Immunityhelps students review what they've learned about HIV and AIDS. Students divide into two teams, T-cells and Germs, and plan strategies dependent upon their ability to answer questions. You can havestudents make up their own board games, too. Think about the objectives of the lesson, and writecontent cards based on those objectives. Then, students can move various spaces and try to achievecertain goals based on how well they know the information.50 Different Cups of Tea43 MagazinesHere's Looking At You, 2000\u00ae's grades four-through-twelve units feature a magazine made spe-cifically for the curriculumHere & NowTM. The magazine gives students information about drugsand chemical dependency by using a student-friendly format that includes jokes, quizzes, stories,interviews, and fun graphics. One advantage of a class making its own magazine is that there's some-thing to do for everyone: writing, graphics, proofreading, research, and coordination.PlaysIn the grades ten-through-twelve unit of Here's Looking At You, 2000 \u00ae, students put on a playcalled Lana and Aaron Meet the Just-Say-No Students from Another Galaxy. In the play, two students tryto make an effective decision among many sources of influence. Students love plays; again, it's anengaging way to deliver information.ConclusionThere are many other cups of tea, all around you. Elementary school teachers, in particular, areknown for using the most common items (paper clips, pine cones, poker chips) in order to teach stu-dents important concepts. And sometimes a funny thing happens: your work becomes students' play.Having only one cup of tea is boring and often not very nutritious. Think about the differentways you learn. Quite often, in education, the medium is the message. We need to use as many mediaas we can to get across as many messages as we can. T IC-TAC-TO Et Want to get your students interested, involved, and excited? Need something different to motivateeveryone from the brightest to the least gifted in your classes? Strike it rich with something as simpleas tic-tac-toe.In tic-tac-toe students pair up and administer their own game by being master/mistress of cere-monies, judge, and contestant at the same time. Students love to compete and cannot be passive whileplaying this game. It's based on the timeless game everyone knows how to play, so attention can beplaced on learning or reviewing the material at hand.First, I wrote questions and answers on our current unit. Questions were then judged as easy,medium, or difficult. Difficult questions should not be true/false, in order to eliminate guesswork.The number of questions can be adjusted to your material or time restraints. Table 1 lists a sample ofquestions used in our substance abuse edition.I began with 25 easy and medium questions and 6 difficult questions. Fewer difficult questionsare needed because they earn fewer squares within the tic-tac-toe grid. The questions are typed withthe acceptable answers following. For example: Chewing tobacco causes a white patch in the mouthcalled .(leukoplakia)One copy of each question is needed for each two students in the class. I used several differentmethods for preparing the necessary questions. They can be typed on colored paper, coded for thedegree of difficulty. Another way is to type all questions on white paper and code them for difficultyby marking the end of the sheets with the appropriate color. One copy of each question is then placedin an envelope; the envelope is sealed and slit at one end to expose the color coded end of the ques-tions (questions can thus be selected without being read). Another method is to print the questions oncardstock, of three different colors; these are more durable but take more time to prepare. t By Mary Lawler, teacher at Greenfield Central High School, Greenfield, IN. This article was previously pub-lished in the Journal of Health Education, January /February 1993, 24(1), 58-60.5 44Substance Abuse Prevention The class is divided into partners to begin the game. Once a player selects a difficulty level, theiropponent reads the appropriate level question from the cardstock stack or envelope. The first playeranswers and, if correct, places their symbol, X or 0, in the tic-tac-toe grid. Xs or Os earned withcorrect responses to easy questions can only be placed in the four corners, medium questions in themid-box, and difficult questions in the center of the grid, as shown in Figure 1.Missed questions are returned to the stack or envelope and remain in play until answeredcorrectly. It is possible the question may recycle to be asked of the player who previously played it.However, it is entirely by chance and students are rewarded for remembering. Only the difficulty ofthe question is in the control of a player, not the actual question selected.Players continue taking turns until the game is won or a draw is declared. Players then draw anew tic-tac-toe grid, and continue playing until all questions have been answered correctly and takenout of play. Progress throughout the game varies with ability of the students. Students in my healthclasses (grades 9 and 10) play the entire packet in 30 to 45 minutes.Students benefit by working at a self-paced, directed activity at a difficulty level of their ownchoosing. They are involved on task with reading, answering, judging answers, and planningstrategy. The teacher's role should be only as final judge for accuracy and fairness.The game is easily adaptable to any subject material and grade level. It has been a fun, excitingactivity that left my students involved, interested, and excited over health class.

Teachers should not stifle learning and should have as much fun doing creativeprojects as the students do.Creativity LearnersCreativity is the rare capacity for developing insights, sensitivities, and appreciations in intellec-tual or artistic activity. Dorothy Rodgers, a child psychologist, reminds us that different types oflearners exist, the bright child and the creative child. Both can have equally high levels of IQ andexcellent capacities for learning. The bright child fits well into the traditional structured academicenvironment. Creative students may not fit the expectation of the teacher and may be labeled asunwilling to cooperate if the teacher fails to recognize their creative aspects (Rodgers, 1969).Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist, takes the creativity learning idea even further andsuggests seven differences in learning, or multiple intelligences. The seven intelligences are:(1) Linguistic intelligence is found in students who have highly developed auditory skills andenjoy creative activities with sounds or language.(2) Logical /mathematical learners, being conceptual thinkers, love to manipulate the environmentand to expore patterns, relationships, and categories.(3) Spatial intelligence is seen in students who find they do best in seeing things done graphicallyor in picture form. Spatial learners day dream a lot.(4) Musical intelligence is found in students who like music. These students are sensitive to non-verbal sounds in the environment. They are rhythmically oriented.(5) The bodily-kinesthetic learner is physically active. These kids process knowledge through bodilysensations. Some are gifted with fine motor coordination and do well in sports and physical activities.(6) Interpersonal intelligence students are the people-oriented students. They may be seen emergingas leaders among their peers. These students can organize, manipulate people, socialize, and com-municate well with others.(7) Intrapersonal intelligence is seen in children who possess strong personalities. Most shy awayfrom group activities and prefer to bloom in solitude and show a strong sense of independence.Cone of Learning: Experiential Learning in Health EducationSeveral educationally related constructs promote creative health education in a school setting.One key construct is that health education should be as experiential as possible. The closer thelearning activity can come to providing real meaning to the student, the more likely the learning will By Thomas C. Timmreck, Professor in the Department of Health Science and Human Ecology, California StateUniversity, San Bernardino, San Bernardino, CA. TIts article was previously published in the Journal ofHealth Education, March /April 1994, 25(2), 114-115 . Creative Health Education and the Healthy Stuffed Animal/Muppet Adventure 47 be retained. If the learning experience can be kept at the bottom of the \"Cone of Learning\" (Dale,1954), the more likely it is that it will be experimental (see Figure 1).One creative way to tap into the different learning styles while providing an experientialapproach is to connect school health education activities to health learning at home. One such crea-tive activity is the \"Stuffed Animal Health Education Learning Adventure.\"The Healthy Stuffed Animal Adventureas a Learning ExperienceThe healthy stuffed animal adventure is a fun experiential learning activity which causes theelementary student to become involved with assessing his or her own personal health and nutritionalbehaviors through the medium of a stuffed animal or a muppet-type puppet. The stuffed animal goeshome with the child and participates in the same health-related activities that the child does. Thiscreative health education activity allows students with different approaches to learning to experiencetheir own health behaviors while interacting with a stuffed animal or a muppeta non-threateningfriend that all children can relate to. This project works best in the middle levels of elementary schoolexperience. For the \"adventure\" to be effective, it should be a part of a major unit on health. Thechildren need some understanding about health and nutrition in order for the \"adventure\" to have itshighest level of success.How the Adventure WorksThe elementary teacher obtains a wash-able 12-inch (or so) stuffed animal such as arabbit or other cute animal (or muppet-typepuppet). All students should have an equalchance of taking the stuffed animal home onits adventure.The teacher develops a chart system tocheck the animal out and back in each time.The animal is to go home with the child afterschool, spending the afternoon, evening, night,and morning with the student and is checkedin at the beginning of the school day the nextmorning. The teacher needs to obtain a largetote bag to put the animal and its personalitems in since students take the stuffed animalhome on the bus or have to walk and need away of carrying it.A journal or log book is needed. The logbook goes home with the child, who keeps arunning written narrative of the overnightstay. In the running written narrative, the childtells of the fun and adventurous things thathappen. Most of all, the written narrativeshould tell about all the health promotingactivities and other related events that oc-curred while the two of them were together onthe overnight adventure. The student shouldwrite down whether he or she exercised whileplaying, what he or she had for snacks, dinner,and breakfast, and about taking a bath, brush-ing teeth, washing hands (sanitation), sleeping,and other fun activities.Figure 1CONE OF LEARNING EXPERIENCE WORDS SOUND ONLYAUDIO Thomas C.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE 48Health Promotion Students can give the animal small health-promoting gifts if they want (no food items). The childgives a short presentation to the class at the beginning of the next school day on adventures with thestuffed animal. Focus on telling about health promoting activities. The teacher may let the student usethe log book to help remember what he or she did on the overnight adventure.The teacher should write up a set of instructions and rules for the overnight adventure. Theinstructions should be pasted in front of the log in a manner that will last through the 30 to 40adventures. Instructions should include care of the animal, carrying and handling the stuffed animalon the bus, how to write in the journal, and what to write in the journal. The teacher may provide afew specific health-promoting activities to look for to record in the journal.A washable animal should be selected. A muppet-type puppet, if sturdy and cute, might be aneven more fun and creative approach. When giving the report, the student could talk through thepuppet. Muppet-type puppets can be fun to play with, and they provide much more interaction thana stuffed animal. Another creative approach would be for the teacher to serve as the puppeteer andmake the puppet come alive by asking students about the fun and healthy things they did. Theteacher could use the log for a prompt to have the puppet converse with students about the overnightadventure. Muppet-type puppets are curious, life-like, and intriguing to all ages and would bewelcomed into the home of the student (Timmreck, 1978).Creative health education is a fun and exciting adventure for the elementary teacher. Learningstyles and approaches of students considered, fun learning mediums such as muppet-type puppetsand stuffed animals, allow the greatest participation by all students. Experientially based health edu-cation adventures are most rewarding for the student because school and learning at home arebrought together.ReferencesArmstrong, T. (1987). In their own way.

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS FACILITATORSOF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HEALTH EDUCATION CARNIVALSt During the early 1980s, Watts and Stinson (1981) began to advocate \"health education carnivals\" forelementary school students. These carnivals are similar to traditional health education fairs whichhave been popular for years (Daughtrey, 1976; Lafferty, Guyton & Pratt, 1976; McKenzie, Scheer &Williams, 1981). The most obvious similarity of the carnivals and fairs is that they both employ manyof the same instructional strategies and materials. However, where a typical health fair includes tBy Parris R. Watts, Associate Professor of Health Education at the University of Missouri-Columbia,Columbia, MO, and David K. Hosick, former eighth grade science and health teacher in the Phelps CountyMissouri School District. He currently is a ninth grade science and health instructor at Blue Springs JuniorHigh School, Blue Springs, MO. This article was previously published in Health Education, October /November1988, 19(5), 83-85.56 Junior High School Students as Facilitators of Elementary School Health Education Carnivals 49 screening tests, the health education carnival does not. The latter actually is comprised of a widevariety of health education activities, incorporated into a festive, carnival-like setting; hence, thereason for its name. Although health professionals still are involved in the carnivals, physicians,dentists and nurses replace their usual work apparel with costumes that are more appropriatelyrelated to the activity areas of which they are a part.Watts and Stinson initially developed the health education carnival concept to expose under-graduate elementary education majors to the natural learning patterns of children prior to a formalstudent teaching experience. From the beginning, objectives of the health education carnival havebeen the promotion of (1) personal interaction between the facilitators and children, (2) meaningfulhealth education experiences for the children, (3) cooperative involvement among the facilitators asthey plan and implement the activities, and (4) positive public relations within the school andthroughout the community. The authors of this article simply have extended those expected out-comes into a new dimension by replacing the elementary education majors with junior high schoolstudents. In using junior high school students are facilitators of an elementary school healtheducation carnival, all four of the previously stated objectives were achieved for the elementarystudents, their school, and the community. Involvement of junior high school students in facilitativeroles enabled them to better appreciate their own health within a context of a broader based experi-ence. In addition, they were able to develop a sense of teamwork by joining together in a commoncause. Also, the junior high school students were given a great deal of responsibility for providing aquality health education learning opportunity for elementary school students, and they felt muchpersonal pride when their efforts were successful.Organizing Junior High School Students as FacilitatorsThe carnival idea was presented to eighth grade students of the Phelps County Missouri SchoolDistrict as a part of their junior high school science and health education course. Video tapes of othercarnivals were shown and synopses of certain journal articles were distributed for review (Watts &Stinson, 1981; Petty & Pratt, 1982; Bays, 1986; Wolf, 1986). After students informally discussed theidea among themselves and considered it as a group, they decided to conduct the carnival. It shouldbe noted that the health education carnival was not the only learning activity within the course. Ahealth textbook was utilized and traditional health education class sessions were held throughout thesemester. In preparation for the health education carnival, the class was divided into five differentgroups. After the groups were organized, each was given the opportunity to choose from among fivehealth conceptual areas included in the carnival. Those instructional areas were (1) smoking, alcohol,and other drugs, (2) physical fitness, (3) nutrition, (4) dental health, and (5) first aid. Figure 1 outlinestasks completed by students and by the teacher of the course during the nine weeks devoted topreparation for and staging of the health education carnival event.Overview of Activity AreasFollowing are brief descriptions of the five conceptual areas included in the health educationcarnival.Smoking, Alcohol, and Other DrugsEmployed a smoking machine to demonstrate the effects ofcigarette smoke on the lungs along with the encouragement not to smoke. Brief descriptions of whathappens within the human body when people drink alcohol or use other drugs. Playing of a smoking,alcohol and other drugs game which included basic questions about those substances, with emphasisplaced on advantages of not using them. Distribution of coloring books, iron-on and stick-on patchesand informational pamphlets pertaining to this activity area.Physical FitnessDisplay of a model of the human heart and identifying and explaining its vari-ous anatomical parts. Use of a stethoscope for students to listen to their heartbeats and to participatein a physical activity and then listen to determine how much faster their hearts beat in response toexercise. Playing of a game which emphasized the sequence of blood flow through the chambers ofthe heart and reviewed how the heart works. Distribution of pamphlets and other resource materialson blood circulation and the benefits of maintaining physical fitness throughout the elementaryschool years and beyond.57 50Health Promotion Figure 1STUDENT TASK ASSIGNMENTS AND TEACHER CHECKLISTWeeks Student Task Assignments1-2Develop the activity/conceptual area, including the selection of a carnival theme and send for and/or locally secureinformation and resource materials.3-5Organize information received and materials secured for use in the carnival activity areas.6-7Work on banners, posters, handouts, and costuming for the activity areas.8Complete all preparatory work and rehearse presentations to be made within each activity area during the carnival.9Conduct the health education carnival for the elementary school students.

NutritionIntroduction of the four basic food groups and an explanation of the importance ofeach. Discussion of \"junk foods\" and provision of actual substitute foods for the children to eatselected from among the four basic food groups. Playing of a nutrition game wherein studentsreached into a sack of groceries and placed the food item withdrawn into its proper basic food group.Dental HealthPresentation of a skit involving the elementary students themselves where theywere introduced to dental caries and given a graham cracker to eat. Plaque revealed on their teethand cleansed away by using carrot and celery sticks to demonstrate how foods can help clean theteeth. Proper brushing of the teeth included in the skit, along with other dental hygiene practices.First AidIntroduction to the three degrees of burns and a demonstration on how to properlytreat each. The correct way to bandage burn injuries in order to help relieve pain and prevent infec-tion stressed. Printed resource materials dealing with burns distributed.Conducting the CarnivalDuring the week of the health education carnival, regularly scheduled daily class periods for theeighth grade science and health course on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday were used for the carni-val. On each of those days, the 56-minute scheduled class time was used to set up, conduct the carni-val, and disassemble the activity areas. The first ten minutes of the class period were used to assembleand organize the five activity areas. Then on each day, a different class (second grade on Tuesday,third grade on Wednesday, and fourth grade on Friday) participated in the carnival, held in theschool gymnasium. Students in each class were divided into five separate groups and assigned tobegin at a different learning center. They were then rotated through all five activity areas so thatevery student was exposed to each set of learning experiences.All five groups of junior high school facilitators were given seven minutes to conduct theiractivity area session. The seven minute time period typically consisted of one minute to introduce tothe conceptual material, two minutes of information sharing, two to three minutes of games or otherhands-on activities for the children, and one minute to synthesize and conclude the learning experi-ence. During the weeks of preparation for the carnival, the junior high school student facilitators wereinstructed to design the activity areas so that they would (1) be child-centered, (2) provide basic infor-mation at the proper grade level, and (3) promote learning and fun throughout the experience. Allthree goals were effectively achieved, best evidenced in the attentive behavior and enthusiasticresponse of the elementary school children.58 Junior High School Students as Facilitators of Elementary School Health Education Carnivals 51 After all groups had rotated through each station, plenty of time remained for disassembly ofactivity areas and clearing out of the gymnasium. With everyone working together, there was noneed for junior high school students to miss any additional class time outside the regularly assignedscience and health class period.Carnival Follow-UpAfter the health education carnival was over, the primary author of this article, who also wasinstructor of the eighth grade health class, visited elementary school classes involved in the experi-ence. He found students studying, completing the worksheets, and using the pamphlets and otherprinted resource materials provided for them during the carnival. Elementary school students clearlyseemed to be more conscious of their health and expressed considerable interest in following goodhealth habits they had learned during the carnival. Two examples of the lasting impact of the carnivalon their lives were noted by the junior high school science and health teacher. Members of the thirdgrade class confessed they had no idea that milk was so good for the body and they proclaimed thatthey would continue to drink more of it. Members of the second grade class organized a \"SmokeBusters\" club and promised to wear their \"Don't Smoke\" emblems to further demonstrate their com-mitment. The teacher observed that the second grade students remained true to their promise.Additional follow-up was also done by teachers in each of the three classes involved in the healtheducation carnival. During the next few class meetings, they processed the health related informationand materials given to their students. Elementary school teachers expressed sincere appreciation forthe outstanding, active learning opportunity made available to their students during the health edu-cation carnival. Teachers were surprised that the junior high school students could be so wellorganized, motivated, and capable of providing such a high quality learning experience for theirstudents. What was possibly even more amazing is that we never doubted for a moment that theycould do it. Junior high school students are \"naturals\" as facilitators of elementary school healtheducation carnivals. Give them the chance and you will be glad that you did!ReferencesBays, C. T. (1986).

May DayChild Health Day, inaugurated by Herbert Hoover in 1928 when he was servingas President of the American Child Health Association (Ingen, 1935), and the Summer Round-UpCampaign of the 1920s, which focused on the importance of health examinations for school children(Means, 1962), are two early examples of annual health promotion events.More recently, school and community health educators have utilized World Health Day, April 7,as an opportunity to share information and experiences related to health conditions worldwide.(World Health Day Planning Kit, 1991). The AAWH also initiated World AIDS Day (December 1) in1988. Now an annual event in most countries, World AIDS Day encourages increased awarenessabout HIV infection, supports AIDS prevention and control activities, and promotes support and carefor all HIV-infected people (World AIDS Day Action Kit, 1990). Action planning kits, including aresource list and a directory of state contact persons, as well as suggested health education activities,are available for both World Health Day and World AIDS Day.The plethora of days, weeks, and months has grown, over the years, to the point where, foralmost any given day, a health related annual event, presidential proclamation, anniversary, orcelebration can be identified. The focuses of many such annual events offer opportunities for linkagesto content areas currently included in the scope of comprehensive health education. A few intriguingexamples, along with possible linkages, include: Make Up Your Mind Day (decisionmaking), SorryCharlie Day, a day, named for Charlie Tuna, to recognize anyone who has been rejected (self-esteem),National Oatmeal Month (nutrition), National Joygerm Day, a day for hugging, smiling, grinning,and winning over grumps and grouches (mental health), Week of the Ocean (environmental health),and Cable TV Month (sexuality or physical fitness).Health educators might use suggestions for classroom activities provided in the event sponsor'spromotional material, or ask colleagues and students to brainstorm ways to capitalize on a givenannual event. (A healthy measure of skepticism may be in order in the case of some commercial spon-sors wherein the sponsor's own agenda for product promotion may not match the health educationmessage desired.)Some events, Cable TV month for example, may usher in annual health education strategieswhich are far different from those the sponsor had in mind, but which serve the health educator'spurposes rather nicely. Guiding students in an examination of the relationship between what they seeon MTV and current teen sexual behavior, or challenging students and their families to live withouttelevision for a week and engage in more healthful recreational activities instead, are a few examples.A variety of learner-centered strategies can be employed to capitalize on annual events. Specialprograms, photo displays, classroom visitors, student initiated investigations, interviews andresearch projects, poster contests, classroom discussions, and role plays are all methods for conveyingtimely messages and promoting healthful behaviors.Inventing an original annual event, to focus attention on a local concern, or to acknowledge thecontribution of a local historical figure to the health education scene is yet another possibility. Localmayors, governors, and other governmental officials often are willing to legitimize an annual eventby making an official declaration.At the federal level, a congressional process, beginning with introduction of a bill in the House orSenate, has been established for declaring special observances. The first presidential proclamation t By Susan J. Koch, Assistant Professor of Health Education, The University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Fall, IA.This article was previously published in Journal of Health Education, March /April, 1993, 24(2), 113-115.60 Make Up Your Mind Day, National Oatmeal Month 53 was made by George Washington when he declared November 26, 1789 Thanksgiving Day, and therehave been 6,013 presidential proclamations to date (Chase & Chase, 1990). Contacting a U.S. Senatoror Representative who has an interest in the particular health issue is an appropriate way to initiatethe presidential proclamation process.The following steps, adapted from the World AIDS Day action Kit provided by the AmericanAssociation for World Health, are recommended for planning an annual event:1. Identify persons/organizations within the school and community who share your interest inobserving the event. (This is a good opportunity to establish helpful linkages between schools andcommunity groups.)2. Form a planning committee representative of interested persons/groups.3. Brainstorm and select appropriate activities. (Remember to include students in the planningprocess.)4. Set a date for your activitiesusually dependent upon the official observance date.5. Make a list of resources needed (personnel, money, supplies, time, etc., and brainstorm abouthow to access these resources).6. Determine who is your target audience, that is, who needs to receive this health educationmessage. Discuss ways to get your target audience involved.7. Make a planning timetable. Schedule dates and deadlines for preliminary preparations andactivities from the first planning meeting through the event follow-up.8. Contact the media and organize publicity. (Decide which media is most appropriate for yourevent and prepare a press release.)9. Secure necessary authorizations from school administration and/or other officials.10. After the event, evaluate the impact of your efforts and thank all who participated. Plan fornext year! (World AIDS Day Action Kit, 1990).There are numerous opportunities for incorporating special events into the health educationcurriculum (see Figure 1). Capitalizing on annual events as a health education strategy can enliventhe health education experience for students, provide healthful opportunities for community-school interaction and service, and engender positive publicity for the school health educationprogram.ReferencesChase, W.

Photography clubs, drama clubs, and science clubs are but a few of the more commonstudent clubs found in the school setting. A health club can be another worthwhile student experi-ence to add to a school's extracurricular program.The formation of a health dub for students cannot only provide meaningful health educationexperiences for the students involved, but also facilitate school-community interaction, promote ahealthy lifestyle, and showcase the benefits of a school health education program. Health clubs canprovide enrichment to a comprehensive, sequential school health education program that shouldnever take the place of any component of such a program.Enrichment to a health education program can be provided in several ways. On the secondarylevel, students are not always offered a health education course at every grade level. Even in situa-tions where health education electives are offered, an interested student may not be able to schedulean elective health education course because of other scheduling demands. For these students thehealth club can provide health education experiences.Further study of topics covered in health education classes can provide another opportunity forenrichment. An example of this may be a student who, after studying cardiovascular health in healtheducation class, may conduct further research on the topic resulting in some type of report, project, orfield trip. Even when a quality health education program exists, logistical factors can prevent suchtime consuming activities as field trips, service projects, research projects, organizing and participat-ing in health fairs, and specialized training (CPR, First Aid). All these activities could be consideredby a health club.For the school health educator interested in organizing a health club, the following considerationsshould be addressed.(1) Will the sponsor have adequate time for planning club meetings and activities?(2) Will there be a limit on membership? Will it be open to all grades or only students at certaingrade levels? Will there be any eligibility criteria? (Some schools/clubs require students to meetcertain academic requirements such as a certain grade point average.)(3) What will the process be for selecting club activities? What is the best mechanism for provid-ing input of members?(4) Will the school provide any financial support if needed? Will there be a need for fundraisingactivities?(5) Are there volunteers for activities such as field trips when other adults are needed for super-vision and transportation?If, after consideration of these issues, the health educator is ready to proceed, there are many pos-sible activities for a club to undertake The following are some possibilities:Health Fairs: A club could organize a health fair using community resources for screening,demonstrations, and activities. Club projects could be displayed. In addition to organizing their ownhealth fair, students can be involved in health fairs organized by other groups. Involvement in healthfairs organized by other groups could mean the development of an exhibit or audio-visual resources,volunteering for fair duties or club fundraising. Specific ideas for health fairs have been offered in pre-vious editions of Health Education (McKenzie et al., 1981; Germer & Price, 1981; Watts & Stinson, 1981).Assembly Presentations: Club members can give presentations on various health related topics toschool assemblies, PTA groups, and other civic and community groups.Field Trips: Club field trips can be taken to community health facilities including fitness centers,hospitals, clinics, and museums. Follow-up activities to such trips such as picture reports, presenta-tions to other students, and club discussions should be scheduled. Careful planning and specificguidelines are essentials for any field trip (Price, 1978). tBy DavidA. Birch, PhD., CHES, School of Health Physical Education and Recreation, Indiana University,Bloomington, IN. This article was previously published in Health Education, April/May 1986, 17(2), 50-5163 56Health Promotion Health News: There are a variety of ways health club members can provide health news to studentsand others in the community. Most schools have school newspapers and a PA system. A regularhealth column in the school newspaper and a daily or weekly health message over the PA system canprovide a regular service to students. A regular column in the community newspaper can reach com-munity members. A more ambitious project could be the publication of a periodic health newsletter.Using a video cassette recorder and camera, a health news broadcast could be produced and pre-sented to other students.Debates and Discussions: Debates, panel discussions, or individual presentations on health topicscould be organized. These programs could include club members, other students, health profes-sionals, school staff, and community members. Attendance may be limited to club members or maybe opened up to other groups.Fundraising Projects: Fundraising projects could be organized to benefit the club itself or otherhealth related organizations. Club members and the sponsor should keep in mind that a health clubshould select fundraising activities that promote healthful behaviors, i.e., fun runs, road races, walka-thons, and nutritious snack recipe books instead of candy sales or bake sales.Community Service Projects: Club members can be involved in volunteer projects that promoteschool and community health. Examples of community service projects are volunteer work in a hos-pital, community health center, or school health clinic, involvement in community fundraisers, andparticipation in nursing home activities.Peer Teaching: In areas of individual interest and expertise, students could be trained to presentmini-lessons to club members, other students, and possibly staff or community members. Trainedclub members could work with small groups of students in the regular health education classroomsetting.Current Health Issues: The health club can provide members an opportunity to examine, discuss ordebate current health issues or participate in activities not included in the health education instruc-tional program. Examples of current issues may be new developments in medical technology and therelated ethical issues or health-related political issues. Members may want to pursue individual orgroup research projects related to those issues. Activities such as health-related computer use or theproduction of health-related videocassettes could be health club ideas. Time or scheduling considera-tions may prevent participation in these types of activities in the health education instructionalprocess.Health Education Resource Center: If space can be found, club members may want to organize ahealth education resource center for other students and possibly community members. There arenumerous sources of free or inexpensive health materials that can be collected by club members.Voluntary health agencies, health-related professional agencies, and other health interest groups maybe willing to donate resources. The school or community library may be willing to periodically loanmaterials for resource room use.Display CaselBulletin Board: Most schools maintain display cases and bulletin boards in halls,foyers and other common areas. Many times those responsible for maintaining these displays aremore than willing to have someone assume responsibility for one or more. Health club memberscould assume responsibility for periodic bulletin board displays related to health.With creativity and careful planning, the possible activities for a school health club are limitless.Through such activities, interested students can extend and enrich their health education experiencesand possibly expand the health education and health promotion opportunities for other students,school staff, and community members.ReferencesGermer, P., & Price, J.

This teaching idea illustrates an approach that can help build bridges between youth andbetween young people and the larger community, bridges that reduce risk factors, encourageresiliency, empower youth, and contribute to community wellness.Building BridgesOne especially effective activity to create bonds among students is called \"Headbands.\" Start theactivity by asking the group what it means to label other people and what effects labels have onpeople at school. Following a brief discussion based on these questions, offer a personal example ofbeing labeled. This should be followed by your stating the purpose of the activity: to explore how welabel, why we label, and the effects labeling has on both the labeler and the person being labeled.Explain to students that you're going to conduct a role play illustrating the effects of labeling.Ask for eight volunteers to play the members of a school committee; you play the role of the prin-cipal. To set up the role play, ask each of the role players to put on a headband onto which a label canbe fastened. Then describe the task of the committee as organizing a school dance where studentsneed to determine, on a minimal budget, the following: the refreshments, the entertainment, and theplace, date, and time.Assign labels to each role player, and be sure that none of the participants can see their ownlabels. Here are the labels:Bully: Fear me.Brain: Compliment me.Nerd: Make of me.Jock: Tolerate me.Leader: Follow me.Clown: Laugh at me.If these labels are not realistic for your school community, substitute labels that are. Take carethat no one receives a label that actually describes that person's subgroup or how that person istreated. Before beginning the role play, encourage the players to speak up and not to be afraid to treateach other as it says they should be treated on their labels, without giving away what the labelactually says. Also, let the players know that you will stop the action from time to time as necessaryto keep the discussion going.Reiterate the committee's task to organize the school dance while reacting to each other basedmore on what the label instructs than on the merit of the idea. The rest of the group will only observeduring the role play, but participate in the discussion that follows. The role play should last about 10minutes.After the role play has generated a lively exchange, consider the following key discussion ques-tions addressed first to each role player individually:1. How did it feel being on this committee?2. Would you want to continue to be on this committee? Why or why not? t By Kelley Reid, Natural Helpers\u00ae Program Coordinator at Comprehensive Health Education Foundation,Seattle, WA. This article was previously published in Journal of Health Education, November /December 1993Supplement, S-52-S-53.65 58Health Promotion 3. What do you think your label says?4. Stepping out of your role, is there anything you want to say to anyone in the role play group?Have all the role players in turn take off their labels and headbands, state their names, and saysomething they enjoy doing in their free time.Next, address the following questions to the entire group:1. What did you notice about how people treated each other in the role play?2. How did this affect individuals? How did this affect the role-play group?3. How did labels affect the ability of the group to accomplish its task?4. How do people get labeled at school?5. How does this affect the labeler, the person labeled, and the school community?You may want to break into small groups, then have a large group conduct a final debriefing onQuestions 4 and 5 to make it easier for people to open up.Finally, conclude by restating the purpose of the activity and the importance of being bothgenuinely ourselves and accepting of others if we are to get along with others and if we want tocreate a more caring school community.ConclusionCreating community wellness means empowering youth to lead us into the future. And, accord-ing to researcher Bonnie Benard, there is nothing more important in creating healthy communitiesthan teaching young people the skills they need to \"create supportive, nurturing environments thatwill, in turn, discourage alcohol and drug abuse and other interrelated social problems.\" Benard goeson to say that \"no better preventionist training exists than peer collaboration in mutual problemsolving in a climate of mutual helping and respect.\"As Morton Deutsch, a seminar researcher in conflict resolution, has said, \"It has been increasinglyrecognized in recent years that our schools have to change in basic ways if we are to educate childrenbeyond hate so that they are for rather than against one another.\" The \"Headbands\" activitydescribed here is one piece of what needs to be a comprehensive approach to giving students theskills they need to build bridges and create nurturing environments.

This latest theory of teaching currently influencing curriculum development involves a newapproach not only in the classroom but also in physical education.The theory of the multiple intelligences developed by Harvard's Howard Gardner, in his bookFrames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence, presents at least seven human intelligences. The twomost common intelligences are verbal/linguistic and logical/mathematical. These two areas areemphasized in schools. The other five intelligences, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal andintrapersonal, have not been given high priority in the academic setting.Gardner arrived at this theory of the seven levels of intelligences through his extensive researchof studying children of all cultures and ages. A brief summary of the seven levels is:Linguistic intelligence learns through the written wordLogical-mathematical intelligence learns through the ability to think mathematicallyBodily-kinesthetic intelligence learns through movementSpatial/Visual intelligence learns through space and visual representationsMusical intelligence learns through beat, melody, rhythmInterpersonal intelligence learns through working with othersIntrapersonal intelligence learns through knowing himself/herself.Traditional techniques of teaching don't always reach every child. Different learning styles needcreative approaches to education. An active hands-on approach can reach those students who need anon-traditional approach to education. This approach of including the seven levels of intelligencescombined with integration to the curriculum is a basic and necessary part of a complete educationspectrum.Teaching traditional movement and sport activities is a standard approach to educating theyoung child in physical education. This technique, while teaching motor development and games,does not integrate with educational themes nor does it incorporate all levels of intelligences. Thisconcept of combining the multiple intelligences theory of Howard Gardner's plus academic integra-tion inspired \"Moving Young Minds.\"The following lesson is designed for the young learner and is a physical education lesson. Itfollows a lesson on ecology. The whole lesson can be adapted for a classroom.Basic Integration Theme: Earth DayBasic Movement Sally Specialist, Purdy Elementary School, Gig Harbor, WA.6'7 60Across the Curriculum Equipment Safety:Introductory Activity:Tape recorder, music, posters of garbage, signs for warm-ups,4-5 hula hoops, 4-5 nerf balls, 2-4 jerseysStress to students to watch where they are goingLinguistic intelligenceWALL CHANGEPlace acid rain poster, oil spill poster, recyclable objects, and garbage on different walls of the gym.Instruct the students to perform specific stretches while facing the different walls.Recyclable:Turn to a wall that shows items that we can recycle.While you are thinking about ways you can separateyour recyclables in your house and at school,do a stretch for the back of your legs.

MARCHEVERYONE RUN PUSH -UPS 70 Sing a Song in the Key of H for Health 63 SING A SONG IN THE KEY OF H FOR HEALTHt Professional musicians seem to find it easy to motivate an audience to \"sing a song.\" Take, forexample, the following words from a popular Earth, Wind and Fire song:When you feel down and out, sing a song.It'll make your day.You will learn to shout, in a song.It'll make you well.Sometimes it's hard to care, sing a song.It'll make your day.A smile is so hard to bear, sing a song.The lyrics are a melodic teacher, a helpful way of coping with the stressors of life, and the lessons arememorable. This musical example is not unique, however, because songs often promote learning in adirect (concrete), a second hand (vicarious), or an indirect (abstract) manner.Although school health educators are not professional musicians, the inclusion of a variety ofinstructional strategies during health teaching should provide for concrete, vicarious, and abstractlearning and promote the synthesis of health knowledge, attitudes and skills for living. Schools can\"step to the beat of different drummers\"their own drummersthrough creative orchestration. Bothteachers and students can follow a step-by-step plan to design and implement health songs in theclassroom.Related LiteratureIt is essential for health educators to select teaching strategies which will lead to the attainment ofhealth knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Health education and teacher education literature andresearch consistently support instructional variability, teacher enthusiasm, and creativity as beingnecessary for effective teaching. The utilization of music and lyrics during health instruction is a use-ful medium for motivating students to make personally satisfying, responsible health decisions. Theinclusion of music and lyrics increases variability, enthusiasm, and creativity in teaching approaches.As Hochbaum (1978) states:The purpose of teaching health is not to create knowledgeable children and adults. The purpose is to createhealthy children and adults.Categorical curricula recently developed by many health related organizationsthe AmericanAutomobile Association (1981), the American Cancer Society (1977 & 1979), the American DentalHealth Association (1982), the American Heart Association (1982a, 1982b), and the American LungAssociation (1983)include many instructional strategies teachers can choose for use in the class-room. Several of these include musical songs to increase student motivation and participation.Health education and teacher education literature substantiates the incorporation of innovative,creative teaching techniques such as musical songs during health instruction. Therefore, the authorsencourage health instructors to incorporate musical songs relevant to health instruction and toconsider \"orchestrating\" their own songs to teach health.The \"Song\" and Its UseThe following song, \"The Tracks of Time,\" was written for use in the American Cancer Society'sOn The Right Track, middle school health education curriculum (Smith, 1984). It provides an exampleof how to write, chord, and use a musical song in health instruction. Also, one should note howadaptable the song can be for almost any health subject matter chosen for instruction. illy DennisW.

BESTCOPYAVAILABLETeaching Suggestions for \"TheTracks of Time\"1. Play the tape, \"The Tracks of Time\" (Smith,1984) on a regular basis. Encourage the stu-dents to sing the chorus and the last line ofeach verse (It's right, all right).2. Bring in your own guitar and play/singyour own version of \"The Tracks of Time\"with your class. (The song was recorded inofthe key of D, capo up two frets, in the key 3. Ask the following questions: What are thetracks of time? (Each person's life.) How arewe engineers of our own trains? (Internallocus of control.) Is any health choice allright? (Responsible decision-making.) Whois the switchman? (A health educated indi-vidual.) What are some of the curves weface on the tracks of time? (Setbacks, mile-stones, challenges to our health choices,diseases, peer influences.) Who is the guideright by our side? (Switchman, personalvalue system.)4. Encourage your students to illustrate theirown personal \"Tracks of Time.\"5. Encourage your students to role play thedifferent themes shared in the song.6. Relate the \"Tracks of Time\" to the entireAmerican Cancer Society's curriculum forhealth education, On The Right Track (Smith,1984).Original SongsA Four Step ProcessStep I: Think about the health unit or subjectmatter. Write key words such as friends, deci-sions, love sharing, vitamins, pollution, thatyou might want to include in your song.Include suggestions from your students if pos-sible. Keep in mind that this is a lesson plan-ning phase as far as appropriate content, gradelevel, and curriculum considerations are con-cerned. Songs are appropriate at any age. As ageneral rule, however, the younger the audi-ence, the more simple the composition shouldbe. Also, older students may be a bit shy toparticipate. With a bit of encouragement, theywill probably enjoy the experience.72 Step H: Create a tune. Hum, kazoo, or struma sequence of melodies that sound unique toyou. A favorite method in Step II is to playcompatible guitar chords and invent notes atrandom. This is relaxing and fun, but quitetricky to recreate. Pay attention to what is hap-pening and let your ears guide you to a tunethat you can replicate. 'Top\" songs can lendideas to this process. Variations of these songscan be used. However, credibility and satisfac-tion is gained from creating your own compo-sition. Remember that not everyone can be amusician. Individual abilities may limit thedevelopment of a musical creation, but not theidea itself. Talented students can also help theteacher with musical limitations.Step HI: Combine Step I and Step H. Let yourmelody and words blend in poetic synergy byadding key words to rhythmic phrases suchas:Oh I've got my guideto help me decide.So it's right, all right.Notice that key words can take different formsdecisions/decideand attempt to rhymethe phrases, thus keeping continuity andmeter.Step IV: Instrumentation and recording.Instrumentation need not be elaborate. Guitarsare popular choices. Also, bells, banjos, sticks,and even acappella accompaniment presentpleasant combinations.Recording the orchestration is an impor-tant consideration. Reel-to-reel tape recorders,small cassettes, and large portable cassettetape players are adequate recording devices.The Musical ExperienceExperiment with \"creative orchestration\"and discover possible untapped talents. Thefollowing suggestions lend further assistancein the use of music in the class:Use quality audio equipment to play themusic; make copies of the lyrics for the class; bereceptive to other interpretations of the music fromyour students; be aware that misconceptions maybe conveyed in your music; and, be aware that anyteaching strategy can become ineffective if over-used.Songs produce a lasting effect on thelistener. Many people find themselves remem-bering various melodies and lyrics from thepast, discovering they are tapping their feetand singing words to songs that have not beenSing a Song in the Key of H for Health 65 heard for years. Many health educators' andtheir students will discover that they have theability to creatively write and orchestratemusic relevant to health education. Althoughthe resulting songs may not make the \"Top20,\" students and teachers will find their crea-tive efforts memorable and rewarding. Stu-dents will be learning concretely, vicariously,and abstractly, promoting health conceptformation and the development of healthylifestyles. Also, musical methodology supportsaspects of effective teaching behavior such asteacher variability and enthusiasm.As the \"conductor\" of the health educa-tion experience, teaching methodology cantake a variety of forms. When an \"encore\"event is desired in your class, \"tune up\" yourtalents, wave your wand, and sing a song.Your audience will applaud for life!ReferencesAmerican Automobile Association.

American CancerSociety Health Education Curriculum,Columbus, OH.73 66Across the Curriculum THE HEALTH REPORTER POOLt Students, who are often viewed as \"receptacles\" in which to deposit health-related information,should be more actively involved in the learning process. A primary problem with mass-producedteacher guides and curriculum manuals in health education is that they tend to focus more on subjectmatter than on student participation. The field of health education, however, presents many oppor-tunities to actively involve the student in the learning process. The goals of health education differfrom other subjects, such as mathematics, geography, or history, where knowledge is factual andcumulative. In health education, knowledge should be combined with efforts to influence positivehealth attitudes, effective decision-making skills, and promotion of positive health behavior.The Health Reporter Pool is an activity that can combine a variety of student-centered activitiesinto a single lesson format. The central idea of the Health Reporter Pool activity is that a student isselected to role play a particular health-related \"character.\" The choices for characters are limitless,for example, a bacterium, a carbohydrate, a drug abuser, a positive self-esteem, a good decision, orthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Based on class size, a number of other students areselected to be reporters \"assigned\" to cover a press conference, in the presence of the class, with eachhealth-related character.Several days prior to the press conference, the character and the reporters conduct research todiscover facts and other health-related issues pertaining to the character. Reporters must formulaterelevant questions such as: \"What is it like to be a bacterium?\"; \"What good do you do anyone?\"; or\"If you are supposed to help humans, why do you constantly have to be controlled?\" The teacher canlimit or expand the types and number of questions based on availability of time and resources.An exchange between the reporters (R) and the character (C) might go as follows:R1: \"So tell me, what makes you, a bacterium, so important?\"C:\"Well, I am very important in helping the body conduct a variety of functions.\"R2: \"Would you be so kind as to elaborate on two or three of these functions?\"C:\"First of all, I assist the intestinal tract in the digestion of food. In addition, I can help wardoff certain infectious organisms.\"R3: 'Tlease describe your relationship with antibiotic drugs.\"C:\"As you may be aware, I've never really enjoyed being around antibiotics, and I'll tell youwhy. ...\"The Health Reporter Pool can be used with a variety of grade levels (7-12) and diverse abilitygroups. In addition, this activity is structured with maximum flexibility to allow the teacher to fit itinto specific time frames and availability of resources. For example, the activity can be used as a 10-minute introduction to a new unit or as an entire class session on a particular topic. Also, the teachercan design questions for the participants to research or rely on the students to generate their own setof questions and responses. Most importantly, no special materials are needed for this activity, al-though students should be encouraged to use appropriate props to represent their specific character.Advantages of using the Health Reporter Pool are numerous. First, it actively involves studentsin the learning process. Health class then becomes \"something to do,\" rather than \"something toattend.\" Students become involved in researching a particular subject for something besides aresearch paper or other written report. Second, topics that many students might consider boring (e.g.,nutrition, infectious disease, personal health) can be made exciting and fun. In addition, controversialtopics (e.g., AIDS, sexuality, substance abuse) can be approached from an impersonal perspective thatcould serve to reduce the inherent volatility of many of these issues. Third, the activity can be usedwith special populations. For example, classes comprised of a predominantly minority populationcan examine health care issues from the perspective of that particular group and even carry on theinterview in a language other than English. tBy David Wiley, teacher at Southwest Texas State University, San Marcos, TX. This article was previouslypublished in the Journal of Health Education, November/December 1992, 23(7), 433-434. 74 The Health Reporter Pool67 Fourth, the Health Reporter Pool can be used to integrate health with other content areas. As anexample, the problem of AIDS can be examined from a sociological perspective, with the healtheducator and sociology teacher using the Pool to serve as an introductory activity in a coordinatedeffort to provide a focus on the topic. Thus the activity provides a medium to spread the health edu-cation curriculum across related content areas within a school. Fifth, students must learn beyond rotememorization and advance to higher level thinking and interaction skills. With the Health ReporterPool, students learn to answer a range of questions focused on advancing discussion beyond basicfacts.Finally, students have the opportunity to develop public speaking skills. For many students,speaking before a group is a very uncomfortable experience. By structuring the activity carefully, theteacher can provide students with the opportunity to practice speaking in a controlled environment.For those students who speak comfortably in front of a group, the Pool provides an opportunity to adlib and have fun creating an interesting interview.The Health Reporter Pool idea has the potential for use in a variety of ways. Teachers have thediscretion to use the activity in a strictly controlled manner or to allow students to construct theirown interviewing activity. As this activity is used throughout the school year, the more comfortableand creative students can become in its use.Its most important characteristic is that it directly involves students in the process of learning.The Health Reporter Pool provides teachers with a creative and challenging activity in whichstudents may develop new skills while refining skills that already exist. LIVING HISTORY.. .THE GALLERY OF HEALTH CHAMPIONSt The contributions of individuals towards the well-being of people from ancient to modern times is animportant facet of health education at the intermediate grade level. In order to foster knowledge andappreciation of health's heritage, students need to recognize those men and women who, havingfought and vanquished ignorance, prejudice and frustration in their battle against ill-health anddisease, stand as health's champions.Making health's history come alive for students is the unique dramatic presentation, \"The Galleryof Health Champions.\" This activity not only brings the contributions of these health heroes andheroines to the attention of the students but also fosters student participation and learnings. Healtheducators have long known the advantages of dramatic presentations (mime, role-playing, skits, andplays) for making health concepts more readily understandable for their pupils. \"Children are morelikely to remember facts when they are portraying them\" (Cornacchia, Olsen & Nickerson, 1989, 283).The Gallery varies from the stage format generally followed from fourth through the sixth grades.Firstly, it is a multi-disciplinary (art, social studies and language arts), group-centered project that isdesigned, researched, written, produced, and performed by students involving cooperative learning,expository (historical inquiry and reporting), and expressive (play design, plot and dialogue) writingand the constructive arts (sets, costumes and properties).Secondly, the production employs the theatre-in-the-round model. Individual sets representing aspecific health champion are placed on and adjacent to the walls with the performers, frozen instatue-like positions, providing a three-dimensional form to each setting. This complements theGallery theme in which spectators walk around to view the in-place pictures and sculptures. Because tBy Eleanor B. English, EdD., St. Bonaventure University, St. Bonaventure, NY.75 68Across the Curriculum of this design, the play does not require an auditorium/stage arrangement and works best in a class-room, all-purpose room or gymnasium. This environ allows the audience, depending on its number,to either walk around with the museum curator to each set or to turn, while sitting on the floor, tovisually follow the curator's tour to the individual champion's set. Each set remains a still-pictureuntil introduced by the curator. The performers come to life and present the researched historicaldata, that has been written with dialogue in the playlet form.The third unique facet of The Gallery is its design, which allows the audience to become part ofthe production, either in asking questions directly to the performers (who may leave the set to roamthrough the audience while responding to or eliciting questions) or by involving themselvessingularly or in groups with the action of the \"picture.\" The latter may take place in several creativeways, e.g., a member of the audience might be asked to come to the set to view into a microscope andreport the findings or someone might be asked to come forth and have a \"war wound\" bandaged byFlorence Nightingale, etc. Not knowing who will be invited to perform or what actions will be calledupon further heightens the audience's interest in the play and fosters a personalization and empathywith the champions. Once this process has occurred, learnings are enhanced (Ceprano & English,1990, 67).A schema, accompanied by a model playlet and samples of Gallery sets, is given as a guide forteachers/students for a successful presentation before other classes and parents or as a part of ahealth fair.The Gallery of Health Champions: SchemaI. Introductory Phase (Teacher)A. Information Giving1. Introduces health's history and the individuals who played a significant role; notes thetheme of health champions including a few people with their personal backgroundwithin the historical context and their specific contributions to health.2. Details the sources of information available, e.g., encyclopedias, non-fiction and fictiontradebooks, medical history books appropriate for the grade level such as Famous Men ofMedicine (Chandler et al., 1950).3. Compiles and presents a list of health champions which includes both well-known andlittle-known (e.g., Vesalius, Mary Walker, etc.) men and women throughout a broad timespan. A sample list might include the following: Hippocrates; Alexander Fleming.B.Task Presentation1. Defines the task; sets groups (no more than five pupils in each); appoints leaders; andsets group responsibilities and time limits.2.

Based on the research, all three of the above should best represent the historical period inthe most simple manner.2. Each historical vignette is located on an individual set designed as a three-sided (5x4x5)picture frame of black construction paper attached to the wall. Newsprint paper or clothis adhered to the base of the wall and extended three feet outward on the floor. Appro-priate drawings or properties may be placed within the picture frame. A sign denotingthe champion's name and accomplishment stands on a tripod to the side of each set.Regular classroom lighting may be used. If available, a portable spotlight placed in thecenter of the room would be most effective.3. Collect and/or make simple costumes. Pictures of the period help in matching the dressof the champion.IV.

You have the opportunity notonly to see these people who battled againstthe forces of ill-health and disease to make lifemore healthy for people of all ages but to alsoask questions of them concerning their contri-butions. You may even be called upon to per-form some type of actions connected with theirwork in health. Come along with me now aswe tour the Gallery of Health Champions.(Walks to Catherine Beecher's set.) Here is thepicture of our first champion, CatherineBeecher, who noted the importance of exercisefor good health.BEECHER: Hello, my name is CatherineBeecher. When I opened my school for younggirls in 1822, not only was education forfemales considered unnecessary, but physicalexercise and activity were also discouraged bysociety. The fashions of this time, with theirtight wasp-waists and enormous hoop skirtsmade any strenuous physical activity almostan impossibility. As a result of this, I foundthat much too often my students appeared tobe pale, listless, too easily fatigued after toolittle work, and often susceptible to communi-cable diseases. I strongly believed that dailyphysical exercise while wearing loose, free-flowing clothing would promote good health.But what type of exercises would be mostbeneficial for my young women? I investigated77CATHERINE E. BEECHERExercise for Health 70Across the Curriculum HIPPOCRATESFather of MedicineFLORENCE NIGHTINGALEThe Lady With the Lamp the German System of Gymnastics and found all that vaulting over stuffed horses to be too strenuousand dangerous for females. I decided to design my own system of calisthenics, originally for females,but now modified for use in schools and with families at home. Watch carefully as my studentsdemonstrate a few here in the Seminary Exercise Hall. See the footprints placed on the floor? Thoseare there for students to stand on so as to be given room to move. Sometimes we perform these move-ments to music. Ready girls? Begin. (Two students follow Beecher's direction and do three forms ofher exercises; on completion, Beecher turns and addresses the audience.) Now, I want the audience tostand, watch, and do a few of my exercises with me. Ready, begin! (She leads audience in a fewexercises.) Remember to always exercise your way to good health. (Returns to frozen position withinthe picture frame; the Curator enters.)CURATOR: Through her books and articles, Catherine Beecher remained a strong champion ofexercise for good health. (Turns to set #2.) Now turn your attention to the next picture. Within thisframe you will see the inventor of the stethoscope, Theophile Laennec. He will explain how he cameto design this very important health instrument.ReferencesCeprano, M., & English, E. B. (1990, Winter).

Environmental Health and Mathematics 71 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND MATHEMATICS:MAKING CONNECTIONS IN THE CLASSROOMt During the early 1990s the nation's headlines repeatedly contained news of oil spills, water and airpollution, deforestation, and solid waste disposal problems. These and other environmental healthconcerns are receiving increased emphasis in school curricula and in school recycling and conserva-tion projects (Tex ley, 1990). Another emphasis that has accompanied entry into the new decade is thecall for reform in school mathematics, as evidenced in the new Curriculum and Evaluation Standards forSchool Mathematics by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989). These two movementspresent teachers with a timely opportunity to interrelate the two subjects in innovative ways for theirK-8 students.The purpose of this article is to suggest some introductory activities for making connectionsbetween environmental health and mathematics. In a sense, the two subjects can serve in comple-mentary roles. The context of environmental health can serve to motivate students to developmathematical concepts and skills. The formulas and processes of mathematics can serve to model andquantify many phenomena associated with environmental health. It is hoped that as students makeconnections between the two subjects, their knowledge and understanding of each will be enhanced.Activity 1This activity demonstrates that a substantial amount of water can be saved if K-8 students willturn off the water while brushing their teeth, rather than allowing the water to run continuously.Begin the activity by asking each student to brush his/her teeth three times, using water to wet thebrush and rinse only. Catch the water used during each brushing in a one-quart container, such as astandard mayonnaise jar. Estimate the amount used each time to the nearest one-fourth of a quartand record the data in a table. An example is given in Figure 1. The column labeled \"Average\" inFigure 1 gives the average amount of water used per brushing. Figure 1TURNING WATER ON AND OFFBrushing#1#2#3AverageAmount of Water1/2 qt.3/4 qt.1/4 qt.1/2 qt. Repeat the process for three more brushings, this time allowing the water to run continuously. Again,record the data in a table. An example is given in Figure 2. Figure 2WATER RUNNING CONTINUOUSLYBrushing#1#2#3AverageAmount of Water4 1/2 qts.4 qts.3 1/2 qts.4 qts. The results of the two examples reveal that a student who turns the water off while brushing uses anaverage of 1/2 quart per brushing; the same student letting the water run continuously uses an aver-age of 4 quarts, or one gallon, per brushing. The students will be surprised that they use eight timesas much water if the water is allowed to run continuously! t By Charlene K. Stewart and James F. Strickland, Jr., Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA.79 72Across the Curriculum Students not yet familiar with fractional number computations can visually compare the amountsof water used in the two processes. Again, the conclusion can be drawn that much more water is usedby letting it run continuously. Teachers can extend this activity by asking questions such as: \"Howmuch water could you save, as an individual, in one year by using the on-and-off technique?\" and\"How much water could our class save in one week?\"Activity 2The second activity focuses on recycling aluminum cans. Have students bring empty soft drinkcans to school for a hands-on lesson. Lead students to understand that a soft drink can is a concretemodel of a cylinder, with circular-shaped bases and a rectangular-shaped lateral surface. Providestudents with rulers to measure the diameter (d) of a base and the height (h) of the can. Students maynow compute the volume of the can using the formula V = itr2h, where r = d/2.The formula will seem very abstract and of little relevance to some students. Teachers can addmeaning to the concept of volume by asking students to think of it as the amount of soft drink thatcan be packaged again and again when new cans are made from recycled aluminum. Students willenjoy conjecturing how many liters or gallons of their favorite soft drink might be consumed while animportant natural resource is being conserved.Recycling aluminum cans has become a popular money-making project in some schools. Profitsare often used to purchase computers, calculators, and other instructional aids. Many mathematicalskills in estimating and computing can be further developed in a class or school recycling project.Activity 3The third activity concerns noise pollution. High volume stereo systems provide one source ofnoise pollution to which most middle school students are exposed. The detrimental effect of listeningto loud music for a short time period is immediate but not lasting. The detrimental effect becomeslasting when one listens to high volumes frequently and for long periods of time. An impressiveactivity denionstrating the potential danger of such practices can be safely experienced by K-8students. Step 1(a) Place a loud-clicking timer at a prescribed point. (b) Allow the students to moveaway from the clicking timer to the point when they can no longer hear it.(c) Mark, measure, andrecord the individual students' \"hearing distances.\" Step 2(a) Place a very loud source of music(students' favorite rock number) near the students for several minutes. (b) Immediately repeat Step 1.(c) Compare findings in Step 2 with those of Step 1.Several additional studies can be completed by manipulating noise volume and length oflistening time and by comparing students' \"listening distances\" along with their daily music listeninghabits.Using the activities described in this article can benefit your students in a variety of ways. Theywill become better informed about environmental health issues. They will identify specific actionsthey can take to conserve natural resources and improve the environment. They will apply mathe-matical concepts and skills in meaningful ways. And, they will see connections between environmen-tal health and mathematics, two disciplines which heretofore may have seemed unrelated.ReferencesNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1989).

Teaching the Digestive System in Elementary Physical Education 73 TEACHING THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM INELEMENTARY PHYSICAL EDUCATIONt Currently, the holistic approach, or integrating physical education with academic subjects, is beingstressed as a part of a good physical education curriculum. In January 1987, an article was publishedin Journal of Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance explaining and demonstrating an active, inexpen-sive way to teach the circulatory system (Kern, 1987). Perhaps even before 1987, but definitely sincethen, other circulation models have been constructed. Although the circulatory system is one of themain body systems one associates with physical activity, the digestive system can also be learnedthrough activity. As physical educators profess, \"we learn best by doing.\"Following Kern's model where the students are the blood in the circulatory system, in the diges-tive system, each student is a piece of food. In this inexpensive model, the only equipment needed is:mats on which the students do sit-ups or push-ups representing chewing, signs (preferably lamin-ated) to identify the major structures of the digestive system, chairs on which the signs are taped andto separate the \"good food\" from the waste,\" and conessmall ones to keep students safely in theappropriate areas and large ones to help them know when to leave the system to return to become anew piece of food.The main concepts taught are: (1) the food is chewed in the mouth; (2) the food then passesthrough the esophagus to the stomach to the small intestine; (3) the food the body absorbs into theblood \"gets in\" at the small intestine; (4) the waste not absorbed in the blood passes through to thelarge intestine, rectum, and out through the anus (or simply \"out\" after the large intestine). t By SueMoen, PhD., Dallas Baptist University Lab School, Dallas, TX.81 74Across the Curriculum Before becoming a new piece of food to be chewed up (5-10 sit-ups or push-ups), the childrendecide whether they want to be the \"good stuff\" (to be absorbed at the small intestine) running downthe right side of the chairs or the \"bad stuff\" running down the left side of the chairs (and \"out\"). Thisprevents children from crossing between chairs and helps avoid safety problems.Our kindergartners through second graders run through the system as previously discussed.They make sure they go around the cones by the mouth, because they know food cannot be taken inthrough the cheek!For the older elementary children, additional signs are placed on chairs for the parts of the smallintestine: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Since most absorption takes place at the duodenumand jejunum, the cones marking the area through which they will leave are directly across from oneof those signs. Additional signs can be used, too, for the four areas of the large intestine (colon):_ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. Out SICTMOIDCOLON DESCENDINGCOLON Later, other concepts are added: children of all ages find it fun to \"throw up\"; after \"beingchewed,\" they run to the stomach and turn and run right back out through the mouth. The concept ofreverse peristalsis is taught here.Older children later have the opportunity to learn about choking by taking an incorrect path, pastthe epiglottis into the trachea, but then back to the mouth and onto the correct path (or they can startover immediately as a new piece of food).The older children, too, can add jumping jacks in theesophagus to represent peristalsis, jumping jacks in the stomach for the muscle action on chyme, andrunning in place just before entering the small intestine while they wait for the pyloric sphincter toopen. Signs are used for the cardiac sphincter and ileocecal valve as well as for the pyloric sphincter.Also, whether signs for the rectum and anus are used or simply the sign \"out,\" the children can runin place while waiting for the rectal muscles to relax and the anus to open.If enough space is available, the digestive and circulatory systems could be combined by havingthe children who get \"absorbed\" leave the digestive system and enter the circulatory system. In thisway, the children would learn about how the systems are \"integrated.\" Possibly, the respiratorysystem could also be added.82 ,Teaching the Digestive System in Elementary Physical Education 75 o For a cooldown to this lesson, the children walk through the system a few times and then stretch.In the review, children are asked questions about the system. After only two or three days (non-consecutive), I have found that most kindergartners can describe the digestive path as \"mouth,esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and out,\" and they know that the \"good stuff\" isabsorbed into the blood at the small intestine. 83 76Across the Curriculum In this lesson, the children have a maximum amount of participation time including a warm-up(walking and then jogging slowly through the system as a review), at least 10-15 minutes of timeduring which their heartrates are consistently raised, several different sets of sit-ups and push-ups, acooldown (same as the warm-up), and static stretching at the end of class. Most of the children findthis an enjoyable lesson and will let me know when they are reviewing the digestive system in theirclassroom, after having already learned it in the gym! e, ASCE=LARGEINTESTINEIlea:Ica:co I COLOCOLONVoiveler 1fr\"..1,4921.\"1,\"IL Reference: Kern, Kathleen, A.

Interdisciplinary approaches to instruction have been developed to meet thesechallenges.Why an integrated approach? Because learning, like health, occurs all the time, not just in neat 45-minute segments. Integration is a microcosm of life, offering flexibility, meaningful correlation, andinter-subject reinforcement. For maximum impact, team planning, implementation and evaluationshould be initiated.Health education does not exist in a vacuum; by utilizing an integrated approach, educators canhelp students to make connections between similar concepts presented in different ways. This maxi-mizes learning, retention and application. Students see educators cooperating and communicating,visible role models in real life.A single lesson may be piloted, or an integrated unit, theme-based activity or day can be created.In a similar manner, selected skills can be taught and reinforced through several subject areas.Teachers can create unifying themes for a semester or year.There are many ways to meet subject objectives through integrated approaches. For shared/mutual integrated applications, syllabi, curricula and collateral materials need to be reviewed to iden-tify mutual goals and objectives. Many of these will be very similar; many will be complementary.These goals and objectives can then be achieved through a planned interdisciplinary approach.Activities can be planned around a theme, such as \"family membership\" or \"rules and responsi-bilities\" which can be developed in many subject areas. If themes are clearly articulated and rein-forced across the curricula, students will make appropriate learning connections, assisted by educa-tors in several disciplines.The following activities can be used as part of a unit on human growth and development in theelementary or middle school.Ages and Stages: An ExplorationFor interdisciplinary curriculum planning, this lesson encompasses mathematics, language arts,social studies, and art, in addition to health. This activity is particularly suitable for special educationstudents.There are two instructional objectives: the student will (1) identify classifications as gender andage, (2) describe and compare a range of roles and capabilities for people of all ages and genders.Prior to this activity, collect a stack of magazines or catalogues containing numerous pictures ofpeople of all ages. Also needed: posterboard or construction paper, staples or glue.Step 1: Ask students to look through magazines and catalogues and cut out pictures of infants,boys, girls, men and women of all ages. Mount pictures one at a time on posterboard or chart paper.As they finish, classify and divide pictures into these approximate categories: infant, toddler, child,pre-teenager, teenager, young adult, adult, senior citizen. Look for a distribution of males andfemales in each category, if possible. Do not discuss these categories with the class as you classify; letthem come to their own conclusions as to agesthat's part of the fun!)Step 2: Divide students into groups of 2 or 3 and give each group a selection of 4-5 different aged/gendered pictures to work with. With a 10-12 minute time limit, ask students to look at each picture,and decide:(a) two activities that this person can definitely do;(b) two activities that this person probably cannot do. tBy Isabel Burk, M.S., CHES, Regional Drug Education Coordinator for Putnam/No. Westchester Board ofCooperative Educational Services, Yorktown, NY.85 78Across the Curriculum Groups record their answers on the chart paper/poster. Then ask the groups, one at a time, to actout their \"ages and stages\" for each picture, for the class. (This will be a lot of fun and very revealing.)Discuss their ideas and ask groups how they came to their answers. Explore the concept that ageand gender do not rigidly define behaviors and skills. Ask: Do all toddlers learn to walk on their firstbirthday? Does every six-year-old learn to ride a two-wheeled bicycle on the same day? Do all elderlypeople use a cane to walk? Help students to see that abilities aren't strictly age- or gender-related.Step 3: Within their groups, ask students to develop a list of abilities that relate to their age group.Then ask them to develop a second list, a \"wish list\" of activities that they want to be able to do soon.(This might include driving, going to the movies without an adult, etc.) Collate the most commonideas into class lists and discuss similarities. This provides peer support and a public forum for stu-dents to discuss their future goals. Define \"maturity,\" \"responsibility\" and \"ability\" and discuss theirinterrelationship.How Long Do We Live?Students in grades 3-6 are taking increasing responsibility for their health-related behaviors. Toraise awareness of the long-term effects of their behaviors, this series of activities will produce bothcognitive and affective results.For interdisciplinary curriculum planning, this lesson encompasses mathematics, language artsand social studies in addition to health. This activity is also suitable for special education students.Several World Almanacs or similar reference books would be very helpful.There are two instructional objectives: students will be able to (1) identify and describe factorsthat influence life expectancy, and (2) identify and describe specific behaviors which will enhancetheir personal life expectancy.Step 1: Define life expectancy: The number of years an \"average\" person born at a certain time canexpect to live.Step 2: Give students the basic life expectancy numbers from Figure 1 (or ask students to researchthese figures).Step 3: Have students graph these life spans as a line graph and a bar graph.Step 4: Students can use the graphs to determine the change in life expectancy in the past twocenturies. In small groups or as a class, discuss what factors may have influenced longevity. (Includetechnological factors such as modern medical science, improved transportation, improved access tomedical care, literacy, diet, agricultural techniques, sanitation improvements, occupations, economicstatus, living conditions.)Now contrast these figures with life expec-tancies of people in other nations. Students canuse the World Almanac to find this information.Add selected life expectancies to students'graphs; for instance, in 1981, the life expec-tancy of a child born in Nepal was 45 years; achild born in Ghana was expected to live 52years; a child born in Ireland could expect tolive to be 73. Research other countries and dis-cuss the factors relating to their expected lifespan.Figure 1EXAMPLES OF LIFE EXPECTANCIESOF AMERICANS FROM 1800-1991An American could expect to live to:180047.3 years197071.1 years198073.2 years199174.9 years Step 5: In pairs or individually, have students contrast human life spans with average life spansof animals. Figure 2 presents some selected expectancies; ask students to research others. Graph thisinformation as well. Students can also make a time line of life expectancy for animals and humans onthe blackboard.Step 6: Lead a class discussion on how students can contribute to longer life span. Ask students tolist specific actions that can help them to live longer. (Examples: low fat diet, regular exercise, recog-nize and deal with stress, etc.) 86 Figure 2SAMPLE LIFE EXPECTANCIESFOR SELECTED ANIMALS apecatwolfgerbil45 years14 years15 years3 yearsAn Integrated Approach to Human Growth and Development 79 Step 7: Challenge students to look aheadand predict what will the average life span befor infants born in 2100? Have students write acreative short story about the future of medi-cine, health, living conditions, etc. that mayimpact life span in the future.What's Your Pulse?For interdisciplinary curriculum planning,this lesson encompasses mathematics, science,social studies, in addition to health. Thisactivity is particularly suitable for special edu-cation students. A stopwatch or sweep secondhand clock is needed.There are two instructional objectives: students will (1) demonstrate the ability to find and recordpulse rate and (2) be able to differentiate average pulse rates for persons of many ages. Step 1: Review the steps in taking pulse: index and middle finger pressed lightly against the\"pulse point\" on side of the throat or inside of wrist.In class, have each student take his/her pulse for 20 seconds, then multiply by 3 to get the beatsper minute. Repeat the process to check accuracy. Record the class's pulse rates as dots on a graph.Then assign students to take a sampling of pulses from people of all ages: adults, younger stu- dents, older students. Use different colors to indicate these pulses on the chart.Look at the dots and discuss patterns. The approximate pulse rates at rest for sample age groups are:Figure Make sure that students understand that variation is normal, Note that pulse rate is directly related to blood volume and size of the body.Ask selected students to perform such activities as jumping jacks, jogging in place, etc., and then compare their pulse rates with the previous \"at rest\" rates. Discuss what other factors may cause pulse rates to rise (fear, surprise, extreme emotion, physical exertion, etc.)Now compare with animal pulse rates. (See Table 4.)Graph these data alongside the human pulse rate data and compare. What conclusions do the students come to?An Integrated Approach to Substance Abuse PreventionAlcohol, tobacco and other drug prevention issues must be addressed by elementary schoolteachers as a federally mandated component of school instruction. The issue is where to fit this in, and how to make it part of an overall course of instruction. Interdisciplinary approaches to instruc- tion have been developed to meet these challenges.Why an integrated approach? Because learning, like health, occurs all the time, not just in neat 45- minute segments. Integration is a microcosm of life, offering flexibility, meaningful correlation and 87 80Across the Curriculum inter-subject reinforcement. Effective substance abuse prevention cannot take place in a two or fourweek unit; it should be infused throughout the curriculum during the entire year for optimum value.Substance abuse prevention does not exist in a vacuum; by utilizing an integrated approach, edu-cators can help students to make connections between similar concepts presented in different ways.Team planning, implementation and evaluation are most effective in preparing an integratedapproach. Not only will teamwork maximize learning, retention and application, but it providespositive role modeling of educators cooperating and communicating.A single lesson may be piloted, or an integrated unit, theme-based activity or day can be created.In a similar manner, selected skills can be taught and reinforced through several subject areas.Teachers can create unifying themes for a semester or year.There are many ways to meet subject objectives through integrated approaches. For shared/mutual integrated applications, syllabi, curricula and collateral materials need to be reviewed to iden-tify mutual goals and objectives. Many of these will be very similar; many will be complementary.These goals and objectives can then be achieved through a planned interdisciplinary approach.Activities can be planned around a theme, such as \"red ribbon week\" or \"rules and responsibil-ities\" which can be developed in many subject areas. If themes are clearly articulated and reinforcedacross the curricula, students will make (or can be taught to make) appropriate learning connections,assisted by educators in several disciplines.The following activities can be utilized as part of the alcohol/tobacco an other drug preventionprogram in the elementary or middle school.How Much Is Too Much?For interdisciplinary curriculum planning, this lesson encompasses mathematics and languagearts. This activity is particularly suitable for special education students.There are four instructional objectives: The student will (1) observe and practice reading andimplementing written directions (such as on a recipe or medication label); (2) be able to explain howtoo much of a substance can be unpleasant and undesirable; (3) describe a spectrum of body cues andtheir relation to good health.Prior to the lesson, you will need to assemble these materials: water, sugar, lemons (or lemonjuice), ice, spoons, measuring spoons, paper cups. Introduce the concept of \"recipe\" with students, ifthey are not familiar with this term. Explain that a recipe provides a standard method of preparingfood that will yield standard, predictable results.Now review a lemonade recipe with students, either on blackboard or overhead. (Most recipescall for 3 cups of cold water, juice of 4 lemons, and 1/2 cup of sugar.) Ask students to assist you inmeasuring and mixing the lemon juice and water.Emphasize the importance of careful measuring. Do not measure or add sugar initially, but tellthe class that they will add sugar to the lemonade a little at a time. Ask a volunteer to sip a smallamount of lemonade without sugar, and describe it in terms of sweetness (\"not sweet at all\").Measure out 1 cup of lemon/water mixture. Now ask a student to add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar tothis, mix, taste a very small amount of it, and describe it in terms of sweetness (\"not very sweet\").Have the student mix in 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, taste and describe (\"a little bit sweet\"). Repeat fivemore times until the student says the lemonade is \"very sweet.\" At this point, ask him/her to add just1/2 teaspoon more and describe the drink (\"too sweet\").Repeat the experiment with another student. Then allow students to use the standard recipe toprepare lemonade, taste, and report out.Ask students to remember how the lemonade changed to \"too sweet\" in the first experience. Howcan we avoid this? Use a recipe; the recipe will yield uniform lemonade that tastes good every time!Explore student experiences with \"too much.\" Have any students ever eaten, too much candy?Drunk too much soda? Stayed out too long in the sun? How did they feel? Did they learn anythingfrom these experiences? Is it possible to have too much of something, even something enjoyable, likesweets?Discuss the concept of individual differences, in terms of quantity: sweetness, volume of music,night time sleep needs, etc., emphasizing that each person has a personal preference or tolerancelevel.83 An Integrated Approach to Human Growth and Development 81 Now discuss body signals and their importance to overall health. Ask students what clues theirbodies give them when they're hungry, thirsty, tired, etc. How do body signals help us know ourlimits and modify our behavior?Finally, correlate the lemonade experiment to safe use of medication. Both over-the-counter andprescription medications list appropriate dosages for children and adults. These dosages have beentested by scientists and doctors to make sure that they work properly and won't be harmful. Eachmeasure (pill, liquid, capsule, tablet) is carefully formulated the same way each time, from a \"recipe\"so that it will work the same way each time. Remind students of the overload of sugar and tell themthat too much medication will not help, but could even make a person sick. It is important to readand follow label directions. Only a medical professional should change a medication dosage level.The Visible Difference: Teaching About DosageFor interdisciplinary curriculum planning, this lesson encompasses science, mathematics, andlanguage arts. This activity is particularly suitable for special education students.Before you begin, you will need to assemble: bright red food coloring or concentrated dye,measuring spoons, 8 clear containers of varying sizes from very small (1 oz. size) to very large (quart),box from children's liquid pain reliever.Ask students to arrange the containers in size order and fill with water. Let water bubbles settleuntil you can see through clearly.Have students carefully measure one teaspoon of coloring into each container and stir carefully.The class should be able to observe marked color differences. Ask volunteers to describe the colorhues, or ask students to draw and color diagrams to match the color concentrations they observe. Thesmallest vessel will be highly concentrated; the largest will have very little color change.Now correlate this to human body size. Select a student to read the label on the liquid painreliever, and note that dosage is designated by body weight. Why? Ask students to draw conclusionsabout medicine dosage, using the results of this experiment. If appropriate, read the labels on avariety of over-the-counter medications to show the pattern of larger dosage for older peoplereallya substitution for asking for weight!Discuss factors that impact medication's effects. For instance, larger people have more bloodvolume which dilutes medication (just like the experiment)! Food in the stomach may slow down themedication's absorption. An individual's metabolism, age and activity level may also influence medi-cation effects.Finally, remind students that alcohol is a drug. What would be the effect of an ounce of pure alco-hol on a smaller body (such as a child) as compared to the effect on a larger body? Why? (Relate thisto the color concentration experiment.) What other factors might influence the effect? Emphasize thatalcoholic beverages affect all people, but smaller people generally feel the effects more quickly andintensely.ReferencesFogarty, R.(1991).

Giving them arepertoire of social skills to use that information is the \"how\" of health education.\"How do I tell my friend I don't want to go with him to the party and still look cool?\" \"How do Isettle an argument with my mother so that we both get what we want?\" \"How do I keep myself fromtalking back to my teacher?\" These are the kinds of questions students need answered. Students facetough situations and they need to know how to get out of them.One of the specific social skills many people of all ages can benefit from is one found in theSkillwiseTM program, published by the Comprehensive Health Education Foundation, and in severalhealth education curricula, The Refusal Skill for Self- ControlTM. These are the steps of the skill, each stepfollowed by a phrase skill-users can say to themselves:(1) Stop what you're doing (e.g., \"Stop.\" \"Wait a minute.\").(2) Name the trouble (That's ..\").(3) State the consequences (\"If I do that .. .\").(4) Think of something else to do, and move away from the situation (\"Instead, why don't I .. .\").(5) Give yourself credit for staying in control (e.g., \"I did a good job.\" \"I stayed in control.\" \"Istayed safe.\").This skill, like other social skills, is taught most effectively when teachers follow a method ofinstruction that comprises the following sequence:(1) Introduce the skill.(2) Model the skill.(3) Facilitate practice.(4) Provide opportunities for students to \"transfer\" the skill outside the classroom.Let's concentrate on the first step, without which none of the others may be meaningful: How doyou introduce the skill so that your students are motivated to learn it?First, give them a reason to learn. Establish a context for learning the skill. Ask your students how\"controlling yourself\" applies to the health unit they're studying. Ask students to make a list of whatthey've done in the past to control themselves. Establish that they're already using some effectivetechniques. Have students discuss in small groups the difficulties in controlling themselves. Reach aconsensus with students that it would be helpful to have a consistent technique to use.Second make it real for students. Ask them to think of a time when they wanted to controlthemselves but didn't. Say that you're going to show them a way to help them do that.Show them the steps of The Refusal Skill for Self- ControlTM. Point out key phrases they can use untilthey become more comfortable with the steps of the skill. tBy Bob Patterson, Coordinator of Skillwise\u00ae and Here's Looking at You, 2000\u00ae at Comprehensive HealthEducation Foundation, Seattle, WA.

Compare their experiences with learning a new skill.After you've introduced the skill, you can model it so that students \"see\" the skill themselves.Finally, you can ask students to identify situations in their lives in which they might use the skill.Introducing The Refusal Skill for Self Control`\"' isn't much different from introducing any otherskill, or, for that matter, any other subject. The more you can convince students that they have areason to learn something, and the more you can make it real for them, the more they're going towant to learn it.And, after all, isn't that what you want? TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT STRESSTHROUGH MOVEMENTt Stress management for children is a concern for teachers and parents today. Movement can be used toexplore the physical stress reaction and coping mechanisms. Five activities are described for studentsK-6 that identify sources of stress, explore how they might demonstrate a feeling of stress throughphysical movement, describe a balanced lifestyle and learn to believe in themselves more.Teachers today are seeing stress among our nation's youth. Dr. Hans Sey le might define the stressas a divergent physical or emotional response to external factors in the students' life. Such things asheadaches, stomach aches, mood swings, belligerent behavior and poor attention span might beindicative of stress in the child's life (Reed 1984). Educators today are looking for ways to helpchildren cope with stress.Using movement to define and discuss stress is a tool in the process of helping students cope.Using movement as therapy is not new. In the 1950s Marion Chace started using dance therapy onindividuals hospitalized for mental disorders. Chace (1975) used movement activity to increasepatients' active involvement with others, work on attention span, release nervous energy in anacceptable manner, and to communicate feelings nonverbally.Debra Landforce (1990) said that the body never lies. One can learn much about internal feelingsthrough observing and listening to the body. Berstein noted (1972) how much we ascribe feelings tobody parts. For instance, we hear sayings such as \"the eyes are windows of the pain in the neck.\"Levy (1988), a noted dance therapist, suggests that movement can identify and unify divergentforces within the person. This is certainly the goal of stress management for children.The following movement activities are designed for students in the upper elementary age groupbut can be equally instructive and fun for teacher education groups. These activities can accommo-date large or small groups of students. The lesson can be completed in a one-hour lesson and needsno special materials.Activity 1Defining StressObjective: Students will seek to recognize the presence of stress by observing individuals' bodylanguage when under stress.Start with a discussion how do people look when they feel upset? Have students take turnsdescribing a recent stressful situation for them. Have the group give him or her feedback on how thebody changed or looked while talking about the stressful situation.Have students take a partner. With the partner, take turns designing a visual human model of aperson under stress. It may be a family member, friend or the student. Give examples of situations to tBy Christine Wilson Ahmed, M.S., Assistant Professor, Department of H.P.E.R., Missouri Western StateCollege, St. Joseph, MO.91 84Skill Enhancement model: under the stress of a test, going to the dentist or fighting with a sibling. Is it easy to showstress physically? Where do we each feel stress in our bodies? Have students share before continuingto the next activity.Activity 2Sources of StressObjective: Students should be able to identify a current source of stress after this activity.Ask students to think of what brings out those feelings of stress. Have students work with a samesize partner this time. Students can hold onto a long stick or each other at the elbow or shoulder ifthis doesn't disrupt class. Start by either pushing or pulling for a count of five seconds. At any timeindividuals want to quit they can say \"stop\" to their partner. Ask them to tell what areas in their lifethat they feel that same sense of struggle. Does it seem like a good struggle or a bad one? Emphasizethat they have the control to \"quit\" struggling at any time.Activity 3Acting Out StressObjective: Students may recognize a way that they cope with stress without thinking about itnormally.Ask students to think of situations when they feel stressed; focus on either the situation or thefeelings of stress. What actions might express what they would like to do as a symbolic physicalresponse to stress. Examples of actions might be pushing, retreating, hiding, withdrawing, showingheaviness, hyperactivity, or stamping, pushing, chopping, or punching. Have the students pick outfive or more movements that express a response toward stress. Demonstrate them to the class withperhaps a verbal explanation of the movements if students feel ready to share. They can also sharethis with a partner if the group is large. There are many different ways of responding to stress. Whatare some good ways and some not so good?Activity 4Finding BalanceObjective: Students will identify people, activities, or situations that give them a sense of peace orbalance.Start the activity by talking about balance in lifewhat things make us feel good. With a partneragain, have the students demonstrate three positions where they feel balanced against each other.Have the partners show the balances to the class. After the class looks at each one, have each persontell what helps them feel relaxed or good, balanced.Activity 5Stressors Are ChallengesObjective: This activity seeks to help students grow in the belief that they are capable of coping with achallenge.Self-efficacy may begin by becoming involved rather than retreating from a challenge. We aregoing to use the action of either a side hug, arm around the shoulder or perhaps raising inside armsup high standing next to a partner to symbolize acceptance of a stressor as one of life's challenges.They might shout a refrain, I am a \"SUPER Kid\" (Serene, Unwound, Peaceful, Energized, and Ready-to-go) to end the activity on a positive note. As an instructor, give yourself a long, deep breath and amental pat on the back. You're a SUPER Kid Too.In conclusion, this activity provides students with an opportunity to learn about stress throughmovement activities. The lesson works well with the Health Education unit focusing on stressmanagement. Children as well as adults become involved participants in the learning experience.ReferencesBerstein, P. L. (1972).

JOURNAL WRITING; INTRODUCING A COPINGTECHNIQUE IN STRESS MANAGEMENT COURSESt Stress management classes are typically designed to introduce a host of relaxation techniques toaccompany and compliment theoretical concepts of stress reduction from psychophysiology to strate-gies for stress reduction. Although coping techniques comprise a large component of stress manage-ment skills, it is often difficult to practice the complete effectiveness of these in the classroom withoutthe immanent presence of personal stressors which all individuals can relate to equally. One effectivecoping strategy which can be taught as an in-class exercise is journal writing.The ConceptThe word journal comes from the root word \"journee\" meaning a day's travel or to journey ortravel. Journals originally started as a means of guidance on long trips as a record or orientation for asafe return passage. From Columbus to Lewis and Clark to today's astronauts, journal writing hasbeen and continues to be a proven means of communication for personal guidance on each indi-vidual's journey through life.Current research suggests that not only is journal writing good for the soul, a type of catharsis toexpress the full range of emotions, it is proven to be good for the body as well. Studies in whichindividuals kept journals and wrote about their frustrations and painful experiences revealed that,over time, they had less physical ailments (headaches, cramps, etc.) suggesting a new bond in the linkbetween the mind and the body (Pennebaker, 1988, 1989).Journal writing is perhaps the most profound coping skill available to provide and enhance theskill of self-awareness, the essential coping tool needed to not only identify personal stressors, but towork on the resolution process of these as well. Journal writing initiates a communication of self-reflection, a necessary step in the resolution process. To initiate the journal writing process alone canbe difficult. One way to enhance this process is with a few journal writing themes which serve ascatalysts to promote the self-awareness and soul searching process. A class exercise in journal writingalso lends credence to the concept of solitude and quality time for the purpose of self-reflection.The following are two journal themes that have proven effective as a catalyst for increased self-awareness and self-reflection.Journal ThemesThere are several themes that can promote a sense of self-reflection and self-awareness. Journalthemes should include a general concept with several supporting concepts which help the individualinitiate the soul searching process. Themes should include a brief explanation regarding the majorconcept, its importance to the self-exploration process and several questions which serve as a catalystfor reflection. The following are two themes which have proven to be extremely successful in theattempt to promote reflections on self-awareness. tBy Dr. Brian Luke Seaward, Assistant Professor, Department of Health and Fitness, The American University,Washington, DC.93 86Skill Enhancement A Gift from the Sea: This theme, regarding reflections on personal strengths and weaknesses, isbased upon the book Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindberg. To start this class assignment, a fewpreparations need to be made in advance. First, create a sea shell collection. Include approximatelytwice the number of shells as there are students to provide an abundance to choose from. Shells ofvarying size, shape, and color for students to select from add significantly to this experience. Addi-tional shells can be borrowed or even purchased from novelty shops to balance out your collection.Second, if possible, locate a tape recording of ocean waves. The rhythmical sounds are very relaxingand promote the reflection process. Next, locate a copy of Lindberg's book, Gift from the Sea (1976) andselect a couple of passages to be read at the completion of this exercise. Lastly, create a handout (orwrite on a blackboard) a series of thought-provoking questions related to this theme. Questions mayinclude the following: Describe the shell you selected, its size, shape, color, and any distinguishing featuresthat stand out. What attracted you to this particular shell? Shells act as a form of protection and security.Humans, too, have shells, although invisible to the eye. What is your shell like? Does it over-protect or is it agrowing shell? Shells can be strong or weak. What are your strengths and weaknesses? Sometimes strengthscan become weaknesses, perfectionism, for example. Do any of your strengths have the tendency to becomeweaknesses? How do your strengths and weaknesses assist or confound your ability to deal with stress?At the start of the exercise, place the shells on a large beach towel. Ask each student to approachthe towel and select a shell. Explain the concept of the assignment from the nature of journal writingto the specific concept of the sea shell as a metaphor of strengths and weaknesses. Allow 20-30minutes for students to complete the assignment. When they begin to reflect and write, play therecording of the ocean waves to enhance the mood of the exercise. At the completion, allow studentsa few moments to finish remaining thoughts. As shells are returned, read a few selected passagesfrom Lindberg's book. A short dialogue regarding this exercise may follow by asking students todescribe their impressions of the journal theme and what it meant to them.Vision Question: This theme regards the concept of rites of passage. It is based on the NativeAmerican custom of a retreat to nature; a three-day excursion of self-reflection and solitude. A visionquest is an intense probing of one's life purpose and contribution to mankind. It promotes an affirma-tion of centeredness and connectiveness to the Mother Earth. In the Native American custom, a visionquest marks a significant rite of passage into adulthood, or a major life transition. This concept is veryadaptable to all societies. In contemporary American culture there are many rites of passage. Whilemany are celebrated in ceremony, many are not, with the most difficult experienced alone. Rites ofpassage are thought to include three critical phases: severance, a separation from former ways ofthoughts, behaviors, people, places, etc.; threshold, a quest, a search for vision or understanding; andincorporation, a return to community with knowledge from the vision. The concept of rites of passagebecome increasingly important in high school, during college, and throughout one's adult life.To begin this assignment, some preparations will certainly enhance this experience. First, atangible catalyst to promote self-exploration is helpful. A collection of tumble stones, either polishedgems or common garden stones, will lend itself to the concept of groundedness (polished stones canalso symbolize the concept that resolution of stressors smoothes the, rough edges of our being).Second, because this theme is derived from the culture of southwest American Indians, NativeAmerican flute music lends an exponential quality to this experience as students begin the reflectionand writing process (Nakai, 1987). Next, if possible, locate a reference regarding the concept of thevision quest to read a few selected passages at the completion of the assignment (Foster & Little,1988). Finally, a handout or blackboard notes to highlight the concept and provide a few soul-searching questions related to this theme. Questions may include the following: What significant eventsto date would you consider to be included in your own rites of passage and why? What rites of passage are youin the midst of currently? What dragons are you doing battle with right now? Regarding the concepts ofseverance, threshold, and incorporation, what life passage are you in now, what phase are you entering oremerging from? In a vision quest, a new name is received from the mother earth. A name can also be a positiveaffirmation statement, a unique phrase which boosts self-esteem and gives the ego a solid sense of positiveidentity. What phrase or positive affirmation statement can you suggest as a morale booster to give you a solidsense of positive identity? 9 Journal Writing; Introducing a Coping Technique in Stress Management Courses 87 As students begin to reflect and write, play the recording of the Native American flute music.Allow 20-30 minutes for the journal writing session. At the end of the writing period, as studentsreturn the stones, select a few passages to read to bring closure to this theme. A short discussion mayadd final closure as individuals who wish to share their impressions of this journal theme commenton this concept.ConclusionsThere are many types of coping techniques to effectively deal with stress. Each coping techniquemust be initiated with an increased sense of self-awareness. Journal writing is perhaps the most wellsuited for this purpose. In-class journal writing exercises lend credence and opportunity to thiscoping style. Unlike other coping mechanisms which may not prove effective in the classroom settingfor all students, journal writing initiates and maintains a strong sense of self-awareness. Because ofthe personal nature of these themes, and the conceptual balance of honesty of communication andprivacy to promote honesty, these perhaps should not be collected, rather left inside the journal forreview of the writer to enhance the learning experience.ReferencesFoster, S., & Little, M.

They were all the same, a graphic of a rose. He likedthe cards, didn't really want to give up any of them. But his classmate Debbie was insistent. \"Come on, let's trade.\"He nodded, not saying anything. He selected one of the roses and gave it to her. She gave him a card from her hand; it was a pitchfork. Not bad, thought Chris.He switched three more times in the activity, though he had 10 opportunities altogether. Later, Mr.Thorn held up facsimiles of the cards everyone had.\"This card,\" said Mr. Thorn, holding up a graphic of a penguin, \"is 'happiness.' How many people either have this card in their hands right now or had it pass through their hands?\"Several of Chris's classmates raised their hands, and they traced a ball of yarn from one to the other, based on who gave the penguin card to whom.\"And this card,\" said Mr. Thorn, holding up a graphic of a bee, \"is chicken pox.\" The procedure was repeated: the raised hands, the yarn.Mr. Thorn held up a card with a pitchfork on it. \"All right,\" he said, \"let's suppose that this card is theAIDS virus. How many people have had this card in their hands?\"Chris knew it was just a card, but he felt as if he had been kicked in the gut.What It DoesThis activity is called \"The Invisible Thread.\" It's part of a middle school lesson illustrating some ofthe factors influencing the transmission and spread of the AIDS virus in an AIDS prevention curriculumcalled Get Real About AIDSTM, published by Comprehensive Health Education Foundation. In this simu- lation, students realized the following:The more times they switched cards, the more they risked getting a \"bad\" card.Sometimes there was pressure to switch cards.No one knew at the time of the switches who had the \"AIDS\" card, even the person who had it.Even if someone gave away the \"AIDS\" card after having received it from someone, that person was stillcounted as having the card.Students gain an understanding of HIV/AIDS, of the nature of epidemics, and of their own predispo- sitions toward succumbing to peer pressure. How is this different from reading about HIV/AIDS, from t By Neal Starkman, writer and developer at Comprehensive Health Education Foundation, Seattle, WA. This articlewas previously published in the Journal of Health Education, November /December 1993 Supplement, S-55-S-56.9G Personal Impact: Making a Curriculum Meaningful to Students 89 listening to a teacher talk about epidemics, from discussing peer pressure? It's the difference betweenreading about an ice cream cone and eating one. It's learning with the gut, learning from experience, evenif the experience is a facsimile.Optimally we all learn best when the subject matter applies to us personally. How many of usremember the formula for quadratic equations? or the capital of Sri Lanka? or the year that Justinianascended to the throne of the Byzantine Empire? But we do remember how to drive a car, we do remem-ber the capital of the state we live in, and we do remember the year of our birth (some of us withprodding).Making a curriculum meaningful to students requires four things:(1) knowing studentswhat they like, how they live, what they think about(2) knowing the curriculumprimarily what it's designed to do(3) varying teaching strategiesvisual, auditory, kinesthetic, and combinations of these(4) motivating studentsencouraging them to make the curriculum meaningful to themselves.How to Teach ItHere's how to do your own \"Invisible Thread.\" You'll need about 30 sets of cards, seven per student,plus one set of larger masters for the teacher, attractive enough to motivate students to get more. Write anumber in the upper right-hand corner of each set of cards (seven ls, seven 2s, etc.). You'll also need aball of yarn.(1) Distribute one set of seven cards to each student. Have students take out a sheet of paper andnumber it from one to 30 (or the number of students there are in the room).(2) Tell students that some of the symbols on the cards stand for good things and some of them standfor bad things. Say that when you give a signal, they can switch any one of the cards with any one ofsomeone else's cards. Add that they don't have to switch at all, but when you say \"Decide,\" they'll have10 seconds to decide whether or not to switch.(3) Tell students that once they switch, they should notice the number in the upper right-hand cornerand write on their sheet of paper the name of the person who gave them the card next to the number ofthe card.(4) Give student about 10 opportunities to switch, repeating the directions on occasion and remindingstudents that it's their choice whether or not to switch.(5) After all students are back in their seats, choose one of the cards from your master set and hold itup. Say that the card stands for \"happiness,\" and ask how many people either have the card in theirhands right now or had it pass through their hands. Use the yarn to trace the route back to the personwho was originally given the card.(6) Repeat the process with \"chicken pox\" and then with \"the AIDS virus.\"(7) Ask students to draw parallels between the activity and some of the factors influencing the trans-mission and spread of HIV.Obviously, this activity cannot stand alone. It serves as a provocative introductory lesson, however,for a unit on sexually transmitted diseases. It should be supported with current and accurate informationon the topic.What Else You Can DoFor some curricula, e.g, AIDS prevention or drug education curricula, personal impact is essential; it'sthe key motivator enabling students to learn. That's the bottom line for teachers: How can I get mystudents to learn? It's not enough to put food before a person; you've got to make the person want to eatit.Think about what you can do in your classroom to bring that personal impact to each of your stu-dents: What do your students care about What do they like to do? Use examples from their lives,examples that they generate. Have them role-play. Have them create something, a story, a mural, a song,a game, a lesson. When it comes from them, they'll buy into the message. It will have impact. 97 90HIV/AIDS Prevention AIDS EDUCATION: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHBETWEEN THE. HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALAND THE TEACHER OF THE DEAFt Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) resulting from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is killing our youth, both hearing and deaf. Growing numbers of identified AIDS and HIV cases in the United States are forcing professionals in the fields of health care, education, and deaf education to interact in ways never before deemed necessary. This article addresses ways that health care professionals interact with teachers of deaf children. Good health habits and quality health education regarding AIDS and HIV infection, hopefully, will result.How to Begin the ProgramStarting an AIDS/HIV unit for deaf youths is not easy. The health care professional must consider several factors. First, deaf students have weak background knowledge in science, sex education (Fitz- Gerald, Fitz-Gerald, & Williams, 1978), and AIDS/HIV related issues. Second, deaf students have weak English language skills. For example, deaf adolescents read at the 3rd to 4th grade level (Allen, 1986; King & Quigley, 1985; Quigley & Paul, 1986, 1989, as cited in Paul & Quigley, 1990).Third, unfortunately, myths and ignoranceconcerning sex and AIDS/HIV run rampantthrough school-aged deaf children. This ignoranceis a result of a lack of information about AIDSamong parents, guardians, and teachers, a lack ofsex education and sexuality classes in schools, andpoor communication skills between parents,teachers, and deaf children. Health care profes-sionals working with parents, teachers, and schooladministrators can help remediate the ignoranceby providing background information i n classes,workshops and meetings for students, teachers,and parents. By using an American Sign Language(ASL) interpreter, the health care professional canmore effectively teach AIDS/HIV information todeaf students.Presenting the LessonLimited background knowledge. Presenting a lesson to a class of deaf children requires that the presenter utilize a variety of educational approaches and techniques. Paramount is consideration of the information level to be presented and the background knowledge of the audience. Background knowledge about sex and sexuality for deaf children is considerably less than for hearing children. Why? Hearing children can learn about sex incidentally through television, radio, and conversations with their peers. Deafness closes off avenues for incidental learning and the deaf youth is often at a disadvantage in learning aboutsexuality issues. Additionally, deaf youth have fewer opportunities to discuss sexuality with their parents because of communication problems in the house. For example, a hearing child may overhear an Oprah Winfrey talk show on AIDS/HIV with the resulting discussion and discuss this subject with his or her t By Gabriel A. Martin, Assistant Professor of Deaf Education at the Speech and Nursing Clnic, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX. This article was previously published in the Journal of Health Education, November /December 1993, 24(6), 374-375.98 AIDS Education: An Interdisciplinary Approach 91 parents, while the deaf youth is not able to understand the topic or to communicate questions to theparents.Language differences. The most important element that the health professional faces is that of languagedifferences with the deaf children. Deaf children typically are bilingual, that is, they use some form ofsign language and are learning English. Consequently, the presenter must offer his information withsimple sentences in English using a sign language interpreter. At all times, the presenter must make surethat the deaf student understands the technical vocabulary contained in an AIDS/HIV lesson.As a result of this language difference, health care professionals will find themselves in the unfamiliarand somewhat frightening situation of using an ASL interpreter. An ASL interpreter is one who hasdeveloped expressive and receptive skills in American Sign Language (ASL), follows a code of ethics, andinteracts with deaf adults and children in their community to have a familiarity with their cultures. Thesign language interpreter also will have skills in other sign systems for the purpose of communicatingwith a wide variety of deaf individuals who have varied communication levels.The health care professional should remember four elements that will ease tension of the new situa-tion. First, speak to the audience and not to the interpreter. The health care professional should face thedeaf students because they are the ones receiving the information, not the interpreter. Second, speak at anormal rate of speed. The health care professional should avoid the tendency to say a few words and waitfor the interpreter to catch-up. Third, speak clearly, distinctly, and avoid exaggeration of lip movementsand facial expressions. This will ensure that deaf students have an opportunity to receive facial informa-tion. Finally, the experience of a time lag when asking questions and receiving a response is a result ofinterpreting one language (English) into another (ASL).Multipresentation modes. The most common approach to presenting a topic is through the lecturemode. This traditional approach can be enhanced by utilizing visual displays to support the lecture (i.e.,posters, bulletin boards, overhead projectors, movies). The more the health professional can make thepresentation visual, the better it will be for hearing-impaired students because they are visual learners.One word of caution is that all the visual displays should represent the information at the appropriatelevel for the audience. Do not make the posters, bulletin boards, and overhead transparencies too childishfor junior high school or high school, nor too abstract for preschool and elementary level. Further, allvisual displays should be clear, neat, and accurate.A second approach utilized with hearing-impaired classrooms is \"role playing.\" This approach addsvariety and excitement to any topic. Having students play parts enhances internalization of the conceptspresented. It also personalizes learning and promotes a pragmatic connection of the facts. Integrating thelecture and \"role playing\" approaches greatly facilitates the student's learning. An example is where thehealth professional provides information about how one acquires AIDS/HIV, then has a pair of students\"role play\" a scenario where an individual (student 1) tells a friend (student 2) that he (student 1) ishomosexual and the friend (student 2) becomes very angry because he (student 2) believes that both ofthem have AIDS/HIV infection because they are friends. The class then is given the opportunity todiscuss this scenario with the presenter and the teacher. The scenario should be utilized at an appropriategrade level and maturity level for the class.A final approach suggested is use of varied project activities designed to incorporate the informationpresented into a practical utilization in the real world. One example might be that students organize anAIDS Education Week program under sponsorship of the school. Students would develop and present\"skits\" and posters, and invite local community medical experts to lecture to the entire student body andfaculty members. This also could be open to the public. Students learn how to organize a program, theylearn how to involve the school and community, they learn to work as a team, and they incorporate thefacts they learned about AIDS/HIV into a real world active project.The three approaches above should not be considered as the only ones available. They represent theconcept of providing the information to school-aged children from a variety of activities. These activitiessupport and reinforce the internalization of factual information. A point to be mentioned here is that useof manipulatives (i.e., worksheets, stories, objects) helps to support the approaches discussed in the pre-ceding paragraphs. Multi-sensory manipulations provide deeper levels of comprehension and internali-zation of concepts than do uni-sensory approaches.Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach requires some education on the part of the health care pro-fessional as well as the classroom teacher of the hearing impaired. There is the need to share informationand skills by both professionals. Both professionals utilize interpersonal skills to provide effective99 92HIV/AIDS Prevention teaching. Each must rely on the other's strengths to provide an efficient and effective learning environ-ment. There are several techniques and skills required of some health care professionals that may nothave been developed or experienced previously. These include utilization of sign language interpreters,lesson presentations, language levels of hearing-impaired students, and classroom environment.ConclusionThe need for AIDS/HIV education in the classroom is paramount for the hearing-impaired student.Because of the difficulty in the communication process and incorporation of a second language (ASL), thehealth care professional and the teacher of the deaf need to work in an interdisciplinary approach. In thismanner, education about an issue that is highly controversial optimally may subdue the fears experiencedby the community and will assist in providing much needed education to reverse the epidemic trend.ReferencesAllen, T.

The condition may be viewed as a diseaseissue, a decision-making issue, a sexuality issue, and a death and dying issue.A series of four teaching ideas are presented as they address each of the AIDS/HIV issues. The teach-ing techniques are as follows:1.\"Understanding AIDS/HIV\"a and dying issueActivity #1:\"Understanding AIDS/HIV\"Objective: After the bag demonstration, the student will be able to describe how HIV breaks down theimmune system to allow the development of AIDS. tBy Barbara Beier,J. Leslie Oganowski, Richard A. Detert, and Kenneth Becker, members of the faculty at theUniversity of Wisconsin-LaCrosse. This article was previously published in the Journal of Health Education,JanuarylFebruary 1993, 24(1), 47-49.100 AIDS /HIV Teaching Ideas93 Preparation: Prepare envelopes for each student with the following shapes representing parts of the bloodinvolved in the immune system. Place the HIV in only three of the envelopes.TBT-cellsWhite Blood Cells B CellsHIVNecessary Materials:1 lunch-size paper bag for each student2 lunch-size bags for teacher demonstrationmarkers or crayonsprepared envelope for each studentActivity:1.Instruct the students to color or decorate their bag to represent the skin.2.Review the steps that take place when a germ enters the body by having each student put parts ofthe blood (from their envelope) in the bag. The teacher demonstrates by placing in the bag each cell typeand explaining the action; i.e., white blood cells rush to the place where germs enter and attach to thegerm to make it less dangerous to the person.3.Introduce the functions of the immune system. A healthy immune system works to destroynearly all types of germs, including many bacteria and viruses.4.Write \"immune\" on the board. Have a student tell what is meant when someone says he/she is\"immune\" to something (protected/safe).5.Conduct the following demonstration of the activities of the immune system in fighting germs.a.Hold two bags to represent the skin as a barrier to keep germs out. As long as the skinremains uninjured, it holds what's inside the body in and keeps the rest safely out.b.Reveal a break in the skin by tearing part of one bag. Have students name ways a break couldoccur (cuts, scratches, burns, scrapes, broken bones, surgery, intravenous drugs, ear piercing, tattoos,punctures).c.Toss some objects into the bags representing foreign bacteria, viruses, or germs. Explain thatour blood contains white blood cells that fight germs. One kind of white blood cell (macrophage) movesthrough the blood and tissues to surround and \"eat\" germs. Toss some macrophage cells into the bag.d.T-cells are another type of white blood cell that help fight germs. T-cells attack and destroyviruses. Add T-cells to the bag. Stress that some T-cells serve as \"command centers\" for the body's battleagainst germs.e.Another kind of white blood cell is called a B-cell. Add the B-cells to the bag. B-cells producechemicals called antibodies. Explain that antibodies can destroy viruses and other germs.f.Explain that some antibodies, even after destroying some germs, stay in the body to protectin case there is another exposure to the same type of germ. That is immunity.g.Ask students \"What happens when the 'command center' in a real battle is destroyed?\" Con-clude that when germs attack the white blood cells (T-cells) that control the body's immune system, theycan cripple the body's ability to fight off infection and disease.h.Ask who has an \"H\" in his/her envelope. Toss the \"H\" into the bag. This represents an HIVcondition. AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV destroys the\"command centers\" (T-cells) of the immune system and the body cannot fight off certain infections.i.The person with HIV does not usually die of HIV infection directlythe person with AIDSusually dies from other diseases that the body can no longer fight off.Time Frame: The bag activity itself can be completed in a 30-40 minute class period. The preparatory infor-mation could take one class period to the activity. Questions about symptoms of HIV, children with HIV,and feelings associated with having an \"H\" in his/her bag could take varying amounts of time.Do discuss with the class the chances of \"having an HIV in his/her bag\" and the risks of infection.Include a discussion of caring for the feelings of people who are infected.101 94HIV/AIDS Prevention Activity #2:\"Who Do You Trust?\"Objective: At the completion of this activity, students will be able to discuss the benefits and consequencesof taking risks.Preparation: Before students enter the room, the teacher places objects inside each of four large brownpaper bags: (bag #1 = one mouse trap that is not set; bag #2 = one small mouse trap that is set; bag #3 =one large rat trap that is set; bag #4 = one block of wood).There is one block of wood on the corner of the table.Necessary Materials:4 large brown paper bags numbered 1 to 42 mouse traps1 large rat trap2 blocks of woodtableActivity:1.Ask for three volunteers to come forward who are willing to take a risk. Describe the risk asselecting one of the paper bags. Volunteers will be asked to blindly reach to the bottom of the bag andgrab whatever is in it. If it is the block of wood like the one on the corner of the table, they will receive adesignated amount of money.2.Ask for three volunteers who will assist the risk takers in their adventure. Instruct these volun-teers to move to the other side of the room.3.One at a time, ask each of the three assistants to open each of the bags and look at the contents.Ask them to be expressionless as they view each of the bags. Then ask each of the assistants if there is ablock of wood in at least one of the bags. Once verified, ask (one at a time) if he/she would be willing totake the risk of reaching blindly into one of the bags. Some will say no; some, yes.4.Ask each assistant to meet a risk taker and quietly whisper in his/her ear what was seen in thebags. Then instruct the risk taker to whisper the same message to one other person in the room. Once allthree have additional information about the contents, ask each of the risk takers if he/she is still willing totake the risk. Those who say \"no\" can be seated; those who are still willing to continue remain standing.5.Provide some more information to the risk takers (and the rest of the class) by revealing thecontents of bag #1. Then reveal the contents of bag #2 by unsetting the mouse trap with a folded piece ofpaper. Ask again which risk takers would still be willing to blindly reach into one of the two remainingbags.6.Ask the assistants to provide a bit more information to the risk takers and the rest of the class byasking whether a consequence of reaching into one of the bags could result in (a) pain, (b) broken fingers,or (c) the presence of blood? Then ask again who might be willing to take the risk.7.Teacher places remaining risk takers in the front of the room and asks them one more time if theyare willing to take the risk. If yes, mix the bags up and ask the risk takers to turn around. By now, mostrisk takers have quit!8.Of course, the teacher stops the activity at this point as students could get injured if they actuallyreached into bag #3. The bag contents are now revealed.9.Follow-up discussion:a.Ask the risk takers to tell the group what their assistant whispered in their ear.b.Did all the assistants see the same contents?c.Discuss how the risk takers thought they could \"beat the odds.\"d.Discuss comments that encouraged/discouraged each from stopping or continuing with theactivity.e.Finally, discuss what risks each are willing to take; which would not be safe risks; what risksare involved with AIDS/HIV conditions.Time Frame: This activity takes between 20-40 minutes to complete. The time frame may vary dependingon grade level and the number of comments made or points raised during the discussion.102 AIDS /HIV Teaching Ideas95 Activity #3:\"A Safer Sex Continuum\"Objective: At the completion of this activity the student will be able to identify means of transmission ofAIDS/HIV on a safer to unsafe continuum.Preparation: When discussing the issue of AIDS in the classroom, one way to introduce safe and unsafesexual practices is by using the \"Safer Sex Continuum.\" This activity would be part of a larger unit onsexuality or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and would be utilized once the students had developeda degree of comfort in discussing sexual topics.Materials Necessary:chalkboard and chalk(or newsprint and marking pens)Activity:1.Introduce the topic by having students consider the methods of transmission of the HIV virusand sexual practices. Place the continuum shown at the bottom of the page on the chalkboard.2.At this point, ask the students to \"place\" a sexual activity on this continuum on the appropriateposition so as to indicate the \"safeness\" or \"riskiness\" of the behavior. As each behavior or sexual activityis suggested, the elements involved in ranking that behavior in that position should also be discussed.This method involves the students in analyzing each sexual activity based upon their knowledge of thetransmission of the HIV virus. It is also a method that could be useful in introducing sensitive topics suchas masturbation, condom use, and anal intercourse.3.Clarification of certain activities is a productive outcome of this activity if students are allowed toengage in open discussion and ask questions. For instance, one popular misconception discovered withthis approach was that some students considered a sexual monogamous relationship to mean having sexwith \"one person at a time.\"Time Frame: This activity takes between 30 and 50 minutes to complete depending upon (1) the level ofknowledge of the students, (2) the degree of comfort with discussing sexual topics, and (3) the amount ofdiscussion time allowed.Activity #4:\"The Living Years\"Objective: At the completion of this activity, the student will be able to verbalize his/her reactions to AIDSas a death and dying issue.Preparation: One effective way we found to address AIDS as a death and dying issue was to play a songthat many students may have heard on popular hit radio stations. \"The Living Years,\" recorded by Mikeand the Mechanics, was played and students were encouraged to follow along with the printed words.Introductory statements may include: \"Think about the words and what they say about death and dy-ing,\" or, \"As you listen to the words of this song, think about your thoughts on death, dying, and AIDS.\"Materials Necessary:tape: \"The Living Years,\" by Mike and the songtape playerThe Living YearsEvery generationBlames the one beforeAnd all of their frustrationsCome beating in your door.I know that I'm a prisonerTo all my father held so dearI know that I'm a hostageTo all his hopes and fearsI just wish I could have told himIn the living years.1U3Crumpled bits of paperFilled with imperfect thoughtStilted conversationsI'm afraid that's all we've got.You say you just don't see it 96HIV/AIDS Prevention He says it's perfect senseYou just can't get agreementIn this present tenseWe all talk a different languageTalking in defense.Say it loud, say it clearYou can listen as well as you hearIt's too late when we dieTo admit we don't see eye to eye.So we open up in quarrelBetween the present and the pastWe only sacrifice the futureIt's the bitterness that lasts.So don't yield to the fortunesYou sometimes see as fateIt may have a new perspectiveOn a different dayAnd if you don't give up,And don't give inYou may just be OK.Say it loud, say it clearYou can listen as well as you hearIt's too late when we dieTo admit we don't see eye to eye. 104I wasn't there that morningWhen my father passed awayI didn't get to tell himAll the things I had to say,I think I caught his spiritLater that same yearI'm sure I heard his echoIn my baby's new born tearsI just wish I could have told himIn the living years.\"The Living Years,\" Mike and the Me-chanics (1988), Atlantic Record Corpora-tion, 75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY10019. Discipline: A Parenting Dilemma 97 PARENTEDUCATION DISCIPLINE:A PARENTING DILEMMAt The philosophical continuum of parental discipline ranges from \"child abuse\" on one extreme to \"passiveacceptance of the child's unmanageable behavior\" on the other. Repercussions to disciplinary actions areboth positive and negative and affect both child and parental health.Attempting to apply specific disciplinary measures to correct a child's unacceptable behavior canoften be a matter of trial and error. For each couple experiencing parenthood, there will be frustration andaggravation as well as love and delight.Parents admittedly make mistakes in their administration of discipline. Today the effectiveness of thetraditional method of corporal punishment is much in doubt. It is through this method that childrenquickly learn \"might means right.\" Since there are seldom any academic classes addressing the problemsof parenting, we are often left with past disciplinary experiences as our only legacy of such skills.The selection of behavioral management techniques by a parent depends on the child's overtbehavior which is interfering with parental rules or guidelines.Behavioral management is basically a set of procedures that, when appropriately applied, usuallydecrease undesirable behavior and hopefully increase desirable behavior. These parental proceduresrequire experience and practice to be successful. Punishment is defined as administering an aversiveconsequence or withdrawing positive reinforcement in order to reduce the possibility of the recurrence ofa task or demonstration of a maladaptive behavior (Azrin & Holz, 1966).Discipline is a state of order based upon rules and regulations. In its simplest terms, it is teachingpeople to follow specific rules.There is a major difference between punishment and discipline, however. In punishment, pain fol-lows an act that someone else disapproves of, and the someone else usually provides the pain. With disci-pline, the pain is a natural and realistic consequence of a person's behavior. Unlike punishment, disci-pline is rarely arbitrary; it asks that a child evaluate his behavior and commit himself to a better course ofaction (Glasser, 1965).Preventive behavioral management is the best approach to parenting. Management guidelines needto be established early and explained in detail, along with possible consequences as a result of violatingthese guidelines.The importance of parent-child communication is paramount in the prevention-behavior managementcontinuum. Being able to discuss fully problems, potential crises, and the providing of parental support,can perhaps reduce the probability of future behavioral problems.Health problems pertaining to mental health, sexuality, mood modifiers, nutrition and other relatedareas often center around a poor self-concept or self-esteem. If potential parents realize the importance ofthe development of their child's self-concept and facilitate open, two-way communication, disciplinetechniques will be more easily understood and tolerated. t By Patrick K. Tow, Associate Professor of Health Education, Department of Health, Physical Education andRecreation, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, and Warren L. McNab, Associate Professor of Health Educat-ion, School of Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV. This articlewas previously published in Health Education, February /March 1985 , 16(1), 45-47.1u5 '98Parent Involvement The positive or negative development of the child depends on the parental attitudes, values, anddiscipline philosophy which many times emulates the positive or negative relationship they experiencedwith their own parents.Glasser (1965) suggests parents take the following steps in addressing behavioral problems:1. Ask the child if what he/she did was against your parental rules.2. Ask the child to evaluate himself as to the reason behind his/her actions or behavior.3. Collectively the parent(s) and the child should devise a plan and commitment to do better.4. As a parent, explain you will not accept anything but a change in behavior.5. Otherwise, specific consequences of breaking the rules will be enforced. In following these steps,parents should build on the positive strengths of their children, control emotions, and facilitate positivecommunication.The Role of Health EducationEducational methodologies which allow parents or prospective parents hypothetically to recognizepotential problem areas, establish guidelines in disciplining children, and practice the communicationtechniques which enhance the behavioral management procedure, certainly would be beneficial. Prospec-tive parents are not prepared, nor do they realize what parental responsibilities encompass. Education forparenthood segments of health education courses should involve a variety of methodologies gearedtoward the prevention, management, and communication skills needed to cope with specific behaviorproblems.In professional preparation programs, health educators should provide numerous methodologies tostudents involving disciplinary measures. Following is a procedure that has been successful in providingstudents in health education with parental behavioral management experience.Step 1. Identify Discipline AlternativesChances are that students in your class have had first-hand experience with a variety of disciplinarymeasures employed by their own parents. Tap into this valuable resource at your disposal. Depend upontheir past encounters to help shape the preliminary portion of the strategy by encouraging them to iden-_tify a list of these measures.After the brainstorming session, carry out a class tally of the number of students having experience ineach of the measures listed. This will help students realize there is a commonality, though no absoluteuniformity, in discipline practices among parents. It also allows students the opportunity to see there aremany different and perhaps more effective ways to handle disciplinary problems. This list usuallyincludes the following disciplinary alternatives:1. Corporal punishment (i.e., use of physical force).2. Total loss of privileges (e.g., no TV, music, or parties).3. Home detention (i.e., grounded at home for a period of time; room confinement).4. Fines (i.e., suspension or reduced allowance; pay a penalty).5. Assignment of extra household duties (i.e., additional chores on top of regular duties).6. Verbal put-downs (i.e., belittle or scold).7. Curbing of privileges (e.g., earlier curfew, restrictions).8. Ignoring the problem (i.e., pay little or no attention to the child).No doubt there are proponents and opponents to one or more of these disciplinary techniques. Part ofthis step requires students to provide advantages and disadvantages for each of the measures cited.Step 2. Examine Potential Disciplinary ProblemsAfter identifying specific disciplinary alternatives, the types of problems confronted by new parentsover the years should be identified. After all, our society would like to believe its members designateappropriate \"punishment\" tailored to the nature of the \"crime\" committed. Presumably the same logicwould apply to the disciplinary problems created by children in a family. This second step requiresstudents to list problems frequently encountered at home for which disciplinary measures may beapplied. Examples of some potential disciplinary problems would probably include:106 Discipline: A Parenting Dilemma 99 1. Talking back or \"sassing\"2. Excessive TV watching3. Use of profanity4. Staying out late without checking in5. Lying6. Shoplifting7. Fighting with peers8. Playing with matches9. Crossing streets without adult supervision10. Smoking cigarettes11. Coming home drunk12.

Violation of curfew on weekday or weekend28. Hitting the parent in anger29. Hanging around with bad company30. Failing academically at schoolAs one can easily surmise from this partial listing of disciplinary problems, some are major concernswhile others do not need redress of any kind. Yet many parents have a way of misconstruing a wideassortment of concerns as being a personal matter deserving punitive action. One also sees that someconcerns can be handled differently with a young child than with a teenager.Step 3. Examine Specific Circumstances and Determine a Reasonable Course of Disciplinary ActionThis step requires students in the class to be paired off in couples simulating two parents.Ask the prospective parents to examine each of the situations listed and determine whether it trulyconstitutes a bonafide disciplinary problem. The parents are then to determine the proper disciplinaryaction, if any, to be applied to each of the problems listed earlier. It must be stressed to these pseudo-parents that concurrence should exist between them on the final decision. This exercise can also be doneindividually to symbolize the single parent family.Step 4. Evaluation and Discussion of the Disciplinary DecisionThe last step of this strategy involves convening the class to listen collectively to and discuss similaror different ways these prospective parents would handle such disciplinary problems in their ownfamilies. The opportunity to discuss the reasons for variations in approaching the same disciplinaryproblems should be provided.SummaryThe positive familial relationship can be an extremely rewarding and enjoyable experience. The key,perhaps, is understanding the magnitude of the responsibility of parenthood, the preparation of the pre-107 100Parent Involvement dictable, and coping with the unpredictable behavioral management difficulties that one may encounteras a parent.Even before anticipating a pregnancy, prospective parents should evaluate the needs and goals theyhope to satisfy by having children. Every child should be a wanted child. In having children, parentsshould feel a sense of creative accomplishment in guiding and helping a child grow into a well-function-ing adult. The parent is the most important teacher the child will ever have. Helping their childrenthrough behavior management in developing positive physical, mental, intellectual, and social adjust-ments in life can be a wonderfully rewarding experience for parents. Even the best parents makemistakes, but with proper knowledge, planning, and discipline experience, they can overcome many ofthe difficulties of child-rearing. Good parents will evaluate the discipline situation and respect the childas an individual, satisfy the psychological and behavioral needs of the child, and provide the child withemotional security, sympathy, and understanding.In the majority of school systems, parenting and behavioral management skills are not included in thehealth curriculum. There is a definite need for cognitive and effective teachings regarding the behavioralmanagement of children. The objective is to provide as many relevant and realistic experiences aspossible to inform students, as potential parents, of the responsibilities in preparing for parenthood.There is a need to dispel the unrealistic notion that as future parents they will rear perfectly obedientchildren. Disciplinary measures come in many formsheld in disdain by some and strongly endorsed byothers. Effective experimental behavioral management techniques encourage effective parent-childcommunication skills through listening, critical thinking, and assertiveness.Health programs which include parental discipline techniques can provide assistance to youngpeople to prepare for parenthood, reduce certain predictable health problems, and hopefully enhance theoverall health of the child and parent in the process.ReferencesAzrin, N.

They rely totally ontheir parents and caregivers (\"Caregiver\" refers to the individual responsible for the child while theparent is away, for example, due to employment outside the home) to meet their basic needs, provide acaring environment, and protect them from injury and harm. Parents and caregivers want to be familiarwith all information related to the health and safety of their young children, but many individuals feelthey lack sufficient knowledge in all areas such as basic child care, safety and first aid, and nutrition. Theindividual may experience feelings of guilt or lack of confidence if the child develops a preventable illnessor is injured. Acquisition of this information can be another source of frustration. Parents and caregivershave a natural interest in their child's well-being and they ask questions of one another to meet theirchild's needs. Examples of health/safety related questions which one might expect are (parent to doctor)\"What immunizations are recommended?\"; (parent to caregiver) \"Are the electrical outlets properlycovered and are toys appropriate for the child's age?\" or (caregiver to parent) \"Your child seemsunusually tired. Has he/she been ill or had any fever?\". Questions such as these are essential to optimal tBy CharlotteM. Hendricks, Health Educator and Special Projects Coordinator, JCCEO Headstart, Birmingham,AL. This article was previously published in Health Education, September /October 1990, 21(5), 56-57. 1 Parent/Caregiver Health Education in the Daycare Center 101 child care, but parents and caregivers may not realize their importance. Therefore, one goal of healtheducation for this population is to increase awareness of health related issues and the importance ofhealthy behaviors. Caregivers then can be directed to further sources of information.Daycare centers are seldom the target of formal health education programs. This is a serious problemwhen one considers the growing number of children enrolled in such programs. More than half of all pre-school age children have employed mothers (the traditional caregiver) and about half these mothers usesome form of day care (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1987). Unfortunately, parents and caregivers ofyoung children in daycare programs often cannot arrange time to participate in a structured health edu-cation program at the center. Parents have diverse schedules, so it is difficult to schedule a time conveni-ent for each. Daycare staff are limited to the time before and after work hours for educational programs,creating additional scheduling difficulty since many daycare staff work on individualized schedulesrather than on standard shifts. For such reasons, parents and caregivers require effortless access to conciseinformation that has immediate application to their child's developmental or health needs.Health education may occur only through efforts of a concerned parent or caregiver familiar with thehectic schedules of other parents and caregivers. The purpose of this article is to describe a health educa-tion program which can be implemented easily in a daycare center by any individual with the properinterest and motivation, and does not require a trained health educator.The first component involves placing colorful, informative posters by each outer door. Parents andcaregivers can read the information as they take their child to or from the center. The primary purpose ofthe poster is to make individuals aware of the topic. Thus, the key to success is color and design. Theposter must be visually appealing to both children and adults and must attract their attention. A differentposter and topic is presented each month.The second component provides further information related to the topic through pamphlets and bro-chures that the individual can keep for future reference. A colorful box containing copies of the materialis placed near the poster. As with posters, material are changed monthly.The difficulty in conducting this program may be to locate appropriate (and free) posters and pam-phlets. Many available health education posters are related to adolescent and adult topics rather thanchildhood health issues. Few health education printed materials relate specifically to the health and safetyneeds of young children. This lack of appropriate materials can affect greatly the impact of a health edu-cation program. If parents perceive materials (such as stop smoking or cardiovascular disease informa-tion) to be unrelated to their child's immediate needs, they may ignore future materials. Also, selectedmaterials must be carefully reviewed for accuracy, readability, and suitability of information. This willrequire expertise of an individual trained in health education and/or a related profession.Likely sources of appropriate materials may include companies that market children's toys, infantformula/foods, medicines, diapers, or clothing. Professional or governmental organizations such as theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission, the NationalInstitute of Dental Research, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have materials at little or nocost. Voluntary and public health organizations, such as the American Heart Association the AmericanLung Association, and local Children's Hospitals also provide excellent materials.The need for immediate application of information is met through the third component, presentationof weekly \"Health Tips,\" or \"Health Questions.\" A sheet of colored paper is folded in half and fastened toa bulletin board or other prepared surface. The question is printed on the outside flap, preferably alongwith clip-art or a picture to attract the individual's attention. The person must then open the folded paperto read the answer or health tip. Since this information is changed weekly, it serves either to highlightinformation in the related pamphlet or to provide up-to-date information about current health events. Forexample, a question might ask \"What food most often causes choking?\" Answer: \"Hot dogs. Other foodsthat young children should not eat are hard candies, Vienna sausages, grapes, and nuts.\" Another topicarea for which a question could be asked might be based on news coverage of pesticide contamination ofapple products.The fourth component of this program may be maintenance of an on-site library including books andvideocassettes. Parents themselves may be the best source of material since many are willing to sharetheir personal books and videotapes. Also, the sources mentioned earlier may provide single copies ofbooks or videotapes or may provide copyright permission for their videotaped materials. If an on-sitelibrary is not feasible, a reference list of materials available at the local public library can be provided. 1) 9 102Parent Involvement The final element to a successful health education program is listening to participants. Parents andcaregivers can suggest topics and ask questions to make the program more interesting and applicable.The comments may be collected by providing paper, pencil, and a drop box, or have parents inform theirchild's teacher of their interests.This entire program can be directed by an individual parent or caregiver, or the program director maychoose to coordinate the activities and delegate responsibilities to interested parents and caregivers. Afew simple steps such as these can not only make a great difference in the adults' confidence and securityas they care for their child, but can also help create a healthy, happy, and safe childhood.ReferenceAmerican Academy of Pediatrics.

Elk Grove Village, IL. 110 Defending Your Programs 1 03 PROGRAM ANDINSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DEFENDING YOUR PROGRAMSt Ellen Candles, drug prevention coordinator for a mid-size school district in Wisconsin, sits behind a desk watchingthe veins on a young woman's neck become more and more pronounced even as her voice maintains a calm, deter-mined tone. The woman's son is in the fourth grade, and she is describing the drug education program he is beingtaught: ...school is not a place for psychotherapy. I do not pay taxes for my son to feel that he has to tell family secretsin order to pass this class. My son has strong values, and I don't want them subverted by a curriculum that turnschildren against their parents and pries into their personal lives.\"Ms. Candles nods as the woman continues with claims that the curriculum espouses New Age philosophy,promotes drug use, reflects values clarification, and violates the Hatch Act. The woman concludes by demanding notonly that her son be removed from the drug education class, but also that the curriculum be removed from thedistrict's program.The following week, the woman, along with five other parents, will take her complaints to the School Board.These parents will be adamant, persistent, and organized.This is not an uncommon scenarioin any state, in any community. Drug education programs, healthprograms, are constantly being challenged, sometimes by well-meaning parents with legitimate concernsabout what their children are learning in school, sometimes by fanatics of the right whose sole agenda isto make everyone adapt to their narrow, intolerant beliefs, and everything in between. To the extent thatyou can distinguish people's motives, you'll better serve the interests of your students and yourdistrict.People who rant about the devil's exerting influence over the developers of a curriculum may be sub-jects for amusing anecdotes, but their impact has been serious and far-reaching. The right is organized,well-funded, and single-minded. We need to address their concerns as much as anyone's, but there arecertain points to remember if we are to address their concerns successfully. Here are some:(1) Know your rules and your allies. First, know the process by which curricula are adopted in yourdistrict. Understand how the system works so you can guarantee that no one is stampeded into makinga decision based on an emotional presentation. Second, know your allies. Rely on others for support,for information, and for ideas. Establish alliances and conditions to support your health education program.(2) Determine whether the challengers in fact live in your district or have children in your district's schools. This, of course, goes to the heart of their concerns; it may have nothing to do with their ownchildren, but more to do with a national political agenda.(3) Ask them to document their concerns in writing. Having a concern in writing accomplishesseveral objectives: it makes the person adhere to a consistent line; it makes the person be specific, so you tBy Neal Starlcman,writer and developer, and Jerry Warren, Health Education Specialist, at Comprehensive HealthEducation Foundation, Seattle, WA. This article was previously published in the Journal of Health Education,November /December 1993 Supplement, S-50-S-S1.111 104Program and Instructional Resources in turn can be specific in your response; it enables you to refer the concern to others, without fear of mis-interpretation.(4) Ask challengers if they personally have read the material in question. Sometimes people willmerely repeat a rumor they've heard rather than examine the material in context. Offer to show thematerial in question.(5) Ask for definitions of terms, e.g., \"sensitivity training,\" \"secular humanism.\" Quite often peopleuse terms to generate emotion rather than reason; they really don't know what \"sensitivity training\" or\"secular humanism\" means. If you can get them to define their terms, it will be easier to reject theirclaims.(6) Talk about the overall goals of the curriculum and the objectives of the lessons, not each word ineach activity. A curriculum is complex. It includes not only written material, but also the teacher, thestudents, and the classroom environment. Targeting a word or sentence can lead people astray from themain thrust of the lesson and the program. You're better off if your curriculum is age-appropriate, isbased on reliable research, and uses acceptable methodology.(7) Keep in focus the needs of the students. Don't be shifted form the important issues. You're not ina position to debate the religious freedom of the parent or the moral decay of civilization or the lack ofrespect young people have for their elders. Presumably, you have a mandate to provide effective healtheducation for your students. That's the issue.(8) Stay positive. This could be the most difficult point to remember. Sometimes you're going to beinteracting with hateful, spiteful people who care nothing for children, nothing for education, nothing foryou. In these cases, you might have to accept a bottom line: you won't be able to convince them of anything.Arguing with logic is alien to some people, and you might as well agree to disagree. Be assured thatyou're doing what's right for children and what's consistent with the goals of your job.This is tough work: It makes you expend time and energy on something that distracts you from whatyou want to be doing. It exposes you to intolerance and negativity when you'd prefer to be focusing onthe promise and hope of health education. But remember: You're not alone. Most people don't agree withthe fanatics. Most people support health education. These are the people you need to stand the groundwith you.Here are people who will stand the ground with you.

The group's composi-tion and discussion are carefully planned to create a permissive, nonthreatening environment conduciveto revelation and disclosure. Participants are encouraged to express differing perceptions, ask questions,and respond to comments of other participants, as well as to those presented by the moderator (Kreuger,1989).You probably have heard about use of focus group interviews in health education research. Theyhave proven highly effective as a tool for \"understanding and developing sensitivity toward those weserve\" (Basch, 1987, p. 436). Less attention has been given to the important educational role that focusgroups can play in helping participants clarify values, expand their knowledge, and motivate them toadopt healthy behaviors. This article looks at each of these applications, research, and education, as theymay be used by school based health educators. We give special attention to curricula development andrisk reduction, using smoking cessation as an example.Understanding Student PerceptionsAs a research tool, focus group interviews offer a relatively rapid and inexpensive way to gain anunderstanding of students' perceptions of a health topic such as smoking and smoking cessation cur-ricula. The loosely structured discussion format is ideal for uncovering factors that influence students'decisions and the feelings associated with various views about the topic. Information that is especiallyvaluable in determining the content, key messages, materials, and teaching methods which are needed todesign risk reduction curricula effectively includes:Knowledge: What do they already know? What misinformation needs to be corrected? What dothey want to know?Perceptions: What factors deter them from adopting healthy practices? What aspirations, interests,or other factors can be used to motivate them to adopt healthy practices?Assessment of teaching techniques: Which teaching methods do they enjoy the most? Which dothey believe are most effective in helping them understand new information? Which do they find mosteffective in helping them change health behaviors?Assessment of existing or proposed teaching materials: Do they understand the information pre-sented? What do they like and dislike about the content, illustrations, and format of the proposedmaterials. Do they find the spokesperson(s) credible and convincing? Do they find the message(s) persua-sive?A note of caution: in curricula development, results of focus group research usually are confirmedusing a more structured survey that allows the health educator to assess the extent to which issues areshared by a larger group. It is important also to supplement data obtained from students with the viewsof other key groups, particularly parents, teachers, and community representatives.Empowering Students to Adopt Healthy BehaviorsAlthough focus group discussions are conducted primarily to collect information, most participantsfind them highly educational, even empowering (Bryant & Bailey, 1990). This is not surprising. Smallgroup processes have been used in health education since Kurt Lewin and Margaret Mead conductedgroup experiments during World War II. Using lectures and small group discussions, they found that tBy Carol Bryant,Assistant Professor, and Elizabeth Gulitz, Associate Professor, in the Department of Communityand Family Health, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. This article was previouslypublished in the Journal of Health Education, May /June 1993,24(3), 188-189.113 1 06Program and Instructional Resources people are more likely to act on the knowledge that they have learned if they make a commitment in agroup to do so, even if they know that they will never see other group members again (Basch, 1987).Focus group discussions are especially valuable for health educators working with students. First,students learn a great deal from their peers. The safety of being with a group of other students providesan avenue for self-discovery, self-expression, and an opportunity to compare their views with those oftheir peers. The group interaction and camaraderie that typically develops within the group enhancesstudents' abilities to uncover factors that influence their health decisions and stimulates a willingness toshare these discoveries with others. Participants often gain the support from the group to express sociallyunpopular, embarrassing, or anxiety producing views. Also, most groups contain one or morecourageous students who share information that others would prefer to withhold, thereby proVoking themore timid respondents to make similar disclosures (Goldman & McDonald, 1987). In this way, focusgroup discussions encourage value clarification, and give students a rare opportunity to teach each other.This instills confidence and increases the likelihood that students will translate this new knowledge intobehavioral change. In a discussion of smoking, for example, students may gain a new awareness of themany factors that influence their decision to smoke. They may learn for the first time that others sharemany of their concerns. For those voicing a public position against smoking, the group interactionreinforces their decision not to smoke.Second, focus group interviews allow the health educator to observe respondents' interactions as theyshare feelings, form opinions, and influence each other, as they would in other social settings. If smokersand nonsmokers are mixed in a group, it is possible to assess the strength of their convictions as theydefend their respective positions. How do smokers respond to the view that smokers are less attractivesexually because of bad breath and clothing? How do the nonsmokers counter the advantages ofsmoking?During the course of group discussions, some students change their opinions or beliefs. Often, focusgroup participants are able to correct misinformation and encourage adoption of healthier behaviorswithout guidance of an educator or moderator. In addition to the impact the group interaction has onparticipants' views or behavior, the opportunity to observe the interaction enables the moderator toidentify the comments or types of interaction that resulted in the shift. This also may provide informationuseful in designing educational messages, materials, and other aspects of risk reduction curricula.Third, focus group interviews use a loosely structured interview format to present ideas or broadtopics for discussion. Students as well as the moderator may initiate new topics and direct the conver-sation to areas not previously recognized as relevant. For instance, students are able to address theirconcerns about smoking and to present ideas for encouraging young people to quit that could not beanticipated by the moderator. This makes the group discussion effective as both an educational andresearch tool, generating insights that can be incorporated into other educational materials and messages.Fourth, like people of all ages, students gain a sense of importance from participating in a project thatwill help others. Focus group discussions offer a rare opportunity to serve as expert, expressing viewswhile one or more adults listen respectfully and intently. Moderators often are impressed with howarticulate and intelligent people appear in focus groups compared to other settings in which theiropinions are not as highly valued. They also note the large percentage of people who express gratitudefor being included and ask to participate in future groups.Special ChallengesFocus group discussions with students pose several challenges to the health educator. Because teensand pre-teens are easily influenced by their peers, the moderator should be skilled at eliciting divergentopinions and controlling the influence of more dominant, vocal participants. Examples include avoidingeye contact with a student who is doing most of the talking or looking directly at a more reticent groupmember when asking a question (KreuGer, 1989; Goldman & McDonald, 1987). The interview protocolcan be designed to ensure that a balance of techniques also helps to counter peer pressure and to facilitatediscussion of unpopular or embarrassing views, especially when working with a groUp of students whoknow each other. Examples include free association, story completion exercises, and photo sort exercises(Debus, 1989). In the photo sort exercise, students are given a set of photographs of teens representing avariety of class and ethnic groups and are asked to identify the people who would smoke and those whowould not. As students discuss the reasons for their choices, they are likely to reveal subtle characteristics Focus Group Discussions: An Application to Teaching 107 of smokers that otherwise would require unusual awareness and verbal skill. In the course of imaginingthe lives and attributes of these photographed teens, the students are likely to discover and disclose infor-mation about their own ideas and personalities.In sum, focus group discussions offer the health educator working in school settings a valuableresearch method for gaining increased awareness of students' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions ofhealth topics, and an educational technique to empower them to adopt healthier lifestyles.

COGNITIVE MAPPING:AN ACTIVITY FOR HEALTH EDUCATIONt Health educators are in general agreement that health behavior is a decision-making process, where deci-sions are based on critical examination of possible alternatives (Pollock & Middleton, 1989). Teachers ofhealth education, then, should be concerned with selecting and utilizing methods of teaching designed toassist students in developing problem-solving skills. An information processing approach to studentlearning offers a useful framework for thinking about process-centered teaching which can encouragereasoning and reflection, rather than recitation by students.Current information processing approaches to learning assume that an individual constructs modelsof reality from interactions with the environment and these prototypes are stored as networks of relatedschemata or structures for future reference or interpretation (Shuell, 1986). It is the qualitative organi-zation of this network that is as important as learning from an information processing perspectiveinvolving creation of cognitive structures which help students arrange knowledge in a meaningful way.Knowledge structures are based on the content of a particular course but are created individually bystudents. These internal cognitive representations are used to interpret new knowledge, forming the basisfor problem solving. There is general agreement that in order for basic health content to be useful to stu-dents, the information acquired must represent more than a compilation of facts, laws, and theories to bememorized for a unit examination. If learning is to be a lifelong process enabling students to think anduse cognitive skills for more healthful living, teachers must assist students in their development of moreorganized and elaborate cognitive structures. tBy Jo A.

First, the teacher asks each student to formulate a list of terms about a particular health topicor provides the student with a teacher-constructed list. The goal is for students to arrange the terms insome spatial way which represents their personal understanding of the content. Students are asked todraw a map or picture which displays their understanding of the content, using connecting lines to showrelationships. A sample map prepared by the teacher on another topic may be used as an example. It isimportant to emphasize that there is no one correct way to display the terms. The objective is for each stu-dent to construct a network that makes sense to him or her. Since cognitive maps reflect the knowledgestructure of a student, several useful applications can be offered for teachers.The Process in ActionAssessment of KnowledgeStudents construct a map prior to instruction so the depth and breadth of understanding about atopic can be determined. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate pretest maps showing two different levels of priorknowledge. The concept map can be used in lieu of or in addition to a pretest. As students progressthrough the unit, new maps should be generated to serve as indicators of learning and to identify areas ofmisunderstanding. Maps drawn during instruction can show content inadequacies (long vertical lists) orillogical associations(two totally unrelated concepts connected). The basis for gaps and inadequacies incomprehension of health content then can be studied and specific plans can be made to address miscon-ceptions or limited understanding.Organizing ContentUse an instructor-prepared map as a visual when introducing a topic. The map can function as aguide for sequencing content and can provide a vehicle for helping students link new ideas to what theyalready know. Identification of major concepts or principles can be used as advanced organizers and, assubconcepts are introduced, relationships can be explained while viewing the map. This helps studentsanchor new terminology to that previously learned.Facilitating ComprehensionStudents are asked to look at their maps during class, then form small groups to compare and discussthe maps. Student maps can be compared with the map constructed by the teacher. Discussion of dif-ferences shows students that content can be understood and interpreted in different ways, and that thereis not always just one right answer. Comparison of the various networks can help students establish linksbetween concepts which will improve comprehension. While simple recall of subject matter is important,development of higher level cognitive skills (analysis, synthesis) is necessary before information can beapplied to problem-solving situations.In summary, cognitive maps offer health education teachers a powerful teaching tool which can beuseful to: (1) link new health concepts with prior health knowledge, (2) give direction for organizing andanchoring new health information, (3) help students integrate and synthesize health concepts and sub-concepts holistically, both within and between the designated health content areas, and (4) provide theteacher with opportunities to help students develop cognitive skills needed for critical thinking and prob-lem solving. Mapping is simple to learn and can be used with students in the elementary grades throughcollege. The maps reflect qualitative characteristics of students' thinking. This is quite different fromsimple recall.ReferencesPollock, M B., & Middleton, K (1989). Elementary school health instruction. St. Louis: Times Mirror/MosbyCollege Publishing.Shuell, T. J (1990).
