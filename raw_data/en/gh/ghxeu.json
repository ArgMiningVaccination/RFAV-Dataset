What is the capacity charge? The sewage treatment capacity charge is a monthly charge, billed quarterly for 15 years directly from King County. It helps fund the costs of new wastewater infrastructure in our region without charging up-front costs for property development. Who pays a capacity charge? Owners of properties whose sewage flows to a King County treatment plant and who connect to the sewer system on or after February 1, 1990 pay the capacity charge. This includes new sewer service, reconnections after 5 years, additions, and changes of use. Some properties in Pierce County and south Snohomish County pay the capacity charge because their sewage is brought to and treated at a King County sewage treatment plant. The capacity charge is the responsibility of the current property owner. The charge is billed for 15 years, unless the balance is paid off early. Why is there a capacity charge? The capacity charge helps King County protect public health and the environment. It also helps us keep up with our region's growth by funding more pipes, pump stations, and treatment plants. Customers with the newest sewer connections pay the charge so that \"growth pays for growth.\" Elected officials, sewer utility representatives and jurisdiction officials were all involved in King County's decision to implement a capacity charge. How much is the capacity charge? The capacity charge is calculated using a measurement called \"residential customer equivalent\" or RCE. The 2023 capacity charge is $72.50 per residential customer equivalent (RCE) per month. This rate goes into effect for properties connecting to the sewer system on or after January 1, 2023.
