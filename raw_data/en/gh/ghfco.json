Most babies get nappy rash at some time, but some are more sensitive than others. Your baby's skin needs to be clean and dry to help prevent nappy rash. If your baby's bottom has redness or spots: - change their nappy more often - give them time without a nappy Causes of nappy rash Nappy rash can happen when: - your baby is left too long in a dirty or wet nappy - a rough nappy rubs against your baby - your baby has a thrush infection - their skin is sensitive to a soap, bath product or detergent like washing powder - you use baby wipes that contain alcohol - your baby is teething - your baby or toddler has recently been on antibiotics Healing nappy rash Always wash your hands before and after changing your baby's nappy. Use cotton wool and water to clean your baby's skin. Try not to use baby wipes until your baby is 2 to 4 weeks old. Gently wash your baby's bottom and pat it dry at each nappy change. Leave off the nappy for half an hour and expose the skin to fresh air, as much as possible. Add a thin layer of protective barrier cream. Your pharmacist, public health nurse or GP can recommend one. Do not use bubble baths, talcum powder or any scented products on your baby. Sometimes it can be helpful to give your baby their evening fluids early. This means the nappy may not be as wet overnight. Never apply raw egg or any other food directly to broken skin. Talk to your GP if your baby continues to be distressed and their nappy rash is not improving with treatment. How often to change nappies How often you change your baby's nappy will depend on their age. Young babies may need changing up to 10 or 12 times a day. Older babies need to be changed around 6 to 8 times. Change them after every feed, and as soon as possible after they have done a poo. There is no need to wake them up to change their nappy if they are asleep. "}
