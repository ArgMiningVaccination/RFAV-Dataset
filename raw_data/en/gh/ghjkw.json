Certif ication usually requires an examination to verify a certain knowledge base and experience in the specialty area to develop the expertise. Certification is a voluntary process that provides recognition of one's expertise. 3. d. The Joint Commission establishes National P atient Safety Goals (NPSG) and evidence-based solutions are provided to prevent persistent safety problems. Nurses are vital to promoting this culture of safety. Rapidly expanding technology and knowledge are increasing the complexity of the health care system. With the aging population there will be more patients with chronic illnesses. The QSEN project identified six core competencies for nursing education to include in the curriculum to enable graduates to be ready for practice. 4. QSEN' s six competencies are (1) Patient-centered care, (2) Teamwork and collaboration, (3) Evidence-based practice, (4) Quality improvement, (5) Safety, and (6) Informatics. 5. In order: 6 Make recommendations for practice or generate data1 Ask a clinical question3 Critically analyze the evidence 2 Find and collect the evidence 5 Evaluate the outcomes in the clinical setting0 Create a spirit of inquiry 4 Use evidence, clinical expertise, and patient preferences to determine care 6. b . The C part of the PICOT format stands for Comparison. \"Restraint\" is the Intervention. \"During a seizure\" is the Time period. \"Adult seizure patients\" is the Patient/population. \"Protecting them from injury\" is the Outcome. 7. d. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are developed from summaries of research results and reflect the best known state of practice at the time. Use of these guidelines leads to more positive outcomes of care and would be best to use in planning care or programs. 8. d , e, f. Only standardized terminologies describe and organize nursing practice that includes patient responses, nursing interventions, and patient outcomes. 9. d. The use of a standardized electronic health record for each person is being promoted primarily to provide all health care providers ready access to patient information to coordinate care and to prevent duplication of information and erratic delivery of care. 10. a, e. The nurse informaticist designs, b uilds, implements, evaluates, and maintains computer systems used for health care. The studies done by nurse informaticists develop ways to avoid errors. Nurses are trained by informaticists to use computer systems but not all nursing actions. All nurses use the accessing of information and communication aspects of technology. 11. a. 2; b . 3; c. 4; 3; h. 2; i. 5; j. 4 12. b, e, f. Collaborati ve problems are potential or actual complications of disease or treatment. As stated, fatigue, constipation, and excess fluid volume are not complications of disease or treatment. 13. Man y answers may be correct. Examples include the following: a. T urn the patient every 2 hours using the following schedule: L side back R side L side back. Inspect and document all at-risk areas for blanching and erythema at each position change. b. Pro vide 8 oz of fluids every 2 hours (even hours) while the patient is awake (the patient prefers cold liquids). Assist the patient in choosing five fresh fruits or vegetables from the menu each day. 14. d. The mistak e was made during assessment when the nurse did not ask why the patient had not taken her medication regularly and the appropriate etiology for the nursing diagnosis was not validated. 15. b, d, f, g, h. Right task, right circumstance, right person, right direction and communication, and right supervision and evaluation. 16. a, c, d, f, g. These actions or interv entions require judgment and clinical decision making; therefore they should be performed by an RN. 17. 3 A plan that directs an entire health care team 1 Used as guides for routine nursing care 1, 2 Used in nursing education to teach the nursing process and care planning 3 A description of patient care required at specif ic times during treatment 1 Should be personalized and specif ic to each patient 2 A visual diagram representing relationships between patient problems, interventions, and data 3 Used for high-v olume and highly predictable case types 18. c, e. Hands are to be w ashed with soap and water or gel before and after each patient. SBAR is suggested to improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers. Restraints are not suggested as part of the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG), although evaluating fall risk and taking action to reduce fall risk are included. All medications may not be administered if there is interaction between them. The physician would be notified before administering any questionable medications. The \"time-out\" is not for the nurse's fatigue but to ensure that the correct patient procedure and site are verified before surgical procedures. To prevent health care-related pressure ulcers, NPSG suggest assessing patients at risk initially on admission and on a regular basis throughout their care. To improve the accuracy of patient identification, it is suggested that two identifiers are used whenever a patient is identified, including for but not limited to medication administration. 19. a, c, d, e. Only re gulatory agencies are not quality of care measures, although they do affect patient safety, which is another quality of care measure that affects payment for care.318 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 2 Answer Key 1. b. The determinants of health are factors that influence the health of individuals and groups. Today the major determinant of health is behavior. Although the other factors could influence this patient's health, the smoking behavior is the most important causative factor in this situation. 2. a. Rural setting; b. Low income; c. Gender; d. Age 3. a, b, e, f. Health literacy is the patient's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate decisions. Age, language, and education may interfere with the patient's ability to read, comprehend, and analyze information to make health care decisions. Place may be associated with limited health literacy because rural populations tend to be older and have lower literacy rates. The accepted health behaviors are affected by the areas in which people grow up, work, and live. Gender, race, and ethnicity are not associated with health literacy. 4. a, b, c. Values, culture, and ethnicity provide the nurse with information to help plan care for the patient that ensures that cultural histories, experiences, and traditions are valued. Stereotyping, acculturation, and ethnocentricity all presuppose information about the individual because of his or her culture or ethnicity without assessing the individual. 5. d. Culture is dynamic and ever changing, may not be shared by all members of the same cultural group, is adapted to specific conditions such as environmental factors, and is learned through oral and written histories as well as socialization. 6. a. Cultural skill is the ability to complete a cultural assessment by collecting cultural data. 7. Examples may include any instances of the following and others: Cultural Factor Effect on Nursing Care Health Care Team Time orientation Patients may be late for appointments, skip appointments entirely, or delay seeing a health care provider because social events are more important to them.Health care providers may be late to work or in providing time-sensitive care. Economic factorsLack of health insurance, limited financial resources, or undocumented immigrant status may deter patients from using the health care system.The health care worker may not be able to afford new uniform items or transportation to work. Nutrition Ethnic foods may be high in sodium and fat or low in calcium and protein. If dietary changes required by health problems are not made within the context of the patient's normal diet, chances are high that the patient will not make the changes.Ethnic foods may not be available in the cafeteria, so the health care provider must bring food for meals. Personal space Personal space zones are a strong cultural trait. A patient may move closer to the nurse, causing a feeling of discomfort for the nurse, or if the nurse increases the personal space, the patient might be offended. Beliefs and practicesReligious beliefs or practices, faith in folk medicine, or negative experiences with culturally insensitive health care may delay or prevent patients from seeking health care. Health care workers may need to practice certain behaviors while at work (i.e., fasting during Ramadan, not caring for patients having abortions, not eating milk and meat together). 8. a. As a follower of Islam, pork or pork-derived products are prohibited (this is also true for strict followers of Judaism). Strict relationships between men and women are also characteristic of Islam. The Amish seldom purchase health insurance. Artificial contraception and abortion are prohibited in Catholicism. For Jehovah's Witness, the administration of blood or blood products is prohibited. 9. b. Traditional Native American rituals may include healing ceremonies used in addition to conventional therapy to promote a balance of physical, spiritual, and emotional wholeness believed to be necessary for wellness. These rituals may or may not be part of formal religious beliefs and may positively alter the progression of physical illnesses. 10. a. Empacho causes pain and cramping from food balls forming in the stomach or intestinal tract. Susto is a culture-bound syndrome also known as \"fright sickness.\" Ghost sickness for Native Americans causes nightmares, weakness and a sense of suffocation. Bilis brought on by strong anger causes headaches, stomach disturbances, and loss of consciousness. 11. b. In some cultural groups, especially Asian, Hispanic, and Native American, there is an emphasis on interdependence rather than independence. The nurse should be aware that in other cultures, decisions for the patient may be made by other family members or may be made collectively by the patient and his or her family. All of the other options reflect an insensitive assumption that the patient should make an autonomous decision. 12. c. In the Arabic culture, male and female roles are strictly observed. A woman should not be touched by a man other than her husband, nor should she be alone with another man. An Arabic woman would be very uncomfortable being cared for by a male nurse or would be put in the position of having to refuse the care. 13. b, d, e. From eTable 2-1. With antipsychotics use is more frequent and dose is higher. Tricyclic antidepressants show faster response but more side effects in African Americans. Antihypertensives are not responded to as well as they are by European Americans. There is no difference in the effect of analgesics or benzodiazepines.

Hispanics or Latino indi viduals may not return the nurse's direct gaze because of their respect for authority. 15. b, d 1 6. a, c. Using standardized e vidence-based care guidelines guides care based on the patient's outcomes. Using cultural competency guidelines guides the nurse in practice. Using a family member as the interpreter is not recommended because of the possibility of misunderstandings as well as potential privacy issues. Completing the health history rapidly may not allow patients from other cultures than the nurse to explain themselves well enough. Racial cultural differences cannot be assumed. The individual patient must be assessed to determine the differences to be included in the care. CHAPTER 3 Answer Key 1. 2. d. The focused assessment is used to e valuate the status of previously identified problems and monitor for signs of new problems. In this case, the chest must be assessed related to the shortness of breath, chest pain with breathing, increased respiratory rate, yellow sputum, increased temperature, and elevated white blood cell count. If the patient's headache and achiness are not reduced after the cough and temperature have been treated, further nursing and medical assessments will be done. 3. Examples: Man y answers could be correct. It is helpful to preface the question with the reason it is being asked. a. \"Man y patients taking drugs for hypertension have problems with sexual function. Have you experienced any problems?\" b. \" Alcohol may interact dangerously with drugs you receive or it may cause withdrawal problems in the hospital. Can you describe your recent alcohol intake?\" c. \"It is important to contact and treat others who might ha ve the same infection you do. Would you tell me with whom you have been sexually intimate in the last 6 weeks?\" d. \"T oday medications are so expensive that some people must choose between eating and taking their medications. Are you able to get and take all of the medications prescribed for you?\" 4. d. Data are required re garding the immediate problem but gathering additional information can be delayed. The patient should not receive pain medication before pertinent information related to allergies or the nature of the problem is obtained. Questions that require brief answers do not elicit adequate information for a health profile. 5. c. When a patient describes a feeling, the nurse should ask about the factors surrounding the situation to clarify the etiology of the problem. An incorrect nursing diagnosis may be made if the statement is taken literally and its meaning is not explored with the patient. A sense of \"being tired and unable to function\" does not necessarily indicate a need for rest or sleep and there is no way to know that treatment will relieve the problem. 6. There may be man y correct answers. Examples include the following:a. \"Can you tell me ho w you are feeling?\" b. \"Describe your relationship with your spouse. \" c. \"Can you describe your e xperience with this illness?\" d. \"What is your usual acti vity during the day?\" 7. c, d, e. Se verity, palliative, and radiation are not addressed. The timing, quality, and precipitating factors are described. 8. a. 1; b . 10; c. 10; d. 8; i. j. 12; q. 11; r. 2; s. 10; t. 13 9. d. Abnormal lung sounds are usually associated with chronic bronchitis and their absence is a negative finding. Chest pain is a positive finding and radiation is not expected for all chest pain. Elevated blood pressure in hypertension is a positive finding and pupils that are equal and react to light and accommodation are normal findings. 10. a. 2; b . 4; c. 3; d. 2; e. 1; f. 4; g. 1; h. 2 11. d. The usual sequence of ph ysical assessment techniques is inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. However, because palpation and percussion can alter bowel sounds, in abdominal assessment the sequence should be inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. 1 2. b . A nurse should use the same efficient sequence in each examination to avoid forgetting a procedure, a step in the sequence, or a body part. However, a specific method is not required. Patient safety, comfort, and privacy are considerations but are not the priorities. The nursing history data should be collected in an interview to avoid prolonging the examination. 1 3. b, c, e. Older adults may ha ve decreased vision and hearing so providing a quiet environment free from distractions will make the assessment easier than having the distraction of the TV . 14. b, c. These are situations in which an initial and thorough baseline assessment needs to be completed. Options a. and e. would require focused assessments; option d. would require an emergency assessment. 15. a, b, e. The w atch is used to assess pulses, the stethoscope is used to hear pulses and heart sounds, and the blood pressure cuff is used to assess blood pressure. The ophthalmoscope is used to assess the retina and the percussion hammer is used to assess reflexes. 1 6. c. Subjecti ve data or symptoms are obtained by interview during the nursing history. These data can be described only by the patient or caregiver. Objective data or signs are data that are obtained on physical examination. Comprehensive data are obtained from a detailed health history and physical examination of one or more body systems. 17. a, d, e. The general surv ey is considered a scanning procedure that includes mental state, behavior, speech, body movements, body features, obvious physical signs, and nutritional status. The physical examination includes auscultation and percussion of lung sounds and bowel tones, palpation of temperature and pulses, auscultation of pulses and heart sounds, and inspection of mobility. If there are obvious physical signs or abnormal sounds, a focused assessment will be done to assess the specific problems. CHAPTER 4 Answer Key 1. a. Maintenance of health. b . Management of illness. c. Appropriate selection and use of treatment options. d. Prevention of disease.Subjective Objective Short of breath, pain in chest upon breathing, coughing makes head hurt, aches all overRespiratory rate of 28 bpm, coughing yellow sputum, skin hot and moist, temperature 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C)320 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2. In your own words, the answer should be something like this: Use every opportunity (interaction [e.g., administering medications]) to assess patients for educational needs, to provide the teaching needed, and to reinforce the teaching that has already occurred. The time for patient teaching is limited and every opportunity needs to be used efficiently. 3. a, b, e. Learning is acquiring a skill or knowledge and may occur from experience rather than teaching. Planned teaching using a variety of methods may increase learning and teaching that is planned helps to make learning more efficient. Teaching may occur as an incidental experience without prior planning. One hopes that the learner's behavior will change as a result of teaching. However, it is the choice of the learner to either change behavior or not. 4. a. 1, 2; b. 1, 2, 4, 6; c. 2, 4; d. 5; e. 2, 6; f. 5; g. 3 5. c. This patient is in the precontemplation stage of behavior change; he is not considering a change, nor is he ready to learn. During this stage the best intervention by the nurse is to describe the benefits of change and the risks of not changing. The consequences of not changing should not be presented as threats but rather as a disadvantage of the current behavior. Describing what is involved in behavior change and setting priorities are recommended for later stages of change. 6. a. Example: A sudden episode (acute) in which the heart muscle (myocardium) is damaged from a lack of blood supply (infarction) b. Example: The intravenous (IV) injection of a dye to visually record (gram) the kidneys (pyelo) c. Example: Damage (pathy) to the retina (retino) of the eye as a complication of diabetes 7. b. An empathetic approach to teaching requires that the nurse provide positive feedback and try to understand the patient's world. The other options are important but are not directly related to empathy. 8. 9. c. Because the patient's father died of a myocardial infarction at a young age, the nurse needs to assess how his anxiety may affect his ability to learn about his treatment and follow-up care. There is no information about the learner characteristics or sociocultural characteristics, although these areas would also need to be assessed. 10. b. To promote self-efficacy it is important that the person is successful in new endeavors to strengthen the belief in his or her ability to manage a situation. To avoid early failure the nurse should work with the patient to present simple concepts related to knowledge and skills the person already has. Motivation and relevancy are important factors in adult learning but are more often a result of self-efficacy, not a method of promoting it. 11. 12. b. The nursing diagnosis should specify the exact nature of the knowledge deficit so that the objectives, strategies, implementation, and evaluation relate to the identified problem. The problem is deficient knowledge and a nursing diagnosis stating that the knowledge deficit is related to a lack of interest is in error. The statement \"risk for cardiac dysrhythmias\" is a collaborative problem rather than a nursing diagnosis. 13. Example: The patient will identify foods that are high in potassium from a given list of common foods by the time of discharge.Barrier Strategy Lack of time Set learning priorities with the patient and use every encounter. Let the patient know how much time you have for each session. Your feeling as a teacherPrepare ahead of time. Use available written materials. Respect the patient's response to the health problem. Patient circumstances Know your resources. Anticipate each contact with your patient and use it to teach throughout the day. Provide the patient with written materials and contact numbers if clarification is needed. Provide access to resources that the patient or caregiver may need.Patient Characteristic Teaching Intervention Impaired hearing Use supplementary illustrations and written materials. Provide audiotapes or audiovisual presentations with headphones that block environmental noise and promote auditory function. Patient refuses to see a need for a change in health behaviorsSupport the patient during this time and do not argue about the need for a change in health behaviors. Wait until the patient is ready to learn before beginning teaching. Drowsiness caused by use of sedativesEvaluate the medication schedule and change it, if possible, to increase alertness. If sedation is the objective of the medication, consider teaching family members or other caregivers. Presence of pain Provide only brief explanations and wait until the pain has been controlled to present more detailed instruction. Uncertain of reading ability Be sure that educational materials are written at fifth-grade or lower reading level. Use audiovisual materials with simple, layperson language. Visual learning styleProvide a variety of written educational materials. Refer the patient to appropriate Internet resources for information. Primary language is not EnglishUse translators and translation software programs. Obtain patient teaching materials in the patient's primary language. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 321 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 14. a, c, d. DVDs or videos and printed materials can be left with the patient, then discussed or \"taught back\" later to be sure that all goals are met. Role play and lecture-discussion may take more time than is available to meet the goals. 15. a, b. In role playing patients need to examine attitudes and behaviors that they may not be comfortable with if they are not mature enough. Demonstration is best used for teaching motor skills. Lecture-discussion is used in teaching basic information. Audiovisual strategies are easily combined with other teaching strategies. 16. c. If audiovisual and written materials do not help the patient to meet the learning goals, they are a waste of time and expense. The nurse should ensure that these materials are accurate and appropriate for each patient. Audiovisual materials are often supplementary materials that are used either before or after other presentation of information and do not need to include all of the information the patient needs to learn to be of value. Patients with auditory and visual limitations may find these materials useful because they can adjust the volume and size of the images. 17. a, e. When using the Internet as a teaching strategy, the nurse will assist the patient or caregiver in accessing trustworthy sites. The nurse personally cannot evaluate all sites that a patient or caregiver uses. The Internet is a valuable source of health information but it is also unregulated and much infor - mation is unreliable or inaccurate. As a result, both nurses and patients should learn to evaluate sources and identify accurate information. Reliable sources include universities, government health agencies, and reputable health care organizations. 18. 19. b. A statement that documents what the patient does as a result of teaching indicates whether the learning objective has been met and provides the best documentation of patient instruction. \"Understand\" is not a measurable behavior and does not validate that learning has occurred. 20. d, f. Baby boomers grew up sitting quietly in rows at school with the teacher lecturing or watching a movie and then discussing the information. They are used to learning with these methods although some individuals may be comfortable with the other methods as well. 21. a, b, c, d, e. Adult children who are caregivers have lost their parents as they knew them before the illness. Possible stressors in her life include changing roles within the family, lack of respite from caregiving responsibilities, conflict with her brother related to decisions about caregiving, financial depletion of resources as a result of her inability to work, and social isolation and loss of friends from an inability to have time for herself. 22. c. Adjusting to rather than opposing the patient's resistance as well as expressing empathy and reinforcing the positive outcome of attending therapy previously will encourage her to continue therapy. The other options are argumentative and confrontational, focus on the negative rather than the patient's strengths, and do not help the patient to recognize the \"gap\" between where she is and where she hopes to be. CHAPTER 5 Answer Key 1. b, c, e, f. The diabetes mellitus and residual right-sided weakness from the cerebrovascular accident (CV A) contribute to the residual disability and permanent impairments. The diabetes requires long-term management and both problems contribute to nonreversible pathologic changes. 2. Learning Goal Evaluation Technique The patient will demonstrate to the nurse the preparation and administration of a subcutaneous insulin injection to himself with correct technique before discharge.Direct observation Before discharge, the patient will identify five serious side effects of Coumadin that should be reported to the doctor.Ask a direct question or use a written measurement tool (ask the patient to write down the serious side effects that need to be reported to the doctor) The patient's wife will select the foods highest in potassium for each meal from the hospital menu with 80% accuracy.Direct observation with observation of verbal and nonverbal cues The patient will verbalize \"no shortness of breath\" when ambulating unassisted with the walker each of three times a day.Direct observation with observation of verbal and nonverbal cues The patient's caregiver will state that they are ready to change the patient's dressing today.Talk with a member of the patient's familyChronic Condition Task Diabetes mellitusPrevent and manage crisis, carry out prescribed regimens, adjust to changes in the course of the disease, control symptoms Visual impairmentPrevent social isolation, attempt to normalize interactions with others Heart disease Carry out prescribed regimens, control symptoms, prevent and manage a crisis Hearing impairmentPrevent social isolation, attempt to normalize interactions with others Alzheimer's diseasePrevent and manage crisis, reorder time, adjust to changes in the course of the disease, attempt to normalize interactions with others, control symptoms Arthritis Control symptoms, carry out prescribed regimens, reorder time, adjust to changes in the course of the disease, prevent social isolation Orthopedic impairmentReorder time, prevent and manage crisis, prevent social isolation322 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

The trajectory defines a life-threatening situation as a crisis. Increasing disability is described as downward. A gradual return to an acceptable way of life is a comeback. 6. a, b, d, e. Ageism is a negative attitude based on age. 7. There may be other correct responses but examples include the following: a. Decreased intestinal villae, decreased digestive enzyme production and secretion, decreased dentine and gingival retraction, decreased taste threshold for salt and sugar b. Decreased force of cardiac contraction, decreased cardiac muscle mass, increased fat and collagen c. Decreased skeletal muscle mass; decreased joint flexion; stiffening of tendons and ligaments; decreased cortical and trabecular bone; changes in eyes and ears that impair vision, hearing, and balance; slowed response/reaction time d. Decreased bladder smooth muscle and elastic tissue, decreased sphincter control e. Decreased ciliary action, decreased respiratory muscle strength, decreased elastic recoil, decreased cough force f. Decreased muscle and subcutaneous fat, collagen stiffening, decreased sebaceous gland activity, decreased sensory receptors, decreased tissue fluid, increased capillary fragility g. Decreased vessel elastin and smooth muscle, increased arterial rigidity h. Decreased blood flow to colon, decreased intestinal motility, decreased sensation to defecate, decreased muscle mass 8. d. Age-associated memory impairment is characterized by a memory lapse or benign forgetfulness that is not the same as a decline in cognitive functioning. Forgetting a name, date, or recent event is not serious but the other examples indicate abnormal functioning. 9. 10. d. Older adults with an ethnic identity often have disproportionately low incomes and might not be able to afford Medicare deductibles or medications to treat health problems. Although they often live in older urban neighborhoods with extended families, they are not isolated. Ethnic diets have adequate nutrition but health could be impaired if money is not available for food. 11. c. This statement indicates that this patient does not understand the importance of having the test every week and that the test results will determine ongoing dosing. The other three statements indicate that the patient is thinking about ways to get into town weekly. 12. Any three of the following are appropriate: unplanned weight loss ( 10 lb in the last year), weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness and low activity. 13. a. Psychologic abuse, psychologic neglect, physical neglect, and perhaps violation of personal rights b. Perform a very careful medical history and screening for mistreatment; interview the mother alone; use an assessment tool designed specifically for elder mistreatment; specifically assess for dehydration, malnutrition, pressure ulcers, and poor personal hygiene; evaluate explanations about physical findings that are not consistent with what is seen or contra-dictory statements made by the daughter and the mother c. Caregiver role strain d. Community caregiver support group, formal support system for respite care, adult day care 14. Possible factors that accelerate placement decisions are deteriorating cognition, incontinence, or a major health event. a. Rapid patient deterioration b. Caregiver exhaustion c. Alteration in or loss of family support system 15. c. During an initial contact with an older adult, the nurse should perform a comprehensive nursing assessment that includes a history using a functional health pattern format, physical assessment, assessment of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), mental status evaluation, and a social-environmental assessment. If available, a comprehensive interdisciplinary geriatric assessment may then be done to maintain and enhance the functional abilities of the older adult. The older adult and the caregiver should be interviewed separately and the older adult should identify his or her own needs. 16. a. The results of mental status evaluation often determine whether the patient is able to manage independent living, a major issue in older adulthood. Other elements of comprehensive assessment could determine eligibility for special problems, determination of frailty, and total service and placement needs. 17. c. Exercise for all older adults is important to prevent deconditioning and subsequent functional decline from many different causes. Walkers and canes may improve mobility but can also decrease mobility if they are too difficult for the patient to use. Nutrition is important for muscles but muscle strength is primarily dependent on use. Risk appraisals are usually performed for specific health problems. 18. Any of the following eight nursing interventions listed in Table 5-13: (1) Evaluate cognitive function and ensure ability to self-administer medication, (2) Attempt to reduce medication use that is not essential, (3) Screen all medication use, (4) Assess alcohol use, (5) Encourage the use of written or medication-reminder systems, (6) Encourage the use of one pharmacy, (7) Work with health care providers and pharmacists to establish routine drug profiles on all older adult patients, (8) Advocate with drug companies for low-income prescription support services. 19. a, b, c. These actions are alternatives to restraints that may help to reduce falls and keep the patient safe. A jacket vest and a seat belt are forms of restraint and require an order and frequent reassessment and order renewal. 20. a, b, c, d, e. Any of these actions will promote health. 21. b. Long-term acute care provides acute care for an average length of greater than 25 days. Acute rehabilitation is a post-acute level of care with therapies for returning the patient to the best level of functioning as possible. Intermediate care facilities provide convalescent care. Transitional subacute care facilities are used for 5 to 21 days.S Sadness (mood) C Cholesterol (high) A Albumin (low) L Loss (or gain of weight) E Eating problems S Shopping (and food preparation problems) ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 323 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

Mind-body medicine includes communication with the Creator or prayer, self-directed focusing or meditation, and learned control of physiologic body responses or biofeedback. The use of hands to realign energy flow or healing touch is part of the other CAM practices, in this case an energy therapy. The soft tissue manipulation or massage and spinal manipulation or chiropractic therapy are included in the category of manipulative and body-based methods. 3. d. Ayurveda from India is a whole medical system that views disease as an imbalance between the person's life force and basic metabolic condition. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and uses fine needles to manipulate energy channels. The principle of \"like cures like\" is used in homeopathy. Acupressure uses finger and hand pressure at energy meridians to improve energy flow. 4. c. The integrative health care model focuses on the mind- body-spirit connections with the individual responsible for care that uses natural, less invasive modalities and is less costly. The conventional health care model is directed by the health care provider and focuses on treatment of symptoms with medications and surgery. 5. d. CAM therapy practices vary by culture and time. CAM therapy incorporates the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual realms of the patient. The increase of CAM therapies is due in part to increased chronic disease and stress-related disorders. Research and education related to CAM therapies are supported by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 6. b. Complementary and alternative therapies are harmonious with the values of nursing, which include a view of humans as holistic beings, an emphasis on healing and partnership relationships with patients, and a focus on health promotion and illness prevention. 7. a. The basic concept of disease in Traditional Chinese Medicine is that the opposing phenomena of yin and yang are out of balance and this imbalance alters the movement of the vital energy of the body, known as Qi, that influences physiologic functions of the body. Acupoints are holes in the Qi meridians where the flow of Qi can be influenced but not released. Naturopathy is based on promotion of health rather than symptom management and focuses on enhancing the body's natural healing response using individualized interventions. Harmony with nature is necessary for health in Native American beliefs and spiritualism and mysticism are frequently a part of Hispanic health care. 8. b, d. Acupuncture is used to regulate the flow of Qi with the insertion of needles at acupoints, areas where needles may be inserted to unblock obstruction of energy and reestablish the flow of Qi. It can relieve nausea and vomiting postoperatively, with pregnancy, or related to chemotherapy. Counterirritation and inflammation are not consistent with the theory of Qi and although electrical stimulation may be applied to the needles in electroacupuncture, this procedure releases neuropeptides within the central nervous system. 9. b. If the nurse knows enough acupressure to suggest its use to a patient, it is appropriate to use with the patient's permission. The PRN medication for postoperative pain is not usually appropriate for a headache, nor would biofeedback training be appropriate for this situation. Simply reassuring the patient that the headache will go away is not helpful. 10. c. Massage therapy is one of the body-based methods commonly used by nurses for many different effects. As part of nursing care, nurses can use specific massage techniques that are not as comprehensive as those of massage therapists. It would be quite appropriate for the nurse to massage the patient's back. The other options are inappropriate at this time. 11. a. Journaling may be very helpful for this patient who has difficulty verbalizing her fears and concerns. Yoga is a helpful general stress management but is not specific to this problem. The nurse cannot prescribe herbal therapy or provide chiropractic care. 12. a. Because of a lack of governmental control for clinical testing of herbs or standardization of ingredient concentration or acceptable levels of contamination of pesticides, solvents, bacteria, and heavy metals, the safety and efficacy of herbal preparations are based on the manufacturer's standards. As such, the reputation and history of the manufacturer are the major criteria for purchasing herbs. Herbs indeed can be toxic and are contraindicated or should be used with caution in certain people. 13. b. To serve as a resource for patients regarding complementary and alternative therapies, nurses must first develop their own knowledge base. To teach patients about their use, monitor for adverse effects and interactions with conventional therapies, and assist patients to use the therapies knowledgeably and safely, nurses themselves must be informed. 14. a. Encourage the patient to seek the guidance of the physician regarding the safety and efficacy of using the herbal therapy rather than the medical therapy. See the answer to Question 15 for further clarification. 15. a, b, c, f. Professional nurses should be knowledgeable about the various complementary and alternative therapies, assess their use in patients, and promote their safety. Suggesting specific herbs is \"prescribing\" and is outside the scope of nursing. Advice against use of all herbs related to side effects is not appropriate. 16. b. Feverfew is used to prevent migraine headaches. Valerian is used for insomnia and anxiety. Echinacea and zinc are used to prevent and treat upper respiratory infections. Soy and black cohosh have been used for menopausal symptom relief. 17. b. Ginger may be used with monitoring to treat nausea and vomiting related to pregnancy. Aloe is an effective laxative and is also used for skin lesions. Cranberry juice is used to prevent urinary tract infections. Evening primrose is used for eczema and skin irritation. 18. a. Melatonin decreases the time needed to fall asleep. Depres - sion may be relieved by St. John's wort, although it may have many side effects. The dietary supplements red yeast rice and soy and the herb garlic may help to lower cholesterol. Saw palmetto has been used for benign prostatic hyperplasia but current research shows that it has little or no benefit. 19. a. Kava may be used to relieve anxiety but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning of severe liver damage, so patients with liver problems or those taking other medications that affect the liver must avoid kava. Ginseng is used to improve mental performance, enhance the immune system, and lower blood glucose in healthy adults. It may also affect blood pressure. Although not proven effective, milk thistle has been used for liver disease and does not 324 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. affect anxiety. Although not proven effective, ginkgo biloba has been used in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. CHAPTER 7 Answer Key 1. b. When individuals do not become stressed with a situation or an event, it is because the event is not perceived by them as a demand that is being made on them or as a threat to their well-being. Perceptions of stressors have great variability and, for whatever reasons, this patient does not perceive this diagnosis as stressful. 2. a. 1; b. 1; c. 3; d. 3; e. 1; f. 2 3. Resilience, hardiness, attitude, and optimism. Other factors that could have been selected are age, health status, personality characteristics, prior experience with stress, nutritional status, sleep status, and genetic background. These are all factors that are internal to the individual and may affect the response to stress. 4. See chart below.

Increased heart rate b. Increased blood pressure c. Cool, clammy skin d. Decreased bowel sounds e. Hyperglycemia f. Decreased lymphocytes g. Decreased eosinophils h. Decreased urinary output Subjective Findings a. Anxiety, fear b. Decreased perception of pain c. Verbalization of stress d. Wakefulness, restlessness 6. b. One of the many physiologic changes that occur as a result of prolonged, increased stress is immunosuppression, which may exacerbate or increase the risk of progression of immune-based diseases, including asthma. The other options are not valid explanations for the worsening asthma. 7. a. N; b. N; c. P; d. P; e. P 8. a, d, e. The other answers are problem-focused coping mechanisms. 9. a. Because it is almost impossible to maintain muscle tension while breathing slowly and deeply, relaxation breathing is a component of all relaxation therapies. Progressive muscle relaxation and meditation first require relaxed breathing and although soft music can decrease stress, it should be used with other therapies. 10. a. Peptic ulcer disease is one of several disorders with a known stress component. Although many patients have stress related to a health problem, stress-relieving interventions are always indicated for patients with diseases in which stress contributes to the problem. 11. a, c, e. Humor, journaling, and relaxation activities are realistic strategies that can be used during hospitalization by a patient with an acute episode of a chronic disease. Exercise or a cleansing diet would not be appropriate for an exacerbation of Crohn's disease. Case Study 1. Physiologic: Fever, pain, anemia, inflammatory disease itself Psychologic: No income, no insurance, duration and chronicity of the disease, frequent hospital admissions, lack of social support systems Effects: Prolonged healing of illness, progression of the inflammatory disease. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune system involvement can also occur. 2. Her refusal to seek support from boyfriend Her depression, weakness Her experience with the illness and hospitalizations Her lack of financial resources 3. Increased weight, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, strength Decreased body temperature, number of stools 4. One approach might be using a hospital stress-rating scale to clarify the patient's perception of the situation. The nurse and the patient might not rate the stressors as being the same in intensity. Specific questions may include the following: \"What is the most stressful thing to you about being in the hospital?\" \"Can you tell me what having this illness means to you?\" 5. Reduce additional stressors, such as sleep deprivation, environmental stimuli. Set short-term outcomes to achieve success. Provide pain relief, measures for comfort, rest. Provide stress-reducing interventions, such as relaxation and guided imagery. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective coping related to inadequate resources as manifested by crying, depression Stress overload related to excessive amounts of demands Ineffective role performance related to lack of employment Acute pain related to inflammatory process Risk for impaired skin integrity related to frequent stools and emaciation Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to nausea and frequent watery stools Risk for deficient fluid volume related to frequent watery stools and low-grade fever Collaborative problems: Potential complications: fluid-electrolyte imbalances, intestinal obstruction, fistula-fissure-abscess 7. Acute pain, a physiologic need that takes pri ority over other physiologic and psychosocial prob lems CHAPTER 8 Answer Key 1. c. Lack of sleep does not cause medical and psychiatric disorders, although people with these diagnoses may have fragmented sleep. Most adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep per day. In 2011, 87% of Americans reported sleep problems. 2. b, c, e, f. Manifestations of insomnia include difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, prolonged nighttime awakening or awakening too early and not being able to fall back to sleep, and feeling unrefreshed on awakening and having daytime sleepiness and difficulty concentrating. 3. d. Parasomnias are unusual and often undesirable behaviors that occur while falling asleep, transitioning between sleep stages, or arousing from sleep. Cataplexy is brief and sudden loss of skeletal muscle tone and is experienced with narcolepsy episodes. Hypopnea is shallow respirations and sleep apnea is the cessation of spontaneous respirations for longer than 10 seconds. 4. c. The nervous system controls the cyclic changes of wake and sleep through a complex arrangement of structures with key nuclei in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Melatonin is an endogenous hormone that increases sleep efficiency and is released in the evening. The light-dark cycles influence our circadian rhythms and neuropeptides influence wake behavior. These all play a role in the sleep/wake cycle and are components of the nervous system. 5. a. 4; b. 3; c. 2, 3; d. 3; 2; h. i. 2; j. 3326 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. Any three of these can contribute to insomnia: Consumption of stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, methamphetamine) close corticosteroids, psychostimulants, analgesics) Drinking alcohol or using over-the-counter medications as a sleep aid Long naps in the afternoon Sleeping in late Exercise near bedtime Jet lag Nightmares Stressful life event Medical conditions or psychiatric illnesses Irregular sleep/wake schedules Worry about getting enough sleep 7. a, b, e, f, g, h, i, k 8. b. Cognitive-behavioral therapies are effective therapies for insomnia and should be tried first. These include relaxation training, guided imagery, education about good sleep hygiene, and regular exercise several hours before bedtime. The other therapies are used to treat insomnia, with benzodiazepine- receptor-like agents being the first choice for drug therapy. Many patients will try over-the-counter medications such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) but tolerance develops rapidly. Complementary and alternative therapies such as melatonin have been found to be useful to help individuals to fall asleep but they are not first-line therapy. 9. b. It is not recommended that a person lie in bed awake. Alcohol should not be consumed within 6 hours of bedtime. The other statements represent strategies that may help the individual go to sleep. Exercise is good but not within 6 hours of bedtime; a light snack may help to relax the person. 10. b. Hot chocolate has 5 mg of caffeine. A Hershey's bar has 10 mg of caffeine, Dannon coffee yogurt has 45 mg of caffeine, and Ben & Jerry's nonfat coffee fudge frozen yogurt contains 85 mg of caffeine. 11. a. Reducing the light and noise levels in the ICU can help to promote opportunities for sleep. Having the TV on at all times will only add to the noise level. Analgesics given for actual pain may help a patient to sleep or rest but they may also alter sleep. The alarms should not be silenced except for short periods to address why they were alarming. Silencing alarms to prevent them from making noise puts the patient at risk because the nurse may not be alerted to patient changes on the monitor or problems with the infusion device. 12. a. Desipramine and protriptyline are both tricyclic antidepressants used to treat cataplexy and methylphenidate is an amphetamine. 13. Any of these responses would be appropriate: Start to get in harmony with the Moscow time zone several days before you travel. Be sure to expose yourself to daytime daylight, which will assist with synchronizing your body's clock to environmental time. Melatonin has been shown to be an effective sleep aid to help synchronize the body's rhythm. Resynchronization of the body's clock will occur at a rate of 1 hr/day if the patient travels eastward. 14. a. 4; b. 7; c. 6; d. 5; e. 2; f. 1; g. 8; h. 3. Obstructive sleep apnea has the risk factors listed. Airflow obstruction occurs because of narrowing of the air passages with relaxation of muscle tone during sleep or when the tongue and soft palate fall backward and partially or completely obstruct the pharynx. With apnea lasting 10 to 90 seconds, hypoxemia and hypercapnia occur. The startle response causes a brief arousal, so the tongue and soft palate move forward and the airway opens. This cycle occurs 200 to 400 times during 6 to 8 hours of sleep. 15. c. CPAP is continuous positive airway pressure and is the treatment of choice for more serious sleep apnea. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is the therapy that delivers a high inspiratory pressure and a low expiratory pressure to prevent airway collapse. CPAP is not well tolerated and compliance is low. Compliance may be improved by involving the patient in the selection of the device and mask, showing the CPAP before therapy begins, and teaching troubleshooting to reduce anxiety. An oral appliance is used to prevent airway occlusion from the relaxed mandible and tongue. 16. d. The most common complications in the immediate postoperative period are airway obstruction and hemorrhage. The patient may experience a sore throat, foul-smelling breath, and snoring during the recovery but they will resolve. Infection is a potential complication of any surgery but is not common with this procedure. Loss of voice and electrolyte imbalance generally are not complications of this procedure. 17. d. Assess the patient to determine what the problem is and then offer sleep hygiene instruction and collaborate with the physician to improve the patient's sleep behavior. Disturbed sleep is not a normal result of aging and people need about the same amount of sleep throughout their life span. Over- the-counter and prescription sleep aids need to be used very cautiously in older adults and patient response must be monitored closely. 18. Any three of these would be correct: Nurse is too sleepy to be fully awake at work Nurse is too alert to sleep soundly the next day Increased morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular problems Mood disorders are higher Fatigue could result in errors and accidents, as perceptual skills, judgment, and decision-making abilities may be diminished 19. a, b, c, d, e. All of these measures can be used to help a nurse who works rotating shifts to get adequate sleep. CHAPTER 9 Answer Key 1. c. Because the patient's self-report is the most valid means of pain assessment, patients who have decreased cognitive function, such as those who are comatose, have dementia, or are mentally disabled, might not be able to report pain. In these cases, nonverbal information and behaviors are necessary considerations in pain assessment. 2. c. Administering the smallest prescribed analgesic dose when given a choice is not consistent with current pain management guidelines and leads to undertreatment of pain and inadequate pain control. Without reassessing the ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 327 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. pain within 30 minutes of the IV analgesic the nurse is unsure how well the previous dose of medication worked for the patient to determine the current dose needed. Unnecessary suffering, impaired recovery from acute illness, increased morbidity as a result of respiratory dysfunction, increased heart rate and cardiac workload, and other physical dysfunction can occur. 3. a. Ph ysiologic\u2014the anatomic and physical determinants of pain b. Af fective\u2014the emotional response to pain c. Cogniti ve\u2014the beliefs, attitudes, and meanings attributed to pain d. Beha vioral\u2014observable actions that express or control pain e. Sociocultural\u2014age and gender , family and caregiver influence, and culture that influences the pain experience 4. a. Although a peripheral nerv e is one cell that carries an impulse directly from the periphery to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord with no synapses, transmission of the impulse can be interrupted by drugs known as membrane stabilizers or sodium-channel inhibitors, such as local anesthetics and some antiseizure drugs. The nerve fiber produces neurotransmitters only at synapses, not during transmission of the action potential. 5. a. The right neck and flank are common areas of referred pain from liver damage and examination of the liver should be considered when pain occurs without other findings in these areas. Other common referred areas are midscapular and left arm for cardiac pain, inner legs for bladder pain, and shoulders for gallbladder pain. 6. b . It is known that the brain is necessary for pain perception but because it is not clearly understood where in the brain pain is perceived, pain may be perceived even in a comatose patient who may not respond behaviorally to noxious stimuli. Any noxious stimulus should be treated as potentially painful. 7. a. 3; b . 4; c. 2; d. 1 8. a. 2, 7/9; b . 2, 7; c. 2, 6; d. 1, 3; e. 1, 5; f. 2, 8; g. 1, 4 9. c. Se veral antidepressants affect the modulatory systems by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in descending modulatory fibers, thereby increasing their availability to inhibit afferent transmission of pain impulses. Although chronic pain is often accompanied by anxiety and depression, the antidepressants that affect the physiologic process of pain modulation are used for pain control whether depression is present or not. 10. a. Damage to peripheral or cranial nerv es causes neuropathic pain that is not well controlled by opioid analgesics alone and often includes the adjuvant use of tricyclic antidepressants or antiseizure drugs to help inhibit pain transmission. Salicylates and NSAIDs are not effective for the intensity of neuropathic pain. 11. a. Onset: About 4 hours ago b. Duration and pattern of the pain: Continuously for about 4 hours. Similar episodes in the past month but lasted only 2 hours. c. Location: Right upper quadrant d. Intensity: Se vere, 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 e. Quality: Se vere cramping, radiates to back f. Associated symptoms: Nausea g. Management strate gies: Pain better walking bent forward, more intense lying in bed 12. a. F ollow the principles of pain assessment. b. Use a holistic approach to pain management. c. Ev ery patient deserves adequate pain management. d. Base treatment on the patient' s goals. e. Use both drug and nondrug therapies. f. When appropriate, use a multimodal approach to analgesic therapy. g. Address pain using an interdisciplinary approach. h. Ev aluate the effectiveness of all therapies to ensure that they are meeting the patient's goals. i. Pre vent or manage medication side effects. j. Incorporate patient and care giver teaching throughout assessment and teaching. 13. a. Analgesics should be scheduled around the clock for patients with constant pain to prevent pain from escalating and becoming difficult to relieve. If pain control is not adequate, the analgesic dose may be increased or an adjunctive drug may be added to the treatment plan. 14. a. As cancer pain increases, stronger drugs are added to the regimen. This patient is using a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and an antidepressant. A stronger preparation would be an opioid but because an NSAID is already being used, a combination NSAID/opioid is not indicated. An appropriate stronger drug would be an oral opioid, in this case oral oxycodone, and this still leaves stronger drugs for expected increasing pain. Propoxyphene is not recommended in analgesic guidelines because of its limited efficacy and toxicities. 15. c. Although tolerance to man y of the side effects of opioids (nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus) develops within days, tolerance to opioid-induced constipation does not occur. A bowel regimen that includes a gentle-stimulant laxative and a stool softener should be started at the beginning of opioid therapy and continue for as long as the drug is taken. 1 6. d. Use of a basal dose may increase the risk of serious respiratory events in opioid-naive patients and those at risk for respiratory difficulties (older age, existing pulmonary disease, etc.). Overdose is not expected, as the dosages are calculated and the PCA pump is programmed to prevent this. Nausea and itching are common side effects but not related to a basal dose of analgesic. A lack of pain control would not be expected with or without a basal dose. The nurse would be assessing the patient and notify the physician if a lack of pain control occurs but, again, this is not related to receiving a basal dose of analgesic via PCA pump. 17. b, d, e, f. Distraction is ef fective in the perception stage. Epidural opioids are effective in the transmission stage. 1 8. a, b, c, d, e, f. The major complications of epidural analgesia are catheter displacement and migration, accidental infusions of neurotoxic agents, and infection. These actions will help to reduce those risks. 19. b . When a patient wants to be stoic about pain, it is important that he or she understand that pain itself can have harmful physiologic effects and that failure to report pain and participate in its control can result in severe unrelieved pain. No evidence that indicates fear of taking the medication is present in this situation. 20. a. Duragesic is frequently used for chronic pain in patients who are not opiate-naive. Oramorph SR given buccally will have the same absorption as morphine, so it would not be expected to be more effective than oral morphine. 328 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Hydrocodone is used for acute and short-term pain, not chronic pain. Intranasal butorphanol (Stadol) is used for acute headaches and recurrent, not chronic pain. The route used will depend on the swallowing ability of the patient. Case Study 1. Assess the location, quality, and specific pattern of the pain. Also assess R.D.'s prior medication use, experience with opioids, and any addictions. 2. Affective: Worried about worsening of disease, afraid of opioids Behavioral: Posturing, slow gait, stays in bed with severe pain Cognitive: Uses emptying mind to block pain 3. The symptoms that R.D. has in the mornings are related to withdrawal because of physical dependence and the long interval during the night when the opioid is not used. An adjuvant drug should be added to his regimen and it and the Percocet should be taken around the clock. If the pain is not controlled with this measure, a stronger, sustained-release opioid such as MS Contin should be substituted for the Percocet. 4. Teach R.D. to evaluate the dose required to control his pain and the range and frequency of his dose. 5. Explain that tolerance and physical dependence are expected with long-term opiate use and should not be confused with addiction. Addiction is a psychologic condition characterized by a drive to obtain and compulsively take substances other than for their prescribed therapeutic value and despite risk of harm. 6. There are several physical techniques that could be used, depending on the location of R.D.'s pain, including dermal stimulation, such as massage and pressure. Additional cognitive-behavioral therapies, such as distraction or relaxation (imagery, meditation), could be taught. R.D. has a potential for using cognitive-behavioral therapies successfully because he can already mentally block the pain somewhat. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Chronic pain related to ineffective pain management Anxiety related to effects of disease process and inadequate relief from pain-relief measures Activity intolerance related to pain, fatigue Collaborative problems: Potential complications: drug-induced constipation, respiratory depression, negative nitrogen balance, opioid toxicity CHAPTER 10 Answer Key 1. a, c, d, f, g, i. Table 10-1 lists the goals of palliative care. Overall, goals of palliative care are to prevent and relieve suffering and to improve the quality of life for the patient. 2. a. The family may not understand what hospice care is and may need information. Some cultures and ethnic groups may underuse hospice care because of a lack of awareness of the services offered, a desire to continue with potentially curative therapies, and concerns about a lack of minority hospice workers. 3. a. Patient must desire services and agree in writing that only hospice care can be used to treat the terminal illness (palliative care) b. Patient must meet eligibility, which is less than 6 months to live, certified initially by two physicians 4. Respiratory a. Cheyne-Stokes respiration b. Death rattle (inability to cough and clear secretions) c. Increased, then slowing, respiratory rate (Also: irregular breathing, terminal gasping)Skin a. Mottling on hands, feet, and legs that progresses to the torso b. Cold, clammy skin c. Cyanosis on nose, nail beds, and knees (Also: waxlike skin when very near death)Gastrointestinal a. Slowing of the gastrointestinal tract with accumulation of gas and abdominal distention b. Loss of sphincter control with incontinence c. Bowel movement before imminent death or at time of death Musculoskeletal a. Loss of muscle tone with sagging jaw b. Difficulty speaking c. Difficulty swallowing (Also: loss of ability to move or maintain body position, loss of gag reflex) 5. b. Hearing is often the last sense to disappear with declining consciousness and conversations can distress patients even when they appear unresponsive. Conversation around unresponsive patients should never be other than that which one would maintain if the patients were alert. 6. a. Coma b. Absent brainstem reflexes c. Apnea 7. b. Bargaining is demonstrated by \"if-then\" grief behavior that is described by K\u00fcbler-Ross. K\u00fcbler-Ross's stage of depression is seen when the person says \"yes me, and I am sad.\" Prolonged grief disorder is seen when there is a dysfunctional reaction to loss and the individual is unable to move forward after the death of a loved one. In the Grief Wheel model, the new normal stage is when the grief is resolved but the normal state, because of the loss, is not the same as before. 8. a. Spiritual distress may surface when an individual is faced with a terminal illness and it is characterized by verbalization of inner conflicts about beliefs and questioning the meaning of one's own existence. Individuals in spiritual distress may be able to resolve the problem and die peacefully with effective grief work but referral to spiritual leaders should be the patient's choice. 9. a. Natural death acts in each state have their own requirements. Allow natural death is the new term being used for the Do Not Resuscitate order. Advance care planning is the process of having patients and their families think through their values and goals for treatment and document those wishes as advance directives. 10. b. Palliative care is aimed at symptom management rather than curative treatment for diseases that no longer respond to treatment and is focused on caring interventions rather than curative treatments. \"Palliative care\" and \"hospice\" are frequently used interchangeably. 11. d. There currently are no clinical practice guidelines to relieve the shortness of breath and air hunger that often occur at the end of life. The principle of beneficence would encourage any of the options to be tried, based on knowing that whatever gives the patient the most relief should be used. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 329 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 12. d. In assisting patients with dying, end-of-life care promotes the grieving process, which involves saying goodbye. Physical care is very important for physical comfort but assessment should be limited to essential data related to the patient's symptoms. Analgesics should be administered for pain but patients who are sedated cannot participate in the grieving process. 13. a, b, c, d, e, f. Teaching, along with support and encouragement, can decrease some of the anxiety. Teaching about pain relief, the dying process, and the care provided will help the patient and family know what to expect. Allowing the patient to make decisions will help to decrease feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness. The nurse who is the target of anger needs to not react to this anger on a personal level. 14. d. Using the open-ended statement to seek information related to the patient's and family's perspective and expectations will best guide the plan of care for this patient. This will open the discussion about palliative or hospice care and preferences for end-of-life care. Case Study 1. Additional assessment data should include S.J.'s and her husband's reasons for not discussing her illness and impending death with their children, an assessment of their spiritual needs, what decisions (if any) they have made about where and how S.J. prefers to die, and what resources they have used or could use to assist them through the dying process. In addition, assessment and evaluation of their coping skills are necessary. A functional assessment of S.J.'s activities of daily living (ADLs) should also be made. 2. Maladaptive or dysfunctional grief is demonstrated in this family. S.J. appears to have some degree of acceptance of her impending death but feels rejected by her children. The children may be experiencing fear, guilt, anger, powerlessness, and other emotions that they cope with by withdrawing from the family. S.J.'s husband is also feeling guilt about wishing that the ordeal would be over. Healthy grieving is blocked in this family because communication has not occurred. 3. Pain patterns should be assessed and dosages and frequencies of medication increased to provide pain relief that is acceptable to S.J. without unnecessary sedation. Complementary and alternative therapies to enhance the effect of pain medication should be instituted. As opioids are increased, constipation and abdominal distention could become a problem and stool softeners may be needed. Although S.J. is underweight, patients tend to take in less food and fluid as death approaches and maintaining food and fluid intake is not a high priority. Because S.J. spends most of her time in bed and is very thin, measures to prevent skin breakdown are essential. Oxygen therapy should be considered as a measure to relieve her shortness of breath. 4. Arrange for family meetings to discuss S.J.'s condition and her feelings and those of the family. The hospice nurse or a grief counselor can help all members of the family to express and acknowledge their feelings of anger, fear, or guilt. S.J. and the family need to know that the grief reaction is normal and they should be taught what to expect and how each individual's needs can be met as S.J.'s death approaches. 5. A multidisciplinary team of nurses, health care providers, pharmacists, dietitians, nursing assistants, social workers, clergy, and volunteers is available to this family to provide care and support to the patient and family through hospice care. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Compromised family coping related to inadequate coping mechanisms Dysfunctional grieving related to blocked communication and guilt Chronic pain related to ineffective pain management Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility and emaciation Risk for constipation related to decreased oral intake and effects of drugs Ineffective breathing pattern related to weakness Impaired physical mobility related to pain CHAPTER 11 Answer Key 1. d. Substance abuse negatively affects psychologic, physiologic, and/or social functioning of an individual. The compulsive need for pleasure is psychologic dependence. Behavior to maintain addiction is addictive behavior. Absence of a substance causing withdrawal symptoms is physical dependence. 2. b. Tolerance is described. Relapse is when the person returns to substance use after a period of abstinence. Abstinence is avoidance of substance use. Withdrawal is the response that occurs after abrupt cessation of a substance. 3. a. Ask; b. Advise; c. Assess; d. Assist; e. Arrange 4. d. Nurses have a professional responsibility to help individuals stop smoking. The advice and motivation of health care professionals can be very helpful to the individual. Nurses should encourage and provide information to patients and work with physicians to identify ways to assist patients with quitting. 5. Nicotine a. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) b. Cancers: lung, mouth, larynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, pancreas Others: coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (see Table 11-2)Alcohol a. Dementia b. Cirrhosis Others: peripheral neuropathy, increased risk for several cancers, anemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, GERD (see Table 11-7)Cocaine and amphetamines a. Cardiac dysrhythmias b. Psychosis Others: nasal sores, myocardial infarction (MI), Table 11-2)Opioids a. Gastric ulcer b. Glomerulonephritis Other: sexual dysfunction (see Table 11-2)Cannabis a. Bronchitis, chronic sinusitis b. Memory impairment Other: impaired immune system, reproductive dysfunction (see Table 11-2) 6. b, c, f. Cocaine and amphetamines cause nasal damage when snorted, sexual arousal, and tachycardia and 330 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. hypertension. Drowsiness and constricted pupils are seen with sedative-hypnotics and opioids. There is anorexia with cocaine, not increased appetite. 7. a. Opioids produce these physiologic responses. Although alcohol intake can cause euphoria, drowsiness, and slurred speech, the abuser of alcohol develops tolerance and does not usually have these manifestations. Effects of chronic alcohol abuse include impairment of all body systems (see Table 11-7). Cannabis produces euphoria, sedation, and hallucinations. Depressants may cause slurred speech and drowsiness but not euphoria or decreased respirations unless there is an overdose. 8. a. Seizures may be experienced with phenobarbital or a long-acting benzodiazepine. Tremors, chills, sweating, nausea, and cramps are seen with opioid withdrawal. Hallucinogens are least likely to have withdrawal symptoms. Suicidal thoughts and violence are more likely to occur in patients withdrawing from stimulants. 9. d. Nicotine replacement contains the same nicotine as that in tobacco but with slower absorption. The nicotine will help to prevent withdrawal symptoms because its use is reduced gradually. While the addiction is treated, the carcinogens and gases associated with tobacco smoke are eliminated. 10. a. 2; b. 3; c. 4; d. 1; e. 3; f. 4; g. 3 11. a. Headache is a common symptom of caffeine withdrawal and often occurs in heavy caffeine users who are NPO for diagnostic tests and surgery. 12. b, c, f. Seizures, gross tremors, visual and auditory hallucinations, and alcohol withdrawal delirium are the four major withdrawal syndrome manifestations. Apathy and depression occur in withdrawal from stimulants. Cardiovascular collapse is seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. 13. c. Open-ended questions indicating that substance use is normal or at least understandable are helpful in eliciting information from patients who are reluctant to disclose substance use. 14. b. Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death and most smokers start smoking by age 16. If smoking in preadolescents and adolescents could be prevented, it is unlikely that these individuals would start smoking at a later age. Health problems associated with smoking and future use of other addictive substances would be significantly reduced. 15. a. Naloxone (Narcan) is given when opioids are the cause of central nervous system (CNS) depression. b. Flumazenil (Romazicon) is given when benzodiazepines are the cause of CNS depression. 16. a. The knowledge of when the patient last had alcohol intake will help the nurse to anticipate the onset of withdrawal symptoms. In patients with alcohol tolerance, the amount of alcohol and the blood alcohol concentration do not reflect impairment as consistently as in the nondrinker. The type of alcohol ingested is not important because in the body it is all alcohol. 17. c. An extreme autonomic nervous system response may be life threatening and requires immediate intervention. A quiet room is recommended but it should be well lighted to prevent misinterpretation of the environment and visual hallucinations. Cessation of alcohol intake causes low blood alcohol levels leading to withdrawal symptoms and fluids should be administered carefully to prevent dysrhythmias. Patients should not be restrained if at all possible because injury and exhaustion can occur as patients struggle against restraint. 18. d. Alcohol-induced central nervous system (CNS) depression can lead to respiratory and circulatory failure in an alcoholic patient. Vital signs are monitored closely because of the increased risk of infection from malnutrition. Emergency magnesium would not be expected, although an emergency dose of thiamine may have been given before surgery. Pain medication requirements may be increased if the patient is cross-tolerant to opiates. 19. a. Because Wernicke's encephalopathy resulting from a thiamine deficiency is a possibility with chronic alcoholism, IV thiamine is often administered to intoxicated patients to prevent the development of Korsakoff's psychosis. Thiamine should be given before any glucose solutions are administered because glucose can precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. Benzodiazepines may be used for sedation and to minimize withdrawal symptoms but would not be given before thiamine, and haloperidol could be used if hallucinations occur. 20. d. The \"five Rs\" are used for individuals who are unwilling to quit tobacco use. The \"five As\" are used for individuals who want to quit tobacco use. Although cost, cough, cleanliness, and the use of Chantix as well as deduce, describe, decide, and deadline may be ways to assist this patient, these are not recommendations or clinical practice guidelines. 21. d. Older adult patients have the highest use of OTC and prescription drugs, and simultaneous use of these drugs with alcohol is a major problem. Illegal drug use is minimal in older patients except in long-term addicts. Case Study 1. Because there is a tendency among substance abusers to take a variety of drugs simultaneously or in a sequence to obtain specific effects, as shown by this patient's history, he should be assessed for his pattern of abuse. Regular alcohol use in addition to other drug use or the common use of cocaine in combination with heroin or phencyclidine hydrochloride could cause withdrawal symptoms and additional manifestations that would complicate his condition and direct his care. Information about all of the drugs he uses, including both over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs, is necessary to avoid withdrawal syndromes, acute intoxication, overdose, or drug interactions that might be life threatening. 2. The nurse should be aware that common behaviors that are likely to influence history taking from this patient include manipulation, denial, avoidance, underreporting or minimizing substance abuse, giving inaccurate information, and inaccurate self-reporting. To obtain reliable information about his drug abuse patterns, the nurse should first explain that information about his drug use is essential in the monitoring for and prevention of serious effects of the drugs while he already is very ill. Providing a need for the information and explaining how the information will be used may facilitate more honest responses by the patient. The nurse should question him without judgment about his pattern of abuse with open-ended questions such as \"How much or how often do you use alcohol?\" or \"Can you describe how you use cocaine with other drugs?\" ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 331 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 3. Ph ysical effects of drug use that provide clues to drug abuse include collapsed and scarred veins used to inject drugs, nasal septum and mucosa damage, brown or black sputum production, and wound abscesses and cellulitis. 4. Continuous monitoring of this patient' s vital signs, cardiac activity, level of consciousness, respiratory status, temperature, fluid and electrolyte balance, liver function, and renal function is necessary. Complications of cocaine toxicity that may occur and can be detected by monitoring include myocardial ischemia or infarction, heart failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, stroke, respiratory distress or arrest, seizures, agitated delirium and hallucinations, electrolyte imbalances, and fever. In severe intoxication the patient may progress rapidly through stages of stimulation and depression, which may result in death. His use of cocaine with alcohol also increases his risk of liver injury and sudden death. 5. Assessment for neurologic, cardio vascular, and respiratory problems as described above is a critical nursing intervention in the patient with cocaine toxicity. In addition, the nurse should institute seizure precautions, provide airway management, keep open IV lines, administer medications aggressively as prescribed, and use cardiac life-support measures as indicated. Nursing interventions that are indicated for his anxiety, nervousness, and irritability include explaining procedures using short, simple, clear statements in a calm manner; providing a safe, secure environment; decreasing environmental stimuli; reinforcing reality orientation; and encouraging participation in relaxation exercises if possible. 6. Eng aging an individual who is addicted to cocaine in treatment is difficult because of the intense craving for the drug and a strong denial that cocaine is addicting or that the individual cannot control it. Motivational interviewing is indicated in even this initial encounter with this patient. The nurse should help him to increase his awareness of risks and problems related to his current behavior and create doubt about the use of substances. Asking him what he thinks could happen if the behavior continues, pointing out the physical symptoms he is experiencing, and offering factual information about the risks of substance abuse are indicated. Often the only motivation for a patient with a cocaine addiction to enter a treatment program is family threats, loss of job or professional license, legal action, or major health consequences. A treatment program is indicated to provide him with new skills and an ability to deal with his addictive behavior. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Inef fective health maintenance ve problems: Potential complications: cardiopulmonary arrest, seizures, sudden death, cerebrovascular accident, acute renal failure CHAPTER 12 Answer Key 1. Clinical Manifestation Chemical Mediators Physiologic Change Fever Interleukin-1 (IL-1) to tissues Leukocytosis Release of chemotactic factors at site of injuryIncreased release of neutrophils and monocytes from bone marrow 2. d. A shift to the left is the term used to describe the presence of immature, banded neutrophils in the blood in response to an increased demand for neutrophils during tissue injury. Monocytes are increased in leukocytosis but are mature cells. 3. c. Chemotaxis in volves the release of chemicals at the site of tissue injury that attract neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury. The attraction is chemotaxis and when monocytes move from the blood into tissue, they are transformed into macrophages. The complement system is a pathway of chemical processes that results in cellular lysis, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability causing the slowing of blood flow at the area. 4. d. The processes that are stimulated by the acti vation of the complement system include enhanced phagocytosis, permeability, chemotaxis, and cellular lysis. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are released by damaged cells and body temperature is increased by the action of prostaglandins and interleukins. All chemical mediators of inflammation increase the inflammatory response and, as a result, increase pain. 5 . c. The nurse will encourage Rest to pre vent further injury. Ice or cold compresses will be applied to decrease swelling with vasoconstriction. Compression will help to reduce edema and stop bleeding if it is occurring. Elevation will help to decrease edema and pain. The other options are not correct.332 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. b. The injurious agent of chronic inflammation persists or repeatedly injures tissue. It lasts for weeks, months, or years. Infective endocarditis is a subacute inflammation that lasts for weeks or months. Neutrophils are the predominant cell type in acute inflammation. Lymphocytes and macrophages are the predominant cell types at chronic inflammation sites. 7. a. Labile cells of the skin, lymphoid organs, bone marrow, and mucous membranes divide constantly and regenerate rapidly following injury. Stable cells, such as those in bone, liver, pancreas, and kidney, regenerate only if they are injured and permanent cells found in neurons and cardiac muscle are not expected to regenerate when damaged. 8. a. 1; b. 10; c. 2; d. 4; g. 7; h. 9; i. 3; j. 5 9. c. The process of healing by secondary intention is essentially the same as primary healing. With the greater defect and gaping wound edges of an open wound, healing and granulation take place from the edges inward and from the bottom of the wound up, resulting in more granulation tissue and a much larger scar. In primary healing the edges of the wound may be sutured. Tertiary healing involves delayed suturing of two layers of granulation tissue together and may require debridement of necrotic tissue. 10. b. Adhesion is a band of scar tissue that forms between organs. It may occur in the abdominal cavity and cause intestinal obstruction. Infection could be seen with undernutrition or necrotic tissue but would not cause these symptoms. Contractures shorten the muscle or scar tissue but would not contribute to abdominal symptoms. Evisceration of an abdominal wound would occur sooner after surgery when the wound edges separate and the intestines protrude through the wound. 11. d. A fistula is an abnormal passage between organs or between a hollow organ and skin that will leak fluid or pus until it is healed. In this situation there may be a fistula between the vagina and rectum. The student nurse did not describe dehiscence, hemorrhage, or keloid scar formation. 12. c. Vitamin C aids healing with capillary synthesis and collagen production by fibroblasts. Fats provide synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides used for cellular membranes. Protein corrects negative nitrogen balance from increased metabolism and contributes synthesis of immune factors, blood cells, fibroblasts, and collagen. Vitamin A aids in epithelialization, increasing collagen synthesis and tensile strength of the healing wound. 13. d. The B-complex vitamins are necessary coenzymes for many metabolic reactions, including protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Carbohydrates provide metabolic energy for inflammation and are protein sparing. Fluid is needed to replace that used in exudates as well as the extra fluid used for the increased metabolic rate required for healing. 14. d. A yellow wound would have creamy ivory to yellow- green exudate with soft necrotic tissue. A red wound will be a clean pink wound, possibly with serosanguineous drainage. A black wound would have adherent gray necrotic tissue. 15. b. A yellow wound would be treated with absorptive dressings. A red wound would be treated with a hydrocolloid dressing or a telfa dressing with antibiotic ointment to keep the wound moist and encourage granulation. A dry, sterile dressing would be used for a closed wound. A black wound would be treated with autolytic debridement or negative pressure wound therapy. 16. c. For the negative pressure therapy to work, a vacuum is created between the device and the wound so that the excess fluid, bacteria, and debris are removed from the wound. The wound is cleaned weekly or when the dressing is replaced. A hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber is not used with a wound vac device. Nutrition must be maintained, as protein and electrolytes may be removed from the wound. 17. d. Hand washing is the most important factor in preventing infection transmission and is recommended before and after the use of gloves by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all types of isolation precautions in health care facilities. 18. c. The immobility, mental deterioration, and possible neurologic disorder of the comatose patient present the greatest risk for tissue damage related to pressure. His Braden score is 9, which puts him at very high risk. Although obesity, hyperglycemia, advanced age, mental deterioration, malnutrition, and incontinence contribute to development of pressure ulcers, the risk is not as high with any of the other patients. 19. c. Relief of pressure on tissues is critical to prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Although pressure-reduction devices may relieve some pressure and lift sheets and trapeze bars prevent skin shear, they are no substitute for frequent repositioning of the patient. Massage is contraindicated if there is the presence of acute inflammation or possibly damaged blood vessels or fragile skin. 20. d. Stage IV pressure ulcers are full-thickness tissue loss with muscle, tendon, or bone exposed. Stage I pressure ulcers are intact skin with nonblanchable localized redness. Stage II pressure ulcers have a shallow open area with a red-pink wound bed. Stage III pressure ulcers exhibit full-thickness tissue loss without bone, tendon, or muscle exposure with possible tunneling into the tissue. 21. c. Stage III is full-thickness tissue loss; subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon, and muscle are not exposed. Option a. describes a Stage IV pressure ulcer, option b. describes a Stage II pressure ulcer, and option d. describes a Stage I pressure ulcer. 22. d, e. Measuring the size of the wound and repositioning do not require judgment, patient teaching, or evaluation of care. The other interventions listed relate to assessment, judgment, and teaching, all of which are responsibilities of the RN. However, the LPN can reinforce teaching by the RN. Case Study 1. Pain, redness of leg, edema of leg, fever, elevated WBC 2. Purulent, which means that this is a yellow wound. 3. This is likely to be a venous ulcer because it is located medially above the ankle, is shallow with an irregular shape, is extremely painful, is infected, and is accompanied by edema. Venous ulcers occur distally because circulation may be compromised, as commonly seen in diabetic patients. (See eTable 12-1.) 4. The WBC count is increased, indicating a pronounced leukocytosis that would be seen in acute inflammation. Neutrophils are normally 50% to 70% of the WBCs and hers are increased to 80%, indicating an early response of neutrophils to tissue damage. She also has a \"shift to the left\" in that she has 12% bands. (Normally only 0% to ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 333 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8% of the neutrophils in the blood are immature, banded- nucleus.) All of these findings are consistent with an acute inflammatory process. 5. History of diabetes, with possible circulatory impairment to lower extremities and altered blood glucose levels; increased weight; inadequate nutrients (e.g., vitamin C, protein, carbohydrates, zinc) for healing possible because of confinement to bed; has no one to help with meals; and the presence of infection in the wound 6. Acetaminophen acts on the heat-re gulating center in the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation and heat loss. Mild to moderate fevers (up to 103\u00b0F [39.4\u00b0 C]) are not usually harmful and may benefit defense mechanisms. Antipyretics are often prescribed only to control higher temperatures. To prevent acute swings in temperature and cycles of chilling and perspiring, antipyretics should be given regularly at 2- to 4-hour intervals as ordered. 7. The w ound should be kept moist with frequent cleansing with high-quality tap water to remove nonviable tissue. Moist gauze, hydrocolloids, alginates, and/or hydrogel dressings will keep the wound moist and help with debridement, which would be the best choice in this infected wound. 8.

Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to inflammation of left leg Impaired skin inte grity related to wound above left ankle Hyperthermia related to inflammatory process and infection Risk for def icient fluid volume related to an increased metabolic rate Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to decreased intake of essential nutrients and diabetes mellitus Impaired ph ysical mobility related to pain of left leg Collaborative problems: Potential complications: septicemia, h yperglycemia CHAPTER 13 Answer Key 1. c. The phenotype is the observ able characteristics of the individual. An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of a gene on a particular locus. Genomics is the study of all of a person's genes (the genome), including interactions of these genes with each other and the person's environment. Chromosomes are compact structures containing DNA and proteins that are present in nearly all cells of the body. 2. c. Genotype is the genetic identity of an indi vidual without outward characteristics. A gene is the basic unit of heredity at a specific locus on a chromosome. Transmission of a disease from parent to child is termed hereditary. The pedigree is the family tree that contains the genetic characteristics and disorders of that particular family. 3. c, e. The age of disease diagnosis as well as the age and cause of death of three generations of the biological relatives will be most helpful for making lifestyle changes, if necessary, and family planning. Cholecystitis, prostate cancer, and kidney stones are not known to be genetically linked. 4. a. An error during meiosis causes an abnormal number of chromosomes. In Down syndrome there are three copies of chromosome 21. There can also be a copy of a chromosome missing. Translocation occurs when genetic material is exchanged between two chromosomes in a cell, such as in chronic myelocytic leukemia. 5. FatherMotherHh HHH Normal Hh Affected HHH Normal Hh Affected a. 50% b. 50% 6 . a, b, e. Genetic testing may raise psychologic and emotional issues if someone is identified with a positive result or as a carrier of a disease. A woman with a positive BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic test may have a bilateral mastectomy to prevent breast cancer. Privacy issues also arise with genetic testing. Genetic testing can be used to provide the risk of a genetic condition only if both parents are tested. Newborn screening for phenylketonuria is done in all states. It may also be completed for congenital hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis. 7. 25%. the pedigree will show 25% having the disease, 25% not having the disease, and 50% being carriers whether the offspring are male or female. 8. a. When both parents are tested, genetic testing can pro vide information about the couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition by identifying changes in the genes tested. Not all diseases are genetically identified or familial disorders. Genetic testing kits are available but a genetic counselor will help them to understand the purpose of the testing, the pros and cons of having testing, and the emotional and medical impact of the test results. 9. a. Because Huntington' s disease is an autosomal dominant disease and her father has it, she has a 50% chance of getting it. A positive result of genetic testing will mean that she will get the disease. There are no carriers of Huntington's disease and changing her lifestyle will not affect the disease diagnosis. 10. d. Multif actorial conditions are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In diabetes, several genes have been identified that increase the likelihood of getting diabetes. Single gene disorders result from a single gene mutation, for example, sickle cell disease. Chromosome disorders are caused by structural changes within chromosomes or an excess or deficiency of the genes in that locus. People are born with these disorders. Acquired genetic disorders occur when there is an error in replication or damage to DNA from toxins at some time in the person's life. 11. a. T rastuzumab is effective only for women whose breast cancer tumors have genes that overproduce the protein HER2. Testing for BRCA genes is used to identify women at risk for developing breast cancer. The stage of cancer is not relevant to whether this drug should be used. 334 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 12. a. Pharmacogenetic testing can assist the health care provider in prescribing the appropriate dosage of warfarin. Giving bivalirudin IV would be done only in the hospital. Clopidogrel and aspirin will not give the level of anticoagulant effect that warfarin does, as they are only platelet inhibitors and do not block clotting factors. Enoxoparin injections can be given at home but the patient is less likely to continue the therapy because of the injections and the added expense of the medication. 13. b. Yearly colonoscopies are done to monitor the polyp growth and remove polyps. A colectomy may be considered to prevent cancer. Changing the diet will not affect the growth of polyps that develop in the colon and potentially become cancerous. Gene therapy is still considered experimental therapy. If he has children, they will need to have genetic testing. 14. b. Because gene therapy is risky, it is currently studied only in research settings with diseases that have no cure. Gene therapy may inactivate or \"knock out\" a mutated malfunctioning gene. A new gene inserted into the body usually does not function without using a carrier molecule called a vector to deliver it to the target cells. It will replace a mutated gene with a healthy copy of a gene. 15. b. The hematopoietic stem cells are adult stem cells. The red blood cells are returned to the donor so that he or she does not become anemic. Although bone marrow aspirations and transplants may be done for recipients, stem cells are now usually obtained from the blood via large-bore intravenous needles. Case Study 1. The nurse will provide accurate information pertaining to genetics and the genetic disease. This information should be tailored to the patient based on culture, religion, knowledge level, literacy, and preferred language. The nurse will identify and assess inheritance patterns and explain them to the patient and family through the use of family pedigrees (see Fig. 13-4 and Fig. 13-5) and the Punnett square (see Fig. 13-9). Maintain the patient's confidentiality and respect the patient's values and beliefs because genetic information may have major health and social implications. The nurse will also be an advocate for the patient and her family by facilitating access to genetics resources, such as a genetic clinical nurse or genetic counselor. 2. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (MD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder. 3. D.L. will not develop MD, as it is present at birth but usually does not become clinically apparent until age 3. Few individuals with MD live into adulthood. She is too old to develop MD now. 4. Because MD is X-linked recessive genetic disorder, if she carries the gene, each son will have a 50% chance of having the disease and each daughter will have a 50% chance of being a carrier of the gene. 5. This is an ethical concern. As with all medical information, this information should not be misused and the nurse should protect the privacy of the patient. The nurse should tell her about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects her from discrimination by employers and health insurance companies.CHAPTER 14 Answer Key 1. c. Innate immunity is present at birth and its primary role is first-line defense against pathogens. Innate immunity is not antigen specific so it can respond within minutes to an invading microorganism without prior exposure to that organism. 2. a, c, d. Passive acquired immunity is received from the injection of gamma globulin, provides immediate immunity, and may last for several weeks or months. Immunization with an antigen and the need for boosters contribute to active acquired immunity. Maternal immunoglobulins in the neonate provide temporary passive innate immunity. 3. a. Both B and T lymphocytes must be sensitized by a processed antigen to activate the immune response. Processing involves the taking up of an antigen by macrophages, expression of the antigen on the macrophage cell membrane, and presentation to the lymphocytes. Antigens do not need to be proteins and a few antigens may combine with larger molecules that are antigenic. 4. d. T cytotoxic cells directly attack antigens on the cell membrane of foreign pathogens and release cytolytic substances that destroy pathogens. Dendritic cells primarily capture antigens at sites of contact with the external environment and then transport the antigen to a T cell with specificity for the antigen. Natural killer cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity but are not considered T lymphocytes. CD4 cells (T helper cells) are involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and humoral antibody response. 5. c. Interferon produces an antiviral effect in cells by reacting with viruses and inducing the formation of an antiviral protein that prevents new viruses from becoming assembled. Most cytokines are immunomodulatory and do not directly affect antigens, and cytokines such as interleukins may stimulate activation of immune cells. 6. b. Production of immunoglobulins (or antibodies) by B lymphocytes differentiated into plasma cells is the essential component in humoral immunity. Tumor surveillance and the production of cytokines are functions of T lymphocytes in cellular immunity and B lymphocytes do not directly attack antigens. 7. b. B lymphocytes activated in the bone marrow by the presentation of an antigen differentiate into many plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulins and only a few memory cells that retain recognition of the antigen as foreign. Helper cells are T lymphocytes and natural killer cells are large, granular lymphocytes that are neither B nor T lymphocytes. The spleen filters foreign substances from the blood. The thymus differentiates T lymphocytes. The bursa of Fabricius is found in birds, not humans. 8. d. IgM immunoglobulin is predominant in the primary immune response and produces antibodies against ABO blood antigens. 9. a, d. IgA is passed to the neonate in the colostrum and IgG crosses the placenta for fetal protection. 10. a, b. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) assists in parasitic infections and causes allergic reactions. IgA protects body surfaces and mucous membranes. IgD assists in B-lymphocyte differentiation and is present on the lymphocyte surface. IgG is predominant in the secondary immune response. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 335 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1 1. a, c, d. Functions of cell-mediated immunity include fung al infections, rejection of foreign tissue, contact hypersensitivity reactions, immunity against pathogens that survive inside cells, and destruction of cancer cells and tuberculosis. Transfusion reactions are from humoral immunity. 12. d. Aging has a pronounced ef fect on the thymus, which decreases in size and activity, leading to a decline in T cells and cell-mediated immunity. T-cell reduction is responsible for decreased tumor surveillance, resulting in an increase in cancer. B-cell activity also declines with advancing age but the bone marrow is relatively unaffected by increasing age. Circulating autoantibodies increase and are a factor in autoimmune diseases. 13. c. When sensitized T lymphoc ytes attack antigens or release cytokines that attract macrophages and cause tissue damage, a type IV or delayed hypersensitivity reaction is occurring with transplant rejections as well as contact dermatitis, some drug sensitivity reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions to bacterial fungal and viral infections. 1 4. a, b, c, d, e, g. These are the anaph ylactic or atopic responses that can be seen with a type I or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to specific allergens. Contact dermatitis is seen with a type IV or delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Transfusion reactions and Goodpasture syndrome are seen with a type II or cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction. 15. c. W ith rheumatoid arthritis and acute glomerulonephritis, type III or immune-complex mediated hypersensitivity reaction is seen when the antigens combined with IgG and IgM are too small to be removed by the mononuclear phagocytic system and are deposited in tissue, which activates the complement system. 16. d. The best drugs for aller gic rhinitis are antihistamines. However, of those listed, minor sympathomimetic/decongestant drugs are used primarily for allergic rhinitis. Nasal corticosteroids may be used for seasonal allergic rhinitis; oral corticosteroids are used briefly if the patient is incapacitated. Immunotherapy is used when the allergen cannot be avoided and after it is found that drug therapy is not effective. Antipruritic drugs are topical and used to relieve itching. 17. a, f. Wheezing and a feeling of impending doom can both occur with anaphylaxis. Other common physiologic systemic anaphylactic responses are hypotension; rapid, weak pulse; dilated pupils; and edema and itching at the injection site. An arm rash would be more likely with a simple allergic reaction. 18. a. 2; b . 4; c. 1; d. 6; e. 5; f. 3; g. 7; h, 8. Airway is always first and oxygen will help with the dyspnea. Knowing that the patient has hypotension leads to placing the patient recumbent with elevated legs. Knowing that the patient has a bee sting, the stinger will be removed next. Then an IV is started. Anticipation of intubation with severe respiratory distress is also needed after the initial interventions.Having diphenhydramine and nebulized albuterol as well as methylprenisolone IV available is important, as they may be needed. 19. c. Aller gic individuals have elevated levels of IgE that react with allergens to produce symptoms. Immunotherapy involves injecting allergen extracts that will stimulate increased IgG that combines more readily with allergens without releasing histamine. The goal is to keep the \"blocking\" level of IgG high. 20. d. This describes a type IV aller gic contact dermatitis that is caused by chemicals used in the manufacturing process of latex gloves. A type I allergic reaction that is a response to the natural rubber latex proteins occurs within minutes of contact with the proteins and may manifest with reactions ranging from skin redness to full-blown anaphylactic shock. Powder-free gloves will avoid respiratory exposure to latex proteins but nonlatex gloves are more helpful. Avoidance of oil-based hand creams when wearing gloves can also help to prevent latex allergic reactions. 21. b . Multiple chemical sensitivities are commonly seen with scented products, paint fumes, petroleum products, smoke, pesticides, plastics, and synthetic products and occur in Gulf War veterans. Symptoms vary but include headache, sore throat, breathing problems, nausea as well as pain, skin rash, gastrointestinal (GI) problems, confusion, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and mood changes. Diagnosis is made based on the patient's health history, as there is no test to diagnose it. 22. c, d. Autoimmune causati ve factors are genetic susceptibility and initiation of autoreactivity by a trigger. Females and older patients are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. A viral infection may be a trigger but medications and hormones may also be triggers. 23. c. Plasmapheresis is the remo val of plasma from the blood and in autoimmune disorders is used to remove pathogenic substances found in plasma, such as autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complexes, and inflammatory mediators. Circulating blood cells are not affected by plasmapheresis, nor are blood cells added. 24. d. A crossmatch mix es recipient serum with donor lymphocytes. A positive crossmatch shows that the recipient has cytotoxic antibodies to the donor and this organ cannot be transplanted without hyperacute rejection occurring. A negative crossmatch indicates that it is safe to do the transplant. 25. c. Drug-induced immunosuppression with antineoplastic agents and corticosteroids is the most common cause of secondary immunodeficiency. Chronic stress and AIDS, not HIV , may cause secondary immunodeficiency but they are not the most common causes. Primary immunodeficiency is caused by common variable hypogammaglobulinemia. 26. d, e, f. Acute transplant rejection occurs when the recipient's T cytotoxic lymphocytes attack the foreign organ. Long-term immunosuppressants help to combat it and it is usually reversible with additional immunosuppression. Treatment of chronic rejection is supportive and irreversible with infiltration of the organ with B and T lymphocytes. Hyperacute rejection occurs when the recipient has antibodies against the donor's human leukocyte antigen (HLA), is most common with kidney transplants, and results in the organ needing to be removed. 27. b . Chronic rejection of a kidney transplant manifests as fibrosis and glomerulopathy (seen with proteinuria, edema, and renal failure), occurs over months or years, and is irreversible. Acute rejection occurs in the first 6 months after transplant. Hyperacute rejection occurs minutes to hours after transplantation and is rare. \"Delayed rejection\" is not a term used with transplantation. 28. d. Standard immunotherap y involves the use of three different immunosuppressants that act in different ways: 336 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), a corticosteroid, and the antimetabolite mycophenolate mofetil. Although cyclosporine is still used, tacrolimus is the most frequently prescribed calcineurin inhibitor. Azathioprine (Imuran) is similar to mycophenolate mofetil and they cannot be taken together. 29. c. Graft-versus-host (GVH) disease is occurring as the graft is rejecting the host tissue, which usually manifests in a pruritic or painful skin rash; in the GI tract with diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and malabsorption; or in the liver with mild jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. GVH disease is more effectively prevented with immunosuppressive agents than treated. Case Study 1. The comprehensive assessment should include past health history of respiratory problems and any allergies, medication use and response, family history of allergies, food intolerances, GI problems, activity intolerance symptoms, presence of pets, and altered home or work environment. The eyes, ears, nose, and throat should be assessed for drainage and discomfort. The lung sounds should also be assessed. 2. IgE is the immunoglobulin involved in most allergic reactions. Chemical mediators that would be active in the complement anaphylatoxins. 3. The procedure would involve either the scratch test or the prick test technique to identify specific allergens. Intradermal allergy testing is not used unless other methods do not result in conclusive reactions. An allergy blood test for IgE antibodies to specific allergens may be used if the patient cannot tolerate the many needle sticks or scratches needed for the skin test, has a skin disorder, or cannot stop using antihistamines or corticosteroids before skin testing. The patient must have been taught not to take antihistamines or corticosteroids for a few days before the test to achieve a positive result. A positive result is manifested by a local wheal-and-flare reaction that occurs within minutes after insertion of the extract and may last for 8 to 12 hours. 4. Precautions to prevent or treat severe allergic reactions are important: Never leave the patient alone during the testing period. Always have the following available: \u00b0 Emergency equipment (oral airway, laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes, oxygen, tourniquet, IV therapy equipment, cardiac monitor with defibrillator \u00b0 Essential drugs (epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, vasopressors) Severe local reactions should be treated with removal of the extract and application of antiinflammatory topical cream to the site. 5. Antihistamines relieve allergic symptoms by competing with histamine for H1 histamine receptors and thus block the effect of histamine. The action of most antihistamines is not very effective against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. This patient should be taught to take antihistamines on a regular basis because he has perennial allergic rhinitis that is not limited to contact with seasonal allergens. He also must be cautioned about the common side effects of antihistamines: drowsiness and impaired coordination, dry mouth, GI upset, urinary retention, blurred vision, and dizziness. 6. Household dust is controlled with air conditioners and air filtration systems in the home as well as daily damp dusting and frequent vacuuming with high-filtration vacuum bags. 7. Advantages of using sublingual immunotherapy include a lower risk of severe adverse reactions and being able to do it at home. However, sublingual immunotherapy is considered investigational, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers this an \"off-label\" use, and is not covered by most insurance plans. 8. Precautions with subcutaneous immunotherapy are as follows. Always having the following available: \u00b0 Health care provider \u00b0 Emergency equipment (oral airway, laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes, oxygen, tourniquet, IV therapy equipment, cardiac monitor with defibrillator) \u00b0 Emergency drugs (epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, vasopressors) Administer the extract in an extremity away from a joint so that a tourniquet can be applied for a severe reaction. Always aspirate for blood before injection of the allergen extract. Assess for systemic reactions manifested by pruritus, urticaria, sneezing, laryngeal edema, and hypotension. Observe the patient for systemic reactions for 20 minutes following the injection. 9. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective health maintenance related to insufficient knowledge of medications and methods of decreasing exposure to allergens Risk for injury related to effects of antihistamines, skin testing, and immunotherapy Collaborative problems: Potential complication: anaphylaxis CHAPTER 15 Answer Key 1. a, b, c, e. Infectious agents, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hantavirus, have evolved to affect humans through closer association with animals as human populations push into wild animal habitats. The transfer of infectious agents from animals to humans has also resulted in West Nile virus and avian flu. Bacterial infections have also become untreatable as the result of genetic and biochemical changes stimulated by unnecessary or inadequate exposure to antibiotics. The increased number of immunosuppressed and chronically ill people also increase the emergence of untreatable infections. 2. washing and the use of alcohol-based sanitizers and personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves) will prevent health care-associated infections (HAIs). Although the other interventions will not hurt a patient and they are good practice, they will not prevent HAIs. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 337 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 4. b . Contact precautions are used with standard precautions when microorganisms can be transmitted by direct patient contact. 5. a. A mask will be w orn even 3 feet from the patient to avoid droplet transmission. The gown and gloves will be used as with standard precautions, when working closely with the patient and there is a risk of contamination. 6. b . Infection in older adults often has atypical presentations, cognitive and behavioral changes occurring before fever, pain, or altered laboratory values. Fatigue and ICU psychosis (if the patient is in the ICU) could be occurring but these are not as dangerous for the patient as infection can be. Cognitive and behavioral changes are not typical manifestations of medication allergy. 7. d. One of the most important f actors in the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of organisms has been inappropriate use of antibiotics. Following directions regarding timing and completion of antibiotics will not allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to de velop. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses, which cause colds and flu. Not completing the antibiotic may allow the hardiest bacteria to survive and multiply and the potential development of an antibiotic-resistant infection. 8 . a. w omen; b. vascular access; c. first 2 to 6 months of infection; d. HIV-infected mothers using no therapy; e. needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood 9. a. c. 1; d. 6; e. 4 10. 11. a. Acti vated CD4+ T cells are an ideal target for HIV because these cells are attracted to the site of concentrated HIV in the lymph nodes, where they become infected through viral contact with CD4 receptors. CD4 + T cells normally are a major component of the immune system and their infection renders the immune system ineffective against HIV and other agents. The virus does not affect natural killer cells and B lymphocytes are functional early in the disease, as evidenced by positive antibody titers against HIV . Monocytes do ingest infected cells and may become sites of HIV replication and spread the virus to other tissue but this does not make the immune response ineffective. 12. b . The symptoms of acute HIV infection occur 2 to 4 weeks after initial infection and last for 1 to 2 weeks. The CD4+ T-cell counts fall temporarily but quickly return to baseline levels. Burkitt's lymphoma and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia are two of the opportunistic diseases that can occur in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Persistent fevers and drenching night sweats occur in the symptomatic infection stage. 13. d. Cytome galovirus retinitis could be an opportunistic viral infection that occurs when AIDS is diagnosed. Flu-like symptoms occur in the acute HIV infection stage. CD4 + T cells drop to 200-500/\u00b5L and oral hairy leukoplakia are seen in the symptomatic infection stage of HIV . 1 4. d. Or ganisms that are nonvirulent or that cause limited or localized diseases in an immunocompetent person can cause severe, debilitating, and life-threatening infections in persons with impaired immune function. 15. c. Pneumocystis jiroveci infection is characterized by pneumonia with a dry, nonproductive cough. Cryptococcus infection may cause fungal meningitis. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is diagnosed by lymph node is characterized by viral retinitis, stomatitis, esophagitis, gastritis, or colitis. 16. a. Hyperpigmented lesions of skin, lungs, and GI tract are seen in Kaposi sarcoma. Candida albicans is a common yeast infection of the mouth, esophagus, GI tract, or vagina. Herpes simplex type 1 infection oral and mucocutaneous vesicular and ulcerative lesions. Varicella- zoster is a maculo papular , pruritic rash and is treated with acyclovir. 17. b . Because there is a median delay of several weeks after infection before antibodies can be detected, testing during this \"window\" may result in false-negative results. Risky behaviors that may expose a person to HIV should be discussed and possible scheduling for repeated testing done. Positive results on initial testing will be verified by additional testing. Identification of sexual partners and prevention practices are important but do not relate immediately to the testing situation. 18. c. Although the \"rapid\" test is highly reliable and results are available in about 20 minutes, if results are positive from any testing, blood will be drawn for more specific enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) or Western blot testing and another visit will be necessary to obtain the results of the additional testing. CD4 + T-cell counts are not used for screening but rather are used to monitor the progression of HIV infection and new assay tests measure resistance of the virus to antiviral drugs. 19. b . The use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy limits the potential for development of resistance to antiretroviral medications, the major factor that limits the ability of antiretroviral drugs to inhibit virus replication and delay disease progression. The drugs selected should be ones with which the patient has not been previously treated and that are not cross-resistant with antiretroviral agents previously used by the patient. 20. c. Guidelines for initiating antiretro viral therapy (ART) are being updated continuously because of the development of alternative drugs and problems with long-term side effects and compliance with regimens. In the past, ART was always recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis but today new guidelines suggest that treatment can be delayed until higher levels of immunosuppression are observed. Whenever treatment is started, an important Drug Mechanism of Action Entry inhibitors Inhibit entry into cell (step 2 from Question 9) Reverse transcriptase inhibitorsInhibit conversion of viral RNA to single-stranded viral DNA with the assistance of the enzyme reverse transcriptase (step 3 from Question 9) Integrase inhibitorsViral DNA is spliced into cell genome using the enzyme integrase (step 5 from Question 9) Protease inhibitorsInhibit cutting of the long strands of viral RNA in the presence of the enzyme protease (step 7 from Question 9)338 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. consideration is the patient's readiness to initiate ART because adherence to drug regimens is a critical component of the therapy. 21. b. An undetectable viral load in the blood does not mean that the virus is gone; it is still present in lymph nodes and other organs. Transmission is still possible and use of protective measures must be continued. 22. c. Pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis A and B vaccines should be given as early as possible in HIV infection while there is still immunologic function. Isoniazid (INH) is used for 9 to 12 months only if a patient has reactive purified protein derivative (PPD) >5 mm, has had high-risk exposure, or has prior untreated positive PPD. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is initiated when CD4 + T-cell count is <200/ \u00b5L or when there is a history of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is indicated only after significant exposure to chickenpox or shingles in patients with no history of disease or a negative varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody test. Prophylaxis for other opportunistic diseases is noted in eTable 15-2. 23. d. After a patient has positive HIV antibody testing and is in acute disease, the overriding goal is to keep the viral load as low as possible and to maintain a functioning immune system. The nurse should provide teaching regarding ways to enhance immune function to prevent the onset of opportunistic diseases in addition to teaching about the spectrum of the infection, options for care, signs and symptoms to watch for, ways to prevent HIV spread, and ways to adhere to treatment regimens. 24. Sexual Intercourse Abstain from sexual activity Noncontact sexual activities (outercourse) Use of male or female condoms during sexual activity Drug Use Abstain from drug use Do not share equipment Use alternative routes to injecting Do not have sexual intercourse while under the influence of drugs Perinatal Transmission Use family planning to avoid pregnancy Use antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of transmission 25. a. All of the nursing interventions are appropriate for a patient with impaired memory but the priority is the safety of the patient when cognitive and behavioral problems impair the ability to maintain a safe environment. Case Study 1. Posttest counseling should include the following: Provide resources for medical and emotional support, with immediate assistance. Evaluate suicide risk. Determine the need to test others who have had risky contact with the patient. Discuss retesting to verify results. Discuss risk reduction. Encourage optimism: treatment options are available, health habits can improve immune function, the patient can visit HIV-infected people, the patient is infected with HIV but does not have AIDS. Empower the patient to identify needs, direct care, and seek services. 2. Vague symptoms of fatigue, headaches, lymphadenopathy, and night sweats are characteristic of asymptomatic infection. CD4 + T-cell counts are usually >500/\u00b5L in asymptomatic infection. This patient experienced what could have been acute infection only 2 weeks ago and it is unlikely that he would be at a later stage than asymptomatic infection. 3. Additional testing at this visit should include the following: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential Another CD4+ T-cell count Viral load assessment (bDNA or PCR) Hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C serology Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test by Mantoux method Liver function tests Phenotype assay to determine medications to use for the patient Genotype assay to detect drug-resistant viral mutations 4. Pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis A and B vaccines should be given. INH should be given if PPD is >0.5 mm reactive or, if the patient has had high-risk exposure, nutritional support and education should be provided. Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) should be given if the patient is exposed to chickenpox or shingles with no past disease. 5. The drug therapy is not curative but has resulted in dramatic improvements in many HIV-infected patients by maintaining immune function and decreasing viral load. It is critical to take the drug combination specifically as prescribed to prevent the development of resistance by the virus. If the drugs cannot be taken for any reason, the health care provider or nurse practitioner should be notified. There are many side effects of the drugs, some of which can be controlled and are not serious but some of which can prevent use of the drugs. It is important to report any changes in the patient's condition or symptoms that develop. The patient will be closely monitored and viral loads will be assessed 2 to 4 weeks after therapy is started and periodically after that. 6. Genotype and phenotype testing can be done to test for resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The genotype assay detects drug-resistant viral mutations that are present in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. The phenotype assay measures the growth of the virus in various concentrations of antiretroviral drugs (similar to bacteria-antibiotic sensitivity tests). 7. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety Fear Ineffective denial Anticipatory grieving Deficient knowledge Fatigue Risk-prone health behavior Collaborative complications: opportunistic infections, oppor tunistic malignancies, ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 339 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 16 Answer Key 1. a. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States for both women and men and smoking cessation is one of the most important cancer prevention behaviors. Approximately one half of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. are related to tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and obesity. Cancers of the reproductive organs are the second leading cause of cancer deaths. 2. d. Malignant cells proliferate indiscriminately and continuously and also lose the characteristic of contact inhibition, growing on top of and in between normal cells. Cancer cells usually do not proliferate at a faster rate than normal cells, nor can cell cycles be skipped in proliferation. However, malignant proliferation is continuous, unlike normal cells. 3. a. Cancer cells become more fetal and embryonic (undifferentiated) in appearance and function and some produce new proteins, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and -fetoprotein (AFP), on cell membranes that reflect a return to more immature functioning. The other options are unrelated to CEA and AFP. 4. d. The major dif ference between malignant and benign cells is the ability of malignant tumor cells to invade and metastasize. Benign tumors can cause death by expansion into normal tissues and organs. Benign tumors are more often encapsulated and often grow at the same rate as malignant tumors. 5. d. Alk ylating agents are used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma and are carcinogens associated with initiation of acute myelogenous leukemia. Working with radiation would lead to a higher incidence of bone cancer. Epstein-Barr virus is seen in vitro with Burkitt's lymphoma. Intense tanning or exposure to ultraviolet radiation is associated with skin cancers. 6. a. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in many cancers, including bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, lung, and ovarian cancers. APC gene mutations increase a person's risk for familiar adenomatous polyposis, which is a precursor for colorectal cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancer. 7. a, c, d. Promoting f actors such as obesity and tobacco smoke promote cancer in the promotion stage of cancer development. Eliminating risk factors can reduce the chance of cancer development as the activity of promoters is reversible in this stage. Increased growth, invasion, and metastasis are seen in the progressive stage. 8. b . Carcinoma in situ has the histologic features except invasion. Evasion of the immune system by cancer cells by various methods is immunologic escape. Oncogenic factors are capable of causing cellular alterations associated with cancer. Tumor cell surface antigens that stimulate an immune response are tumor-associated antigens. 9 . a. Oncogenes are the mutation of protooncogenes, which then induce tumors. Oncogenic viruses cause genetic alterations and mutations that allow the cell to express the abilities and properties it had in fetal development and may lead to cancer. Oncofetal antigens are antigens that are found on the surface and inside the cancer cells. They are an expression of the cells usually associated with embryonic or fetal periods of life and may be used as tumor markers to monitor treatment. Tumor angiogenesis factor is the substance within tumors that promotes blood vessel development. 10. d. Meningeal sarcoma is from the embryonal mesoderm, is located in the meninges, and is malignant. A meningioma has the same tissue of origin and anatomic site but it is benign. Meningitis is inflammation or infection of the meninges. Meningocele is a hernia cyst filled with cerebrospinal fluid. 11. c. The breast cancer origination gi ves it the anatomic classification of a carcinoma. Grade II has moderate abnormal cells with moderate differentiation. T 1N1M0 represents a small tumor with only minimal regional spread to the lymph nodes and no metastasis. Sarcomas originate from embryonal mesoderm or connective tissue, muscle, bone, and fat. Leukemias and lymphomas originate from the hematopoietic system. The other histologic grading and TNM classifications do not represent this patient's tumor. 12. b . Healthy men and women should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, an annual fecal occult blood test, or a barium enema every 5 years. These frequencies may change depending on the results. Annual PSA and digital rectal exams screen for prostate problems, although the decision to test is made by the patient with his health care provider. 13. b . Although other tests may be used in diagnosing the presence and extent of cancer, biopsy is the only method by which cells can be definitely determined to be malignant. 14. a. A simple mastectomy can be done to pre vent breast cancer in women with high risk and can be used to control, cure, or provide palliative care for breasts with cancerous tumors. A mastectomy would not be used for biopsy or otherwise to establish a diagnosis of cancer. 15. a. 4; b . 1; c. 3; d. 2; g. 1; h. 2. Mammoplasty is done for rehabilitation post mastectomy. A bowel resection and debulking procedure to enhance radiation therapy are done to cure or control cancer. Cordotomy for pain control and colostomy to bypass bowel obstruction are done for palliation. Supportive care includes insertion of a feeding tube, placement of a central venous catheter, and surgical fixation of bones at risk for pathologic fracture. 16. b . Neuroblastomas are cured with chemotherapy. A positive response of cancer cells to chemotherapy is most likely in solid or hematopoietic tumors that arise from tissue that has a rapid rate of cellular proliferation and new tumors with cells that are rapidly dividing. A state of optimum health and a positive attitude of the patient will also promote the success of chemotherapy. 17. a. Nitrosureas are cell c ycle phase-nonspecific, break the DNA helix, and cross the blood-brain barrier. Antimetabolites are cell cycle phase-specific drugs that mimic essential cellular metabolites to interfere with DNA synthesis. Mitotic inhibitors are cell cycle phase-specific drugs that arrest mitosis. Antitumor antibiotics bind with DNA to block RNA production. 18. b . One of the major concerns with the IV administration of vesicant chemotherapeutic agents is infiltration or extravasation of drugs into tissue surrounding the infusion site. When infiltrated into the skin, vesicants cause pain, severe local breakdown, and necrosis. Specific measures to ensure adequate dilution, patency, and early detection of extravasation and treatment are important.340 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 19. a. Intravesical regional chemotherapy is administered into the bladder via a urinary catheter. Leukemia is treated with IV chemotherapy. Osteogenic sarcoma is treated with intraarterial chemotherapy via vessels supplying the tumor. Metastasis to the brain is treated with intraventricular or intrathecal chemotherapy via an Ommaya reservoir or lumbar punctures. 20. d. Intraperitoneal regional chemotherapeutic administration is used to treat metastasis from a primary colorectal cancer. Intrathecal administration is used with the spinal cord or the brain. Intraarterial administration is used to deliver chemotherapy to tumors via specific vessels. IV administration is used for systemic administration. 21. b. Patients should always be taught what to expect during a course of chemotherapy, including side effects and expected outcome. Side effects of chemotherapy are serious but it is important that patients be informed about what measures can be taken to help them to cope with the side effects of therapy. Hair loss related to chemotherapy is usually reversible and wigs, scarves, or turbans can be used during and following chemotherapy until the hair grows back. 22. c. Tissue that is actively proliferating, such as GI mucosa, esophageal and oropharyngeal mucosa, and bone marrow, exhibits early acute responses to radiation therapy. Radiation ionization breaks chemical bonds in DNA, which renders cells incapable of surviving mitosis. This loss of proliferative capacity yields cellular death at the time of division for both normal cells and cancer cells but cancer cells are more likely to be dividing because of the loss of control of cellular division. Cartilage, bone, kidney, and nervous tissues that proliferate slowly manifest subacute or late responses. 23. d. Avoiding sources of excessive heat and cold will prevent damage to the skin. Only nonmedicated, nonperfumed lotions or creams (e.g., calendula ointment, aloe gel, Aquaphor) are recommended for dry skin. The area should be exposed to air if possible. Gentle cleansing, thorough rinsing, and patting the treatment area dry are recommended. 24. b. Brachytherapy is the implantation or insertion of radioactive materials directly into the tumor or in proximity to the tumor and may be curative. The patient is a source of radiation and in addition to implementing the principles of time, distance, and shielding, film badges should be worn by caregivers to monitor the amount of radiation exposure. Computerized dosimetry and simulation are used in external radiation therapy. 25. a. Walking programs scheduled during the time of day when the patient feels better are a way for patients to keep active without overtaxing themselves and help to combat the depression caused by inactivity. Ignoring the fatigue or overstressing the body can make symptoms worse and the patient should rest before activity and as necessary. 26. b. Alkylating chemotherapeutic agents and high-dose radiation are most likely to cause secondary malignancies as a late effect of treatment. The other conditions are not known to be late effects of radiation or chemotherapy. 27. c. Biologic therapies are normal components of the immune system and are used therapeutically to restore, augment, or modulate host immune system mechanisms. They have direct antitumor effects or other biologic effects to assist in immune activity against cancer cells. Virtually all biologic therapies may cause a flu-like syndrome. The other options are not correct. 28. c. The nadir is the point of the lowest blood counts after chemotherapy is started and it is the time when the patient is most at risk for infection. Because infection is the most common cause of morbidity and death in cancer patients, identification of risk and interventions to protect the patient are of the highest priority. The other problems will be treated but they are not the priority. 29. c. An allogenic hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplant is one in which peripheral stems cells or bone marrow from an HLA-matched donor is infused into a patient who has received high doses of chemotherapy, with or without radiation, to eradicate cancerous cells. In an autologous bone marrow transplant, the patient's own bone marrow is removed before therapy to destroy the bone marrow. The marrow is treated to remove cancer cells and may be infused shortly after conditioning treatment or frozen and stored for later use. With either source, the new bone marrow will take several weeks to produce new blood cells and protective isolation is necessary during this time. 30. a. Hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia are characteristic of tumor lysis syndrome, which is the result of rapid destruction of large numbers of tumor cells. Signs include hyperuricemia that causes acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. To prevent renal failure and other problems, the primary treatment includes increasing urine production using hydration therapy and decreasing uric acid concentrations using allopurinol (Zyloprim). 31. d. The priority in pain management is to obtain a comprehensive history of the patient's pain. This will determine the medications most useful for this patient's pain to enable giving the dose that relieves the pain with the fewest side effects. Teaching the patient about the lack of tolerance and addiction associated with effective cancer pain management will also be important for this patient's pain management. 32. a, b, d. Feeling in control, having a strong support system, and the potential of cure or control of the cancer will have a positive effect on coping with the diagnosis. The other options will make coping more difficult for the patient. (See Table 16-19.) Case Study 1. Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression is probably the most relevant factor in the patient's decreased WBC and neutrophil count. Inadequate protein intake would also contribute to impaired recovery of normal blood cells. 2. A temperature of 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C) in an immunosuppressed patient is a significant finding for infection. He also has warm skin, with some degree of dehydration. His risk of infection is high, with a WBC count of 3200/\u00b5L and neutrophils of 500/\u00b5L. The risk for infection increases when neutrophils are <1000/\u00b5l. 3. Assess for sore throat, chest pain, persistent cough, urinary symptoms, skin lesions, rectal pain, or confusion. Also note the catheter site for chemotherapy as a possible source of infection. 4. His nausea, vomiting, and anorexia as well as any other side effects of chemotherapy may contribute to his negative ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 341 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. attitude. Negative attitude may also be promoted by lack of social support, an inability to cope with stress, an inability to express his feelings and concerns, the lack of control he may be feeling, a past negative experience with cancer in a friend, and lack of information about expected results of treatment. 5. Nursing measures: Use antiemetic protocols to control treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Offer small, frequent feedings of bland, high-calorie, high-protein foods (e.g., milk shake, eggnog, cottage cheese) in a pleasant environment. Provide or encourage frequent oral care. Use relaxation techniques and distraction when the patient is nauseated. Offer any fluids or foods that the patient can tolerate and that may be appealing to him. Avoid nagging or being judgmental about food intake. Keep a food diary to track daily calories and fluids. 6. Metastasis can occur when cancer cells detach from the primary tumor to invade tissue surrounding the tumor. Via tumor angiogenesis, hematogenous metastasis can occur through the vascular circulation. 7. There is a lesser incidence of lung cancer in African American women than men but a high morbidity. Less cancer is seen with avoidance of exposure to carcinogens (e.g., limited alcohol use, no tobacco use, limited sun exposure), regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, reducing fat consumption, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, and regular physical examinations. There are no specific screening tests for lung cancer but the seven warning signs of cancer include change in bowel or bladder habits, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge from any body orifice, thickening or a lump in the breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty swallowing, obvious change in a wart or mole, and nagging cough or hoarseness. The routine screenings that are done to detect cancer include colorectal screening, breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, mammogram, and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. 8. Teaching measures: Hand washing with antibacterial soap for staff, patient, and visitors Do not scratch skin or use a razor with a blade Careful sterile technique in caring for IV catheter site Avoidance of visitors with infection Wear shoes to prevent cuts Use a soft toothbrush to prevent cuts in the mouth Report any manifestations of infection 9. Nursing diagnoses: Hopelessness related to uncertainty about outcomes and insufficient knowledge about cancer and treatment Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements related to decreased oral intake, increased metabolic demands of cancer Deficient fluid volume related to decreased oral fluid intake Risk for infection related to immunosuppression Collaborative problems: Potential complications: septicemia, ne gative nitrogen balance, myelosuppressionCHAPTER 17 Answer Key 1. 1000 2. 90 kg \u00d7 60% = 54 3. a, d, e. Third spacing is when fluid mo ves into spaces that normally have little or no fluid. A cell surrounded by hypoosmolar fluid will swell and burst as water moves into the cell. A cell surrounded by hyperosmolar fluid will shrink and die as water moves out of the cell. 4. a. 3; b . 6; c. 7; d. 4; e. 5; 1; g. 2 5. 2 \u00d7 147 + 126/18 = 301. The patient's serum osmolality is increased. 6. c, e. At the arterial end of the capillary , capillary hydrostatic pressure exceeds plasma oncotic pressure and fluid moves into the interstitial space. 7. 8. a. Serum osmolality increases as a lar ge amount of sodium is absorbed. b. Intak e of these foods stimulates antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release from the posterior pituitary, which increases water reabsorption from the kidney, lowering the sodium concentration but increasing vascular volume and hydrostatic pressure, perhaps causing fluid shift into interstitial spaces. 9. d. Aldosterone is secreted by the adrenal corte x in response to a decrease in plasma volume (loss of water), serum sodium, or renal perfusion. It is also secreted in response to an increase in serum potassium. 10. b . A decrease in renin and aldosterone and an increase in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lead to decreased sodium reabsorption and increased water retention by the kidney, both of which lead to hyponatremia. Skin changes lead to increased insensible water loss and plasma oncotic pressure is more often decreased because of lack of protein intake. 11. a, b, c, d, e. All of these are important in assessing fluid balance in a postoperative patient. These assessments will provide data about potential fluid volume abnormalities. 12. d. A major cause of h ypernatremia is a water deficit, which can occur in those with a decreased sensitivity to thirst, the major protection against hyperosmolality. All other conditions lead to hyponatremia. 13. d. As w ater shifts into and out of cells in response to the osmolality of the blood, the cells that are most sensitive to shrinking or swelling are those of the brain, resulting in neurologic symptoms.Event or FactorDirection of Fluid ShiftMechanism of Fluid Movement Involved Burns 1 b Dehydration 2 c Fluid overload 3, 4 d Hyponatremia 4 a Low serum albumin 1 e Administration of 10% glucose1 a Application of elastic bandages4 c342 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

Because of the osmotic pressure of sodium, water will be excreted with the sodium lost with the diuretic. A change in the relative concentration of sodium will not be seen but an isotonic fluid loss will occur. 16. c. Potassium maintains normal cardiac rhythm, transmission and conduction of nerve impulses, and contraction of muscles. Cardiac cells demonstrate the most clinically significant changes with potassium imbalances because of changes in cardiac conduction. Although paralysis may occur with severe potassium imbalances, cardiac changes are seen earlier and much more commonly. 17. b. In metabolic acidosis, hydrogen ions in the blood are taken into the cell in exchange for potassium ions as a means of buffering excess acids. This results in an increase in serum potassium until the kidneys have time to excrete the excess potassium. 18. d. Chvostek's sign is a contraction of facial muscles in response to a tap over the facial nerve. This indicates the neuromuscular irritability of low calcium levels and IV calcium is the treatment used to prevent laryngeal spasms and respiratory arrest. Calcitonin is indicated for treatment of high calcium levels and loop diuretics may be used to decrease calcium levels. Oral vitamin D supplements are part of the treatment for hypocalcemia but not for impending tetany. 19. c. Kidneys are the major route of phosphate excretion, a function that is impaired in renal failure. A reciprocal relationship exists between phosphorus and calcium and high serum phosphate levels of kidney failure cause low calcium concentration in the serum. 20. c. 7.35 to 7.45; 20 to 1. The other answers are incorrect. 21. a, b, c. Shifts of H+ in and out of the cell are characteristics of the cellular buffer system. Free basic radical dissociation is characteristic of the protein buffer system. 22. a, b, d. Free acid radical dissociation is characteristic of the protein buffer system. Chloride shifting in and out of red blood cells is characteristic of the hemoglobin buffer system. 23. c. The amount of carbon dioxide in the blood directly relates to carbonic acid concentration and subsequently hydrogen ion concentration. The carbon dioxide combines with water in the blood to form carbonic acid and in cases in which carbon dioxide is retained in the blood, acidosis occurs. 24. a. 3; b. 4; c. 2; d. 1. Respiratory acid-base imbalances are associated with excesses or deficits of carbonic acid. Metabolic acid-base imbalances are associated with excesses or deficits of bicarbonate. 25. d. Shifting of bicarbonate for Cl- may buffer acute respiratory alkalosis. The kidney conserves bicarbonate and excretes hydrogen to respiratory acidosis. Kussmaul respirations occur with metabolic acidosis to 1; 3; e. 2; f. 2; g. 4; h. 3; i. 4 27. b. Calculation of the anion gap by subtracting the serum chloride and bicarbonate levels from the serum sodium level should normally be 10 to 14 mmol/L. The anion gap is increased in metabolic acidosis associated with acid gain (e.g., diabetic acidosis) but remains normal in metabolic acidosis caused by bicarbonate loss (e.g., diarrhea). 28. a. 1. pH >7.45 indicates alkalosis. 2. PaCO2 is low, indicating respiratory alkalosis. 3. HCO3 is normal. 4. Respiratory alkalosis matches the pH. 5. Although uncommon, if the HCO3 were decreased, compensation would be present. Interpretation: Respiratory alkalosis b. 1. pH <7.35 indicates acidosis. 2. PaCO2 is low, indicating respiratory alkalosis. HCO3 is low, indicating metabolic acidosis. 4. Metabolic acidosis matches the pH. 5. The PaCO2 does not match the acidic pH but is in the opposite direction, which indicates that the lungs are attempting to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Interpretation: Metabolic acidosis; partially compensated c. 1. pH indicates acidosis. 2. PaCO2 is high, indicating respiratory acidosis. 3. HCO3 is normal. 4. Respiratory acidosis matches the pH. 5. Normal HCO3 is found until the kidneys have time to retain bicarbonate. Interpretation: Respiratory acidosis d. 1. pH >7.45 indicates alkalosis. 2. PaCO2 is high, indicating respiratory acidosis. HCO3 is high, indicating metabolic alkalosis. 4. Metabolic alkalosis matches the pH. 5. The PaCO2 does not match the alkalotic pH but is in the opposite direction, indicating that the lungs are attempting to compensate for the alkalosis. Interpretation: Metabolic alkalosis; partially compensated e. 1. pH is within normal range but toward alkalosis. 2. PaCO2 is high, indicating respiratory acidosis. 3. HCO3 is high, indicating metabolic alkalosis. 4. Because the body will not overcompensate, the metabolic alkalosis is a closer match with the pH. 5. The high PaCO2 indicates the ability of the lungs to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis. Interpretation: Compensated or chronic metabolic alkalosis indicated by the high PaCO2 and a pH within normal range f. 1. pH is within normal range but toward acidosis. 2. PaCO2 is high, indicating respiratory acidosis. 3. HCO3 is high, indicating metabolic alkalosis. 4. Because the body will not overcompensate, the respiratory acidosis is a closer match with the pH. 5. The high HCO3 indicates the ability of the kidneys to compensate for the respiratory acidosis. Interpretation: compensated respiratory acidosis as reflected by high HCO 3 and pH in normal range 29. a. Fluids such as 5% dextrose in water (D5W) allow water to move from the extracellular fluid to the intracellular fluid. Although D5W is physiologically isotonic, the dextrose is rapidly metabolized, leaving free water to shift into cells. 30. c. An isotonic solution does not change the osmolality of the blood and does not cause fluid shifts between the extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid. In the case of extracellular fluid loss, an isotonic solution, such as lactated Ringer's solution, is ideal because it stays in the extracellular compartment. A hypertonic solution would pull fluid from the cells into the extracellular compartment, resulting in cellular fluid loss and possible vascular overload.

Dressings that are loose should be changed immediately to reduce this risk. 32. a. 3; b . 7; c. 4; d. 8; e. 2; f. 5; g. 6; h. 1. The first nursing action to be completed after a CV AD is inserted and before it is used is to ensure proper placement with a chest x-ray. Assessments, flushing, dressing changes, and cap changes are completed according to facility policies but hand hygiene must be completed before manipulating the CV AD to prevent infection. Strict sterile technique is used with dressing and cap changes as well as having the patient turn his or her face away from the insertion site to avoid contamination. 33. a. Catheters tunneled to the distal end of the superior vena cava or the right atrium are vascular access devices inserted into central veins, which decrease the incidence of extravasation, provide for rapid dilution of chemotherapy, and reduce the need for venipunctures. Most right atrial catheters, except for a Groshong catheter, need to be flushed with heparin to prevent clotting in the tubing. Regional chemotherapy administration delivers the drug directly to the tumor and is the only administration route that can decrease the systemic effects of the drugs. 3 4. b . With a low magnesium level there is an increased risk for hypokalemia and hypocalcemia as well as altered sodium-potassium pump and altered carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Hypokalemia could lead to dysrhythmias and severe muscle weakness. The sodium and phosphate levels are also not within normal limits. However, the implications are not as life-threatening. The calcium level is normal. Case Study 1. Status: Fluid v olume deficit Ph ysical assessment: Decreased dry blood pressure; confusion Ph assessment: Weakness, 2.5 mEq/L Etiology: Diuretic therap y 2. hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. 3. Metabolic alkalosis: mEq/L) Etiology: Diuretic-induced hypokalemia is the primary factor.Compensation: Not complete because the pH is out of normal range but increased PaCO 2 and slow and shallow respirations indicate the attempt by the lungs to increase carbon dioxide to compensate for excess bicarbonate. 4. P .B. has less fluid reserve because older adults have less total body fluid; older adults also have decreased thirst sensation. 5 . Aldosterone w ould be secreted in response to low fluid volume (decreased plasma volume). P.B.'s low blood pressure and extracellular fluid deficit would stimulate secretion of aldosterone to increase sodium and water retention. 6. General care: Encourage and assist with oral fluid intake Provide skin care with assessment, changes in position, no soap Assessments: Vital signs q4hr Intake and output; daily weights Cardiac monitoring until electrolytes and acid-base normal Type and rate of IV fluid and electrolyte replacement Lung sounds for signs of fluid overload in cardiac-compromised patient Daily serum electrolyte and blood gas levels 7. Nursing diagnoses: Deficient fluid volume related to excessive extracellular fluid (ECF) loss or decreased fluid intake Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of knowledge of drugs and preventive measures Risk for injury related to confusion, muscle weakness Risk for impaired skin integrity related to dehydration Collaborative problems:Potential complications: dysrhythmias, hypovolemic shock, hypoxemia CHAPTER 18 Answer Key 1. d, e. Gastroscop y is for the purpose of diagnosis. Rhinoplasty is done for a cosmetic improvement. A tracheotomy is palliative. 2. a. Amb ulatory surgery is usually less expensive and more convenient, generally involving fewer laboratory tests, fewer preoperative and postoperative medications, less psychologic stress, and less susceptibility to hospital- acquired infections. However, the nurse is still responsible for assessing, supporting, and teaching the patient who is undergoing surgery, regardless of where the surgery is performed. 3. a. Excessi ve anxiety and stress can affect surgical recovery and the nurse's role in psychologically preparing the patient for surgery is to assess for potential stressors that could negatively affect surgery. Specific fears should be identified and addressed by the nurse by listening and by explaining planned postoperative care. Falsely reassuring the patient, ignoring her behavior, and telling her not to be anxious are not therapeutic. 4. a, b, d, f. V alerian may cause excess sedation. Astragalus may increase blood pressure before and during surgery. 5. c. Risk f actors for latex allergies include a history of hay fever and allergies to foods such as avocados, kiwi, bananas, potatoes, peaches, and apricots. When a patient identifies such allergies, the patient should be further questioned about exposure to latex and specific reactions to allergens. A history of any allergic responsiveness increases the risk for hypersensitivity reactions to drugs used during anesthesia but the hay fever and fruit allergies are specifically related to latex allergy. After identifying the allergic reaction, the anesthesia care provider (ACP) should be notified, the allergy alert wristband should be applied, and the note in the record will include the allergies and reactions as well as the nursing actions related to the allergies. 6. d. B UN, serum creatinine, and electrolytes are used to assess renal function and should be evaluated before surgery. Other tests are often evaluated in the presence of diabetes, bleeding tendencies, and respiratory or heart disease.344 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 7. a. Obesity, as well as spinal, chest, and airway deformities, may compromise respiratory function during and after surgery. Dehydration may require preoperative fluid therapy and an enlarged liver may indicate hepatic dysfunction that will increase perioperative risk related to glucose control, coagulation, and drug interactions. Weak peripheral pulses may reflect circulatory problems that could affect healing. 8. a, b, e. Procedural information includes what will or should be done for surgical preparation, including what to bring and what to wear to the surgery center, length and type of food and fluid restrictions, physical preparation required, pain control, need for coughing and deep breathing (if appropriate), and procedures done before and during surgery (such as vital signs, IV lines, and how anesthesia is administered). The other options are sensory and process information (see Table 18-6). 9. a. The health care provider is ultimately responsible for obtaining informed consent. However, the nurse may be responsible for obtaining and witnessing the patient's signature on the consent form. The nurse may be a patient advocate during the signing of the consent form, verifying that consent is voluntary and that the patient understands the implications of consent, but the primary legal action by the nurse is witnessing the patient's signature. 10. a. The nurse should notify the health care provider because the patient needs further explanation of the planned surgery. b. Sufficient comprehension 11. a. The preoperative fasting recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiology indicate that clear liquids may be taken up to 2 hours before surgery for healthy patients undergoing elective procedures. There is evidence that longer fasting is not necessary. 12. b. Preoperative checklists are a tool used to ensure that the many preparations and precautions performed before surgery have been completed and documented. Patient identification, instructions to the family, and administration of preoperative medications are often documented on the checklist, which ensures that no details are omitted. 13. c. One of the major reasons that older adults need increased time preoperatively is the presence of impaired vision and hearing that slows understanding of preoperative instructions and preparation for surgery. Thought processes and cognitive abilities may also be impaired in some older adults. The older adult's decreased adaptation to stress because of physiologic changes may increase surgical risks and overwhelming surgery-related losses may result in ineffective coping that is not directly related to time needed for preoperative preparation. The involvement of caregivers in preoperative activities may be appropriate for patients of all ages. 14. d. This finding may indicate an infection. The surgeon will probably postpone the surgery until the cause of the elevated WBC count has been found. 15. a, b, c, d, e. All of these are actions that are needed to ensure that the patient is ready for surgery. In addition, the nurse should verify that the identification band and allergy band (if applicable) are on; the patient is not wearing any cosmetics; nail polish has been removed; valuables have been removed and secured; and prosthetics, such as eyeglasses, have been removed and secured. Case Study 1. Family: children with cystic fibrosis who require extra care and expense and concern that the wife will not be able to manage without him; fear of cancer and the unknown; anemia: contributes to fatigue and ability to cope 2. Three criteria for informed consent: Adequate disclosure of the diagnosis; the nature and purpose of the proposed treatment; risks and consequences of the proposed treatment; the availability, benefits, and risks of alternative treatments; and the prognosis if treatment is not instituted. Sufficient comprehension of the information is provided. V oluntary consent is given without persuasion or coercion. 3. Outpatient instructions: When to arrive and the time of the surgery, how and where to register, what to wear and bring, the need for a responsible adult for transportation home after the procedure General preoperative instruction: Information related to preoperative routines and preparation, such as food and fluid restrictions; approximate length of surgery; postoperative recovery 4. Smoking history increases the risk for postoperative respiratory complications; the longer the patient can stop smoking before surgery, the less the risk will be Mild obesity may contribute to problems with clearance of respiratory secretions and complete expansion of the lungs. The patient should have preoperative instruction about deep-breathing and coughing techniques. Fear of a diagnosis of cancer can alter adaptation and recovery. The nurse can help to minimize this risk by providing specific information about the experience and through supportive listening. 5. Nursing diagnoses: Fear related to possible diagnosis of cancer Interrupted family processes related to shift in family roles Ineffective health maintenance related to tobacco use Collaborative problems: Potential complications: hemorrhage, laryngospasm/ bronchos pasm, pneumonia, pneumothorax CHAPTER 19 Answer Key 1. b. Although all of the factors listed are important to the safety and well-being of the patient, the first consideration in the physical environment of the surgical suite is prevention of transmission of infection to the patient. 2. b. Persons in street clothes or attire other than surgical scrub clothing can interact with personnel of the surgical suite in unrestricted areas, such as the holding area, nursing station, control desk, or locker rooms. Only authorized personnel wearing surgical attire and hair covering are allowed in semirestricted areas, such as corridors, and masks must be worn in restricted areas, such as operating rooms and clean core and scrub sink areas. 3. a, c, e. The circulating nurse documents intraoperative care, checks mechanical and electrical equipment, and monitors blood and other fluid loss and urine output. 4. a. The protection of the patient from injury in the operating room environment is maintained by the circulating nurse by ensuring functioning equipment, preventing falls and injury during transport and transfer, monitoring asepsis, and providing supportive care for the anesthetized patient. 5. d. The Universal Protocol supported by The Joint Commission (TJC) is used to prevent wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong surgery in view of a high rate of ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 345 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. these problems nationally. It involves pausing just before the procedure starts to verify patient identity, surgical site, and surgical procedure. 6. a. The mask co vering the face is not considered sterile and if in contact with sterile gloved hands, it contaminates the gloves. The gown at chest level and to 2 inches above the elbows is considered sterile, as is the drape placed at the surgical area. 7. c. Musculosk eletal deformities can be a risk factor for positioning injuries and require special padding and support on the operating table. Skin lesions and break in sterile technique are risk factors for infection and electrical or mechanical equipment failure may lead to other types of injury. 8. d. The Perioperati ve Nursing Data Set includes outcome statements that reflect standards and recommended practices of perioperative nursing. Outcomes related to physiologic responses include those of physiologic function, such as respiratory function; perioperative safety includes the patient's freedom from any type of injury; and behavioral responses include knowledge and actions of the patient and family, including the consistency of the patient's care with the perioperative plan and the patient's right to privacy. 9 . d, e. Nitrous oxide is a weak g aseous anesthetic. Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic that has a rapid onset and may be used for induction. Isoflurane (Forane) is a volatile liquid inhalation agent. 1 0. b . The volatile liquid inhalation agents have very little residual analgesia and patients experience early onset of pain when the agents are discontinued. These agents are associated with a low incidence of nausea and vomiting. Prolonged respiratory depression is not common because of their rapid elimination. Hypothermia is not related to use of these agents but they may precipitate malignant hyperthermia in conjunction with neuromuscular blocking agents. 11. a. Midazolam (V ersed) is a rapid, short-acting, sedative- hypnotic benzodiazepine that is used to prevent recall of events under anesthesia because of its amnestic properties. 12. 13. d. MA C refers to sedation that is similar to general anesthesia using sedative, anxiolytic, and/or analgesic medications. It can be administered by an ACP. The patient must be assessed and the physiologic problems that may develop must be managed because of the high risk of complications resulting in clinical emergencies. 14. a. 3; b . 5; c. 1; d. 4; e. 2 15. d. Moderate sedation uses sedati ve, anxiolytic, and/or analgesic medications. Inhalation agents are not used. It is not expected to induce levels of sedation that would impair a patient's ability to protect the airway. 1 6. b . During epidural and spinal anesthesia, a sympathetic nervous system blockade may occur that results in hypotension, bradycardia, and nausea and vomiting. A spinal headache may occur after, not during, spinal anesthesia and loss of consciousness and seizures are indicative of IV absorption overdose. Upward extension of the effect of the anesthesia results in inadequate respiratory excursion and apnea. 17. b . Although malignant hyperthermia can result in cardiac arrest and death, if the patient is known or suspected to be at risk for the disorder, appropriate precautions taken by the ACP can provide for safe anesthesia for the patient. Because preventive measures are possible if the risk is known, it is critical that preoperative assessment include a careful family history of surgical events. Dantrolene (Dantrium) is given as a treatment for malignant hyperthermia, not as a preventive measure. The cooling blanket would have no effect. Case Study 1 . Ensure that enough help is a vailable to transfer the patient from the stretcher to the OR table. Position the patient carefully to prevent injury. Apply safety straps. Place electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, blood pressure (BP) cuff, and pulse oximetry. Check the IV to verify insertion and patency. Ensure that the grounding pad is placed correctly. Complete the patient safety checklist. Implement the Universal Protocol: take a surgical timeout with the surgical team members to verify patient name, birth date, and operative procedure and location and to compare the hospital ID number on the patient ID band with the chart. Aseptic technique must be maintained by all surgical team members. A fire risk assessment may also be completed. 2. The patient position should allo w for operative site accessibility. Place in correct musculoskeletal alignment. Be sure that no undue pressure is occurring to bony prominences, nerves, earlobes, and eyes. Be sure that there can be adequate thoracic wall movement. Prevent any pressure or occlusion of veins and arteries. Secure the patient's extremities and provide adequate padding. Respect patient modesty. Respect the patient's specific aches and pains or deformities. 3. T .M. should be monitored for hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting, respiratory difficulties, and apnea. 4. Monitor the ef fect of anesthetic agents and adjuncts closely. Ensure clear communication and verify patient understanding. Closely monitor the patient's skin, especially where tape, electrodes, and pads have been applied. Position the older patient carefully with close attention to patient alignment and joint support.

Assess the postoperative recovery from the anesthetic agents before the patient is transferred out of the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). 5. Nursing diagnoses: Risk for infection Risk for impaired skin integrity Risk for injury Risk for hypothermia CHAPTER 20 Answer Key 1. a. Although some surgical procedures and drug administration require more intensive postanesthesia care, how fast and through which levels of care patients are moved depend on the condition of the patient. A physiologically unstable outpatient may stay an extended time in Phase I, whereas a patient requiring hospitalization but who is stable and recovering may well be transferred quickly to an inpatient unit. 2. c. Physiologic status of the patient is always prioritized with regard to airway, breathing, and circulation, and respiratory adequacy is the first assessment priority of the patient on admission to the PACU from the operating room. Following assessment of respiratory function, cardiovascular, neurologic, and renal function should be assessed as well as the surgical site. 3. c. The admission of the patient to the PACU is a joint effort between the ACP, who is responsible for supervising the postanesthesia recovery of the patient, and the PACU nurse, who provides care during anesthesia recovery. The ACP gives a verbal report that presents the details of the surgical and anesthetic course, preoperative conditions influencing the surgical and anesthetic outcome, and PACU treatment plans to ensure patient safety and continuity of care. 4. b. Even before patients awaken from anesthesia, their sense of hearing returns and all activities should be explained by the nurse from the time of admission to the PACU to assist in orientation and decrease confusion. 5. b. ECG monitoring is performed on patients to assess initial cardiovascular problems during anesthesia recovery. Fluid and electrolyte status is an indication of renal function and determinations of arterial blood gases and direct arterial blood pressure monitoring are used only in special cardiovascular or respiratory problems. 6. a. Hypoxemia occurs with atelectasis and aspiration as well as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and bronchospasm. Hypercapnia is caused by decreased removal of CO 2 from the respiratory system that could occur with airway obstruction or hypoventilation. Hypoventilation may occur with depression of central respiratory drive, poor respiratory muscle tone due to disease or anesthesia, mechanical restriction, or pain. Airway obstruction could occur with the tongue blocking the airway, restrained thick secretions, laryngospasm, or laryngeal edema. 7. d. An unconscious or semiconscious patient should be placed in a lateral position to protect the airway from obstruction by the tongue. Deep breathing and elevation of the head of the bed are implemented to facilitate gas exchange when the patient is responsive. Oxygen administration is often used but the patient must first have a patent airway. 8. c. Incisional pain is often the greatest deterrent to patient participation in effective ventilation and ambulation and adequate and regular analgesic medications should be provided to encourage these activities. Controlled breathing may help the patient to manage pain but does not promote coughing and deep breathing. Explanations and use of an incentive spirometer help to gain patient participation but are more effective if pain is controlled. 9. c. Hypotension with normal pulse and skin assessment is typical of residual vasodilating effects of anesthesia and requires continued observation. An oxygen saturation of 88% indicates hypoxemia, whereas a narrowing pulse pressure accompanies hypoperfusion. A urinary output >30 mL/hr is desirable and indicates normal renal function. 10. a. The most common cause of emergence delirium is hypoxemia and initial assessment should evaluate respiratory function. When hypoxemia is ruled out, other causes, such as a distended bladder, pain, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances, should be considered. Delayed awakening may result from neurologic injury and cardiac dysrhythmias most often result from specific respiratory, electrolyte, or cardiac problems. 11. a. During hypothermia, oxygen demand is increased and metabolic processes slow down. Oxygen therapy is used to treat the increased demand for oxygen. Antidysrhythmics and vasodilating drugs would be used only if the hypothermia caused symptomatic cardiac dysrhythmias and vasoconstriction. Sedatives and analgesics are not indicated for hypothermia. 12. c. On initial assessment in PACU the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) status is assessed using a standardized tool that usually includes consciousness, respiration, oxygen saturation, circulation, and activity. Increased or decreased respiratory rate, hypertension, and a SaO 2 below 90% indicate inadequate oxygenation that will be treated or managed in the PACU before discharging the patient to the next phase. 13. b, d, e, f. These problems are improved with ambulation. Other collaborative problems could be potential complications: urinary retention, atelectasis, and pneumonia. 14. c. The stress response causes fluid retention during the first 1 to 3 days postoperatively and fluid overload is possible during this time. Fluid retention results from secretion and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary and activation The RAAS increases aldosterone release, which also increases fluid retention. Aldosterone causes renal potassium loss with possible hypokalemia and blood coagulation is enhanced by cortisol. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 347 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 15. c. Slo w progression to ambulation by slowly changing the patient's position will help to prevent syncope. Monitoring vital signs after walking will not prevent or treat syncope. Monitor the patient's pulse and blood pressure (BP) before, during, and after position changes. Elevate the patient's head, then slowly have the patient dangle, then stand by the bed to help determine if the patient is safe for walking. Eating will not have an effect on syncope. Deep breathing and coughing will not decrease syncope, although it will prevent respiratory complications. 16. c, e. The nasog astric tube and gastrointestinal tube drain gastric contents. The T-tube drains bile, the Hemovac drains blood from a surgical site, and the indwelling catheter drains urine from the bladder. 17. d. Bile is drained by a T -tube, urine is drained by an indwelling urinary catheter, and gastric contents are drained by a nasogastric tube or a gastrointestinal tube. 18. a. 2; b . 5; c. 4; d. 1; e. 3. The nurse must be aware of drains, if used, and the type of surgery to help predict the expected drainage. Dressings over surgical sites are initially removed by the surgeon unless otherwise specified and should not be changed, although reinforcing the dressing is appropriate. Some drainage is expected for most surgical wounds and the drainage should be evaluated and recorded to establish a baseline for continuing assessment. The surgeon should be notified of excessive drainage. Dressings will then be changed as ordered with assessment for infection being done as well. 19. d. During the f irst 24 to 48 postoperative hours, temperature elevations to 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are a result of the inflammatory response to surgical stress. Dehydration and lung congestion or atelectasis in the first 2 days will cause a temperature elevation above 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Wound infections usually do not become evident until 3 to 5 days postoperatively and manifest with temperatures above 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C). 20. d. Before administering all analgesic medications, the nurse should first assess the nature and intensity of the patient's pain to determine if the pain is expected, prior doses of the medication have been effective, and any undesirable side effects are occurring. The administration of PRN analgesic medication is based on the nursing assessment. If possible, pain medication should be in effect during painful activities but activities may be scheduled around medication administration. 21. c. All postoperati ve patients need discharge instructions regarding what to expect and what self-care can be assumed during recovery. Diet, activities, follow-up care, symptoms to report, and instructions about medications are individualized to the patient. Case Study 1. Priority nursing actions for this patient are orienting as the patient recovers from the sedating medication, promoting voiding, and providing oral fluids and intake. 2. Syncope is possible because of the ef fects of the drug and instrumentation of the bladder. The patient should be slowly progressed to ambulation by elevating the head of the bed, then dangling the legs, and then standing at the side of the bed before attempting ambulation. 3. Inability to v oid is the most likely problem. The patient could also have respiratory depression or unstable vital signs because of the effects of the drugs or have complications such as bladder bleeding. 4. The nurse can determine this by using standard discharge criteria for PACUs\u2014stable vital signs, oxygen saturation >90%, awake and oriented, no excessive bleeding or drainage, and no respiratory depression\u2014in addition to the specific criteria ordered for this patient. 5. In an outpatient setting, the patient also needs to be alert and ambulatory with the ability to provide self-care near the level of preoperative functioning. Postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting must be controlled and the patient must be accompanied by an adult to drive her home. No opioids should have been given for 30 minutes before discharge. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Impaired urinary elimination related to bladder irritation Acute pain related to bladder irritation Risk for infection related to incomplete bladder emptying Risk for injury related to sedation Collaborative problems:Potential complications: hemorrhage, infection CHAPTER 21 lens; b . pupil; c. cornea; k. vitreous cavity; l. optic nerve; m. optic disc 2. d. The zonule connects the lens to the ciliary body . The cornea is a transparent external structure that is responsible for the majority of light refraction needed for clear vision. Aqueous humor fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the anterior cavity of the eye. 3. c. The lens bends light rays so the y fall on the retina. Aqueous humor is produced from capillary blood in the ciliary body. Rods are the photoreceptor cells stimulated in dim lighting. 4. c. The junction of the e yelids is the medial and lateral canthi. The optic disc is the point where the optic nerve leaves the eyeball. The puncta drain the tears to the lacrimal canals. 5. c. The pupil is the opening of the iris, the cones are photo - receptors sensitive to color in bright light, and the canal of Schlemm is the drainage path for aqueous humor. 6.

With the right eye, the patient standing at 20 feet from a Snellen chart can read to the 40-foot line on the chart with two or fewer errors; with the left eye, the patient can read only to the 50-foot line on the chart. This patient can read at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can read at 40 and 50 feet. 11. d. PERRLA means pupils equal (in size), round, and react to light (pupil constricts when light shines into same eye and also constricts in the opposite eye) and accommodation (pupils constrict with focus on near object).

The use of corticosteroids has been associated with the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Use of oral hypoglycemic agents alerts the nurse to the presence of diabetes and risk for diabetic retinopathy. Antihistamine and decongestant drugs may cause eye dryness. -Adrenergic blocking agents may cause additive effects in patients with glaucoma for whom these medications may be prescribed.

A normal yellowish hue to the normally white sclera is found in dark-pigmented persons and in older adults. Infants and some older adults may exhibit a normal blue cast to the sclera because of thin sclera. Iris color does not affect the color of the sclera and infections of the eye may cause dilation of small blood vessels in the normally clear bulbar conjunctiva, reddening the sclera and conjunctiva. 14. b . Fluorescein is a dye that is used topically to identify corneal irregularities; irregularities stain a bright green on application of the dye. A tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure. Light from either a penlight or an ophthalmoscope often is not able to illuminate corneal injuries. 15. a, c. Ptosis is drooping of the upper lid. Blepharitis is redness, swelling, and crusting along the lid margins. Strabismus is seen with extraocular muscle assessment. Anisocoria is pupils that are unequal. See Table 21-5. The pinna is the outer part of the ear. 16. c. Photophobia (light intolerance) is seen with inflammation or infection of the cornea or anterior uveal tract. Anisocoria is seen with central nervous system disorders, although some people normally have a slight difference in pupil size. Stabismus is seen with overaction or underaction of one or more extraocular muscles. 17. c. A break in the retina an ywhere in the eye is abnormal and indicates a potential loss of vision. Depression of the center of the optic disc and blurring of the optic disc at the nasal border are normal findings. Pieces of liquefied vitreous are \"floaters\" and are a normal finding in older adults and others. 18. b . Although fluorescein dye can be used topically to identify corneal lesions, in angiography the dye is injected intravenously and outlines the vasculature of the retina, locating areas of retinopathy. Intraocular pressure is measured indirectly with a tonometer and a keratometry is measurement of the corneal curvature. 19. d. The receptor or gan for hearing is the cochlea. It contains the organ of Corti, whose tiny hair cells respond to stimulation according to pitch. The ossicular chain moves and transmits sound waves to the oval window. 20. c. The eustachian tube equalizes air pressure between the middle ear and the throat. The other options have nothing to do with the eustachian tube. The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) transmits sound stimuli to the brain. The tympanic membrane sets the bones (ossicles) in motion. The semicircular canals are the organ of balance. 21. a, c, f. Increased hair gro wth occurs but this does not cause hearing loss. The vestibular apparatus is less effective. There is a decrease in blood supply, which decreases cochlear efficiency. 22. d. Presbycusis is a sensorineural hearing loss that occurs with aging and is associated with decreased ability to hear high-pitched sounds. Tinnitus is present in some, but not all, cases of presbycusis. A sensation of fullness in the ears is related to a blocked eustachian tube and difficulty understanding the meaning of words is associated with a central hearing loss occurring with problems arising from the cochlea to the cerebral cortex. 23. 24. a. The tympanic retraction indicates ne gative pressure in the middle ear. The lack of landmarks and a bulging eardrum describe acute otitis media. Straightening the ear canal by pulling the auricle downward and backward describes otoscope use for children; for adults the auricle is pulled upward and backward to insert the otoscope. 25. a, d, f. Positi ve Rinne test, Weber lateralization to the good ear, and inner ear or nerve pathway pathology indicate sensorineural hearing loss. Negative Rinne test, Weber lateralization to impaired ear, and external or middle ear pathology indicate conductive hearing loss. 26. b . Hearing is most sensitive between 500 and 4000 Hz and a 10-dB loss is not significant at 8000 Hz. A 40- to 45-dB loss in the frequency between 4000 and 8000 Hz will cause difficulty in distinguishing high-pitched consonants. A hearing aid is rarely recommended for a hearing loss of less than 26 dB, and problems in everyday communication situations occur only when the thresholds are 25 dB or higher.Question Significance Do you have a history of childhood ear infections or ruptured eardrums?Childhood middle ear infections with perforations and scarring of the eardrum lead to conductive hearing impairments in adulthood. Do you use any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications on a regular basis?Many medications are ototoxic, causing damage to the auditory nerve. OTC agents such as aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potentially ototoxic, as are prescription diuretics, antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Have you ever been treated for a head injury?A head injury can damage areas of the brain to which auditory and vestibular stimuli are transmitted, with a resultant loss of hearing or balance. Is there a history of hearing loss in your parents?Some congenital hearing disorders are hereditary and the age of onset of presbycusis also follows a familial pattern. Have you been exposed to excessive noise levels in your work or recreational activities?It is well documented that exposure to loud noises causes damage to the auditory organs and hearing loss. Noise exposure earlier in life also can result in increased hearing loss with age. Has the amount of scial activities you are involved in changed?Persons with hearing loss may withdraw from social relationships because of difficulty with communication. A hearing loss often leaves the patient feeling isolated and cut off from valued relationships.350 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Response to Hearing Problem Health perception-health managementGradual or sudden hearing loss, use of protective earwear for high noise environments or with swimming Nutritional-metabolic Alcohol, sodium and dietary supplements used; changes in symptoms with food eaten; ear pain with chewing, grinding of the teeth Elimination Constipation and straining may increase intracranial pressure Activity-exercise Changes in activity related to hearing or equilibrium problems Sleep-rest Tinnitus disturbs sleep; snoring may be caused by swelling in nasopharynx, which impairs eustachian tube function and causes the sensation of ear fullness or pain Cognitive-perceptual Pain and relief methods; inability to pay attention or hear and follow directions Self-perception-self-concept Effect on personal life, feelings about self, embarrassing social situationsRole-relationship Strained family life, work, and social relationships; dangerous situations with vertigo or dizziness Sexuality-reproductive Interference with establishing or maintaining a satisfactory sexual relationship Coping-stress tolerance Denial is common with hearing problems Value-belief Values and beliefs that limit treatment options 27. b. Irrigation of the external ear with cold or warm water causes a disturbance in the endolymph that normally results in nystagmus directed opposite the side of instillation. The absence of nystagmus indicates that peripheral or central vestibular functions are impaired. An improvement in hearing would occur only if an obstruction of the ear canal was present, which would not be an indication for caloric testing. Severe pain upon irrigation would not be related to vestibular function. CHAPTER 22 Answer Key 1. a, d, e. Myopic people may have abnormally long eyeballs, not abnormally short ones, which occurs in hyperopia. Unequal corneal curvature results in astigmatism. 2. d. Absence of crystalline lens is aphakia. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylinder lens. People with myopia have abnormally long eyeballs. 3. a. A light shined at an angle over the cornea will illuminate a contact lens and fluorescein should not have to be used. Cotton balls should not be placed on the cornea and simply tensing the outer canthus will not dislodge the lens. 4. a, d, e. Refractive errors are the most common visual problem and treatment may include nonsurgical corrections such as corrective glasses and contact lenses. Surgical therapy includes LASIK, PRK, LASEK, and intraocular lens implants. 5. d. A person who is legally blind may have some usable vision that will benefit from vision enhancement techniques. A person with total blindness has no light perception and no usable vision and a person with functional blindness has the loss of usable vision but some light perception. As only 4% of blindness occurs suddenly from injuries, the grieving is probably already in process. Dependency on others from visual impairment is individual and cannot be assumed. 6. a. Address the patient, not others with the patient, in normal conversational tones.b. Face the patient and make eye contact. c. Introduce self when approaching the patient and let the patient know when you are leaving. d. Orient to sounds, activities, and physical surroundings. e. Use sighted-guide technique to ambulate and orient patient. (Other options: Do not move objects positioned by the patient without the knowledge and consent of the patient; ask the patient what help is needed and how to provide it.) 7. c. Emergency management of foreign bodies in the eye includes covering and shielding the eye, with no attempt to treat the injury, until an ophthalmologist can evaluate the injury. Irrigations are performed as emergency management in chemical exposure. Pressure should never be applied because it might further injure the eye. 8. b. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is an ocular adenoviral disease. Sebaceous glands do not exist on the cornea. 9. a. Blepharitis is inflammation of the eyelid. Hordeolum is an infection of the sebaceous glands in the lid margin. Conjunctivitis is infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva. 10. d. All infections of the conjunctiva or cornea are transmittable and frequent, thorough hand washing is essential to prevent spread from one eye to the other or to other persons. Artificial tears are not normally used in external eye infections. Photophobia is not experienced by all patients with eye infections and cold compresses are indicated for some infections. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 351 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 11. a, b, f. There are also headaches, reddened and sw ollen conjunctiva, and corneal edema. Eyelid edema, reddened sclera, and bleeding conjunctiva do not occur with endophthalmitis. 12. d. Although cataracts do become w orse with time, surgical extraction is considered an elective procedure and is usually performed when the patient decides that he or she wants or needs to see better for his or her lifestyle. There are no known measures to prevent cataract development or progression. Surgical extraction is safe but the patient will still need glasses for near vision and for any residual refractive error of the implanted lens. 13. c. The lens opacity of cataracts causes a decrease in vision, abnormal color perception, and glare. Blurred vision, halos around lights, and eye pain are characteristic of glaucoma. Light flashes, floaters, and \"cobwebs\" or \"hairnets\" in the field of vision followed by a painless, sudden loss of vision are characteristic of detached retina. 14. a. Assessment of the visual acuity in the patient' s unoperated eye enables the nurse to determine how visually compromised the patient may be while the operative eye is patched and healing and to plan for assistance until vision improves. The patch on the operative eye is usually removed within 24 hours and although vision in the eye may be good, it is not unusual for visual acuity to be reduced immediately after surgery. Activities that are thought to increase intraocular pressure, such as bending, coughing, and Valsalva maneuver, are restricted postoperatively. 15. a, d. V itrectomy is an intraocular procedure but it may be used with sclera buckling. Pneumatic retinopexy is an intraocular procedure that may be used with photocoagulation or cryotherapy. Penetrating keratoplasty is used for corneal scars or opacities and removes the cornea. 16. a. Postoperati vely the patient must position the head so that the bubble is in contact with the retinal break and may have to maintain this position for up to 16 hours a day for 5 days. The patient may go home within a few hours of surgery or may remain in the hospital for several days. No matter what the type of repair, reattachment is successful in 90% of retinal detachments. Postoperative pain is expected and is treated with analgesics. 17. b . The patient with AMD can benefit from low-vision aids despite increasing loss of vision and it is important to promote a positive outlook by not giving patients the impression that \"nothing can be done\" for them. Laser treatment may help a few patients with choroidal neovascularization and photodynamic therapy is indicated for a small percentage of patients with wet AMD but there is no treatment for the increasing deposit of extracellular debris in the retina. 18. c. V erteporfin, the dye used with photodynamic therapy to destroy abnormal blood vessels, is a photosensitizing drug that can be activated by exposure to sunlight or other high-intensity light. Patients must cover all of their skin to avoid thermal burns when exposed to sunlight. Blind spots occur with laser photocoagulation used for dry AMD. Head movements and position are not of concern following this procedure. 1 9. c. Because glaucoma de velops slowly and without symptoms, it is important that intraocular pressure be evaluated every 2 to 4 years in persons between the ages of 40 and 64 and every 1 to 2 years in those over 65 years old. More frequent measurement of intraocular pressure should be done in a patient with a family history of glaucoma, African American patients, and a patient with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The disease is chronic but vision impairment is preventable in most cases with treatment. 20. a, d, f. The other answers are associated with primary angle- closure glaucoma (PACG). 21. a, c, e, f. The other answers are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). 22. 23. b . Patients receiving ototoxic drugs should be monitored for tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo to prevent further damage caused by the drugs. Ears should not be cleaned with anything but a washcloth and finger and ear protection should be used in any environment with noise levels above 90 dB. Exposure to the rubella virus during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy may cause fetal deafness and the vaccine should never be given during pregnancy. 24. a. 5; b . 4; c. 3; Adv anced age; use of three potentially ototoxic drugs (aspirin, quinidine, and furosemide) 26. d. Antibiotic eardrops for e xternal otitis should be applied without touching the auricle to avoid contaminating the dropper and the solution and the patient should hold the ear upward for several minutes to allow the drops to run down the canal. The drops may be placed onto an ear wick that is placed in the canal but it remains in the ear throughout the course of treatment. The use of lubricating eardrops followed by irrigation is performed for impacted cerumen. \"Swimmer's ear\" is best prevented by avoiding swimming in contaminated waters; prophylactic antibiotics are not used. 27. c, e. Antibiotics are used to treat acute otitis media. Both acute and chronic otitis media occur in the middle ear. A cholesteatoma may destroy structures in the middle ear or invade the dura of the brain. 28. a. Otosclerosis is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that causes fixation of the footplate of the stapes, leading to conductive hearing loss. Tuning fork testing Drug Rationale for Use Betaxolol An adrenergic blocking agent that decreases aqueous humor production Dipivefrin An adrenergic agonist that decreases the production of aqueous humor and enhances outflow facility Carbachol A cholinergic agent that stimulates iris sphincter contraction, leading to miosis and opening of the trabecular network, increasing aqueous outflow A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor decreases aqueous production352 TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. in conductive hearing loss would result in a negative Rinne test and lateralization to the poor ear or the ear with greater hearing loss upon Weber testing. During a stapedectomy, the patient often reports an immediate improvement in hearing but the hearing level decreases temporarily postoperatively. 29. b. Stimulation of the labyrinth intraoperatively may cause postoperative dizziness, increasing the risk for falls. Nystagmus on lateral gaze may result from perilymph disturbances but does not constitute a risk for injury. A tympanic graft is not performed in a stapedectomy, nor is postoperative tinnitus common. 30. a, c, d. Vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss are the triad of symptoms that occur with inner ear problems. 31. b. Nursing care should minimize vertigo by keeping the patient in a quiet, dark environment. Movement aggravates the whirling and roaring sensations and the patient should be moved only for essential care. Fluorescent lights or television flickering may also increase vertigo and should be avoided. Side rails should be raised when the patient is in bed but padding is not indicated. 32. c. The benign acoustic neuroma can compress the facial nerve and arteries in the internal auditory canal and may expand into the cranium but if removed when small, hearing and vestibular function can be preserved. During surgery for a tumor that has expanded into the cranium, preservation of hearing and the facial nerve is reduced. 33. b, c, e, f. The remaining answers are characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss. 34. a, c, e. The remaining answers are characteristics of conductive hearing loss. 35. c. Initial adjustment to a hearing aid should include voices and household sounds and experimenting with volume in a quiet environment. The next recommended exposure is small parties; the outdoors; and, finally, uncontrolled areas, such as shopping areas. Case Study 1. Her race, her family history of glaucoma, and her increasing age place her at a high risk for glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans and in older persons, 1 in 10 African Americans has glaucoma. African Americans in every age category should have examinations more often than persons without risk factors because of the increased incidence and more aggressive course of glaucoma in these individuals. Glaucoma may have no symptoms until visual impairment occurs, resulting from increased intraocular ischemic pressure on the retina and optic nerve. 2. Appropriate hand washing and aseptic technique should be used to administer the eyedrops. To prevent systemic absorption of the drug this patient should use punctal occlusion, as she already uses one -adrenergic blocker (metoprolol) for her hypertension and systemic absorption of the betaxolol could cause additive effects. 3. The antihistamine comes into question because of its anticholinergic effects. It is allowed because A.G. has open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with no abnormal angle on gonioscopy. In angle-closure glaucoma, the drug is contraindicated because anticholinergic effects of the antihistamine would dilate the pupil, obstructing an already narrowed angle. 4. No, because glaucoma is a chronic disease with no cure. It can be controlled with medication and some surgical interventions but it cannot be cured. 5. Alternatives to topical therapy for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) include a trabeculoplasty that opens outflow channels in the trabecular meshwork; a trabeculectomy, in which part of the iris and trabecular meshwork are removed; or cyclocryotherapy, in which parts of the ciliary body are destroyed, decreasing production of aqueous humor. 6. Optic disc cupping with the disc becoming wider, deeper, and paler occurs with progression of glaucoma. Visual complaints with increasing damage include increasing peripheral visual-field loss with eventual tunnel vision and loss of sight. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety related to potential permanent visual impairment Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of routine assessments for glaucoma Ineffective self-health management related to lack of knowledge about disease, treatment, administration of eyedrops, follow-up recommendations Collaborative problems: Potential complications: increased intraocular pressure, blindness CHAPTER 23 Answer Key 1. a. hair shaft; b. stratum corneum; c. stratum germinativum; d. epidermis 2. c. In older adults the dermis loses volume and has fewer blood vessels, which contributes to decreased extracellular water. Some older people do not drink enough fluids and this can also contribute to dry skin. In older adults there are also decreased surface lipids and apocrine and sebaceous gland activity. Increased bruising from capillary fragility does not contribute to dry skin. 3. d. A careful medication history is important because many medications cause dermatologic side effects and patients also use many over-the-counter preparations to treat skin problems. Freckles are common in childhood and are not related to skin disease. Communicable childhood illnesses are not directly related to skin problems, although varicella viruses may affect the skin in adulthood. Patterns of weight gain and loss are not significant but the presence of obesity may cause skin problems in overlapping skin areas. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 353 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 4. 5. d. It is necessary for the patient to be completely undressed for an examination of the skin. Gowns should be provided and exposure minimized as the skin is inspected generally first, followed by a lesion-specific examination. Skin temperature is best assessed with the back of the hand and turgor is best assessed with the skin over the sternum. 6. b . Discolored lesions that are caused by intradermal or subcutaneous bleeding do not blanch with pressure, whereas those caused by inflammation and dilated blood vessels will blanch and refill after palpation. Varicosities are engorged, dilated veins that may empty with pressure applied along the vein. 7. a. v esicles; b. discrete, localized to the chest and abdomen. c. color, size, and configuration 8. d. An e xcoriation is a focal loss of epidermis; it does not involve the dermis and, as such, does not scar with healing. Ulcers do penetrate into and through the dermis and scarring does occur with these deeper lesions. Epidermal and dermal thinning is atrophy of the skin but does not involve a break in skin integrity. Both excoriations and ulcers have a break in skin integrity and may develop crusts or scabs over the lesions. 9. b . A shave biopsy is done for superficial lesions that can be scraped with a razor blade, removing the full thickness of the stratum corneum. An excisional biopsy is done when the entire removal of a lesion is desired. Punch biopsies are done with larger nodules to examine for pathology, as are incisional biopsies. 10. a. A culture can be performed to distinguish among fung al, bacterial, and viral infections. A Tzanck test is specific for herpesvirus infections, potassium hydroxide slides are specific for fungal infections, and immunofluorescent studies are specific for infections that cause abnormal antibody proteins. 11. b . Telangiectasia looks like small, superficial, dilated blood vessels. A small circumscribed, flat discoloration describes a macule. A benign tumor of blood or lymph vessels describes an angioma. Tiny purple spots resulting from tiny hemorrhages describes petechiae. 12. b . Scales are excess dead epidermal cells. A pustule is a circumscribed collection of leukocytes and free fluid. Comedo is associated with acne vulgaris. 13. b . Intertrigo is dermatitis in the folds of her skin. Thickening of the skin is lichenification. Loss of color in diffuse areas of skin is vitiligo. A firm plaque caused by fluid in the dermis is a wheal. CHAPTER 24 Answer Key 1. a, e, f. V itamin A, not vitamin C, is critical in maintaining and repairing the structure of epithelial cells. Exposure to UVB rays, not UV A rays, is believed to be the most important factor in the development of skin cancer. Sunscreen, not topical hydrocortisone, can block the photosensitivity caused by various drugs. 2 . b, c, d. Actinic and f irm lesions are actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma frequently occurs in previously damaged skin. 3 . b . Actinic keratosis is an irregularly shaped, with indistinct borders and an overlying hard keratotic scale or horn. Malignant melanoma tumors arise in melanocytes. Malignant melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer and has an increased risk in people with dysplastic nevus syndrome. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of keratinizing epidermal cells. 4 . a. Basal cell carcinoma is noduloulcerati ve with pearly borders. Malignant melanoma tumors arise in melanocytes. Malignant melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer and has an increased risk in people with dysplastic nevus syndrome. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of keratinizing epidermal cells. 5. d. Dysplastic ne vus syndrome involves atypical moles with irregular borders and various shades of color. 6. Asymmetry: one half unlike the other half; Border: irregular and poorly circumscribed; Color: varied within lesion; Diameter: larger than 6 mm; Evolving: look and appearance is changing Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Patient Response to Skin Problem Health perception-health managementPoor skin hygiene; excessive or unprotected sun exposure; family history of alopecia, ichthyosis, psoriasis; history of skin cancer Nutritional-metabolic Decreased intake of vitamins A, D, E, or C; malnutrition; food allergies; obesity Elimination Incontinence; fluid imbalances Activity-exercise Exposure to carcinogens or chemical irritants Sleep-rest Itching that interferes with sleep Cognitive-perceptual Pain; decreased perception of heat, cold, and touch Self-perception-self-concept Feelings of rejection, prejudice, loss of self-esteem, and decreased body imageRole-relationship Exposure to irritants and allergens; altered relationships with others Sexuality-reproductive Changes in sexual intimacy because of appearance, pain Coping-stress tolerance Skin problems exacerbated by stress Value-belief High social value placed on appearance and skin condition with tanning, use of cosmetics354 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 7. b. Thirty years ago, when the patient was a teenager, radiation therapy was used to treat cystic acne with the result that many of these patients now have developed basal cell carcinoma. For a person with dark skin, radiation therapy is a higher risk factor for skin cancer than exposure to the sun or other irritants. 8. b, c. In the early stages, surgical excision with a margin of normal skin is the initial treatment for malignant melanoma. Mohs' surgery can also be used to treat malignant melanoma. Radiation may be used after excision for malignant melanoma, depending on staging of the disease. Topical nitrogen mustard may be used for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 9. a. chronic disease; b. obesity; c. recent antibiotic therapy; d. recent corticosteroid therapy 10. d. A plantar wart is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). A furuncle is a deep skin infection with staphylococci around the hair follicle. A carbuncle is multiple, interconnecting furuncles. Erysipelas is the dermis. 11. b. Seborrheic keratoses are irregularly round or oval shaped and are often verrucous papules or plaques. Candidiasis is a white patchy yeast infection. Cellulitis is a deep inflammation of subcutaneous tissue. Psoriasis is an excessive turnover of epithelial cells. 12. a. In scabies mites penetrate the skin and deposits eggs. An allergic reaction can result from the presence of eggs, feces, and mite parts. Impetigo involves vesiculopustular lesions that develop a thick, honey-colored crust surrounded by erythema. Folliculitis is a small pustule at the hair follicle opening with minimal erythema. Pediculosis is lice. 13. c, e, f. Patients who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk for candidiasis (a fungal infection), herpes simplex 1 (caused by a virus), and Kaposi sarcoma (vascular lesions on the skin, mucous membranes, and viscera with wide range of presentation). The other options are not at increased risk with immunosuppression. Acne is caused by inflammation of sebaceous glands. Lentigo (also called \"liver spots\" or \"age spots\") is caused by an increased number of normal melanocytes in the basal layer of epidermis. Herpes zoster, which is caused by an activation of the varicella-zoster virus, is a group of vesicles and pustules resembling chickenpox located in a linear distribution along a dermatome. 14. b. Urticaria is inflammation and edema in the upper dermis, most commonly caused by histamine released during an antibody-allergen reaction. The best treatment for all types of allergic dermatitis is avoidance of the allergen. Sunlight and warmth would increase the edema and inflammation. Antihistamines may be used for an acute outbreak but not to prevent the dermatitis. Topical benzene hexachloride is used to treat pediculosis. 15. a. Pediculosis (head lice and body lice) causes very small, red, noninflammatory lesions that progress to papular wheal-like lesions and cause severe itching. Lice live on the body as nits (tiny white eggs) that are firmly attached to hair shafts on the head and body. Burrows, especially in interdigital webs, are found with scabies. 16. c. A lotion is a suspension of insoluble powders in water, which has cooling and drying properties, useful when itching is present. Creams and ointments have an oil and water base that lubricates and protects skin whereas a paste is a mixture of powder and ointment. 17. d. Psoralen is absorbed by the lens of the eye and eyewear that blocks 100% of UV light must be used for 24 hours after taking the medication. Because UV A penetrates glass, the eyewear must also be worn indoors when near a bright window. Psoralen does not affect the accommodative ability of the eye. 18. 19. a. 4; b. 1, 2, 3, 5; c. 1, 3; d. 2, 3, 6; e. 2, 3, 6 20. a. Dressings used to treat pruritic lesions should be cool to cause vasoconstriction and to have an antiinflammatory effect. Water is most commonly used and it does not need to be sterile. Acetic acid solutions are bacteriocidal and are used to treat skin infections. 21. b. Tepid or warm solutions should be used when the purpose is debridement and saline is a common debridement solution. Baths are appropriate for debridement but sodium bicarbonate and oatmeal are used for pruritus. 22. 23. b. Defining characteristics for body image problems include verbalization of self-disgust and reluctance to look at lesions, as evidenced in this patient. Social isolation is indicated only if there is evidence of decreased social activities and of anxiety by verbalization of anxiety or frustration. Ineffective self-health management is indicated by evidence of a lack of self-care or understanding of the disease process. 24. a. Lichenification is thickening of the skin caused by chronic scratching or rubbing and can be prevented by controlling itching. It is not an infection, nor is it contagious, as the other options indicate. 25. a. Improvement of body image is the most common reason for undergoing cosmetic surgery; appearance is an important part of confidence and self-assurance. Acne scars, pigmentation problems, and wrinkling can be treated with cosmetic surgery but the surgery does not prevent the skin changes associated with aging.Medication Nursing Instruction Topical antibiotics Clean skin; no occlusive dressings Topical corticosteroids Diagnosis of the lesion first; thin layers; massage at prescribed frequency Systemic antihistaminesAdvise of side effects and risks associated with driving or operating heavy machinery Topical fluorouracil Avoid sunlight; causes photosensitivity; warn patient that it will cause painful, eroded dermatitis before healing Intervention Rationale Cool environment VasoconstrictionTopical menthol, camphor, or phenolDecreased inflammation and blood flow, numbing of itch receptor Soaks and baths Vasoconstriction and stopping itch sensation ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 355 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 26. d. A f acelift is used for preauricular lesions and redundant soft tissue reduction. Liposuction is used for obesity with subcutaneous fat accumulation. 2 7. a. Skin flaps as grafts include mo ving skin and subcutaneous tissue to another part of the body and are used to cover wounds with poor vascular beds, add padding, and cover wounds over cartilage and bone. Both types of free grafts include just skin and soft tissue extension involves placement of an expander under the skin, which stretches the skin over time to provide extra skin to cover the desired area. 2 8. b . The appearance of candidiasis on the skin shows diffuse papular erythematous rash with pinpoint satellites around the affected area. Height and weight could show if the patient is obese but it would be better to ask if the areas affected are moist. The chemotherapy could contribute to candidiasis but it does not matter if the chemotherapy treatments are finished. Culture and sensitivity of the area may be ordered by the physician at the patient's appointment. 2 9. a, d, e, f. Glucocorticoid e xcess can cause acne and decreased subcutaneous fat over the extremities. Diabetes mellitus can cause erythematous plaques of the shins and both the corticosteroids and diabetes can impair or delay wound healing. Increased sweating is seen with hyperthyroidism and coarse, brittle hair is seen with hypothyroidism. Case Study 1. The nurse w ould assess the size and depth of the injury, what the knife was being used for before the patient cut himself, and whether the patient had problems like this in the past. 2. W .B. should have cleansed the wound with soap and water and sought medical care for cleaning and suturing. A sterile dressing should have been applied and the arm should have been elevated to reduce edema. 3. Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus are the usual etiologies of this type of infection. 4 . Systemic antibiotics will be necessary and w arm, moist packs or dressings should be used to help localize the infection. Hospitalization will be necessary if it becomes severe. 5. If treatment is not initiated and maintained, g angrene of the extremity and possible septicemia could occur. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Impaired skin integrity related to trauma Acute pain related to inflammatory process Hyperthermia related to inflammatory process Readiness for enhanced coping related to self-care post injury Deficient knowledge related to self-care post injury Collaborative problems:Potential complications: gangrene, septicemia CHAPTER 25 Answer Key 1. b . An electrical injury causes tissue damage from intense heat generated by the electrical current passing through tissue, including muscle contractions that can fracture long bones and vertebrae. Myoglobin is released into the circulation when massive muscle damage occurs. The electric shock even can cause cardiac standstill or dysrhythmias as well as delayed dysrhythmias during the first 24 hours after injury. 2. d, e. W ith chemical burns, removing the chemical from the skin is important. Lavaging the skin for 20 minutes to 2 hours post exposure may be needed. Alkali tends to adhere to skin and causes prolonged damage with protein hydrolysis and liquefaction. Metabolic asphyxiation is from the inhalation of carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide. Metabolic acidosis is most common in electrical burns, as is the \"iceberg effect\" of tissue injury below the skin. 3. a. Dry , waxy white, leathery, or hard skin is characteristic of full-thickness burns in the emergent phase and it may turn brown and dry in the acute phase. Deep partial-thickness burns in the emergent phase are red and shiny and have blisters. Edema may not be as extensive in full-thickness burns because of thrombosed vessels. 4. a. 3\u00bd + 1 + 6\u00bd + 2 + 1\u00bd + 3\u00bd = 18% TBSA 4\u00bd = 22\u00bd% TBSA c. No, because edema and inflammation obscure the demarcation of zones of injury. 5. a. 2; b . 4; c. 3; d. 1. The first intervention in emergency management of a burn injury is to remove the burn source and stop the burning process. Airway maintenance would be second, then establishing IV access, followed by assessing for other injuries. 6. b . The emergent phase is usually 24 to 72 hours after the time the burn occurred and focuses on fluid resuscitation. The acute phase is after the emergent phase and may last weeks to months after the burn occurred but begins when the extracellular fluid is mobilized and diuresis occurs. There is no postacute phase. The rehabilitative phase begins weeks to months after the injury, when the wounds have healed and the patient participates in self-care. 7. a. W ith increased capillary permeability, water, sodium, and plasma proteins leave the plasma and move into the interstitial spaces, decreasing serum sodium and albumin. Serum potassium is elevated because injured cells and hemolyzed red blood cells (RBCs) release potassium from cells. An elevated hematocrit is caused by water loss into the interstitium, creating a hemoconcentration. 8. a. Although all of the selections add to the h ypovolemia that occurs in the emergent burn phase, the initial and most pronounced effect is caused by fluid shifts out of the blood vessels as a result of increased capillary permeability. 9. c. Burn injury causes widespread impairment of the immune system, with impaired WBC functioning, bone marrow depression, and a decrease in circulating immunoglobulins, which allows microorganisms to grow. 10. b . Shivering often occurs in a patient with a burn as a result of chilling that is caused by heat loss, anxiety, or pain. Severe pain is not common in full-thickness burns, nor is unconsciousness unless other factors are present. Fever is a sign of infection in later burn phases. 11. d. In circumferential b urns, circulation to the extremities can be severely impaired and pulses should be monitored closely for signs of obstruction by edema. Swelling of the arms would be expected but it becomes dangerous when it occludes blood vessels. Pain and eschar are also expected. 1 2. c. P atients with major injuries involving burns to the face and neck require intubation within 1 to 2 hours after burn injury to prevent the need for emergency tracheostomy, which is done if symptoms of upper respiratory obstruction occur. Carbon monoxide poisoning is treated with 100% oxygen and eschar constriction of the chest is treated with an escharotomy.356 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

When the patient's wounds are exposed with the open method, the staff must wear caps, masks, gowns, and gloves. Sterile water is not necessary in the debridement tank and topical antiinfective agents should be applied with sterile gloves. If some dressings are used with the open method, they are removed and wounds are washed with clean gloves. 15. a. Morphine is the drug of choice for pain control and during the emergent phase it should be administered IV because GI function is impaired and IM injections will not be absorbed adequately. 16. b. The patient with large burns often develops paralytic ileus within a few hours and a nasogastric tube is inserted and connected to low, intermittent suction. After GI function returns, feeding tubes may be used for nutritional supplementation and H 2 histamine blockers may be used to prevent Curling's ulcers. Free water is not given to drink because of the potential for water intoxication. 17. c. Patients with ear burns are not allowed to use pillows because of the danger of the burned ear sticking to the pillowcase and patients with neck burns are not allowed to use pillows because contractures of the neck can occur. 18. b, c, e. There is a hypermetabolic state proportional to the size of the burn, which increases the core temperature. Massive catabolism can occur and lead to malnutrition and delayed healing without adequate calorie and protein supplementation. The electrolyte imbalance has more effect on the fluid resuscitation than the nutritional needs. 19. c. At the end of the emergent phase, fluid mobilization moves potassium back into the cells and sodium returns to the vascular space, causing hypokalemia and hypernatremia. As diuresis in the acute phase continues, sodium will be lost in the urine and potassium will continue to be low unless it is replaced. Excessive fluid replacement with 5% dextrose in water without potassium supplementation can cause hyponatremia with hypokalemia. Prolonged hydrotherapy and free oral water intake can cause a decrease in both sodium and potassium. 20. b. The limited ROM in this situation is related to the patient's inability or reluctance to exercise the joints because of pain and the appropriate intervention is to help control the pain so that exercises can be performed. The patient is probably never without some pain and although exercises and enlisting the help of the physical therapist are important, neither of these interventions addresses the cause. 21. a. Early signs of sepsis include an elevated temperature and increased pulse and respiratory rate accompanied by decreased blood pressure and, later, decreased urine output and perhaps paralytic ileus. A burn wound may become locally infected without causing sepsis. 22. 23. a. cultured epithelial autograft. b. eschar (or necrotic tissue); autograft. c. aspirating the fluid with a tuberculosis syringe, performed by individuals instructed in this skill. 24. a. Midazolam is useful when patients' anticipation of the pain experience increases their pain because it causes a short-term memory loss and, if given before a dressing change, the patient will not recall the event. A dosage range of morphine is useful, as is patient-controlled analgesia, but seldom will these doses effectively relieve the discomfort of dressing changes. Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist/antagonist and cannot be used with other opioids. 25. a. Pressure garments help to keep scars flat and prevent elevation and enlargement above the original burn injury area. Lotions and splinting are used to prevent contractures. Avoidance of sunlight is necessary for at least 3 months to prevent hyperpigmentation and sunburn injury to healed burn areas. 26. c. There is tremendous psychologic impact with a burn injury. Open communication with caregivers, close friends, and the burn team about fears regarding loss of life as she once knew it, loss of function, temporary or permanent deformity and disfigurement, return to routine life, financial burdens, rehabilitation, and her future are all essential. Simply convincing her to have the wound cared for ignores her psychologic, emotional, and perhaps spiritual needs. 27. a. 3; b. 2; c. 1; d. 4. Face and neck burns are frequently associated with airway inhalation. Therefore this patient requires airway assessment (priority = ABCs). Severe pain would be the next priority (high physiologic need). The patient returning from the PACU will need to be seen soon to assess vital signs, level of consciousness, IV fluids, and wounds. However, at the current time the transport personnel should be with her. The 18-year-old is not at risk related to ABCs and it will probably take a few minutes to talk with him about why he doesn't want to go for the dressing change. Case Study 1. Discharge planning should be initiated soon after admission, when D.K. is stabilized. Resuming a functional role in society and accomplishing functional and cosmetic reconstruction are the end goals toward which all care is directed. The nurse should coordinate the discharge process with the whole health care team involved with D.K.'s care: the health care provider, physical and occupational therapists, dietitian, home care nurses, and counselors. 2. D.K will continue to need a high-calorie, high-protein diet but not to the same extent as during the acute phase. She should be taught about her diet as well as to monitor for unwanted weight gain and reduce calories as indicated. She may also have a functional disability in feeding herself and may need padded utensils or special assistive devices. 3. D.K. will need to continue the splinting and exercise routine diligently until healing is complete, probably for at least a year. 4. It should be emphasized that exercise and performance of activities of daily living will decrease the tightness and limitation of movement.

All rights reserved. goals with D.K. that can be measured or have her identify a few activities she wants most to do that are realistic and work toward success with those. D.K. is receiving a secondary gain from her husband in her dependence and regression and the nurse should help her husband to see the importance of her reestablishing independence and enlist his help in coaching the patient with exercises. 5 . The staf f should provide information and expected outcomes related to the healing of her injuries to both D.K. and her husband. Encourage both D.K. and her husband to participate in D.K.'s care and have them identify how care can be managed at home. Let them know that it is possible to maintain contact with hospital personnel after discharge to answer questions and provide support. A visiting nurse may also be ordered to assist them in adapting to the burn care at home. 6. D.K. and her f amily may experience a wide range of emotional responses\u2014fear, anxiety, anger, guilt, and depression\u2014and D.K. may be very concerned about her children's reactions to the appearance of her injuries. Encourage D.K.'s expression of negative feelings and fears while still hospitalized. Arranging for short visits by her children while she is still hospitalized and while the visits can be controlled would be helpful. Preparation of the family can also be enhanced by helping all family members to become aware of routines and activities that will need to be continued during rehabilitation. 7. The procedures for dressing changes and graft care should be formally demonstrated to D.K. and her husband with time for them to practice and return the demonstrations. It is most likely that the husband will need be involved because D.K. will be unable to manage applying dressings to her hands. Referral to home care nurses is essential for follow-up and evaluation when the patient is discharged to ensure that rehabilitation is continuing. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Grieving related to impact of injury on appearance, relationships, and lifestyle Anxiety related to appearance Interrupted family processes related to altered health status of family member Self-care deficit related to inability or unwillingness to participate in self-care Ineffective self-health management related to insufficient knowledge of wound care and follow-up care Situational low self-esteem related to effects of burn on appearance, increased dependence on others, and disruption of lifestyle and role responsibilities Risk for disuse syndrome related to effects of immobility Collaborative problems:Potential complications: skin graft rejection, infection, contractures CHAPTER 26 Answer Key 1. a. 9; b . 6; c. 7; j. 13; k. 4; l. 10; m. 11 2. b, e. This patient is older and short of breath. T o obtain the most information, auscultate the posterior to avoid breast tissue and start at the base because of her respiratory difficulty and the chance that she will tire easily. Important sounds may be missed if the other strategies are used first. 3. b . Surfactant is a lipoprotein that lowers the surface tension in the alveoli. It reduces the pressure needed to inflate the alveoli and decreases the tendency of the alveoli to collapse. The other options do not maintain inflation of the alveoli. The carina is the point of bifurcation of the trachea into the right and left bronchi. Empyema is a collection of pus in the thoracic cavity. The thoracic cage is formed by the ribs and protects the thoracic organs. 4 . c. Alv eolar sacs are terminal structures of the respiratory tract where gas exchange takes place. The visceral pleura lines the lungs and forms a closed, double-walled sac with the parietal pleura. Turbinates warm and moisturize inhaled air. The 150 mL of air is dead space in the trachea and bronchi. 5. b . The epiglottis is a small flap closing over the larynx during swallowing. The trachea separates the larynx and the bronchi. The turbinates warm and moisturize inhaled air. The parietal pleura is a membrane that lines the chest cavity. 6. a. Normal f indings in arterial blood gases (ABGs) in the older adult include a small decrease in PaO2 and SaO2 but normal pH and PaCO2. No interventions are necessary for these findings. Usual PaO2 levels are expected in patients 60 years of age or younger. 7. d. Normal v enous blood gas values reflect the normal uptake of oxygen from arterial blood and the release of carbon dioxide from cells into the blood, resulting in a much lower PaO 2 and an increased PaCO2. The pH is also decreased in mixed venous blood gases because of the higher PvCO 2. Normal mixed venous blood gases also have much lower PvO2 and SvO2 than ABGs. Mixed venous blood gases are used when patients are hemodynamically unstable to evaluate the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissue and the amount of oxygen consumed by the tissues. 8 . c. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate if the probe is loose, if there is low perfusion, or when skin color is dark. Before other measures are taken, the nurse should check the probe site. If the probe is intact at the site and perfusion is adequate, an ABG analysis will be ordered by the health care provider to verify accuracy and oxygen may be administered, depending on the patient's condition and the assessment of respiratory and cardiac status. 9 . c. Poor peripheral perfusion that occurs with h ypovolemia or other types of conditions that cause peripheral vasoconstriction will cause inaccurate pulse oximetry and ABGs may need to be used to monitor oxygenation status and ventilation status in these patients. Pulse oximetry would not be affected by fever or anesthesia and is a method of monitoring arterial oxygen saturation in patients who are receiving oxygen therapy. 1 0. d. The respiratory rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure will all increase with decreased oxygenation when compared to the patient's own normal results. The position of the oximeter should also be assessed. The oxygenation status with a stress test would not assist the nurse in caring for the patient now. Hyperkalemia is not occurring and will not directly affect oxygenation initially. The SpO 2 compared with normal values will not be helpful in this older patient or in a patient with respiratory disease, as the patient's expected normal will not be the same as standard normal values. 1 1. d. An SpO2 of 88% and a PaO2 of 55 mm Hg indicate inadequate oxygenation and are the criteria for prescription of continuous oxygen therapy (see Table 26-3). These values may be adequate for patients with chronic hypoxemia if no cardiac problems occur but will affect the patients' activity tolerance.358 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 12. c. A combination of excess CO2 and H2O results in carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of cerebrospinal fluid and stimulates an increase in the respiratory rate. Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies also respond to increases in PaCO2 to stimulate the respiratory center. Excess CO2 does not increase the amount of hydrogen ions available in the body but does combine with the hydrogen of water to form an acid. 13. c. Ciliary action impaired by smoking and increased mucus production may be caused by the irritants in tobacco smoke, leading to impairment of the mucociliary clearance system. Smoking does not directly affect filtration of air, the cough reflex, or reflex bronchoconstriction but it does impair the respiratory defense mechanism provided by alveolar macrophages. 14. a, b. Decreased functional cilia and decreased force of cough from declining muscle strength cause decreased secretion clearance. The other options contribute to other age-related changes. Decreased compliance contributes to barrel chest appearance. Early small airway closure contributes to decreased PaO 2. Decreased immunoglobulin A (IgA) decreases the resistance to infection.

Dullness and hyperresonance are found in the lungs using percussion, not the other assessment techniques. 17. c, d, e. Palpation identifies tracheal deviation, limited chest expansion, and increased tactile fremitus. Stridor is identified with auscultation. Finger clubbing and accessory muscle use are identified with inspection. 18. c. To assess the extent and symmetry of chest movement, the nurse places the hands over the lower anterior chest wall along the costal margin and moves them inward until the thumbs meet at the midline and then asks the patient to breathe deeply and observes the movement of the thumbs away from each other. The palms are placed against the chest wall to assess tactile fremitus. To determine the tracheal position, the nurse places the index fingers on either side of the trachea just above the suprasternal notch and gently presses backward. 19. b. An increased AP diameter is characteristic of a barrel chest, in which the AP diameter is about equal to the side-to-side diameter. Normally the AP diameter should be one third to one half the side-to-side diameter. A prominent protrusion of the sternum is the pectus carinatum and diminished movement of the two sides of the chest indicates decreased chest excursion. Lack of lung expansion caused by kyphosis of the spine results in shallow breathing with decreased chest expansion. 20. d. Bronchovesicular breath sounds are normal breath sounds when they are heard anteriorly over the mainstem bronchi on either side of the sternum and posteriorly between the scapulae. If they are heard in the peripheral lung fields, they are considered abnormal breath sounds. Adventitious lung sounds are extra abnormal sounds that include crackles, rhonchi, wheezes, and pleural friction rubs. See Table 26-7 for descriptions of these sounds. 21. a. 7; b. 6; c. 5; d. 8; e. 1; f. 2; g. 4; h. 3 22. d. A 10-mm red indurated injection site could be a positive result for a nurse as an employee in a high-risk setting. Because antibody production in response to infection with the TB bacillus may not be sufficient to produce a reaction to TB skin testing immediately after infection, two-step testing is recommended for individuals likely to be tested often, such as health care providers. An initial negative skin test should be repeated in 1 to 3 weeks and if the second test is negative, the individual can be considered uninfected. All other answers indicate a negative response to skin testing. 23. c. Samples for ABGs must be iced to keep the gases dissolved in the blood (unless the specimen is to be analyzed in <1 minute) and taken directly to the lab. The syringe used to obtain the specimen is rinsed with heparin before the specimen is taken and pressure is applied to the arterial puncture site for 5 minutes after obtaining the specimen. Changes in oxygen therapy or interventions should be avoided for 20 minutes before the specimen is drawn because these changes might alter blood gas values. 24. a. A pulmonary angiogram involves the injection of an iodine-based radiopaque dye and iodine or shellfish allergies should be assessed before injection. A bronchoscopy requires NPO status for 6 to 12 hours before the test and invasive tests (e.g., bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, biopsies) require informed consent that the physician should obtain from the patient. Nuclear scans use radioactive materials for diagnosis but the amounts are very small and no radiation precautions are indicated for the patient.

The nurse will gather the supplies as soon as the order to do a thoracentesis is given. Hopefully the family will have some time to discuss this before they are instructed to leave the room, unless it is an emergency. The patient is positioned and instructed not to talk or cough to avoid damage to the lung. Observing for hypoxia is done to keep the physician informed. Breath sounds in all lobes are verified to be sure that there was no damage to the lung. This is done before sending the sample to the lab if there is no one else who can send the sample to the lab. 26. a. The greatest chance for a pneumothorax occurs with a thoracentesis because of the possibility of lung tissue injury during this procedure. Ventilation-perfusion scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans involve injections but no manipulation of the respiratory tract is involved. Pulmonary function tests are noninvasive. 27. d. A pulmonary angiogram outlines the pulmonary vasculature and is useful to diagnose obstructions or pathologic conditions of the pulmonary vessels, such as a pulmonary embolus. The tissue changes of TB and cancer of the lung may be diagnosed by chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or PET scans. Airway obstruction is most often diagnosed with pulmonary function testing. 28. a. 3; b . 7; c. 2; d. 4; e. 5; f. 6; g. 1; h. 8 CHAPTER 27 Answer Key 1. a. Direct pressure on the entire soft lo wer portion of the nose against the nasal septum for 10 to 15 minutes is indicated for epistaxis. In addition, have the patient upright and leaning forward to prevent swallowing blood. 2. d. All of the assessments are appropriate b ut the most important is the patient's oxygen status. After the posterior nasopharynx is packed, some patients, especially older adults, experience a decrease in PaO 2 and an increase in PaCO2 because of impaired respiration and the nurse should monitor the patient's respiratory rate and rhythm and SpO2. 3. b . The most important factor in managing allergic rhinitis is identification and avoidance of triggers of the allergic reactions. Immunotherapy may be indicated if specific allergens are identified and cannot be avoided. Drug therapy is an alternative to avoidance of the allergens but long-term use of decongestants can cause rebound nasal congestion. 4. d. Dyspnea and se vere sinus pain as well as tender swollen glands, severe ear pain, or significantly worsening symptoms in a patient who has a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) indicate lower respiratory involvement and a possible secondary bacterial infection. Bacterial infections are indications for antibiotic therapy but unless symptoms of complications are present, injudicious administration of antibiotics may produce resistant organisms. Low-grade elevated temperature, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and purulent nasal drainage at the end of a cold are common symptoms of viral rhinitis and influenza. 5. a. The injected tri valent inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for individuals 6 months of age and older and those at increased risk for influenza-related complications, such as people with chronic medical conditions or those who are immunocompromised, residents of long-term care facilities, health care workers, and providers of care to at-risk persons. The live attenuated influenza vaccine is given intranasally and is recommended for all healthy people between the ages of 2 and 49 but not for those at increased risk of complications or health care providers. The immunity will not protect for several years, as new strains of influenza may develop each year. Antiviral agents will help to reduce the duration and severity of influenza in those at high risk but immunization is the best control. 6 . c. Although inadequately treated -hemolytic streptococcal infections may lead to rheumatic heart disease or glomerulonephritis, antibiotic treatment is not recommended until strep infections are definitely diagnosed with culture or antigen tests. The manifestations of viral and bacterial infections are similar and appearance is not diagnostic except when the white irregular patches on the oropharynx suggest that candidiasis is present. 7 . a, b, c. W ith partial airway obstruction, choking, stridor, use of accessory muscles, suprasternal and intercostals retraction, flaring nostrils, wheezing, restlessness, tachycardia, cyanosis, and change in level of consciousness may occur. Partial airway obstruction may progress to complete obstruction without prompt assessment and treatment. 8 . c. W ith a tracheostomy (versus an endotracheal [ET] tube), patient comfort is increased because there is no tube in the mouth. Because the tube is more secure, mobility is improved. The ET tube is more easily inserted in an emergency situation. It is preferable to perform a tracheostomy in the operating room because it requires careful dissection but it can be performed with local anesthetic in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in an emergency. With a cuff, tracheal pressure necrosis is as much a risk with a tracheostomy tube as with an ET tube and infection is also as likely to occur because the defenses of the upper airway are bypassed. 9. e, f. The fenestrated tracheostomy tube has openings on the outer cannula to allow air to pass over the vocal cords to allow speaking. If the steps of using the fenestrated tracheostomy tube are not completed in the correct order, severe respiratory distress may result. The cuff of the tracheostomy tube with a foam-filled cuff passively fills with air and does require pressure monitoring, although cuff integrity must be assessed daily. The speaking tracheostomy tube has two tubes attached. One tube allows air to pass over the vocal cords to enable the person to speak with the cuff inflated. 10. b . An inner cannula is a second tubing that fits inside the outer tracheostomy tube. Disposable inner cannulas are frequently used but nondisposable ones can be removed and cleaned of mucus that has accumulated on the inside of the tube. Many tracheostomy tubes do not have inner cannulas because when humidification is adequate, accumulation of mucus should not occur. 1 1. d, e, f. Changing the tracheostomy tapes or the tube too soon will be irritating to the trachea and could contribute to dislodgement of the tracheostomy tube. Suctioning should be done when increased secretions are evident in the tube to prevent the patient from severe coughing, which could cause tube dislodgement. Tracheostomy care is done every 8 hours. Keeping the patient in a semi-Fowler position will not prevent dislodgement. Keeping an extra tube at the bedside will speed reinsertion if the tracheostomy tube is dislodged but it will not prevent dislodgement.360 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 12. a, b, c. LPNs may determine the need for suctioning, suction the tracheostomy, and determine whether the patient has improved after the suctioning when caring for stable patients. They also may perform tracheostomy care using sterile technique. The patient's swallowing ability is assessed by a speech therapist, videofluoroscopy, or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluations. The RN will teach the patient about home tracheostomy care. 13. b. Cuff pressure should be monitored every 8 hours to ensure that an air leak around the cuff does not occur and that the pressure is not too high to allow adequate tracheal capillary perfusion. Respiratory therapists in some institutions will record the cuff pressure but the nurse must be able to assess cuff pressure and identify if there is a problem maintaining cuff pressure. Tracheostomy tubes are not usually changed sooner than 7 days after a tracheotomy. Mouth care should be performed a minimum of every 8 hours and more often as needed to remove dried secretions. ABGs are not routinely assessed with tracheostomy tube placement unless symptoms of respiratory distress continue. 14. a. If a tracheostomy tube is dislodged, the nurse should immediately attempt to replace the tube by grasping the retention sutures (if available) and spreading the opening. The obturator is inserted in the replacement tube, water- soluble lubricant is applied to the tip, and the tube is inserted in the stoma at a 45-degree angle to the neck. The obturator is immediately removed to provide an airway. If the tube cannot be reinserted, the health care provider should be notified and the patient should be assessed for the level of respiratory distress, positioned in semi-Fowler position, and ventilated with a manual resuscitation bag (MRB) only if necessary until assistance arrives. 15. b. The primary risk factors associated with head and neck cancers are heavy tobacco and alcohol use and family history. Chronic infections are not known to be risk factors, although cancers in patients younger than age 50 have been associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Oral cancer may cause a change in the fit of dentures but denture use is not a risk factor for oral cancer. 16. a. If laryngeal tumors are small, radiation is the treatment of choice because it can be curative and can preserve voice quality. Surgical procedures are used if radiation treatment is not successful or if larger or advanced lesions are present. 17. a. With removal of the larynx, the patient will not be able to communicate verbally and it is important to arrange with the patient a method of communication before surgery so that postoperative communication can take place. Dry mouth and stomatitis result from radiation therapy. Vigorous coughing is not encouraged immediately postoperatively and information related to community resources is usually introduced during the postoperative period. 18. a. Following a radical neck dissection, drainage tubes are often used to prevent fluid accumulation in the wound as well as possible pressure on the trachea. The patient has placement of a nasogastric tube to suction immediately after surgery, which will later be used to administer tube feedings until swallowing can be accomplished. A tracheostomy tube is in place but mechanical ventilation is usually not indicated. 19. c. A supraglottic laryngectomy involves removal of the epiglottis and false vocal cords and the removal of the epiglottis allows food to enter the trachea. Supraglottic swallowing protects the trachea from aspiration by taking a deep breath, putting the food or fluid in the mouth, swallowing while holding the breath, coughing immediately after swallowing to remove the food from the top of the vocal cord, swallowing again, then breathing. Super-supraglottic swallowing requires performance of the Valsalva maneuver before placing food in the mouth and swallowing. See Table 27-9. 20. b. Suctioning of the tracheostomy with the use of a mirror is a self-care activity taught to the patient before discharge. V oice rehabilitation is usually managed by a speech therapist or speech pathologist but the nurse should discuss the various types of voice rehabilitation and the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The laryngectomy stoma should be covered with a shield during showering and covered with light scarves or fabric when aspiration of foreign materials is likely. 21. b. Transesophageal puncture provides the most normal voice reproduction but requires a surgical fistula made between the esophagus and the trachea and possibly a valve prosthesis. Esophageal speech involves trapping air in the esophagus and releasing it to form sound but only 10% of patients can develop fluent speech with this method. The electrolarynx, whether placed in the mouth or held to the neck, allows speech that has a metallic or robotic sound. Case Study 1. Clear drainage in the nose after facial trauma may be cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that is leaking from the central nervous system following fractures of the face. Testing at the bedside or in the laboratory with strips that indicate glucose can differentiate CSF from mucus. 2. The vascularity of the face may cause excessive edema following facial trauma and surgery to repair fractures may need to be delayed until the edema subsides. 3. Airway can be maintained best by keeping F.N. in an upright position and controlling edema of the upper airway. After surgery, cold compresses and head elevation may help to decrease edema, reduce dyspnea, and minimize discomfort. F.N. may have PO fluids when awake and cold fluids will help to decrease the swelling. Activity restriction to prevent bleeding and injury include no nose blowing, swimming, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, or large facial movements. 4. Respiratory status\u2014rate, depth, and rhythm\u2014should be assessed frequently to note respiratory distress. Vital signs should be taken and observation of the surgical site for hemorrhage and edema should also be done often. 5. F.N. needs to be taught how to clean the nose and nares with cotton swabs and water or hydrogen peroxide and to apply water-soluble jelly to the nares; to continue using the external plastic splint as ordered; to report any continued drainage of serosanguineous fluid from the nose after 24 hours or any fresh bleeding; and to not use aspirin or aspirin-containing products for pain relief. F.N. should also be educated about symptoms of postoperative infection. Activity restriction to prevent bleeding and injury will be decreased as the rhinoplasty heals. 6.

Microor ganisms that cause pneumonia reach the lungs by aspiration from the nasopharynx or oropharynx, inhalation of microbes in the air, and hematogenous spread from infections elsewhere in the body. The other causes of infection do not contribute to pneumonia. 2. c. Pneumonia that has its onset in the community is usually caused by different microorganisms than pneumonia that develops related to hospitalization and treatment can be empiric\u2014based on observations and experience without knowing the exact causative organism. Frequently a causative organism cannot be identified from cultures and treatment is based on experience. 3 . b . People at risk for opportunistic pneumonia include those with altered immune responses. Pneumocystis jiroveci rarely causes pneumonia in healthy individuals but is the most common cause of pneumonia in persons with HIV disease. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) occurs in people with an impaired immune response. Medical care-associated pneumonia is frequently caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter species. Community- acquired pneumonia is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumonia. 4. a, b, f. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and medical care-associated pneumonia (MCAP) are both associated with Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumonia. Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumonia are only associated with CAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is only associated with MCAP. 5. a. 4; b . 3; c. 1; d. 2. With most pneumonia-causing organisms the inflammatory response sends increased blood flow and neutrophils to engulf the offending organisms. The alveoli are filled with extra fluid from increased blood flow and capillary permeability from surrounding vessels, which leads to hypoxia. Mucus production is increased and can further obstruct airflow. With bacterial pneumonia the alveoli fill with fluid and debris. Macrophages lyse and process the debris so that normal gas exchange returns. 6. a. Confusion possibly related to h ypoxia may be the only finding in older adults. Although CAP is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and is associated with an acute onset with fever, chills, productive cough with purulent or bloody sputum, and pleuritic chest pain, the older patient may not have classic symptoms. Other causes of pneumonia have a more gradual onset with dry, hacking cough; headache; and sore throat. A recent loss of consciousness or altered consciousness is common in those pneumonias associated with aspiration, such as anaerobic bacterial pneumonias. 7. d. Prompt treatment of pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics is important in treating bacterial and mycoplasma pneumonia and antibiotics are often administered on the basis of the history, physical examination, and a chest x-ray indicating a typical pattern characteristic of a particular organism without further testing. Sputum and blood cultures take 24 to 72 hours for results and microorganisms often cannot be identified with either Gram stains or cultures. Whether the pneumonia is community acquired or medical-care associated is more significant than the severity of symptoms. 8 . c. A sputum specimen for Gram stain and culture should be done before initiating antibiotic therapy and while waiting for the antibiotic to be delivered from the pharmacy in a hospitalized patient with suspected pneumonia and then antibiotics should be started without delay. If the sputum specimen cannot be obtained rapidly, the chest x-ray will be done to assess the typical pattern characteristic of the infecting organism. Blood cell tests will not be altered significantly by delaying the tests until after the first dose of antibiotics. 9. 10. a. Oxygen saturation obtained by pulse oximetry should be between 90% and 100%. An SpO2 lower than 90% indicates hypoxemia and impaired gas exchange. Crackles, purulent sputum, and fever are all manifestations of pneumonia, but do not necessarily relate to impaired gas exchange. 11. b . Clear lung sounds indicate that the airways are clear. SpO2 of 90% to 100% indicates appropriate gas exchange. Tolerating walking in the hallway also indicates appropriate gas exchange, not improved airway clearance. Deep breaths are necessary to move mucus from distal airways but this is not an outcome. 1 2. b . A second dose of the pneumococcal vaccine should be provided to all persons 65 years of age or older who have not received the vaccine within 5 years and were younger than 65 years of age at the time of vaccination. Influenza vaccine should be taken each year by those older than 65 years of age. Antibiotic therapy is not appropriate for all upper respiratory infections unless secondary bacterial infections develop. 1 3. b . Drug-resistant strains of TB have developed because TB patients' compliance with drug therapy has been poor and there has been general decreased vigilance in monitoring and follow-up of TB treatment. TB can be diagnosed effectively with sputum cultures. Antitubercular drugs are almost exclusively used for TB infections. The incidence of TB is at epidemic proportions in patients with HIV but this does not account for drug-resistant strains of TB. 14. b . A patient with class 3 TB has clinically active disease and airborne infection isolation is required for active disease until the patient is noninfectious, indicated by negative sputum smears. Cardiac monitoring and observation will need to be done with the patient in isolation. The nurse will administer the antitubercular drugs after the patient is in isolation. There should be no need for suction or extra linens after the TB patient is receiving drug therapy. 15. b . TB usually develops insidiously with fatigue, malaise, anorexia, low-grade fevers, and night sweats. Pleuritic pain, Clinical Situation Nursing Intervention Patient with altered consciousnessPosition to side, protect airway Patient with a feeding tubeCheck placement of the tube before feeding, residual feeding; keep head of bed up after feedings or continuously with continuous feedings Patient with local anesthetic to throat Check gag reflex before feeding or offering fluids Patient with difficulty swallowingCut food in small bites, encourage thorough chewing, and provide soft foods that are easier to swallow than liquids362 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. flu-like symptoms, and a productive cough may occur with an acute sudden presentation but dyspnea and hemoptysis are late symptoms. 16. a, b, c, f. For the first 2 months, a four-drug regimen consists of may be used if the patient develops toxicity to the primary drugs. Rifabutin (Mycobutin) may be used as first-line treatment for patients receiving medications that interact with rifampin. 17. d. Notification of the public health department is required. If drug compliance is questionable, follow-up of patients can be made by directly observed therapy by a public health nurse or a responsible family member. A patient who cannot remember to take the medication usually will not remember to come to the clinic daily or will find it too inconvenient. Additional teaching or support from others is not usually effective for this type of patient. 18. b. Although all of the precautions identified in this question are appropriate in decreasing the risk of occupational lung diseases, using masks and effective ventilation systems to reduce exposure is the most efficient and affects the greatest number of employees. 19. a, b, d, e. Smoking by women is taking a great toll, as reflected by the increasing incidence and deaths from lung cancer in women, who develop lung cancer at a younger age than men. Nonsmoking women are at greater risk of developing lung cancer. The incidence of small cell carcinoma is higher in women than in men. Men still have a worse prognosis than women from lung cancer. 20. d. The use of radiology, computed tomography (CT), and sputum cytology has been shown to detect lung cancer at earlier stages. Low-dose spiral CT scanning has been shown to decrease lung cancer mortality compared with those who had chest x-rays. To be considered for screening for lung cancer, patients must be 55 to 74 years old, current smokers with at least a 30 pack-year smoking history or former smokers who quit within the past 15 years, have no history of lung cancer, and not be on home oxygen A patient who has a smoking history always has an increased risk for lung cancer compared with an individual who has never smoked but the risk decreases as the period of nonsmoking increases. 21. c. Although chest x-rays, lung tomograms, CT scans, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) can identify tumors and masses, a definitive diagnosis of a lung cancer requires identification of malignant cells in either sputum specimens or biopsies. 22. a. 3; b. 6; c. 8; d. 7; e. 1; f. 9; g. 5; h. 2; i. 4 23. b. Before making any judgments about the patient's statement, it is important to explore what meaning he or she finds in the pain. It may be that the patient feels it is deserved punishment for smoking but further information needs to be obtained from the patient. Immediate referral to a counselor negates the nurse's responsibility in helping the patient and there is no indication that the patient is not dealing effectively with his or her feelings. 24. d. Spontaneous pneumothorax is seen from the rupture of small blebs on the apex of the lung in patients with lung disease or smoking, as well as in tall, thin males with a family history of or a previous spontaneous pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax occurs with mechanical ventilation and with blocked chest tubes. Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurs due to the laceration or puncture of the lung during medical procedures. Traumatic pneumothorax can occur with penetrating or blunt chest trauma. 25. b. A tension pneumothorax causes many of the same manifestations as other types of pneumothoraces but severe respiratory distress from collapse of the entire lung with movement of the mediastinal structures and trachea to the unaffected side is present in a tension pneumothorax. Percussion dullness on the injured site indicates the presence of blood or fluid and decreased movement and diminished breath sounds are characteristic of a pneumothorax. Muffled and distant heart sounds indicate a cardiac tamponade. 26. d. Flail chest may occur when two or more ribs are fractured, causing an unstable segment. The chest wall cannot provide the support for ventilation and the injured segment will move paradoxically to the stable portion of the chest (in on expiration; out on inspiration). Hypotension occurs with a number of conditions that impair cardiac function, and chest pain occurs with a single fractured rib and will be of high priority with flail chest. Absent breath sounds occur following pneumothorax or hemothorax. 27. A. Suction control chamber or dry suction regulator; B. water-seal chamber; C. air leak monitor; D. collection chamber; E. suction monitor bellows 28. Chamber Function Water-seal This chamber contains 2 cm of water, which acts as a one-way valve. Incoming air enters from the collection chamber and bubbles up through the water. The water prevents backflow of the air into the patient from the system Suction control This chamber supplies suction to the chest drainage. The water suction type system contains a column of water with the top end vented to the atmosphere to control the amount of suction, with bubbles to indicate it is working. The amount of suction applied is controlled by the amount of water in the chamber (usually 20 cm), not by the wall suction applied to it. The dry suction device contains no water and uses a regulator to dial the desired negative pressure. Collection This chamber receives fluid and air from the pleural or mediastinal space. Nurses keep track of the amount of drainage and can mark the container for easy measuring. Suction monitor bellows The dry model has the suction monitor bellows, which expands to show that the suction is operating, as this model does not make the bubbling noise made by the models that control the suction with water. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 363 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 29. b . The water-seal chamber should bubble intermittently as air leaves the lung with exhalation in a spontaneously breathing patient. Continuous bubbling indicates a leak. The water in the suction control chamber will bubble continuously and the fluid in the water-seal chamber fluctuates with the patient's breathing. Water in the suction control chamber, and perhaps in the water-seal chamber, evaporates and may need to be replaced periodically. 30. c. If chest tubes are to be milk ed or stripped, this procedure should be done only by the professional nurse. This procedure is no longer recommended, as it may dangerously increase pleural pressure, but there is no indication to milk the tubes when there is no bloody drainage, as in a pneumothorax. The UAP can loop the chest tubing on the bed to promote drainage and patients should be reminded to cough and deep breathe at least every 2 hours to aid in lung reexpansion. Securing the drainage container in an upright position is also a necessary activity that can be completed by UAP. 31. b . Decortication is the stripping of a thick fibrous membrane. A lobectomy is the removal of one lung lobe. A thoracotomy is the incision into the thorax. A wedge resection is used to remove a small lesion. 32. d. During video-assisted thoracic sur gery (V ATS), a video scope is inserted into the thorax to assess, diagnose, and treat intrathoracic injuries. A pneumonectomy is the removal of a lung. A wedge resection is the removal of a lung segment. Lung volume-reduction surgery is the removal of lung tissue by excising multiple wedges. 33. d. A thoracotomy incision is lar ge and involves cutting into bone, muscle, and cartilage, resulting in significant postoperative pain. The patient has difficulty deep breathing and coughing because of the pain and analgesics should be provided before attempting these activities. Water intake is important to liquefy secretions but is not indicated in this case, nor should a patient with chest trauma or surgery be placed in Trendelenburg position, because it increases intrathoracic pressure. 34. a. 8; b . 7; 1; g. 9; h. 4; i. 5 35. a. All of the acti vities are correct but the first thing to do is to raise the head of the bed to promote respiration in the patient who is dyspneic. The health care provider would not be called until the nurse has assessment data relating to vital signs, pulse oximetry, and any other patient complaints. 36. b . A spiral (helical) CT scan is the most frequently used test to diagnose pulmonary emboli because it allows illumination of all anatomic structures and produces a 3-D picture. If a patient cannot have contrast media, a ventilation-perfusion scan is done. Although pulmonary angiography is most sensitive, it is invasive, expensive, and carries more risk for complications. Chest x-rays do not detect pulmonary emboli until necrosis or abscesses occur. 37. a. Chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease (COPD) causes pulmonary capillary and alveolar damage. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease. stiffens the pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary embolism obstructs pulmonary blood flow. 38. b . High pressure in the pulmonary arteries increases the workload of the right ventricle and eventually causes right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, known as cor pulmonale. Eventually, decreased left ventricular output may occur because of decreased return to the left atrium but it is not the primary effect of pulmonary hypertension. Alveolar interstitial edema is pulmonary edema associated with left ventricular failure. Pulmonary hypertension does not cause systemic hypertension. 39. d. If possible, the primary management of cor pulmonale is treatment of the underlying pulmonary problem that caused the heart problem. Low-flow oxygen therapy will help to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which cause pulmonary vasoconstriction. 40. c. Acute rejection may occur as early as 5 to 7 days after surgery and is manifested by low-grade fever, fatigue, and oxygen desaturation with exertion. Complete remission of symptoms can be accomplished with bolus corticosteroids. Cytomegalovirus and other infections can be fatal but usually occur weeks after surgery and manifest with symptoms of pneumonia. Obliterative bronchiolitis is a late complication of lung transplantation, reflecting chronic rejection. Case Study 1. Lo w-flow oxygen; calcium channel blocking agents and anticoagulants. 2.

She meets additional criteria of being less than 60 years old and a nonsmoker. 3. A heart-lung transplant is indicated for T .S. because she has heart damage from the pulmonary hypertension, although there is evidence that even a single-lung transplantation can markedly correct pulmonary hypertension and the resultant cor pulmonale. 4. T .S. needs preoperative teaching to help her to cope with the postoperative regimen, which includes the following: Strict adherence to immunosuppressive drugs Continuous monitoring and reporting of manifestations of infection Self-care activities and accurately identifying when to call the transplant team Rehabilitation program Financial resources for the procedure, drugs, and follow-up care Social and emotional support system because she is a single mother 5.

All rights reserved. CHAPTER 29 Answer Key 1. d. Respiratory infections are one of the most common precipitating factors of an acute asthma attack. Sensitivity to food and drugs may also precipitate attacks and exercise-induced asthma occurs after exercise, especially in cold, dry air. Psychologic factors may interact with the asthmatic response to worsen the disease but it is not a psychosomatic disease. 2. b. Diminished or absent breath sounds may indicate a significant decrease in air movement resulting from exhaustion and an inability to generate enough muscle force to ventilate and is an ominous sign. The other symptoms are expected in an asthma attack. 3. c. Early in an asthma attack, an increased respiratory rate and hyperventilation create a respiratory alkalosis with increased pH and decreased PaCO2, accompanied by hypoxemia. As the attack progresses, pH shifts to normal, then decreases, with arterial blood gases (ABGs) that reflect respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. During the attack, high-flow oxygen should be provided. Breathing in a paper bag, although used to treat some types of hyperventilation, would increase the hypoxemia. 4. 5. b. Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) are normally up to 600 L/min and in status asthmaticus may be as low as 100 to 150 L/min. An SaO2 of 85% and a FEV1 of 85% of predicted are typical of mild to moderate asthma. A flattened diaphragm may be present in the patient with long-standing asthma but does not reflect current bronchoconstriction. 6. d. The albuterol nebulizer will rapidly cause bronchodilation and be easier to use in an emergency situation than an inhaler. It will be used every 20 minutes to 4 hours as needed. The ipratropium inhaler could be used if the patient does not tolerate the short-acting 2-adrenergic agonists (SABA) but its onset is slower than albuterol. Inhaled or oral corticosteroids will be used to decrease the inflammation and provide better symptom control after the emergency situation is over. 7. c, f, g, i. These are the corticosteroids described. Zileuton (Zyflo CR) and montelukast (Singulair) are leukotriene modifiers that interfere with the synthesis or block the action of the leukotriene inflammatory mediators that cause bronchoconstriction. Omalizumab (Xolair) is an anti-IgE, which prevents IgE from attaching to mast cells and prevents the release of chemical mediators. used when other long-term bronchodilators are not available or affordable. 8. d. Storing the dry powder inhaler (DPI) in the bathroom will expose it to moisture, which could cause clumping of the medication and an altered dose. The other statements show patient understanding. 9. a, f. Salmeterol (Serevent) should not be taken without inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma medications may make gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms worse and GERD medications may make asthma symptoms worse. The rest of the statements show patient understanding. 10. b. The patient in an acute asthma attack is very anxious and fearful. It is important to stay with the patient and interact in a calm, unhurried manner. Helping the patient to breathe with pursed lips will facilitate expiration of trapped air and help the patient to gain control of breathing. Pursed lip breathing also is used with COPD for this same reason. 11. c. A yellow zone reading with the PEFR indicates that the patient's asthma is getting worse and quick-relief medications should be used. The meter is routinely used only each morning before taking medications and does not have to be on hand at all times. The meter measures the ability to empty the lungs and involves blowing through the meter. 12. b. Nonprescription drugs should not be used by patients with asthma because of dangers associated with rebound bronchospasm, interactions with prescribed drugs, and undesirable side effects. All of the other responses are appropriate for the patient with asthma. 13. d. Increased risk of infection, hyperplasia of mucous glands, cancer, and chronic bronchitis are the long-term effects of smoking. 14. a. A; b. C; c. C; d. C; h. i. B; j. C; k. A 15. b. Constriction of the pulmonary vessels, leading to pulmonary hypertension, is caused by alveolar hypoxia and the acidosis that results from hypercapnia. Polycythemia is a contributing factor in cor pulmonale because it increases the viscosity of blood and the pressure needed to circulate the blood. Long-term low-flow oxygen therapy dilates pulmonary vessels and is used to treat cor pulmonale. High oxygen administration is not related to cor pulmonale. 16. d. Smoking cessation is one of the most important factors in preventing further damage to the lungs in COPD but prevention of infections that further increase lung damage is also important. The patient is very susceptible to infections and these infections make the disease worse, creating a vicious cycle. Bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and lung volume-reduction surgery help to control symptoms but these are symptomatic measures. 17. a. A Venturi mask is helpful to administer low, constant O2 concentrations to patients with COPD and can be set to administer a varied percentage of O2. The amount of O2 inhaled via the nasal cannula depends on room air and the patient's breathing pattern. The simple face mask must have a tight seal and may generate heat under the mask. The non-rebreathing mask is more useful for short-term therapy with patients needing high O 2 concentrations. 18. b. The partial rebreathing mask has O2 flow into the reservoir bag and mask during inhalation. Agent Role or Relationship to Asthma Salicylates Associated with the asthma triad\u2014 people with nasal polyps, asthma, and sensitivity to salicylates and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -Adrenergic blockersContraindicated in patients with asthma because they prevent bronchodilation Beer and wine Contain sulfites that are common triggers of asthma ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 365 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The O2-conserving cannula is used for long-term therapy at home versus during hospitalization. The Venturi mask is able to deliver the highest concentrations of O2. The nasal cannula is the most comfortable and mobile delivery device. 19. c. Oxygen concentrators or e xtractors continuously supply O2 concentrated from the air. O2-conserving units will last for up to 20 hours. Portable liquid O2 units will hold about 6 to 8 hours of O2 but because of the expense they are only used for portable and emergency use. Compressed O2 comes in various tank sizes but generally it requires weekly deliveries of four to five large tanks to meet a 7- to 10-day supply. 20. c. Pursed lip breathing prolongs e xhalation and prevents bronchiolar collapse and air trapping. Huff coughing is a technique used to increase coughing patterns to remove secretions. Thoracic breathing is not as effective as diaphragmatic breathing and is the method most naturally used by patients with COPD. Diaphragmatic breathing emphasizes the use of the diaphragm to increase maximum inhalation but it may increase the work of breathing and dyspnea. 21. c. Man y postural drainage positions require placement in Trendelenburg position but patients with heart disease, hemoptysis, chest trauma, or severe dyspnea should not be placed in these positions. Postural drainage should be done 1 hour before and 3 hours after meals if possible. Coughing, percussion, and vibration are all performed after the patient has been positioned. 22. b . Eating is an effort for patients with COPD and frequently these patients do not eat because of fatigue, dyspnea, and difficulty holding their breath while swallowing. Foods that require much chewing cause more exhaustion and should be avoided. A low-carbohydrate diet is indicated if the patient has hypercapnia because carbohydrates are metabolized into carbon dioxide. Fluids should be avoided at meals to prevent a full stomach and cold foods seem to give less of a sense of fullness than hot foods. 23. a. Assistance with positioning and acti vities of daily living (ADL) is within the training of unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP). Teaching, assessing, and planning are all part of the RN's practice. 24. d. Indacterol (Arcapta Neohaler) is a DPI that is used only for COPD. Roflumilast (Daliresp) is an oral medication used for COPD. Salmeterol (Serevent) is a DPI but it is also used in asthma with inhaled corticosteroids. Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) is used for COPD but it is delivered via metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer. 25. d. The tripod position with an ele vated backrest and supported upper extremities to fix the shoulder girdle maximizes respiratory excursion and an effective breathing pattern. Staying with the patient and encouraging pursed lip breathing also helps. Bronchodilators may help but can also increase nervousness and anxiety; rescue inhalers would be used before routine bronchodilators. Postural drainage is not tolerated by a patient in acute respiratory distress and oxygen is titrated to an effective rate based on ABGs because of the possibility of carbon dioxide narcosis. 2 6. d. Specif ic guidelines for sexual activity help to preserve energy and prevent dyspnea and maintenance of sexual activity is important to the healthy psychologic well-being of the patient. Open communication between partners is needed so that the modifications can be made with consideration of both partners. 27. c. Shortness of breath usually increases during e xercise but the activity is not being overdone if breathing returns to baseline within 5 minutes after stopping. Bronchodilators can be administered 10 minutes before exercise but should not be administered for at least 5 minutes after activity to allow recovery. Patients are encouraged to walk 15 to 20 minutes per day with gradual increases but actual patterns will depend on patient tolerance. Dyspnea most frequently limits exercise and is a better indication of exercise tolerance than is heart rate in the patient with COPD. 28. b . These results show worsening respiratory function and failure. The results in option a show potential normal results for the patient described. The results in option c show normal ABGs. The results in option d show alkalosis, probably respiratory, but the HCO 3- results are needed to be sure. 29. b, c, e. Decreasing anxiety , depression, and hospitalizations along with improving exercise capacity are the anticipated effects of pulmonary rehabilitation. The other options may occur but are not predicted. 30. c. Cystic f ibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, multisystem disease involving altered transport of sodium and chloride ions in and out of epithelial cells, which affects the lungs, pancreas, and sweat glands. Abnormally thick, abundant secretions from mucous glands lead to a chronic, diffuse, obstructive pulmonary disorder in almost all patients, whereas exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs in about 85% to 90% of patients with CF. 31. d. The major objecti ve of therapy in CF is to promote removal of the secretions and performance of postural drainage, vibration, and percussion has been the mainstay of treatment. Aerobic exercise also seems to be effective in clearing the airways and is an important part of treatment. Antibiotics are used for early signs of infection and long courses are necessary but they are not used prophylactically. Bronchodilators have no long-term benefit. Although CF has become a leading indication for heart-lung transplant, this treatment option is not available for most patients. 32. b . The presence of a chronic disease that is present at birth and significantly lowers life span and the many treatments needed by those with CF affects all relationships and development of these patients. Although a lung transplant may be needed, not all CF patients need one. Children of a parent with CF will either be carriers of CF or have the disease. Many men with CF are sterile and women may have difficulty becoming pregnant. Educational and vocational goals may be met in those who maintain treatment programs and health. 33. d. In adults, most forms of bronchiectasis are associated with bacterial infections that damage the bronchial walls. In children, cystic fibrosis is the prominent cause of bronchiectasis. The incidence of bronchiectasis has decreased with the use of measles and pertussis vaccines and better treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. 34. d. Mucus production is increased in bronchiectasis and collects in the dilated, pouched bronchi. A major goal of treatment is to promote drainage and removal of the mucus, primarily through deep breathing, coughing, and postural drainage.366 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 35. d. 1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that is a genetic risk factor for COPD. AAT occurs in 1 in 1700 to 3500 live births with an onset between ages 20 and 40 years. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in 1 in 3000 white births, legislation requires babies to be screened at birth, so it would have been previously diagnosed. Asthma is a multifactorial genetic disorder. 36. d. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) is the principle behind the airway clearance devices (ACDs) that mobilize secretions and benefit patients. Vibration, a form of chest physiotherapy, and inhalation therapy are therapies to assist patients with excessive secretions or to increase bronchodilation but they are not principles of ACDs' function. Case Study 1. Blood pressure; presence of perspiration; PEFR; neck vein distention; GERD; frequent lung sounds; ABGs as ordered; pulmonary function studies to determine the reversibility of bronchoconstriction (using bronchodilators) after the acute situation; Asthma Control Test; serum IgE level; sputum culture and sensitivity may be done; fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) may be measured. 2. Oxygen therapy needs to be started immediately. The goal is to get E.S.'s oxygen saturation above 90% and to maintain it at or above that level. Although oxygen could be administered using a nasal cannula or face mask, it is important to ensure that E.S. is receiving the oxygen supplement. Her SpO 2 or PaO2 needs to be monitored closely. Also, the nurse must assess whether the patient with a nasal cannula or face mask device keeps it on (some patients complain that the face mask is suffocating them). 3. E.S. is using accessory muscles and has audible wheezing, a respiratory rate >30, and a heart rate >120. Her responses to questions are very short (one- to three-word sentences). She is sitting upright and is extremely anxious and restless. Her breath sounds are not audible in the bases of her lungs and her oxygen saturation is <90%. These are all manifestations of a severe asthma attack. Other observations that might be evident during severe attacks are agitation, PEF rate <150 mL, neck vein distention, and a pulsus paradoxus of 40 mm Hg. Patients with life-threatening asthma are usually too dyspneic to speak and are perspiring profusely. They may be drowsy and the ABGs will reveal further deterioration (lower PaO2, lower O2 saturation, rising PaCO2, and pH that is acidotic). Breath sounds may become very difficult to hear and wheezing may no longer be present (very little airflow). These patients become bradycardic and may require airway intubation, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the ICU. 4. SABA stimulate the 2-adrenergic receptors in the bronchioles, producing bronchodilation (relieve bronchospasm) as well as increased mucociliary clearance. The SABA medications will be given by nebulizer Often a SABA plus the anticholinergic agent ipratropium (Atrovent) is given in severe asthma attacks and provides partial relief but it has a slower onset of action. Inhaled corticosteroids are the second classification of medications given in severe attacks. They can be administered orally or IV . Corticosteroids are antiinflammatory agents that reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness, block the late phase reaction, and inhibit migration of inflammatory cells. 5. Patients experiencing a severe asthma attack are extremely anxious and may not be able to follow the direction of health care providers. Nurses can decrease a patient's sense of panic by providing a calm, quiet, reassuring attitude. Position the patient for comfort (usually sitting upright), stay with the patient, and be available to provide comfort. Gain eye contact with the patient and in a firm and calm voice coach the patient to use pursed lip breathing and abdominal breathing (technique called \"talking down\"). This helps the patient to remain calm and improves ventilation (maintains a positive airway pressure, slows down the respiratory rate, and encourages deeper breaths). 6. PEFR is measured by the peak expiratory flow rate meter, which correlates with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and is helpful to diagnose and manage asthma. Since there are no standardized PEFR reference values, spirometry is preferred. PEFR can be useful to monitor the asthma patient's response to treatments. 7. Teaching of the written asthma action plan that prescribes a step increase in medications during an acute phase should include medication use and response to medication; avoidance of triggers; a diary with medication use, the presence of wheezing or coughing, PEFR measurement, the drug's side effects, and the activity level; balanced nutrition; physical exercise within the patient's tolerance, possibly with pretreatment; interrupted sleep means poorly controlled asthma; and relaxation therapies. Teaching is done with both patient and family or caregiver. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective airway clearance related to bronchospasm and fatigue Anxiety related to difficulty breathing and fear Deficient knowledge related to lack of information and education about asthma Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of primary health care provider Collaborative problems: Potential complications: severe acute asthma, life-threatening asthma CHAPTER 30 Answer Key 1. a, b, c, f. These characteristics are evident with neutrophils. Platelets arise from megakaryocytes and are stored in the spleen. Eosinophils are increased in individuals with allergies and make up 2% to 4% of WBCs. 2. c. Increased reticulocytes, or immature RBCs, indicate an increased rate of erythropoiesis or stimulation of erythrocyte (RBC) production by the bone marrow. Basophils release granules that increase allergic and inflammatory responses and are stimulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Monocytes may become tissue macrophages. Lymphocytes are primarily responsible for the immune response. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 367 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 3. a, c, d. Basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils are the granulocytic leukocytes. Lymphocytes are the agranular leukocytes that form the basis of the cellular and humoral immune responses. Monocytes are agranulocytes that are potent phagocytic cells. 4. a. L ymphedema is the obstruction of lymph flow that results in accumulation of lymph fluid for the patient in the right arm following a right-sided breast mastectomy. The other options are not hematologic problems that would cause extreme swelling. 5. a, b, e. Although all of the listed nutrients are helpful, iron, folic acid, and cobalamin (vitamin B12) are essential for erythropoiesis. 6. a. 4; b . 1; c. 3; d. 2 7. a. Protein C and protein S are e xamples of anticoagulants that are involved in the lysis of clots. Fibrinolysis is also achieved by thrombin-activating conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which attacks fibrin or fibrinogen and splits it into smaller elements known as fibrin split products (FSPs) or fibrin degradation products (FDPs). 8 . a, b, e. The abdominal or gans that are primarily involved in hematologic function are the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The liver filters the blood, produces procoagulants, and stores iron. The spleen removes old and defective erythrocytes and filters iron for reuse. The lymph nodes filter pathogens and foreign particles from lymphatic circulation. 9. b . During fibrinolysis by plasmin, the fibrin clot is split into smaller molecules known as FSPs or FDPs. Increased FSPs impair platelet aggregation, reduce prothrombin, and prevent fibrin stabilization and lead to bleeding. 10. c. As a person ages the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is normally decreased, so an abnormally high PTT of 60 seconds is an indication that bleeding could readily occur. Platelets are unaffected by aging and 150,000/\u00b5L is a normal count. Serum iron levels are decreased and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is significantly increased with aging, as are reflected in these values. 11. a, b, d. The myeloblast is a committed hematopoietic cell found in the bone marrow from which granulocytes develop. A disorder in which myeloblasts are overproduced would result in increased basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. 12. a. The parietal cells of the stomach secrete intrinsic f actor, a substance necessary for the absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12), and if all or part of the stomach is removed, the lack of intrinsic factor can lead to impaired RBC production and pernicious anemia. Recurring infections indicate decreased WBCs and immune response and corticosteroid therapy may cause a neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Oral contraceptive use is strongly associated with changes in blood coagulation. 13.

Superf icial lymph nodes are evaluated by light palpation but they are not normally palpable. It may be normal to find small (<1.0 cm), mobile, firm, nontender nodes. Deep lymph nodes are detected radiographically. 15. b . Petechiae are small, flat, red, or reddish-brown pinpoint microhemorrhages that occur on the skin when platelet levels are low. When petechiae are numerous, they group, causing reddish bruises known as purpura. Sternal tenderness is associated with leukemias. Jaundice occurs when anemias are of a hemolytic origin, resulting in accumulation of bile pigments from RBCs. Enlarged, tender lymph nodes are associated with infection or cancer. 16. b . A smooth, shiny, reddened tongue is an indication of iron-deficiency anemia or pernicious anemia that would be reflected by a decreased hemoglobin level. The decreased neutrophils would be indicative of neutropenia. The increased WBC count could be indicative of an infection and the increased RBC count of polycythemia.368 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 17. c. Any platelet count <150,000/\u00b5L is considered thrombocytopenia and could place the patient at risk for bleeding, necessitating special consideration in nursing care. Chemotherapy may cause bone marrow suppression and a depletion of all blood cells. The other factors are all within normal range. 18. 19. b. A patient with type O Rh+ blood has no A or B antigens on the RBC but does have anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the blood and has an Rh antigen. Type AB Rh blood has both A and B antigens on the RBC but no Rh antigen and no anti-A or anti-B antibodies. If the type AB Rh blood is given to the patient with type O Rh+ blood, the antibodies in the patient's blood will react with the antigens in the donor blood, causing hemolysis of the donor cells. There will be no Rh reaction because the donor blood has no Rh antigen. 20. a. A contrast CT scan involves the use of an iodine-based dye that could cause a reaction if the patient is sensitive to iodine. Metal implants or internal appliances and claustrophobia should be determined before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Prior blood transfusions are not a factor in this diagnostic test. 21. c. The aspiration of bone marrow content is done with local anesthesia at the site of the puncture but the aspiration causes a suction pain that is quite painful but very brief. There generally is no residual pain following the test. 22. d. Lymph node biopsy is usually done to determine whether malignant cells are present in lymph nodes and can be used to diagnose lymphomas as well as metastatic spread from any malignant tumor in the body. Leukemias may infiltrate lymph nodes but biopsy of the nodes is more commonly used to detect any type of neoplastic cells. 23. c. Pancytopenia is decreased RBCs, WBCs, and Hemolysis is RBC destruction. Leukopenia is WBC <4000/\u00b5L. Thrombocytosis is increased platelets and thrombocytopenia is decreased platelets. 24. b, c. Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies are prefer - red methods to obtain the sample for gene analysis. If a large number of abnormal cells are circulating in the blood, peripheral blood may be used. The other options will not provide the desired information.CHAPTER 31 Answer Key 1. 2. b. The patient's hemoglobin (Hgb) level indicates a moderate anemia and at this severity additional findings usually include dyspnea and fatigue. Pallor, smooth tongue, and sensitivity to cold usually manifest in severe anemia when the Hgb level is below 6 g/dL (60 g/L). 3. c. In the older adult, confusion, ataxia, and fatigue are common manifestations of anemia and place the patient at risk for injury. Nursing interventions should include safety precautions to prevent falls and injury when these symptoms are present. The nurse, not the patient's family, is responsible for the patient and although a quiet room may promote rest, it is not as important as protection of the patient. 4. d. Dyspnea at rest indicates that the patient is making an effort to provide adequate amounts of oxygen to the tissues. If oxygen needs are not met, angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pulmonary and systemic congestion can occur. The other manifestations are present in severe anemia but they do not reflect hypoxemia, a priority problem. 5. b. Aplastic anemia has a decrease of all blood cell types and hypocellular bone marrow. Thalassemia is characterized by inadequate production of normal hemoglobin and decreased erythrocyte production. Megaloblastic anemias (cobalamin deficiency and folic acid deficiency anemias) are caused by impaired DNA synthesis, which results in the presence of large red blood cells (RBCs). Anemia of chronic disease occurs with chronic inflammation, autoimmune and infectious disorders, heart failure, malignancies, or bleeding episodes. It manifests with underproduction of RBCs and shortened RBC survival. 6. c, d, f. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia and occurs with chronic blood loss or malabsorption in the duodenum so it may occur with duodenal removal. The other options are associated with cobalamin deficiency. 7. d. Folic acid deficiency megaloblastic anemia is related to dietary deficiency as seen in anorexia and with the use of oral contraceptives and antiseizure medications. The other anemias are unrelated to this patient's history.Laboratory Finding Possible Etiology Serum iron 40 mcg/dL (7 \u00b5mol/L)Iron-deficiency anemia ESR 30 mm/hr Inflammatory conditions of any kind Increased band neutrophils Infection, usually acute Activated partial thromboplastin time 60 secHeparin therapy Indirect bilirubin 2.0 mg/ dL \u00b5mol/L)Hemolysis of RBCs Bence Jones in urineMultiple myelomaType or Cause of Anemia Etiology Morphology Malaria 3 4 Thalassemia 1 6 Acute trauma 2 4 Aplastic anemia 1 4 Pernicious anemia 1 5 Sickle cell anemia 3 4 Anemia of gastritis 2 4 Anemia of leukemia 1 4 Iron-deficiency anemia 1 6 Anemia of renal failure 1 4 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)3 4 Anemia associated with prosthetic heart valve3 4 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 369 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8. Finding Explanation Reticulocyte counts are increased in chronic blood loss but decreased in cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency.The hypoxia resulting from loss of RBCs in chronic blood loss stimulates the kidney to release erythropoietin, stimulating production of RBCs and reticulocytes. However, in pernicious anemia, normal reticulocytes are not produced because of the lack of cobalamin. Bilirubin levels are increased in sickle cell anemia but are normal in acute blood loss.Sickle cell anemia is a hemolytic anemia involving an accelerated RBC breakdown, leading to increased serum bilirubin levels, whereas acute blood loss results in loss of the RBC and the bile pigments from the body. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is increased in folic acid deficiency but decreased in iron-deficiency anemia.The MCV is a determination of the relative size of an RBC and macrocytic anemias, such as folic acid deficiency and cobalamin deficiency, are characterized by the production of large, immature RBCs that would reflect an increased MCV . In iron-deficiency anemia, the MCV is low because of the lack of Hgb in the cells. 9. a. Constipation is a common side ef fect of oral iron supplementation and increased fluids and fiber should be consumed to prevent this effect. Because iron can be bound in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by food, it should be taken before meals unless gastric side effects of the supplements necessitate its ingestion with food. Black stools are an expected result of oral iron preparations. Taking iron with ascorbic acid or orange juice enhances absorption of the iron but enteric-coated iron often is ineffective because of unpredictable release of the iron in areas of the GI tract where it can be absorbed. 10. b . Pernicious anemia is a type of cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency that results when parietal cells in the stomach fail to secrete enough intrinsic factor to absorb ingested cobalamin. Folic acid deficiency may contribute to folic acid deficiency anemia, not pernicious anemia. Extrinsic factor may be a factor in some cobalamin deficiencies but not in pernicious anemia. Lack of cobalamin intake can cause cobalamin deficiency but not pernicious anemia. Increasing cobalamin intake cannot improve pernicious anemia without intrinsic factor to aid its absorption. 11. c. Neurologic manifestations of weakness, paresthesias of the feet and hands, and impaired thought processes are characteristic of cobalamin deficiency and pernicious anemia. Hepatomegaly and jaundice often occur with hemolytic anemia and the patient with cobalamin deficiency often has achlorhydria or decreased stomach acidity and would not experience effects of gastric hyperacidity. 12. a. W ithout cobalamin replacement individuals with pernicious anemia will die in 1 to 3 years but the disease can be controlled with cobalamin supplements for life. Hematologic manifestations can be completely reversed with therapy but long-standing neuromuscular complications might not be reversed. Because pernicious anemia results from an inability to absorb cobalamin, dietary intake of the vitamin is not a treatment option, nor is a bone marrow transplant. 13. d. Because red meats are the primary dietary sources of cobalamin, a strict vegetarian is most at risk for cobalamin deficiency anemia. Meats are also an important source of iron and folic acid but whole grains, legumes, and green leafy vegetables also supply these nutrients. Thalassemia is not related to dietary deficiencies. 14. a, c, e. Aplastic anemia may cause an inflamed, painful tongue. The thrombocytopenia may contribute to blood-filled bullae in the mouth and gingival bleeding. The leukopenia may lead to stomatitis and oral ulcers and infections. MCV will be normal or slightly increased. Ferritin and coagulation factors are not affected in aplastic anemia. 15. b . Hemorrhage from thrombocytopenia and infection from neutropenia are the greatest risks for the patient with aplastic anemia. The patient will experience fatigue from anemia but bleeding and infection are the major causes of death in aplastic anemia. 16. a, d, e. W ith rapid blood loss, hypovolemic shock may occur. Clinical manifestations will be more reliable, as they reflect the body's attempt to meet oxygen requirements. As the percentage of blood loss increases, clinical manifestations worsen. Blood transfusions will first be used, then iron, vitamin B 12, and folic acid supplements may be used. 17. b . Because RBCs are abnormal in sickle cell anemia, the mean RBC survival time is 10 to 15 days (rather than the normal 120 days) because of accelerated RBC breakdown by the spleen, not in the blood vessels. Antibody reactions with RBCs may be seen in other types of hemolytic anemias but are not present in sickle cell anemia. 1 8. b . During a sickle cell crisis, the sickling cells clog small capillaries and the resulting hemostasis promotes a self-perpetuating cycle of local hypoxia, deoxygenation of more erythrocytes, and more sickling. Administration of oxygen may help to control further sickling but additional oxygen does not reach areas of local hypoxia caused by occluded vessels. 19. d. Because pain usually accompanies a sickle cell crisis and may last for 4 to 6 days, pain control is an important part of treatment. Rest is indicated to reduce metabolic needs and fluids and electrolytes are administered to reduce blood viscosity and maintain renal function. Although thrombosis does occur in capillaries, elastic stockings that primarily affect venous circulation are not indicated; anticoagulants are used instead. 20. d. The patient with sickle cell disease is particularly prone to upper respiratory infection and infection can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. Patients should seek medical attention quickly to counteract upper respiratory infections because 370 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. pneumonia is the most common infection of patients with sickle cell disease. Fluids should be increased to decrease blood viscosity, which may precipitate a crisis, and moderate activity is permitted. Dehydration in hot weather may precipitate a sickling episode but humid weather alone will not do so. 21. a, c, d. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by increased platelet destruction by the spleen. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has decreased platelets and RBCs with enhanced agglutination of the platelets. Platelet deficiencies lead to superficial site bleeding. ITP is the most common acquired thrombocytopenia. Petechiae, not ecchymosis, is a common manifestation of thrombocytopenia. 22. b. The symptoms describe hemochromatosis, which is treated with iron chelating agents to remove accumulated iron via the kidneys. 23. b. Thrombus and embolization are the major complications of polycythemia vera because of increased hypervolemia and hyperviscosity. Active or passive leg exercises and ambulation should be implemented to prevent thrombus formation. Hydration therapy is important to decrease blood viscosity. However, because the patient already has hypervolemia, a careful balance of intake and output must be maintained and fluids are not increased injudiciously. 24. b. Corticosteroids are used in initial treatment of ITP because they suppress the phagocytic response of splenic macrophages, decreasing platelet destruction. They also depress autoimmune antibody formation and reduce capillary fragility and bleeding time. All of the other therapies may be used but only in patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. 25. c. The major complication of thrombocytopenia is hemorrhage and it may occur in any area of the body. Cerebral hemorrhage may be fatal and evaluation of mental status for central nervous system (CNS) alterations to identify CNS bleeding is very important. Fever is not a common finding in thrombocytopenia. Protection from injury to prevent bleeding is an important nursing intervention but strict bed rest is not indicated. Oral care is performed very gently with minimum friction and soft swabs. 26. Any five of these are appropriate: Discontinue heparin administration and expect a direct or indirect thrombin inhibitor to be ordered. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding (check IV sites, wounds, any secretions). Monitor ordered coagulation studies. Avoid injections. Use an electric razor. Protect the patient from trauma. Administer ordered blood products. Instruct the patient and caregiver to avoid aspirin and other anticoagulants. Instruct the patient to avoid high-contact activities (many sports). 27. d. A prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) occurs when there is a deficiency of clotting factors, such as factor VIII associated with hemophilia A. Factor IX is deficient in hemophilia B and prolonged bleeding time and decreased platelet counts are associated with platelet deficiencies. 28. c. Although whole blood and fresh frozen plasma contain the clotting factors that are deficient in hemophilia, specific factor concentrates have been developed that are more pure and safer in preventing infection transmission. Thromboplastin is factor III and is not deficient in patients with hemophilia. 29. b. During an acute bleeding episode in a joint, it is important to rest the involved joint totally and slow bleeding with application of ice. Drugs that decrease platelet aggregation, such as aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should not be used for pain. As soon as bleeding stops, mobilization of the affected area is encouraged with range-of-motion (ROM) exercises and physical therapy. 30. d. This description is characteristic of von Willebrand disease with prolonged bleeding time occurring because of defective platelets, which does not occur with either type of hemophilia. Although inherited thrombocytopenia is believed to be autosomal dominant, the number of platelets is decreased. 31. a. 5; b. 8; c. 3; d. 6; e. 2; f. 7; g. 1; h. 4 32. a. Yes, as the WBC count is below 4000/\u00b5L. b. The neutrophil count is 2300 \u00d7 40% = 920/\u00b5L. c. Yes, as the neutrophil count is less than 1000/\u00b5L. d. Yes, the patient is at moderate risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens and nonpathogenic organisms from normal body flora. 33. a. An elevated temperature is of most significance in recognizing the presence of an infection in the neutropenic patient because there is no leukocytic response to injury. When the WBC count is depressed, the normal phagocytic mechanisms of infection are impaired and the classic signs of inflammation may not occur. Cultures are indicated if the temperature is elevated but are not used to monitor for infection. 34. d. Despite its seeming simplicity, hand washing before, during, and after care of the patient with neutropenia is the major method to prevent transmission of harmful pathogens to the patient. IV antibiotics are administered when febrile episodes occur. Some oral antibiotics may be used prophylactically in some neutropenic patients. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration and laminar airflow (LAF) rooms may reduce the number of aerosolized pathogens but they are expensive and LAF use is controversial. 35. a. Although myelodysplastic syndromes, like leukemias, are a group of disorders in which hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow undergo clonal change and may cause eventual bone marrow failure, the primary difference from leukemias is that myelodysplastic cells have some degree of maturation and the disease progression is slower than in acute leukemias. 36. c. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is seen in 80% of adults with acute leukemia and is characterized by hyperplasia of the bone marrow with uncontrolled proliferation of myeloblasts, the precursors of granulocytes. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), the other acute leukemia, is most common in children and is characterized by small, immature lymphocytes, primarily of B-cell origin, proliferated in the bone marrow. Fever, bleeding, and central nervous system manifestations are also common with ALL. The other two leukemias are chronic in onset and the maturity of WBCs. 37. a, c, f. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. It is a neoplasm of activated B lymphocytes that are mature appearing but functionally inactive. As it progresses, pressure on nerves from enlarged lymph nodes causes pain and paralysis. Mediastinal node enlargement leads to pulmonary symptoms. The other characteristics are related to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 371 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 38. c. Almost all leuk emias cause some degree of hepatosplenomegaly because of infiltration of these organs as well as the bone marrow, lymph nodes, bones, and central nervous system by excessive WBCs in the blood. 39. c. Whether the donor bone marro w is from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor or taken from the patient during a remission for later use, hematopoietic stem cell transplant always involves the use of chemotherapy and/or total-body radiation to eliminate leukemic cells and the patient's bone marrow stem cells totally before IV infusion of the donor cells. A severe pancytopenic period follows the transplant, during which the patient must be in protective isolation and during which RBC and platelet transfusions may be given. 40. a. NHL; b . HL; c. B; h. NHL; i. HL; j. B 41. b . The patient is monitored for infection as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may develop from the disease or usually as a consequence of treatment. Staging of Hodgkin's disease is important to determine treatment. Multiple myeloma is characterized by proliferation of malignant activated B cells that destroy the bones. The intervention of increasing fluid to manage hypercalcemia is used with multiple myeloma. 42. c. Splenectomy may be indicated for treatment for ITP and when the spleen is removed, platelet counts increase significantly in most patients. In any of the disorders in which the spleen removes excessive blood cells, splenectomy will most often increase peripheral RBC, WBC, and platelet counts. 4 3. a. Chills and fe ver are symptoms of an acute hemolytic or febrile transfusion reaction and if these develop, the nurse should stop the transfusion, infuse saline through the IV line, notify the health care provider and blood bank immediately, recheck the ID tags, and monitor vital signs and urine output. The addition of a leukocyte reduction filter may prevent a febrile reaction but is not helpful once the reaction has occurred. Mild and transient allergic reactions indicated by itching and hives might permit restarting the transfusion after treatment with antihistamines. 44. b . Because platelets adhere to the plastic bags, the bag should be gently agitated throughout the transfusion. Platelets do not have A, B, or Rh antibodies and ABO compatibility is not a consideration. Baseline vital signs should be taken before the transfusion is started and the nurse should stay with the patient during the first 15 minutes. Platelets are stored at room temperature and should not be refrigerated. 45. a. Febrile nonhemolytic reaction is the most common transfusion reaction. Allergic reactions occur with sensitivity to foreign plasma proteins and can be treated prophylactically with antihistamines. Acute hemolytic reactions are related to the infusion of ABO-incompatible blood or components with 10 mL or more of RBCs. Massive blood transfusion reactions occur when patients receive more RBCs or blood than the total blood volume. 46. a, c, d. ABO incompatibility , destruction of donor RBCs, and acute kidney injury may occur in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Hypothermia, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia are most likely to occur in massive blood transfusion reactions. Epinephrine may be used for severe allergic transfusion reactions and the infusion may be restarted after treatment with antihistamines in mild cases. 47. b, c. All other actions are the responsibility of the RN. The licensed practical nurse may be able to assist with the ID checks (depending on the state and the facility policy). 48. a. 1; b . 3; c. 4; 10; h. 9; i. 8; j. 7. Case Study 1.

Ele vated fibrin degradation products (elevated split products); reduced prolonged thrombin time; reduced fibrinogen, platelets, antithrombin III (AT III), and proteins C and S. 4. Oxygen and fluid replacement will be administered as needed. In this bleeding patient, therapy is administered on the basis of specific component deficiencies. Platelets are given to correct thrombocytopenia, cryoprecipitate replaces factor VIII and fibrinogen, and fresh frozen plasma replaces all clotting factors except platelets and provides a source of antithrombin. This patient is not manifesting symptoms of thrombosis, so anticoagulation is probably not indicated at this time. Treatment of the underlying condition may include a dilation and curettage or even a hysterectomy, if necessary, to remove the stimulus of DIC. 5. Nursing diagnoses: Inef fective tissue perfusion: cardiopulmonary, cerebral, peripheral, and renal related to blood loss and thrombosis Decreased cardiac output related to fluid volume deficit Risk for impaired tissue inte grity related to altered coagulation Anxiety or fear related to disease process and therapy Collaborative problems: Potential complications: hemorrhage, thrombosis, hypovolemia and shock, renal CHAPTER 32 Answer Key 1 . a.

A palpable vibration of a blood vessel is called a thrill and usually indicates turbulent blood flow through the vessel. A weak, thready pulse has little pressure and is difficult to palpate. A bruit is an abnormal buzzing or humming sound that may be auscultated over diseased blood vessels and a bounding pulse is an extra full, hard pulse that may occur with atherosclerosis or hypervolemia. 13. a.

The cardiac murmurs are produced by turb ulent blood flow across diseased heart valves, S3 is heard with mitral valve regurgitation, and S4 is heard with aortic stenosis. bruits are from turbulent peripheral blood flow. Pulsus alternans, seen in heart failure, is a variation in the strength of each pulse when palpated. Pericardial friction rub is the sound heard with pericarditis. 16. c. The bell of the stethoscope will enable better hearing of the low-pitched extra heart sounds. Having the patient lean forward best enables hearing the aortic and pulmonic areas; having the patient on the left side will enhance the mitral area sounds; both of these positions bring the heart closer to the chest wall. Having the patient supine or prone will not improve the auscultation. 17. b . Central cyanosis is evident with a blue tinge in the lips, conjunctiva, or tongue. Finger clubbing results from endocarditis, congenital defects, or prolonged O 2 deficiency. Peripheral cyanosis is evident with blue-tinged extremities or in the nose and ears. Decreased capillary refill may be seen in reduced arterial capillary perfusion or anemia. 18. a. In an e xercise nuclear imaging scan, a radioisotope is injected at the maximum heart rate on a bicycle or treadmill and used to evaluate blood flow in different parts of the heart. Insertion of electrodes into the heart chambers via the venous system to record intracardiac electrical activity is an electrophysiology study. Simply monitoring ECG activity during exercise is an exercise stress test and an echocardiogram uses transducers to bounce sound waves off of the heart. 19. d. All actions will be done b ut in order to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), the throat must be numbed. Until sensation returns, as evidenced by the gag reflex, the patient is at risk of aspiration so this action has the highest priority (priority related to airway\u2014ABCs). 20. b . Holter monitoring involves placing electrodes on the chest attached to a recorder that will record ECG rhythm for 24 to 48 hours while the patient engages in normal activities of daily living (ADLs). The recording is later analyzed for cardiac dysrhythmias. Serial ECGs are frequent but not continuous ECGs. The 6-minute walk test measures the distance walked in 6 minutes to determine response to treatments and functional capacity for ADLs. An event monitor or loop recorder is used to record infrequent rhythm disturbances when the patient activates the recording with symptom occurrence. 21. c. An absence of pulses distal to the catheter insertion site indicates that clotting is occluding blood flow to the extremity and is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Some swelling and pain at the site are expected but the site is also monitored for bleeding and a pressure dressing and perhaps a sandbag or clamp may be applied. Hives may occur as a result of iodine sensitivity and will require treatment but the priority is the lack of pulses. 22. d. A risk assessment for coronary artery disease (CAD) is determined by comparing the total cholesterol to high- density lipoprotein (HDL) and a ratio can be calculated by dividing the total cholesterol level by the HDL level. The ratio provides more information than either value alone and an increased ratio indicates an increased risk. The female patient has a ratio of 3.56, which is average risk, compared with the male patient's ratio of 6.56, which is increased risk. 23. b, d, e. Increased le vels of cardiac tropinin T (cTnT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein- associated phospholipase A2 are indicators of risk for or evidence of myocardial injury. Increased b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a marker for heart failure and increased CK-creatine kinase (CK)-MM is most commonly associated with skeletal muscle injury. CHAPTER 33 Answer Key 1.

All rights reserved. 2. The vasoconstriction caused by the 1-adrenergic agent raises the BP, stimulating the baroreceptors. The baroreceptors send impulses to the sympathetic vasomotor center in the brainstem, which inhibits the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a decreased heart rate (HR), decreased force of contraction, and vasodilation. 3. The drug will lower BP because of decreased stroke volume and decreased HR, both of which decrease CO. 4. a, c, d, e. Hypertension progresses with increasing age. It is more prevalent in men up to age 45 and above the age of 64 in women. African Americans have a higher incidence of hypertension than do white Americans. Children and siblings of patients with hypertension should be screened and taught about healthy lifestyles. 5. c. Secondary hypertension has an underlying cause that can often be treated, in contrast to primary or essential hypertension, which has no single known cause. Isolated systolic hypertension occurs when the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is consistently elevated over 140 mm Hg but the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remains less than 90 mm Hg, which is more prevalent in older adults. The only type of hypertension that does not cause target organ damage is pseudohypertension. 6. a. Hypertension is often asymptomatic, especially if it is mild or moderate, and has been called the \"silent killer.\" The absence of symptoms often leads to noncompliance with medical treatment and a lack of concern about the disease in patients. With severe hypertension, symptoms usually occur and may include a morning occipital headache, fatigability, dizziness, palpitations, angina, and dyspnea. 7. b. Elevated BP causes the entire inner lining of arterioles to become thickened from hyperplasia of connective tissues in the intima and affects coronary circulation, cerebral circulation, peripheral vessels, and renal and retinal blood vessels. The narrowed vessels lead to ischemia and ultimately to damage of these organs. 8. b. The increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of hypertension directly increases the workload of the heart and heart failure occurs when the heart can no longer pump effectively against the increased resistance. The heart may be indirectly damaged by atherosclerotic changes in the blood vessels, as are the brain, retina, and kidney. 9. Laboratory Test Result Significance Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 48 mg/dL (17.1 mmol/L) Creatinine: 4.3 mg/dL (380 mmol/L)Elevated and creatinine may indicate destruction of glomeruli and tubules of the kidney resulting from hypertension. Serum K+: 3.1 mEq/L (3.1 mmol/L) Serum potassium levels are when hypertension hyperaldosteronism. Serum uric acid: 9.2 mg/dL (547 mmol/L) acid level may be caused by diuretics used to treat hypertension. Fasting blood glucose: 183 mg/dL (10.2 mmol/L) Fasting glucose levels are elevated when hypertension is associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL): 154 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L)An elevated LDL level indicates an increased risk for atherosclerotic changes in the patient with hypertension. 10. a. Dietary modifications to restrict sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fat; maintain intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; and promote weight reduction if overweight b. Daily moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week c. Cessation of smoking (if a smoker) d. Moderation or cessation of alcohol intake; usually medications and monitor BP at home. Also, psychosocial risk factors must be addressed. 11. c. Cardioselective -adrenergic blockers decrease CO, reduce sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, and decrease renin secretion by kidneys. Calcium channel blockers reduce BP by causing blocking movement of calcium into cells, which causes vasodilation of arterioles. Spironolactone blocks the effect of aldosterone. Central adrenergic antagonists such as clonidine (Catapres) inhibit sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS). 12. c. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent the action of angiotensin II and produce vasodilation and increased salt and water excretion. Thiazide diuretics decrease extracellular fluid volume by increasing Na+ and Cl- excretion with water. Direct vasodilators act directly on smooth muscle of arterioles to cause vasodilation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. 13. d. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that causes sodium and potassium loss through the kidneys. High- potassium foods should be included in the diet or potassium supplements should be used to prevent hypokalemia. Enalapril and spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia by inhibiting the action of aldosterone and potassium supplements should not be used by patients taking these drugs. As a combined /-blocker, labetalol does not affect potassium levels. 14. b. Prazosin is an -adrenergic blocker that causes dilation of arterioles and veins and causes orthostatic hypotension. The patient may feel dizzy, weak, and faint when assuming an upright position after sitting or lying down and should be ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 375 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. taught to change positions slowly, avoid standing for long periods, do leg exercises to increase venous return, and lie or sit down when dizziness occurs. Direct-acting vasodilators often cause fluid retention; dry mouth occurs with diuretic use, although orthostatic hypotension may occur with hydrochlorothiazide as well; and centrally acting - and -blockers may cause bradycardia. 15. c. Se xual dysfunction, which can occur with many of the antihypertensive drugs, including thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics and -adrenergic blockers, can be a major reason that a male patient does not adhere to his treatment regimen. It is helpful for the nurse to raise the subject because sexual problems may be easier for the patient to discuss and handle once it has been explained that the drug might be the source of the problem. 16. a, c, e, f. The age-related changes that contrib ute to hypertension include decreased renal function, increased peripheral vascular resistance, increased collagen and stiffness of the myocardium, and decreased elasticity in large arteries from arteriosclerosis. The baroreceptor reflexes are blunted. The adrenergic receptor sensitivity and renin response are both decreased with aging. 17. a. Centrally acting -adrenergic blockers may cause severe rebound hypertension if the drugs are abruptly discontinued and patients should be taught about this effect because many are not consistently compliant with drug therapy. Diuretics should be taken early in the day to prevent nocturia and the profound orthostatic hypotension that occurs with first-dose -adrenergic blockers can be prevented by taking the initial dose at bedtime. Aspirin use may decrease the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors. 18. d. Correct technique in measuring BP includes taking two or more readings at least 1 minute apart. Initially BP measurements should be taken in both arms to detect any differences. If there is a difference, the arm with the higher reading should be used for all subsequent BP readings. The patient may be supine or sitting. The important point is that the arm being used is at the heart level and the cuff needs to fit snugly. 19. b . Unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) may check postural changes in BP as directed. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) may administer antihypertensive medications to stable patients. The RN must monitor the patient receiving IV enalapril (Vasotec), as he or she is in a hypertensive crisis. The RN must also do the teaching related to home BP monitoring. 20. c. Hypertensi ve emergency, a type of hypertensive crisis, is a situation that develops over hours or days in which a patient's BP is severely elevated with evidence of acute target organ disease (e.g., cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, renal, or retinal). The neurologic manifestations are often similar to the presentation of a stroke but do not show the focal or lateralizing symptoms of stroke. Hypertensive crises are defined by the degree of organ damage and how rapidly the BP rises, not by specific BP measurements. A hypertensive urgency is a less severe crisis in which a patient's BP becomes severely elevated over days or weeks but there is no evidence of target organ damage. 21. d. Hypertensi ve crises are treated with IV administration of antihypertensive drugs, including the vasodilators sodium the inhibitor IV enalaprilat; and the calcium channel blocker clevidipine. Sodium nitroprusside is the most effective parenteral drug for hypertensive emergencies. Drugs that are used specifically for hypertensive emergencies include sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin with myocardial infarction, hydralazine with other medications, and oral captopril. 2 2. a. Initially the treatment goal in h ypertensive emergencies is to reduce the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by no more than 20% to 25% in the first hour, with further gradual reduction over the next 24 hours. In this case the MAP is 172, so decreasing it by 25% equals 129. Lowering the BP too far or too fast may cause a stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), visual changes, or renal failure. Only when the patient has an aortic dissection, angina, or signs of MI or an ischemic stroke does the SBP need to be lowered to 100 to 120 mm Hg or less as quickly as possible. 23. d. Hypertensi ve urgencies are often treated with oral drugs on an outpatient basis but it is important for the patient to be seen by a health care professional within 24 hours to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. Hourly urine measurements, titration of IV drugs, and ECG monitoring are indicated for hypertensive emergencies. Case Study 1. Increasing age, which leads to loss of elasticity in lar ge arteries from atherosclerosis, and more prevalent in women (and in African Americans). 2. High sodium intak e from canned foods, sedentary lifestyle, and weight gain. 3 . The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (D ASH) eating plan is rich in fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. In this eating plan there are less salt and sodium, less sweets, less fat, and less red meat than in the typical American diet. Increasing activity and losing weight (if necessary) is encouraged. Increasing calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fiber occurs with the increased fruits and vegetables. 4. Because of K.J. 's low potassium level, a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as spironolactone, amiloride, or triamterine, could be used. If a stronger diuretic were needed, potassium supplementation would be indicated. If an ACE inhibitor were also needed, the diuretic would need to be changed related to additional potassium sparing. 5 . T he nurse should teach K.J. about regular daily aerobic exercise and weight reduction; avoiding canned food and reading labels for sodium content; the need for stress management indicated by weight gain in response to her husband's death and availability of counseling; the pathology, complications, and management of hypertension; and medications and the potential of orthostatic hypotension. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective health maintenance related to increased caloric intake and deficiency of potassium sources Ineffective coping related to use of food as coping mechanism Deficient knowledge related to lack of knowledge of pathology, complications, and management of hypertension and treatment Collaborative problems: Potential complications: cerebro vascular accident, MI, renal failure376 TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 34 Answer Key 1. c. The fibrous plaque stage has progressive changes that can be seen by age 30. Collagen covers the fatty streak and forms a fibrous plaque in the artery. The thrombus adheres to the arterial wall in the complicated lesion stage. Rapid onset of coronary artery disease (CAD) with hypercholesterolemia may be related to familial hypercholesterolemia, not a stage of CAD development. The fatty streak stage is the earliest stage of atherosclerosis and can be seen by age 15. 2. b. The etiology of CAD includes atherosclerosis as the major cause. The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis development is related to endothelial chemical injury and inflammation, which can be the result of tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, toxins, diabetes mellitus, hyperhomocysteinemia, and infection causing a local inflammatory response in the inner lining of the vessel walls. Partial or total occlusion occurs in the complicated lesion stage. Extra collateral circulation occurs in the presence of chronic ischemia. Therefore it is more likely to occur in an older patient. 3. b. This white woman has one unmodifiable risk factor (age) and two major modifiable risk factors (hypertension and physical inactivity). Her gender risk is as high as a man's because she is over 65 years of age. The white man has one unmodifiable risk factor (gender), one major modifiable risk factor (smoking), and one minor modifiable risk factor (stressful lifestyle). The Asian woman has only one major modifiable risk factor (hyperlipidemia) and Asians in the United States have fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) than do whites. The African American man has an unmodifiable risk factor related to age and one major modifiable risk factor (obesity). 4. d. CAD is the number-one killer of American women and women have a much higher mortality rate within 1 year following MI than do men. Smoking carries specific problems for women because smoking has been linked to a decrease in estrogen levels and to early menopause and it has been identified as the most powerful contributor to CAD in women under the age of 50. Fewer women than men present with classic manifestations and women delay seeking care longer than men. Recent research indicates that estrogen replacement does not reduce the risk for CAD, even though estrogen lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. 5. b, c, e. LDLs contain more cholesterol than the other lipoproteins, have an attraction for arterial walls, and correlate most closely with increased incidence of atherosclerosis and CAD. HDLs increase with exercise and carry lipids away from arteries to the liver for metabolism. A high HDL level is associated with a lower risk of CAD. 6. b. Elevated fasting triglyceride levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Apolipoproteins are found in varying amounts on the HDLs and activate enzyme or receptor sites that promote removal of fat from plasma, which is protective. The apolipoprotein A and apolipropotein B ratio must be done to predict CAD. Elevated HDLs are associated with a lower risk of CAD. Elevated total serum cholesterol must be calculated with HDL for a ratio over time to determine an increased risk of CAD. 7. d. All of this patient's results are abnormal. The patient in option c is close to being at risk, as all of that patient's results are at or near the cutoff for being acceptable. If this patient is a woman, the HDL is too low. The other patients' results are at acceptable levels. 8. a. Increased exercise without an increase in caloric intake will result in weight loss, reducing the risk associated with obesity. Exercise increases lipid metabolism and increases HDL, thus reducing CAD risk. Exercise may also indirectly reduce the risk of CAD by controlling hypertension, promoting glucose metabolism in diabetes, and reducing stress. Although research is needed to determine whether a decline in homocysteine can reduce the risk of heart disease, it appears that dietary modifications are indicated for risk reduction. 9. a, c, e. Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet recommendations emphasize reduction in saturated fat and cholesterol intake. Red meats, whole milk products, and eggs as well as butter, stick margarine, lard, and solid shortening should be reduced or eliminated from diets. If triglyceride levels are high, alcohol and simple sugars should be reduced. 10. a. The Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet includes recommendations for all people, not just those with risk factors, to decrease the risk for CAD. 11. c. Diet therapy and smoking cessation are indicated for a patient without CAD who has prehypertension and an LDL level 130 mg/dL. When the patient's LDL level is 160 mg/dL, drug therapy would be added to diet therapy. Because tobacco use is related to increased BP and LDL level, the benefit of smoking cessation is almost immediate. Exercise is indicated to reduce risk factors throughout treatment. 12. c, d, e. Unstable conditions that are manifestations of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The other options are not manifestations of ACS. 13. b, d, e, f. Increased oxygen demand is caused by increasing the workload of the heart, including left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertension, sympathetic nervous stimulation, and anything precipitating angina. Hypovolemia, anemia, and narrowed coronary arteries contribute to decreased oxygen supply. 14. c. When the coronary arteries are occluded, contractility ceases after several minutes, depriving the myocardial cells of glucose and oxygen for aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism begins and lactic acid accumulates, irritating myocardial nerve fibers that then transmit a pain message to the cardiac nerves and upper thoracic posterior roots. The other factors may occur during vessel occlusion but are not the source of pain. 15. c, d. Prinzmetal's angina and microvascular angina may occur in the CAD but with arterial spasm in Prinzmetal's angina or abnormalities of the coronary microcirculation. Silent ischemia is prevalent in persons with diabetes mellitus and contributes to asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Nocturnal angina occurs only at night. Chronic stable angina refers to chest pain that occurs with the same pattern of onset, duration, and intensity intermittently over a long period of time. 16. b, c. Unstable angina is unpredictable and unrelieved by rest and has progressively increasing severity. Chronic stable angina is usually precipitated by exertion. Angina decubitus ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 377 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. occurs when the person is recumbent. Prinzmetal's angina is frequently caused by a coronary artery spasm. 1 7. d. An increased heart rate (HR) decreases the time the heart spends in diastole, which is the time of greatest coronary blood flow. Unlike other arteries, coronary arteries are perfused when the myocardium relaxes and blood backflows from the aorta into the sinuses of Valsalva, which have openings to the right and left coronary arteries. Thus the heart has a decreased oxygen supply at a time when there is an increased oxygen demand. Tachycardia may also lead to ventricular dysrhythmia. The other options are incorrect. 18. b, c, d. Nitrates decrease preload and afterload to decrease the coronary workload and dilate coronary arteries to increase coronary blood supply. The other options are not attributed to nitrates. 19. b . Captopril (Capoten) would be added. It is an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that vasodilates and decreases endothelial dysfunction and prevent ventricular remodeling. Clopidogrel (Plavix) is an antiplatelet agent used as an alternative for a patient unable to use aspirin. Diltiazem (Cardizem), a calcium channel blocker, may be used to decrease vasospasm but is not known to prevent ventricular remodeling. Metoprolol (Lopressor) is a -adrenergic blocker that inhibits sympathetic nervous stimulation of the heart. 20. a. A common complication of nitrates is dizziness caused by orthostatic hypotension, so the patient should sit or lie down and place the tablet under the tongue. The tablet should be allowed to dissolve under the tongue. To prevent the tablet from being swallowed, water should not be taken with it. The recommended dose for the patient for whom nitroglycerin (NTG) has been prescribed is one tablet taken sublingually (SL) or one metered spray for symptoms of angina. If symptoms are unchanged or worse after 5 minutes, the patient should contact the emergency medical services (EMS) system before taking additional NTG. If symptoms are significantly improved by one dose of NTG, instruct the patient or caregiver to repeat NTG every 5 minutes for a maximum of three doses and contact EMS if symptoms have not resolved completely. Headache is also a common complication of nitrates but usually resolves with continued use of nitrates and may be controlled with mild analgesics. 21. a. Orthostatic h ypotension may cause dizziness and falls in older adults taking antianginal agents that decrease preload. Patients should be cautioned to change positions slowly. Daily exercise programs are indicated for older adults and may increase performance, endurance, and ability to tolerate stress. A change in lifestyle behaviors may increase the quality of life and reduce the risks of CAD, even in the older adult. Aspirin is commonly used in these patients and is not contraindicated. 22. c. Unstable angina is associated with the rupture of a once-stable atherosclerotic plaque, exposing the intima to blood and stimulating platelet aggregation and local vasoconstriction with thrombus formation. Patients with unstable angina require immediate hospitalization and monitoring because the lesion is at increased risk of complete thrombosis of the lumen with progression to MI. Any type of angina may be associated with severe pain, ECG changes, and dysrhythmias. Prinzmetal's angina is characterized by coronary artery spasm. 23. a. One of the primary dif ferences between the pain of angina and the pain of an MI is that angina pain is usually relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, which reduces the oxygen demand of the heart, whereas MI pain is not. Both angina and MI pain can cause a pressure or squeezing sensation; may or may not radiate to the neck, back, arms, fingers, and jaw; and may be precipitated by exertion. 24. b . An exercise stress test will reveal ECG changes that indicate impaired coronary circulation when the oxygen demand of the heart is increased. A single ECG is not conclusive for CAD and negative findings do not rule out CAD. Coronary angiography can detect narrowing of coronary arteries but is an invasive procedure. Echocardiograms of various types may identify abnormalities of myocardial wall motion under stress but are indirect measures of CAD. 25. d. The subjecti ve report of the pain from an MI is usually severe. It usually is unrelieved by nitroglycerin, rest, or position change and usually lasts more than the 15 or 20 minutes typical of angina pain. All of the other symptoms may occur with angina as well as with an MI. 26. c. At 10 to 14 days after MI, the myocardium is considered especially vulnerable to increased stress because of the unstable state of healing at this point, as well as the increasing physical activity of the patient. At 2 to 3 days, removal of necrotic tissue is taking place by phagocytic cells. By 4 to 10 days, the necrotic tissue has been cleared and a collagen matrix for scar tissue has been deposited. Healing with scar-tissue replacement of the necrotic area is usually complete by 6 weeks. 27. c. The most common complication of MI is cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring allows identification and treatment of dysrhythmias that may cause further deterioration of the cardiovascular status or death. Measurement of hourly urine output and vital signs is indicated to detect symptoms of the complication of cardiogenic shock. Crackles, dyspnea, and tachycardia may indicate the onset of heart failure. 2 8. b . Heart failure, which can escalate to cardiogenic shock, initially occurs with mild dyspnea, restlessness, agitation, pulmonary congestion with crackles, S 3 or S4 heart sounds, and jugular vein distention. Pericarditis is a common complication identified with chest pain that is aggravated by inspiration, coughing, and moving the upper body. Ventricular aneurysm is manifested with heart failure, dysrhythmias, and angina. Papillary muscle dysfunction is suspected with a new systolic apical murmur. 29. d. Creatine kinase-muscle and brain sub units band (CK- MB) is a tissue enzyme that is specific to cardiac muscle and is released into the blood when myocardial cells die. CK-MB levels begin to rise about 6 hours after an acute MI, peak in about 18 hours, and return to normal within 24 to 36 hours. This increase can identify the presence of and quantify myocardiac damage. Cardiac troponin T and troponin I are released with myocardial damage, rise as quickly as CK-MB does, and remain elevated for 2 weeks. ECG changes are often not apparent immediately after infarct and may be normal when the patient seeks medical attention. An enlarged heart, determined by x-ray, indicates cardiac stress but is not diagnostic of acute MI. 30. c. A dif ferentiation is made between MIs that have ST segment elevations on ECG and those that do not because chest pain accompanied by ST segment elevations 378 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. is associated with prolonged and complete coronary thrombosis and is treated with reperfusion therapy. The other options are incorrect. 31. c. Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) is a treatment used for patients with inoperable CAD. It uses a high-energy laser to create channels in the heart to allow blood to flow to the ischemic area and can be done percutaneously or during surgery with a left anterior thoracotomy incision. A stent is the structure used to hold vessels open and requires anticoagulation following the procedure. Surgical construction of new vessels is done with a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). 32. c. Emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the first treatment for patients with a confirmed MI within 90 minutes of arriving at the facility with an interventional cardiac catheterization lab. Stent placement, CABG, and TMR are usually done to facilitate circulation in non- emergency situations. 33. b. Unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) can check vital signs and report results to the RN. The other actions include assessment, teaching, and monitoring of IV fluids, which are all responsibilities of the RN. 34. c. The most common method of coronary artery bypass involves leaving the internal mammary artery attached to its origin from the subclavian artery but dissecting it from the chest wall and anastomosing it distal to an obstruction in a coronary artery. Synthetic grafts are not commonly used as coronary bypass grafts, although research continues to investigate this option. Saphenous veins are used for bypass grafts when additional conduits are needed. 35. c. Because an NSTEMI is an acute coronary syndrome that indicates a transient thrombosis or incomplete coronary artery occlusion, treatment involves intensive drug therapy with antiplatelets, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, antithrombotics, and heparin to prevent clot extension. In addition, IV nitroglycerin is used. Reperfusion therapy using thrombolytics, CABG, or PCI is used for treatment of STEMI. 36. c. Decreasing level of consciousness (LOC) may reflect hypoxemia resulting from internal bleeding, which is always a risk with thrombolytic therapy. Oozing of blood is expected, as are reperfusion dysrhythmias. BP is low but not considered abnormal because the pulse is within normal range. 37. a. If chest pain is unchanged, it is an indication that reperfusion was not successful. Indications that the occluded coronary artery is patent and blood flow to the myocardium is reestablished following thrombolytic therapy include return of ST segment to baseline on the ECG; relief of chest pain; marked, rapid rise of the CK enzyme within 3 hours of therapy; and the presence of reperfusion dysrhythmias. 38. a. Morphine sulfate decreases anxiety and cardiac workload as a vasodilator and reduces preload and myocardial O2 consumption, which relieves chest pain. Calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and ACE inhibitors will not relieve chest pain related to an MI. 39. c. Docusate sodium (Colace) is a stool softener, which prevents straining and provoking dysrhythmias. It does not do any of the other options. Antidysrhythmics are used to control ventricular dysrhythmias; morphine sulfate is used to decrease cardiac workload and anxiety; and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and antiplatelets prevent the binding of fibrinogen to platelets. 40. b. It is recommended that patients with hypertension and after an MI be on -adrenergic blockers indefinitely to decrease oxygen demand. They inhibit sympathetic nervous stimulation of the heart; reduce heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure; and decrease afterload. Although calcium channel blockers decrease heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure, they are not used unless the patient cannot tolerate -adrenergic blockers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for vasodilation. 41. a. This patient is indicating positive coping with a realization that recovery takes time and that lifestyle changes can be made as needed. The patient who is \"just going to get on with life\" is probably in denial about the seriousness of the condition and the changes that need to be made. Nervous questioning about the expected duration and effect of the condition indicates the presence of anxiety, as does the statement regarding the health care professional's role in treatment. 42. a. 6; b. 4; c. 3; d. 1; e. 5; f. 2. A patient having chest pain needs to have the pain assessed and relieved as quickly as possible. The administration of oxygen may help to relieve the pain. Following an assessment of the pain, medication may be administered. It is important to know if the pain is accompanied by a change in vital signs and if any other manifestations or ECG changes exist before the report is given to the physician. 43. d. Anger about the MI may be directed at family, staff, or the medical regimen. Stating that the chest pain is no big deal is denial. Relaying an inability to care for self relates to dependency. Questioning what will happen if there is another attack is expressing anxiety and fear. Depression may be expressed related to changes in lifestyle. Realistic acceptance is seen with actively engaging in changing modifiable risk factors. 44. a. Golfing is a moderate-energy activity that expends about 5 metabolic equivalent units (METs) and is within the 3 to 5 METs activity level desired for a patient by the time of discharge from the hospital following an MI. Walking at 5 mph and mowing the lawn by hand are high-energy activities and cycling at 13 mph is an extremely high-energy activity. 45. a. Any activity or exercise that causes dyspnea and chest pain should be stopped in the patient with CAD. The training target for a healthy 58-year-old is 80% of maximum HR, or 130 bpm. In a patient with cardiac disease undergoing cardiac conditioning, however, the HR should not exceed 20 bpm over the resting pulse rate. HR, rather than respiratory rate, determines the parameters for exercise. 46. b. Resumption of sexual activity is often difficult for patients to approach and it is reported that most cardiac patients do not resume sexual activity after MI. The nurse can give the patient permission to discuss concerns about sexual activity by introducing it as a physical activity when other physical activities are discussed. Health care providers may have preferences regarding the timing of resumption of sexual activity and the nurse should discuss this with the health care provider and the patient but addressing the patient's concerns is a nursing responsibility. Patients should be informed that impotence after MI is common but that it usually disappears after several attempts. 47. c. It is not uncommon for a patient who experiences chest pain on exertion to have some angina during sexual stimulation or intercourse and the patient should be instructed to use nitroglycerin prophylactically. Positions ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 379 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. during intercourse are a matter of individual choice and foreplay is desirable because it allows a gradual increase in HR. Sildenafil (Viagra) should be used cautiously in men with CAD and should not be used with nitrates. 48. a. Most patients who e xperience sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a result of CAD do not have an acute MI but have dysrhythmias that cause death, probably as a result of electrical instability of the myocardium. To identify and treat those specific dysrhythmias, continuous monitoring is important. The other assessments can be done but are not the most important after an episode of SCD. Case Study 1. Diabetes mellitus, smoking history , obesity, physical inactivity, and stress response. 2. Anxiousness with f ist clutching; radiation of the burning from epigastric area into the sternum; and prior episodes of chest pain with activity, relieved by rest. 3. Pro vide emotional support and explain all interventions and procedures. As well, position her in an upright position, administer oxygen per nasal cannula, obtain vital signs, initiate continuous ECG monitoring, auscultate heart and breath sounds, assess pain using PQRST, medicate as ordered, and obtain baseline laboratory values and a chest x-ray. 4. Depressed ST se gment and T wave inversion would indicate myocardial ischemia. 5. The nurse should inform H.C. that she will ha ve continuous cardiac monitoring while she walks on a treadmill with increasing speed and elevation to evaluate the effects of exercise on the blood supply to her heart. Her pulse, respiration, BP, and heart rhythm will be measured while she walks and after the test until they return to normal and the cardiac monitor will be used after the test until any changes return to normal. 6. This patient does not seem moti vated to assume responsibility for her health and, in the absence of symptoms, has not had a desire to make lifestyle changes. First, the nurse should assist her to clarify her personal values. Then, by explaining the symptoms related to her risk factors and having her identify her personal vulnerability to various risks, the nurse may help her to recognize her susceptibility to CAD. Help the patient to set realistic goals and allow her to choose which risk factor to change first. 7 . A: Antiplatelet, antianginal, and A CE inhibitor or ARB therapy B: -adrenergic blocker and blood pressure control C : Cig arette smoking cessation, cholesterol management, calcium channel blockers, and cardiac rehabilitation D: Diet for weight management, diabetes management, and depression screening E: Education and e xercise F: Flu v accination Many of these measures can be used now to help the patient better manage her current health if she is motivated to do so. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand Anxiety related to possible diagnosis and uncertain future Ineffective denial related to reluctance to receive medical care or change lifestyle Ineffective coping related to lack of effective coping skills Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements related to intake of calories in excess of calorie expenditure Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of health insurance and motivation Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: myocardial inf arction, cardiac 35 Answer Key 1. a, b . Diastolic failure is characterized by abnormal resistance to ventricular filling. Coronary artery disease (CAD), advanced age, and hypertension are all risk factors for heart failure (HF). Ejection fraction is decreased in systolic HF. Dysrthythmia precipitates HF with decreased cardiac output (CO) and increased workload and oxygen requirements of the myocardium. 2.Compensatory Mechanism Cardiac Output Detrimental Effect Cardiac dilation Increased force of contraction by stretching of cardiac muscleOverstrains the muscle fibers; mitral valve incompetence Cardiac hypertrophy Increased contractile force of muscle Increased myocardial oxygen need Sympathetic nervous system stimulationIncreased heart rate (HR) and force of contraction; increased preloadIncreased systemIncreased fluid and maintain blood pressure (BP)Increased preload and afterload Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) Increased w ater retention Increased blood volume when already overloaded380 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 3. c. Both the natriuretic peptides and nitric oxide contribute to vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, and decreased afterload. The natriuretic peptides also increase excretion of sodium by increasing glomerular filtration rate and diuresis (renal effects) as well as interfere with ADH release and inhibit aldosterone and renin secretion (hormonal effects). 4. d. FACES is used to teach patients signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure. F = Fatigue; A = Activity limitations; C = Congestion/cough; E = Edema; S = Shortness of breath. The other options are not correct. 5. b. In left-sided heart failure, blood backs up into the pulmonary veins and capillaries. This increased hydrostatic pressure in the vessels causes fluid to move out of the vessels and into the pulmonary interstitial space. When increased lymphatic flow cannot remove enough fluid from the interstitial space, fluid moves into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and impaired alveolar oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Initially the right side of the heart is not involved. 6. a. Clinical manifestations of acute left-sided heart failure are those of interstitial edema, with bubbling crackles and tachycardia, as well Later frothy, severe dyspnea; and orthopnea develop with alveolar edema. Severe tachycardia and cool, clammy skin are present as a result of stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system from hypoxemia. Systemic edema reflected by jugular vein distention, peripheral edema, and hepatosplenomegaly are characteristic of right-sided heart failure. 7. d. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is awakening from sleep with a feeling of suffocation and a need to sit up to be able to breathe and patients learn that sleeping with the upper body elevated on several pillows helps to prevent PND. Orthopnea is an inability to breathe effectively when lying down and nocturia occurs with heart failure as fluid moves back into the vascular system during recumbency, increasing renal blood flow. 8. a. SpO2 of 84% on 2 L/min via nasal cannula indicates impaired oxygen saturation. The patient is having trouble with gas exchange. Airway and breathing are the priority (follow ABCs). b. The nurse should place the patient in high Fowler's position, assess the patient immediately, recheck SpO2, auscultate breath sounds, assess level of consciousness (LOC), check the oxygen connection and rate setting (2 L/min), and talk with the patient about her or his breathing. 9. b. Thrombus formation occurs in the heart when the chambers do not contract normally and empty completely. Both atrial fibrillation and very low left ventricular output (LVEF <20%) lead to thrombus formation, which is treated with anticoagulants to prevent the release of emboli into the circulation as well as antidysrhythmics or cardioversion to control atrial fibrillation. 10. c. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released from the ventricles in response to increased blood volume in the heart and is a good marker for heart failure. If BNP is elevated, shortness of breath is due to heart failure; if BNP is normal, dyspnea is due to pulmonary disease. BNP opposes the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in vasodilation and reduction in blood volume. Exercise stress testing and cardiac catheterization are more important tests to diagnose coronary artery disease and although the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) may be elevated in heart failure, it is a reflection of decreased renal perfusion. (See Table 32-6.) 11. d. Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine (BiDil) is currently used only with African American patients for hypertension and angina. Captopril (Capoten) is used only for hypertension by all patients. Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid) is used with hydralazine (Apresoline) for patients who cannot tolerate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for heart failure management. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is used for hypertension. 12. c. Nesiritide (Natrecor) is a recombinant form of a natriuretic peptide that decreases preload and afterload by reducing pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and systolic BP which decreases the workload of the heart for short-term emergency treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Digoxin (Lanoxin) requires a loading dose and time to work, so it is not recommended for emergency treatment of ADHF. Morphine sulfate relieves dyspnea but has more adverse events and mortality. Bumetanide (Bumex) will decrease fluid volume but also will decrease potassium levels and activate the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can exacerbate HF symptoms. 13. c. Dopamine (Intropin) is a -adrenergic agonist that is a positive inotrope given IV , not orally, and used for acute HF. Losartan (Cozaar) is an angiotensin II rece ptor blocker used for patients who do not tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Carvedilol (Coreg) is the -adrenergic blocker that blocks the sympathetic nervous system's negative effects on the failing heart. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is the diuretic. 14. b, d. Furosemide is a diuretic that eliminates potassium and spironalactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that retains potassium. The other treatments and medications are used for patients with HF but they do not directly affect serum potassium levels. 15. b. Hypokalemia is one of the most common causes of digitalis toxicity because low serum potassium levels enhance ectopic pacemaker activity. When a patient is receiving potassium-losing diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide, it is essential to monitor the patient's serum potassium levels to prevent digitalis toxicity. Monitoring the heart rate (HR) assesses for complications related to digoxin but does not prevent toxicity. 16. a. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and when it is the only diuretic used in the treatment of heart failure, moderate to low levels of potassium intake should be maintained to prevent development of hyperkalemia. Sodium intake is usually reduced to at least 2400 mg/day in patients with heart failure but salt substitutes cannot be freely used because most contain high concentrations of potassium. Calcium intake is not increased. 17. d. Although all of these drugs may cause hypotension, nitroprusside is a potent dilator of both arteries and veins and may cause such marked hypotension that an inotropic agent (e.g., dobutamine) administration may be necessary to maintain the BP during its administration. Furosemide may cause hypotension because of diuretic-induced depletion of ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 381 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. intravascular fluid volume. Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator and can decrease BP but not as severely as nitroprusside. It primarily dilates veins and increases myocardial oxygen supply. Milrinone has a positive inotropic effect in addition to direct arterial dilation. 18. c. All foods that are high in sodium should be eliminated in a 2400-mg sodium diet, in addition to the elimination of salt during cooking. Examples include obviously salted snack foods as well as pickles, processed prepared foods, and many sauces and condiments. 19. Cardiovascular Condition Leading to HF Preventive Measures Hypertension Use medications, diet, and exercise to control Valvular defects Surgical replacement before heart failure occurs; prophylactic antibiotics Ischemic heart disease Percutaneous coronary intervention bypass surgery; fibrinolytic therapy occlusions Dysrhythmias Antidysrhythmic agents, pacemakers, or defibrillators to control; also adequate treatment of pulmonary hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or myocarditis 20. c. Successful treatment of heart f ailure is indicated by an absence of symptoms of pulmonary edema and hypoxemia, such as clear lung sounds and a normal HR. Weight loss and diuresis, warm skin, less fatigue, and improved LOC may occur without resolution of pulmonary symptoms. Chest pain is not a common finding in heart failure unless coronary artery perfusion is impaired. 21. d. Further teaching is needed if the patient belie ves a weight gain of 2 to 3 pounds in 2 days is an indication for dieting. In a patient with heart failure, this type of weight gain reflects fluid retention and is a sign of heart failure that should be reported to the health care provider. The other options show patient understanding of the heart failure management teaching. (See Table 35-10.) 22. d. The 52-year -old woman does not have any contraindications for cardiac transplantation, even though she lacks the indication of adequate financial resources. The postoperative transplant regimen is complex and rigorous and patients who have not been compliant with other treatments or who might not have the means to understand the care would not be good candidates. A history of drug or alcohol abuse is usually a contraindication to heart transplant. 23. a. Because of the need for long-term immunosuppressant therapy to prevent rejection, the patient with a transplant is at high risk for infection, a leading cause of death in transplant patients. Acute rejection episodes may also cause death in patients with transplants but many can be treated successfully with augmented immunosuppressive therapy. Malignancies occur in patients with organ transplants after taking immunosuppressants for a number of years. Case Study 1. Right-sided HF: jugular frothy pink sputum, BP, and S3, S4 heart sounds Present with both types of HF: f atigue, HR, and dysrhythmias. 2. Nursing interv entions: Calm, reassuring approach because of his anxiety and critical condition Explanations of rationales for all diagnostic tests and medications Administration of oxygen, sitting upright with legs out straight or dependent Emotional and physical rest Constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function Administration of ordered medications per parameters Evaluation and documentation of the effects of medical interventions (i.e., to determine if HF is resolving) Initiation of strict intake and ouput (I&O) measurements and daily weights 3. Appropriate diagnostic procedures include the follo wing: Chest dysrhythmias of conduction disturbances Echocardiogram: to determine the presence of a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography: normal coronary arteries, ventricular pressures Nuclear imaging studies: cardiac contractility, myocardial perfusion, blood gases (ABGs), serum chemistries, cardiac enzymes to assess cardiac damage, BNP level to confirm dyspnea of cardiac source, oxygenation status, liver function tests, renal function tests 4. Continuous ECG monitoring; hemodynamic monitoring (intraarterial BP, SaO2, PAWP, cardiac output); and BP, HR, RR, pulse oximetry, and urine output every hour. 5. The Joint Commission core measures include (1) dischar ge instructions, (2) evaluation of left ventricular systolic function, and (3) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Nursing can be responsible for providing (1) written discharge instructions or teaching material that includes activity level, diet, discharge medications, follow-up appointment, weight monitoring, and symptom management as prescribed. Although smoking cessation counseling is no longer a core measure for heart failure patients, the 40-year history of smoking could make smoking cessation an important topic to include for this patient during hospitalization or at discharge. 382 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. CRT is a pacemaker that will stimulate both the right and left ventricles (chambers) of the heart so that they will contract in coordination (together) to improve the way the heart pumps blood with each heartbeat. 7. Slowing the progression of heart failure is important. Use FACES to remind the patient of the signs and symptoms to watch for and to notify the health care provider about. Weigh self daily. Teach the patient the expected actions of the prescribed medications and the signs of drug toxicity, as well as the dose and time(s) to take them. Teach the patient to take the pulse every day for 1 full minute if he is taking a digitalis preparation or -adrenergic blocker and instruct him on the HR or rhythm at which he should hold the medication and notify the health care provider. If the patient is taking diuretics, he will be taught the symptoms of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. Using the DASH diet, home BP monitoring, oxygen therapy, daily activity simplification and the need for rest after activity, cardiac rehabilitation, the use of telehealth monitoring technology, and home health care may all be needed. An annual flu vaccination should be obtained in the fall and the pneumococcal vaccine should be administered before dismissal. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Death anxiety related to question: \"Am I going to die?\" Impaired gas exchange related to alveolar-capillary membrane changes Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to pump failure Decreased cardiac output related to altered contractility Activity intolerance related to imbalance between oxygen supply and demand Risk for impaired skin integrity related to edema Deficient knowledge related to lack of information about complications, medications, and disease management Deficient nutritional status related to lack of intake Collaborative problems: Potential complications: cardiogenic shock, ventricular dysrhythmias, emboli, liver or renal failure, cardiac arrest CHAPTER 36 Answer Key 1. c. The V1 leads are placed toward each limb and centrally at the fourth intercostal space to the right of the sternal border. Depolarization of the ventricular cells produces the QRS interval on the ECG. The T wave is produced by repolarization of the ventricular cells. Abnormal cardiac impulses from the atria, ventricles, or atrioventricular (A V) junction create ectopic beats. Artifacts are seen with leads or electrodes that are not secure, with muscle activity or electrical interference. The rate produced by the A V node pacing in a junctional escape rhythm is 40 to 60 bpm. If the His-Purkinje system is blocked, the heart rate is 20 to 40 bpm. 2. d, f. The expected PR interval is 0.12 to 0.20 seconds and is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. The T wave is 0.16 seconds, the QRS interval is <0.12 seconds, the P wave is 0.06 to 0.12 seconds, and the QT interval is the time of depolarization and repolarization of the ventricles. 3. 4 (beats per 3 seconds) + 4 = 8 \u00d7 10 = 80 bpm 4. 1500 \u00f7 20 = 75 bpm 5. d. Automaticity describes the ability to discharge an electrical impulse spontaneously. Excitability is a property of myocardial tissue that enables it to be depolarized by an impulse. Contractility is the ability of the chambers to respond mechanically to an impulse. Conductivity is the ability to transmit an impulse along a membrane. 6. b. Refractoriness is the period in which heart tissue cannot be stimulated. Ectopic foci are abnormal electrical impulses. Reentrant excitation causing premature beats may occur when areas of the heart do not repolarize simultaneously with depressed conduction. Depolarization of cardiac cells occurs when sodium migrates rapidly into the cell. 7. d. The normal PR interval is 0.12 to 0.20 seconds and reflects the time taken for the impulse to spread through the atria, A V node and bundle of His, the bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. A PR interval of six small boxes is 0.24 second and indicates that the conduction of the impulse from the atria to the Purkinje fibers is delayed. 8. d. Electrophysiologic testing involves electrical stimulation to various areas of the atrium and ventricle to determine the inducibility of dysrhythmias and frequently induces ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The patient may have \"near-death\" experiences and requires emotional support if this occurs. Dye and anticoagulants are used for coronary angiograms. 9. d. In type II second-degree A V block, a P wave is nonconducted without progressive P-R interval lengthening. It is usually from a block in a bundle branch, occurs in a ratio of 2 P waves-to-1 QRS complex, 3:1, and so on. Atrial fibrillation has a chaotic P wave. Asystole is absence of ventricular activity. First-degree A V block is a prolonged A V conduction time, so the P-R interval is prolonged. 10. d. Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) occurs when there is electrical activity on the ECG but no mechanical activity on assessment and therefore no heart rate. PEA is the most common dysrhythmia seen after defibrillation and may be caused by hypovolemia, hypoxia, metabolic and ventricles is third-degree A V block. 11. c. The premature atrial contraction (PAC) has a distorted P wave that may feel like a skipped beat to the patient. Atrial flutter is an atrial tachydysrhythmia with recurring, regular, saw-toothed flutter waves from the same focus in the right or possibly left atrium. Sinus bradycardia has a regular heart rate less than 100 bpm. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) starts in an ectopic focus above the bundle of His and may be triggered by PAC. If seen, the P wave may have an abnormal shape and has a spontaneous start and termination with a rate of 150 to 220 bpm. 12. b. Third-degree or complete heart block is recognized with the atrial and ventricular dissociation and treated with a pacemaker. Sinus bradycardia does not have atrial and ventricular dissociation. Atrial fibrillation does not have normal P waves, as they are stimulated by ectopic foci. In type 1 second-degree A V heart block the P-R interval gradually lengthens and a QRS complex is dropped. Then the cycle begins again. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 383 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 13. b . When premature ventricular contraction (PVC) falls on the T wave of the preceding beat, R-on-T phenomenon occurs. Because the ventricle is repolarizing and there is increased excitability of cardiac cells, there is an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The other options do not increase this risk. 14. d. Although man y factors can cause a sinus tachycardia, in the patient who has had an acute MI, tachycardia increases myocardial oxygen need in a heart that already has impaired circulation and may lead to increasing angina and further ischemia and necrosis. 1 5. a. A distorted P w ave with normal conduction of the impulse through the ventricles is characteristic of a premature atrial contraction. In a normal heart, this dysrhythmia is frequently associated with emotional stress or the use of caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol. Sedatives rarely slow the heart rate (HR). Aerobic conditioning and holding of breath during exertion (Valsalva maneuver) often cause bradycardia. 16. a. A rh ythm pattern that is normal except for a prolonged P-R interval is characteristic of a first-degree heart block. First-degree heart blocks are not treated but are observed for progression to higher degrees of heart block. Atropine is administered for bradycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is used for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Pacemakers are used for higher-degree heart blocks. 17. b . Symptoms of decreased cardiac output (CO) related to cardiac dysrhythmias include a sudden drop in BP and symptoms of hypoxemia, such as decreased mentation, chest pain, and dyspnea. Peripheral pulses are weak and the HR may be increased or decreased, depending on the type of dysrhythmia present. 18. c. Multifocal PVCs in a patient with an MI indicate significant ventricular irritability that may lead to ventricular tachycardia such as -adrenergic blockers, procainamide, amiodarone, may be used to control the dysrhythmias. Valsalva maneuver may be used to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The nurse must always be ready to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 19. a. PVC is an ectopic beat that causes a wide, distorted QRS complex 0.12 second because the impulse is not conducted normally through the ventricles. Because it is premature, it precedes the P wave and the P wave may be hidden in the QRS complex, or the ventricular impulse may be conducted retrograde and the P wave may be seen following the PVC but the rhythm is not regular. Continuous wide QRS complexes with a ventricular rate between 150 and 250 bpm are seen in ventricular tachycardia, whereas saw-toothed P waves are characteristic of atrial flutter. 2 0. c. The intent of def ibrillation is to apply an electrical current to the heart that will depolarize the cells of the myocardium so that subsequent repolarization of the cells will allow the SA node to resume the role of pacemaker. An artificial pacemaker provides an electrical impulse that stimulates normal myocardial contractions. Synchronized cardioversion involves delivery of a shock that is programmed to occur during the QRS complex of the ECG but this cannot be done during ventricular fibrillation because there is no normal ventricular contraction or QRS complex. 2 1. a. In preparation for def ibrillation the nurse should apply conductive materials (e.g., saline pads, electrode gel, defibrillator gel pads) to the patient's chest to decrease electrical impedance and prevent burns. For defibrillation, the initial shock is 200 joules with biphasic defibrillators and the synchronizer switch used for cardioversion must be turned off. Sedatives may be used before cardioversion if the patient is conscious but the patient in ventricular fibrillation is unconscious. 22. b . If the cardioverter-defibrillator delivers a shock, the patient has experienced a lethal dysrhythmia and needs to notify the cardiologist. The patient will want to lie down to allow recovery from the dysrhythmia. In the event that the patient loses consciousness or there is repetitive firing, a call should be placed to the emergency medical services (EMS) system by anyone who finds the patient. 23. b . The patient should avoid standing near antitheft devices in doorways of department stores and libraries but walking through them at normal pace is fine. High-output electrical generators or large magnets, such as those used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can reprogram pacemakers and should be avoided. Microwave ovens pose no problems to pacemaker function but the arm should not be raised above the shoulder for 1 week after placement of the pacemaker. The pacing current of an implanted pacemaker is not felt by the patient but an external pacemaker may cause uncomfortable chest muscle contractions. 24. a. Until the def ibrillator is available, the patient needs CPR. Defibrillation is needed as soon as possible, so someone should bring the crash cart to the room. Defibrillation would be with 360 joules for monophasic defibrillators and 120 to 200 joules for biphasic defibrillators. Amiodarone is an antidysrhythmic that is part of the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol for ventricular fibrillation. 25. c. Catheter ablation therap y uses radiofrequency energy to ablate or \"burn\" accessory pathways or ectopic sites in the atria, A V node, or ventricles that cause tachydysrhythmias. 26. c. ST se gment elevation indicates injury or infarction of an area of the heart. An inverted T wave is most often associated with ischemia and resolves when blood flow is restored. Occasional PVCs may be normal or may be the result of electrolyte imbalance or hypoxia. They require continued observation. A PR interval of 0.18 second is within normal range. 2 7. d. One of the most common causes of syncope is neurocardiogenic syncope, or \"vasovagal\" syncope. In this type of syncope there is accentuated adrenergic activity in the upright position, with intense activation of cardiopulmonary receptors resulting in marked bradycardia and hypotension. Normally testing with the upright tilt table causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and compensation to increase CO and maintain BP when blood pools in the extremities. However, patients with neurocardiogenic syncope experience a marked decrease in BP and HR. 28. d. ST se gment elevation is seen in myocardial injury. An absent or buried P wave can occur with PVCs, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. A wide pathologic Q wave may be seen with infarction. T wave inversion may be seen with cardiac ischemia or within hours following an MI.384 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 29. a.

Ensure ABCs, administer oxygen (O2), obtain baseline vital signs and O2 saturation, obtain 12-lead ECG, initiate continuous ECG monitoring, identify rate and rhythm and any dysrhythmia, establish IV access, and be prepared for CPR as with all patients. 3. During atrial fibrillation there is total disorganization of atrial electrical activity and no effective atrial contraction. Fibrillatory waves or undulations occur at a rate of 300 to 600 per minute in the atria and although not all electrical activity is conducted to the ventricles, the ventricular rate is usually 100 to 160 bpm and irregular when there is an uncontrolled ventricular response. \"Atrial kick\" is lost and the result is a 15% to 20% decrease in CO. CO is also decreased due to tachycardia. 4. Atrial rhythm is chaotic and although no definite P wave can be observed, fibrillatory waves can be seen as a jagged, irregular baseline between QRS complexes. The P-R interval cannot be measured. The ventricular rhythm is usually irregular but QRS complexes are usually of normal contour. 5. The immediate goal of drug therapy is to decrease the rapid ventricular response to the atrial fibrillation to less than 100 bpm because it leads to decreased CO. 6. Diltiazem is indicated for treatment of atrial fibrillation because it decreases the automaticity of the SA node, as it inhibits the influx of calcium ions during depolarization of cardiac cells and slows the A V nodal conduction time, decreasing the ventricular response. Since this patient is unstable, a bolus dose would be ordered followed by a continuous drip and then oral drugs would be started. Digoxin is used to treat atrial fibrillation because it decreases the ventricular response by increasing the refractory period of the A V node and it also decreases atrial automaticity. Lovenox and Coumadin are used to prevent thrombus formation or extension in the atria where blood pools because of ineffective atrial contraction. If thrombi form in the left atria, arterial embolization may occur causing a stroke or MI or deep vein thrombosis. 7. Cardioversion may be used to convert the fibrillation to a normal sinus rhythm. Cardioversion is administered with an initial dose of 70 to 75 joules with biphasic defibrillator and 100 joules with monophasic defibrillator synchronized with the QRS complex of the ECG and the patient may be sedated before the procedure. If medications and cardioversion do not convert the rhythm, radiofrequency catheter ablation or the Maze procedure may be used. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Decreased cardiac output related to dysrhythmia Activity intolerance related to inadequate cardiac output Impaired gas exchange related to alveolar-capillary membrane changes Anxiety related to vulnerability and cardiac disease Collaborative problems: Potential complications: embolism, heart failure, cardiogenic shock CHAPTER 37 Answer Key 1. a, b, c, d, e. Recent dental, urologic, surgical, or gynecologic procedures and history of IV drug abuse, heart disease, cardiac catheterization or surgery, renal dialysis, and infections all increase the risk of infective endocarditis. 2. a. Blood cultures are the primary diagnostic tool for infective endocarditis. Although a complete blood count (CBC) will reveal a mild leukocytosis, this is a nonspecific finding. Transesophageal echocardiograms can identify vegetations on valves but are used when blood cultures are negative. Cardiac catheterizations are used when surgical intervention is being considered. 3. a. Petechiae are seen as small hemorrhages in the conjunctiva, lips, and buccal mucosa and over the ankles, feet, and antecubital and popliteal areas. Roth's spots are hemorrhagic retinal lesions seen with funduscopic examination. Osler's nodes are lesions on the fingertips or toes. The cause of Roth's spots and Osler's nodes is not clear. Splinter hemorrhages are black longitudinal streaks that occur on nail beds. They may be caused by vessel damage from vasculitis or microemboli. 4. d. Janeway's lesions are flat, painless, small red spots found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Black streaks on the nails are splinter hemorrhages. Hemorrhagic retinal lesions are Roth's spots. Painful lesions on the fingers and toes are Osler's nodes. 5. b. Early valve replacement followed by prolonged antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy is recommended for these patients. Drug therapy for patients who develop endocarditis of prosthetic valves is often unsuccessful in eliminating the infection and preventing embolization. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 385 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. c. The dyspnea, crackles, and restlessness that the patient is manifesting are symptoms of heart failure and decreased cardiac output (CO) that occurs in up to 80% of patients with aortic valve endocarditis as a result of aortic valve incompetence. Vegetative embolization from the aortic valve occurs throughout the arterial system and may affect any body organ. Pulmonary emboli occur in right-sided endocarditis. 7. d. The patient with outpatient antibiotic therap y requires vigilant home nursing care and it is most important to determine the adequacy of the home environment for successful management of the patient. The patient is at risk for life-threatening complications, such as embolization and pulmonary edema, and must be able to access a hospital if needed. Bed rest will not be necessary for the patient without heart damage. Avoiding infections and planning diversional activities are indicated for the patient but are not the most important factors while he is on outpatient antibiotic therapy. 8. d. Proph ylactic antibiotic therapy should be initiated before invasive dental, medical, or surgical procedures to prevent recurrence of endocarditis. Continuous antibiotic therapy is indicated only in patients with implanted devices or ongoing invasive procedures. Symptoms of infection should be treated promptly but antibiotics are not used for exposure to infection. 9. c. The stethoscope diaphragm at the left sternal border with the patient leaning forward is the best method to use to hear the high-pitched, grating sound of a pericardial friction rub. The sound does not radiate widely and occurs with the heartbeat. To differentiate a pericardial friction rub from a pleural friction rub, have the patient hold his or her breath. The rub will still be heard if it is cardiac in nature. 10. b . The patient is experiencing a cardiac tamponade that consists of excess fluid in the pericardial sac, which compresses the heart and the adjoining structures, preventing normal filling and cardiac output. Fibrin accumulation, a scarred and thickened pericardium, and adherent pericardial membranes occur in chronic constrictive pericarditis. 11. b, e. Pulsus paradoxus is measured with a manually operated sphygmomanometer. The cuff is deflated slowly until the first Korotkoff sound during expiration is heard and the number is noted. The slow deflation of the cuff is continued until sounds are heard throughout the respiratory cycle and that number is subtracted from the first number. When the difference is >10 mm Hg, cardiac tamponade may be present. The difference is normally <10 mm Hg. 12. b . Pneumothorax may occur as a needle is inserted into the pericardial space to remove fluid for analysis and relieve cardiac pressure with pericardiocentesis. Other complications could include dysrhythmias, further cardiac tamponade, myocardial laceration, and coronary artery laceration. 1 3. d. Relief from pericardial pain is often obtained by sitting u p and leaning forward. Pain is increased by lying flat. The pain has a sharp, pleuritic quality that changes with respiration and patients take shallow breaths. Antiinflammatory medications may also be used to help control pain but opioids are not usually indicated. 14. b . Viruses are the most common cause of myocarditis in the United States and early manifestations of myocarditis are often those of systemic viral infections. Myocarditis may also be associated with systemic inflammatory and metabolic disorders as well as with other microorganisms, drugs, or toxins. The patient with myocarditis is predisposed to drug-related dysrhythmias and toxicity with digoxin, so it is used very cautiously, if at all, in treatment of the condition. 1 5. d. Initial attacks of rheumatic fe ver and the development of rheumatic heart disease can be prevented by adequate treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Because streptococcal infection accounts for only about 20% of acute pharyngitis, cultures should be done to identify the organism and direct antibiotic therapy. Viral infections should not be treated with antibiotics. Prophylactic therapy is indicated in those who have valvular heart disease or have had rheumatic heart disease. 16. a. Major criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fe ver include evidence of carditis, polyarthritis, chorea (often very late), erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. Minor criteria include all laboratory findings as well as fever, arthralgia, and a history of previous rheumatic fever. There also must be evidence of a previous group A streptococci infection (e.g., positive antistreptolysin O titer). 17. 18. b . When carditis is present in the patient with rheumatic fever, ambulation is postponed until any symptoms of heart failure are controlled with treatment and full activity cannot be resumed until antiinflammatory therapy has been discontinued. In the patient without cardiac involvement, ambulation may be permitted as soon as acute symptoms have subsided and normal activity can be resumed when antiinflammatory therapy is discontinued. 19. d. V alvular regurgitation causes a backward flow of blood and volume overload in the preceding chamber. Without treatment, eventually hypertrophy of that chamber occurs. Stenosis causes a pressure gradient difference and decreased blood flow and hypertrophy of the preceding chamber. A pericardial friction rub is not related to valvular regurgitation but would be heard at the lower left sternal border of the chest. Drug Rationale for Use Antibiotics To eliminate any residual group A -hemolytic streptococci; prevent spread of infection; prevent recurrent infection Aspirin Antiinflammatory effect to control fever and arthritic and joint manifestations Corticosteroids Antiinflammatory effect to control fever and inflammation of severe carditis Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)Antiinflammatory effect to control fever and joint manifestations386 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 20. c. Monitoring vital signs before and after ambulation is the collection of data. Instructions should be provided to the licensed practical nurse (LPN) regarding what changes in these vital signs should be reported to the RN. The other actions listed are RN responsibilities. 21. c. Mitral valve prolapse is the ballooning of the valve leaflets into the left atrium during ventricular systole. The rapid onset that prevents left chamber dilation and the rapid development of pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock occur with acute mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary hypertension may contribute to tricuspid valve disease. 22. d. Acute aortic regurgitation causes a sudden cardiovascular collapse. With mitral valve stenosis dyspnea is a prominent symptom and embolization may result from chronic atrial fibrillation. With tricuspid and pulmonic valve diseases, stenosis occurs more often than regurgitation. Tricuspid valve stenosis results in right atrial enlargement and elevated systemic venous pressures. Pulmonic valve stenosis results in right ventricular hypertension and hypertrophy. 23. b. Aortic valve stenosis is identified with the triad of angina, syncope, and dyspnea on exertion, as well as the systolic murmur and prominent S 4 heart sound. Mitral valve stenosis manifests as exertional dyspnea, regurgitation a new systolic murmur with pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock rapidly developing. Chronic mitral valve regurgitation is identified with weakness, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, palpitations, an S 3 gallop, and holosystolic murmur. 24. b. Patients with mechanical valves have an increased risk for thrombus formation. Therefore prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is used to prevent thrombus formation and systemic or pulmonary embolization. Nitrates are contraindicated for the patient with aortic stenosis because an adequate preload is necessary to open the stiffened aortic valve. Antidysrhythmics are used only if dysrhythmias occur and -adrenergic blocking drugs may be used to control the heart rate if needed. 25. b. Dysrhythmias frequently cause palpitations, lightheadedness, and dizziness and the patient should be carefully attended to to prevent falls. Hypervolemia and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) would be apparent in the patient with heart failure. Exercises will not prevent dysrhythmias. 26. c. This procedure has been used for repair of mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic stenosis and less often for aortic stenosis. It is usually used for older patients and for those patients who are poor surgical risks because it is relatively easy and has good results and few complications. 27. c. Repair of mitral or tricuspid valves has a lower operative mortality rate than does replacement and is becoming the surgical procedure of choice for these valvular diseases. Open repair is more precise than closed repair and requires cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery. All types of valve surgery are palliative, not curative, and patients require lifelong health care. Anticoagulation therapy is used for all valve surgery for at least some time postoperatively. 28. c. Mechanical prosthetic valves require long-term anticoagulation and this is a factor in making a decision about the type of valve to use for replacement. Patients who cannot take anticoagulant therapy, such as women of childbearing age, patients at risk for hemorrhage, patients who may not be compliant with anticoagulation therapy, and patients over age 65 may be candidates for the less durable biologic valves. 29. d. The greatest risk to a patient who has an artificial valve is the development of endocarditis with invasive medical or dental procedures. Before any of these procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary to prevent infection. Planning of an exercise program and monitoring anticoagulant therapy will be done. 30. b. A secondary cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy (CMP) is radiation treatment to the thorax with stiffness of the ventricular wall occurring. Dilated CMP may have a genetic link, follow infectious myocarditis, or be related to an autoimmune process or excess alcohol ingestion. Takotsubo CMP is an acute stress-related syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is most common in postmenopausal women. Hypertrophic CMP has a genetic link in about one half of all cases and is frequently seen in young athletic individuals. 31. d, e, f. Dilated CMP, the most common type of CMP, reveals cardiomegaly with thin ventricular walls on echocardiogram, as there is no ventricular hypertrophy, and may follow an infective myocarditis. As well, stasis of blood in the ventricles may contribute to systemic embolization. Restrictive CMP is the least common type and is characterized by ventricular stiffness. Hypertrophic CMP has hyperdynamic systolic function creating a diastolic failure, is characterized by massive thickening of intraventricular septum and ventricular wall, and may result in syncope during increased activity resulting from an obstructed aortic valve outflow. 32. c. Nursing interventions for the patient with hypertrophic CMP are to improve ventricular filling by reducing ventricular contractility and relieving left ventricular outflow obstruction to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Strenuous activity and dehydration will increase systemic vascular resistance and should be avoided. Atrioventricular pacing will allow the septum to move away from the left ventricular wall and reduce the degree of outflow obstruction. Vasodilators may decrease venous return and further increase obstruction of blood flow from the heart. The surgery that could be done involves cutting into the thickened septal wall and removing some of the ventricular muscle. 33. a, c, d, e, f. These topics can apply to any patient with CMP. Case Study 1. His age (incidence is higher in older adults) and the invasive endoscopic cholecystectomy. 2. Mitral valve prolapse and degenerative valve lesions (calcification degeneration of a bicuspid aortic valve or senile calcification degeneration of a normal aortic valve). 3. Stroke symptoms: Embolization of vegetations to cerebral circulation with cerebral infarction Petechiae: Occur as a result of fragmentation and microembolization of vegetative lesions New systolic, crescendo-decrescendo murmur: Aortic valve patients with infective endocarditis 4. The endoscopic surgery provided a route for introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream to trigger the infectious process. 5.

Identif ication of the organism with blood cultures and appropriate IV antibiotic therapy; antipyretics to control fever; rest, with increase in activity after fever abates and if there are no symptoms of heart failure; and valve replacement if there is no response to antibiotic therapy. 7. Preoperati ve prophylactic antibiotic therapy. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Hyperthermia related to infection, elevated temperature Decreased cardiac output related to valvular insufficiency Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: emboli, heart f ailure CHAPTER 38 Answer Key 1. d. Re gardless of the location, atherosclerosis is responsible for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is related to other cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid artery disease. Venous thrombosis, venous stasis ulcers, and pulmonary embolism are diseases of the veins and are not related to atherosclerosis. 2. 102 \u00f7 132 = 0.77; mild (see T able 38-3) 3. c. Oral anticoagulants (w arfarin) are not recommended for treatment of PAD but all of the other statements are correct in relation to treatment of PAD. 4. a, c, e. W arm legs and feet increase circulation. The lower extremities should be assessed at regular intervals for changes. Walking exercise increases oxygen extraction in the legs and improves skeletal muscle metabolism. The patient with PAD should walk at least 30 minutes a day, preferably twice a day. Exercise should be stopped when pain occurs and resumed when the pain subsides. Nicotine in all forms causes vasoconstriction and must be eliminated. 5. b . PAD occurs as a result of atherosclerosis and the risk factors are the same as for other diseases associated with atherosclerosis, such as CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and aneurysms. Major risk factors are tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, elevated C-reactive protein, diabetes mellitus, and uncontrolled hypertension. The risk for amputation is high in patients with severe occlusive disease but this is not the best approach to encourage patients to make lifestyle modifications. 6. c. Loss of palpable pulses, numbness and tingling of the extremity, extremity pallor, cyanosis or cold, and decreasing ankle-brachial indices are indications of occlusion of the bypass graft and need immediate medical attention. Pain, redness, and serous drainage at the incision site are expected postoperatively. 7. a. P ain; b. pallor; c. pulselessness; d. paresthesia; e. paralysis; f. poikilothermia. The physician requires immediate notification to begin immediate intervention to prevent tissue necrosis and gangrene. 8. b, d, f. Arterial le g ulcers and/or gangrene of the leg due to PAD and chronic ischemic rest pain lasting more than 2 weeks characterize critical limb ischemia. Optimal therapy is revascularization via bypass surgery. 9. a, b, c, d, f. Raynaud' s phenomenon is predominant in young females and may be associated with autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus). Incidents occur with cold, emotional upsets, and caffeine or tobacco use due to vasoconstrictive effects. Small cutaneous arteries are involved and cause color changes of the fingertips or toes. When conservative management is ineffective, it may be treated with nifedipine (Procardia). 10. d. The fusiform aneurysm is circumferential and relati vely uniform in shape. The false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is not an aneurysm but a disruption of all of the arterial wall layers with bleeding that is contained by surrounding anatomic structures. Saccular aneurysms are the pouchlike bulge of an artery. 11. c. Although most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are asymptomatic, on physical examination a pulsatile mass in the periumbilical area slightly to the left of the midline may be detected and bruits may be audible with a stethoscope placed over the aneurysm. Hoarseness and dysphagia may occur with aneurysms of the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. Severe back pain with flank ecchymosis is usually present on rupture of an AAA and neurovascular loss in the lower extremities may occur from pressure of a thoracic aneurysm. 12. d. A computed tomograph y (CT) scan is the most accurate test to determine the diameter of the aneurysm and whether a thrombus is present. The other tests may also be used but the CT scan yields the most descriptive results. 13. b . Increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) continually puts pressure on the diseased area of the artery, promoting its expansion. Small aneurysms can be treated by decreasing blood pressure (BP), modifying atherosclerosis risk factors, and monitoring the size of the aneurysm. Anticoagulants are used during surgical treatment of aneurysms but physical activity is not known to increase their size. Calcium intake is not related to calcification in arteries. 14. b . Because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, the patient with an AAA is likely to have cardiac, pulmonary, cerebral, or lower extremity vascular problems that should be noted and monitored throughout the perioperative period. Postoperatively, the BP is balanced: high enough to keep adequate flow through the artery to prevent thrombosis but low enough to prevent bleeding at the surgical site. 15. a. W ith the aortic cross-clamping proximal and distal to the aneurysm, the open aneurysm repair (OAR) above the renal artery may cause kidney injury from lack of blood flow during the surgery. The saccular aneurysm may involve excising only the weakened area of the artery and suturing the artery closed but this will not decrease renal blood flow. Renal blood flow will not be directly obstructed using the bifurcated graft or the minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair. 16. a. Usually aortic sur gery patients will have a bowel preparation, skin cleansing with an antimicrobial agent on the day before surgery, nothing by mouth after midnight on the day of the surgery, and IV antibiotics immediately before the incision is made. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease will receive a -adrenergic blocker preoperatively to reduce morbidity and mortality. Each surgeon's protocol may be different.388 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 17. b. The BP and peripheral pulses are evaluated every hour in the acute postoperative period to ensure that BP is adequate and that extremities are being perfused. BP is kept within normal range. If BP is too low, thrombosis of the graft may occur; if it is too high, it may cause leaking or rupture at the suture line. Hypothermia is induced during surgery but the patient is rewarmed as soon as surgery is completed. Fluid replacement to maintain urine output at 100 mL/hr would increase the BP too much and only 30 mL/hr of urine is needed to show adequate renal perfusion. 18. c. During repair of an AAA, the blood supply to the carotid arteries may be interrupted, leading to neurologic complications manifested by a decreased level of consciousness (LOC) and altered pupil responses to light as well as changes in facial symmetry, speech, and movement of the upper extremities. The thorax is opened for ascending aortic surgery and shallow breathing, poor cough, and decreasing chest drainage are expected. Often, lower limb pulses are normally decreased or absent for a short time following surgery. 19. d. Decreased or absent pulses in conjunction with cool, painful extremities below the level of repair indicate graft thrombosis. Cardiac dysrhythmias or chest pain indicates myocardial ischemia. Absent bowel sounds, abdominal distention, diarrhea, or bloody stools indicate bowel infarction. Increased temperature and white blood cells, surgical site inflammation, or drainage indicates graft infection. 20. b. The decreasing urine output is evidence that either the patient needs volume or there is reduced renal blood flow. The physician will want to be notified as soon as possible of this change in condition and may order laboratory tests. The other options are incorrect. 21. d. Patients are taught to palpate peripheral pulses to identify changes in their quality or strength but the rate is not a significant factor in peripheral perfusion. The color and temperature of the extremities are also important for patients to observe. The remaining statements are all true. 22. c. The onset of an aortic dissection involving the distal descending aorta is usually characterized by a sudden, severe, tearing pain in the back; as it progresses down the aorta, the kidneys, abdominal organs, and lower extremities may begin to show evidence of ischemia. Aortic dissections of the ascending aorta and aortic arch may affect the heart and circulation to the head, with the development of cerebral ischemia, murmurs, ventricular failure, and pulmonary edema. 23. a. Although most initial treatment for aortic dissection involves a period of lowering the BP and myocardial contractility to diminish the pulsatile forces in the aorta, immediate surgery is indicated when complications (such as occlusion of the carotid arteries) occur. Anticoagulants would prolong and intensify the bleeding and blood is administered only if the dissection ruptures. 24. a. Relief of pain is an indication that the dissection has stabilized and it may be treated conservatively for an extended time with drugs that lower the BP and decrease myocardial contractility. Surgery is usually indicated for dissection of the ascending aorta or if complications occur. 25. b, d, e, f. Arterial disease is manifested in thick, brittle nails; decreased peripheral pulses; pallor when the legs are elevated; and ulcers over bony prominences on the toes and feet, as well as paresthesia. The other options are characteristic of venous disease and paresthesia could occur with venous thromboembolism (VTE). 26. b. If left untreated, a superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) may extend to deeper veins and VTE may occur. VTE may embolize to the lungs and have tenderness to pressure and edema. SVTs usually occur in superficial leg veins and have tenderness, itchiness, redness, warmth, pain, inflammation, and induration along the course of the superficial vein. 27. a, b, d, e, f. This patient is a smoker and on hormone therapy, both of which increase blood hypercoagulability. She will have an IV , which can cause VTE by damaging the venous endothelium. She is an older patient who has had an orthopedic surgery and may have experienced prolonged immobility postinjury and through her \"lengthy hip replacement surgery,\" which contributes to venous stasis. These are representative of Virchow's triad in this patient. The other options are also related to Virchow's triad but not present in this patient via the transfer report. 28. a. With manifestations of a VTE, the D-dimer is drawn to determine if a VTE exists and the duplex ultrasound is most widely used to diagnose VTE by identifying where a thrombus is located and its extent. 29. c. The RN could delegate to the unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) the task to remind the patient to flex and extend the legs and feet every 2 hours while in bed. Measuring for elastic compression stockings may be delegated to the licensed practical nurse (LPN). The RN must assess and teach the patient. 30. d. Prevention of emboli formation can be achieved by bed rest and limiting movement of the involved extremity until the clot is stable, inflammation has receded, and anticoagulation is achieved. Dangling the legs promotes venous stasis and further clot formation and elevating the affected limb will promote venous return but it does not prevent embolization. 31. d. Low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin [Fraxiparine]) is only given and does not require routine coagulation testing. Unfractionated heparin is the only other indirect thrombin inhibitor option but it can be given subcutaneously or IV and therapeutic effects must be monitored with coagulation testing. 32. a, e. Warfarin (Coumadin) is a vitamin K antagonist, so vitamin K is the antidote. It is monitored with the international normalized ratio (INR). It is only administered orally. Protamine sulfate is the antidote for unfractionated heparin (Heparin), which can be administered subcutaneously or IV and is monitored with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Hirudin derivatives are given IV or subcutaneously, do not have an antidote, and are also monitored with aPTT. Argatroban (Acova), a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor, is given only IV and is monitored with aPTT. Factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux (Arixtra) is given coagulation testing. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), another factor Xa inhibitor, is given 33. b. Anticoagulant therapy with heparin or warfarin (Coumadin) does not dissolve clots but prevents propagation of the clot, development of new thrombi, and embolization. Clot lysis occurs naturally through the body's intrinsic fibrinolytic system or by the administration of fibrinolytic agents. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 389 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 34. d. Ex ercise programs for patients recovering from VTE should emphasize swimming, which is particularly beneficial because of the gentle, even pressure of the water. Coumadin will not blacken stools. If this occurs, it could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. Dark green and leafy vegetables have high amounts of vitamin K and should not be increased during Coumadin therapy but they do not need to be restricted. The legs must not be massaged because of the risk for dislodging any clots that may be present. 35. a. During w alking, the muscles of the legs continuously knead the veins, promoting movement of venous blood toward the heart. Walking is the best measure to prevent venous stasis. The other methods will help venous return but they do not provide the benefit that ambulation does. 36. a. 2; b . 7; 5; h. 3; i. 8 37. b . Although leg elevation, moist dressings, and topical antibiotics are useful in treatment of venous stasis ulcers, the most important factor appears to be elastic compression stockings, which provide extrinsic compression to minimize venous stasis, venous hypertension, and edema. Case Study 1. Male gender , age, smoking history, and history of atherosclerosis with CAD. 2. The primary causes of an AAA are de generative, congenital, mechanical, inflammatory, or infections. This patient's atherosclerosis causes degenerative changes in the media lining of the aorta. The changes lead to loss of elasticity, weakening, and eventual dilation of the aorta. 3. The se vere back pain and the shock symptoms: HR 114 bpm; BP 88/68; and cool, clammy extremities. 4. The f irst priority is to control the bleeding, which will require immediate surgical repair of the aneurysm. Fatal hemorrhage is likely if the bleeding is not controlled. If shock continues to develop, resuscitation will also be needed. 5. The patient most lik ely will be taken to surgery from the emergency department and emergency departments are not the most private or supportive environments. It is important for the nurse to provide privacy as much as possible and allow the patient and family to be together and ask questions as necessary. The nurse should also provide explanations of the procedures and interventions that are being implemented, explain the many tubes that will be connected to the patient postoperatively in the intensive care unit (ICU), and be supportive during this critical time. 6. Conserv ative therapy of small, asymptomatic AAAs consists of risk modification: tobacco cessation, decreasing BP, optimizing lipid profile, and annual monitoring of aneurysm size with ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Growth rates may be lowered with -adrenergic blocking drugs, statins, and antibiotics. The only effective treatment for AAA is surgery and the only way to prevent rupture is to repair the aneurysm surgically before it ruptures. Surgical repair is generally required when the aneurysm is greater than or equal to 5.5 cm for men and greater than or equal to 5 cm for women. 7. After AAA repair , discharge teaching will include a gradual increase of activities. Fatigue, poor appetite, irregular bowel habits, and sexual dysfunction in male patients are common. The patient should avoid heavy lifting for 6 weeks after surgery and report to the health care provider any redness, swelling, increased pain, drainage from incisions, or fever greater than 100 oF (37.8 oC). The patient should also report changes in color or warmth of extremities and decreased strength of peripheral pulses. He should eat a well-balanced diet with protein, vitamins C and A, and zinc; high-fiber foods; fresh fruits and vegetables; fewer high-fat foods; and reduced salt intake. Follow-up visits and routine CT or MRI scans will be done to monitor for complications. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to compression of internal structures with blood Decreased cardiac output related to hypovolemia Deficient knowledge related to lack of information about surgical aneurysm repair and postoperative care Collaborati ve gan ischemia, hypovolemic shock, myocardial infarction CHAPTER 39 Answer Key 1. P arotid gland; b. submandibular saliva gland; duct; f. duodenum; pancreas (tail); j. c. The parasympathetic nerv ous system stimulates activity of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, increasing motility and secretions and relaxing sphincters to promote movement of contents. A drug that blocks this activity decreases secretions and peristalsis, slows gastric emptying, and contracts sphincters. The enteric nervous system of the GI tract is modulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic influence. 4. d. Cholec ystokinin is secreted by the duodenal mucosa when fats and amino acids enter the duodenum and stimulate the gallbladder to release bile to emulsify the fats for digestion. The bile is produced by the liver but stored in the gallbladder. Secretin is responsible for stimulating pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and gastrin increases gastric motility and acid secretion. 5. c. The stomach secretes intrinsic f actor, necessary for cobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption in the intestine. When part or all of the stomach is removed, cobalamin must be supplemented for life. The other options will not be a problem. 6. d. When food enters the stomach and duodenum, the gastrocolic and duodenocolic reflexes are initiated and are more active after the first daily meal. Additional laxatives or laxative abuse contribute to constipation in older adults. Decreasing food intake is not recommended, as many older adults have a decreased appetite. Fiber and fluids should be increased.390 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 7. b, c. Pepsinogen is changed to pepsin by acidity of the stomach, where it begins to break down proteins. Gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion and motility and maintains lower esophageal sphincter tone. The stomach also secretes lipase for fat digestion. Bile is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder for emulsifying fats. Maltase is secreted in the small intestine and converts maltose to glucose. Secretin is secreted by the duodenal mucosa and inhibits gastric motility and acid secretion. Amylase is secreted in the small intestine and by the pancreas for carbohydrate digestion. 8. a. Bacteria in the colon (1) synthesize vitamin K, which is needed for the production of prothrombin by the liver and (2) deaminate undigested or nonabsorbed proteins, producing ammonia, which is converted to urea by the liver. A reduction in normal flora bacteria by antibiotic therapy can lead to decreased vitamin K, resulting in decreased prothrombin and coagulation problems. Bowel bacteria do not influence protein absorption or the secretion of mucus. 9. c. The ampulla of Vater is the site where the pancreatic duct and common bile duct enter the duodenum and the opening and closing of the ampulla is controlled by the sphincter of Oddi. Because bile from the common bile duct is needed for emulsification of fat to promote digestion and pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas are needed for digestion of all nutrients, a blockage at this point would affect the digestion of all nutrients. Gastric contents pass into the duodenum through the pylorus or pyloric valve. 10. The bilirubin from hemoglobin (Hgb) is insoluble (unconjugated) and attached to albumin in the blood, removed by the liver, combined with glucuronic acid to become soluble (conjugated), and excreted in bile into the intestine. Bowel bacteria convert some of the bilirubin to urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is absorbed into the blood and a small amount of urobilinogen is excreted by the kidneys in urine, with the rest being removed by the liver and reexcreted in the bile. 11. d. There is decreased tone of the lower esophageal sphincter with aging and regurgitation of gastric contents back into the esophagus occurs, causing heartburn and belching. There is a decrease in hydrochloric acid secretion with aging. Jaundice and intolerance to fatty foods are symptoms of liver or gallbladder disease and are not normal age-related findings. 12. Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Response to GI Problem Health perception-health management Excessive alcohol intake, smoking, exposure to hepatotoxins, recent foreign travel, family history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or breast cancer. Nutritional-metabolic Anorexia and weight loss, excessive weight gain, inadequate diet Elimination Change in bowel patterns, laxative or enema use, decreased fluid or fiber intake, external drainage systems Activity-exercise Immobility, weakness, fatigue, inability to procure and prepare food, inability to feed self Sleep-rest Interruption of sleep with GI symptoms Cognitive-perceptual Changes in taste or smell, use of pain medications, sensory problems that interfere with food preparation or intake Self-perception-self-concept Self-esteem and body image problems related to weight, symptoms affecting appearance Role-relationship Loss of employment because of chronic illness, altered relationships with others Sexuality-reproductive Anorexia, obesity, alcohol intake, decreased acceptance by sexual partner Coping-stress tolerance GI problems or symptoms induced by stress, depression Value-belief Religious dietary restrictions, vegetarianism 13. c. A thin, white coating of the dorsum (top) of the tongue is normal. A red, slick appearance is characteristic of cobalamin deficiency and scattered red, smooth areas on the tongue are known as geographic tongue. The uvula should remain in the midline while the patient is saying \"Ahh.\" 14. b. The pulsation of the aorta in the epigastric area is a normal finding. Bruits indicate that blood flow is abnormal, the liver is percussed in the right midclavicular line, and a normal spleen cannot be palpated. 15. b. The pancreas is located in the left upper quadrant, the liver is in the right upper quadrant, the appendix is in the right lower quadrant, and the gallbladder is in the right upper quadrant. 16. a. Borborygmi are loud gurgles (stomach growling) that indicate hyperperistalsis. Normal bowel sounds are relatively high-pitched and are heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. High-pitched, tinkling bowel sounds occur when the intestines are under tension, as in bowel obstructions. Absent bowel sounds may be reported when no sounds are heard for 2 to 3 minutes in each quadrant. 17. a. The abdomen should be assessed in the following sequence: inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation. The patient should empty his or her bladder before assessment begins.

The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) le vel is elevated in liver disease but it is important to note that it is also elevated in damage to the heart and lungs and is not a specific test for liver function. Measurement of most of the transaminases involves nonspecific tests unless isoenzyme fractions are determined. Hepatic encephalopathy is related to elevated ammonia levels. 20. c, d, f. Because the li ver is a vascular organ, vital signs are monitored to assess for internal bleeding. Prevention of bleeding is the reason for positioning on the right side for at least 2 hours and for splinting the puncture site. Again, because of the vasculature of the liver, coagulation status is checked before the biopsy is done. White stools occur with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) or barium swallow tests. No smoking is to be done after midnight before the study with an UGI. The bowel must be cleared before a lower GI or barium enema, a virtual colonoscopy, or a colonoscopy. Rectal bleeding may occur with a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. A perforation may occur with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), ERCP, or peritoneoscopy. 2 1. a. The left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and nausea and vomiting could occur from perforation. The return of gag reflex is essential to prevent aspiration after an ERCP. The gag reflex is also assessed with an EGD. These are not relevant assessments for the colonoscopy and barium swallow. CHAPTER 40 Answer Key 1. a. b. An a verage adult requires an estimated 20 to 35 calories per kilogram of body weight per day. In this patient, recommended calories would be between 1600 (80 kg \u00d7 20) and 2800 (80 kg \u00d7 35) calories per day. c. W ithout knowing the activity level of the patient, the intake should be 2400 calories for a sedentary man and 3000 calories for an active man. Increase breads, cereals, rice, and pasta as sources of complex carbohydrate. Decrease the meat and egg group to 7 oz per day in three servings each day to lower protein and fat. Use 3 cups of low-fat milk to lower fat intake. Increase fruits to 2 to 2\u00bd cups and vegetables to 3\u00bd cups per day. Use all fats, oils, and sweets sparingly. 2. c. P atients who have surgery on the GI tract may be at risk for vitamin deficiencies because of inability to absorb or metabolize them. The strict vegan diet most often lacks cobalamin (vitamin B 12) and iron. Although the high intake of fat is a major nutritional problem in the United States, vitamin deficiencies are rare in developed countries except in those with eating disorders or chronic alcohol abusers. Some vitamin deficiencies in adults have neurologic manifestations. 3. d. In the United States, where protein intake is high and of good quality, protein-calorie malnutrition most commonly results from problems of the GI system. In developing countries, adequate food sources might not exist, the inhabitants may not be well educated about nutritional needs, and economic conditions can prevent purchase of balanced diets. 4.

Position the patient with the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees during feedings. Following intermittent feedings, keep the head of the bed elevated for 30 to 60 minutes. Measure residual every 8 hours or per policy after the first 24 hours to validate gastric emptying. Hold tube feeding if residual is greater than 500 mL. Monitor for sensation of fullness, nausea, and vomiting. Prevention of diarrhea Start tube feedings with small amounts and/or decrease rate of infusion. Refrigerate and date opened solutions to prevent bacterial growth but warm them to room temperature before administration; discard outdated formula; use closed systems; use sterile water to flush; check for medications that may cause diarrhea; and provide free water with tube feedings to compensate for high-concentration enteral feedings. Maintenance of tube patency Flush the tube with 30 mL water before and after feedings and medication administration. Only administer medications that can be crushed and be sure that they are dissolved in water before administration. In continuous feedings, flush the tube with water every 4 hours; flush after residual measurements. Maintenance of tube placement Confirm placement initially with chest x-ray; mark exit point of tube following x-ray confirmation and routinely assess for changes in the external length of the tube. If lengthened, check pH of aspirate (<5). Administration of medication Stop feeding. Check tube placement. Flush with 15 mL of water, dilute medications, and use clean oral syringe to administer medications; flush again taking into account the patient's fluid status; separately dilute and administer medications; use liquid forms of medications, if available; use immediate release form, if liquid not available. Check to see if medications are to be given with meals or on an empty stomach and hold feeding if necessary. 5. c. The sodium-potassium pump uses 20% to 50% of all calories ingested. When energy sources are decreased, the pump fails to function, sodium and water are left in the cell, and potassium remains in extracellular fluids. Hyperkalemia, as well as hyponatremia, can occur. 6. a. With surgery a patient will recover more rapidly with a balanced nutritional status before the surgery and increased protein is needed for healing after the surgery. Following a vegan diet does not put the patient at risk of low protein intake. A lowered temperature will not cause increased protein need. Following religious and cultural beliefs would not be expected to affect an increased need for protein. 7. a, b, c, e, f. In malnutrition, metabolic processes are slowed, leading to increased sensitivity to cold, decreased heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO), and decreased neurologic function. Because of slowed GI motility and absorption, the abdomen becomes distended and protruding and bowel sounds are decreased. Skin is rough, dry, and scaly whereas bone structures protrude because of muscle loss. Because the immune system is weakened, susceptibility to respiratory infections is increased. 8. d. Malnutrition that results from a decreased intake of food is most common in individuals with severe anorexia where there is a decreased desire to eat. Infections create a hypermetabolic state that increases nutritional demand, malabsorption causes loss of nutrients that are ingested, and draining decubitus ulcers are examples of disorders that cause both loss of protein and hypermetabolic states. 9. c. Serum transferrin is a protein that is synthesized by the liver and used for iron transport and decreases when there is protein deficiency. An increase in the protein would indicate a more positive nitrogen balance with amino acids available for synthesis. Decreased lymphocytes and serum prealbumin are indicators of protein depletion and increased serum potassium shows continuing failure of the sodium-potassium pump. 10. d. Anthropometric measurements, including mid-upper arm circumference and triceps skinfold measurements, are good indicators of lean body mass and skeletal protein reserves and are valuable in evaluating persons who may have been or are being treated for acute protein malnutrition. The other measurements do not specifically address muscle mass. 11. a. The breakfast with the eggs provides 24 g of protein, compared with 14 g for the protein-fortified cream of wheat and milkshake breakfast. Whole milk instead of skim milk helps to meet the calorie requirements. The toast has 10 g of protein and the pancakes have about 6 g. Bacon is considered a fat rather than a meat serving. 12. b. Although calorie intake should be decreased in the older adult because of decreased activity and basal metabolic rate, the need for specific nutrients, such as proteins and vitamins, does not change. 13. a. Socioeconomic conditions frequently have the greatest effect on the nutritional status of the healthy older adult. Limited income and social isolation can result in the \"tea and toast\" meals of the older adult. The other options do not interfere with nutritional status. 14. a. Standard nasogastric (NG) tubes are used for tube feedings for short-term feeding problems because prolonged therapy can result in irritation and erosion of the mucosa of the upper GI tract. Gastric reflux and the potential for aspiration can occur with both tubes that deliver fluids into the stomach. Both NG and gastrostomy tubes can become displaced and deprive the patient of the sensations associated with eating.

With intermittent feedings, less than 250 mL residual does not require further action. With continuous feedings and a residual of 250 mL or more after the second residual check, a promotility agent should be considered. 17. a. RN; b RN; d. RN; e. UAP; UAP; h. 1 a. b CPN; CPN; d.

In malabsorption syndromes, foods that are ingested into the intestinal tract cannot be digested or absorbed and tube feedings infused into the intestinal tract would not be absorbed. All of the other conditions can be treated with enteral or parenteral nutrition, depending on the patient's needs. 20. Complication Preventive Measure Infection Refrigerate solutions until 30 minutes before use; aseptically change dressing to catheter site per institutional protocol and assess for signs of infection; label date and time started; change filter and tubing every 24 hours if lipids are being administered or every 72 hours if amino acids and dextrose are being administered and label tubing with date and time attached; do not infuse solution in one bottle more than 24 hours; do not add anything to the solution. Hyperglycemia Start infusions slowly, gradually increasing rate for 24 to 48 hours; check capillary blood glucose levels every 4 to 6 hours; provide sliding-scale insulin as prescribed; do not speed up infusion rates or remove infusion from infusion controllers and pumps; visually check the amount infused every 30 to 60 minutes. Air embolism Place patient supine before changing the dressing with sterile technique; clamp the infusion line before changing the injection cap with sterile technique; if the line cannot be clamped, instruct the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver when the catheter is open to air; do not inject air when flushing the catheter lumen(s). 21. a. Bacterial gro wth occurs at room temperature in nutritional solutions. Therefore solutions must not be infused for longer than 24 hours. Remaining solution should be discarded. Speeding up the solution may cause hyperglycemia and should not be done. The health care provider does not need to be notified. 22. a. AB; b . A; c. B; d. AB; e. AB; f. A; g. A; h. B 23. d. The potential life-threatening cardiac complications related to the hypokalemia are the most important immediate considerations in the patient's care. The other nursing diagnoses are important for the patient's care but do not pose the immediate risk that the hypokalemia does. Case Study 1. V ital signs, R.M.'s position on the weight for height and body frame chart, and food intake history. Assessment of each body system. Ability to obtain and make food or a support system to help her do so. 2. The sur gery, chemotherapy, and radiation have greatly increased nutritional need but R.M.'s food intake is decreased because of side effects of cancer treatment. Weakness may lead to an inability to procure and prepare food; the patient lives alone and has no socialization with meals. As well, she has feelings of hopelessness about treatment for cancer. 3. Edema and possible ascites indicated by h ypoalbuminemia and paleness of skin and mucous membranes indicated by R.M.'s hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. 4. Li ver damage with fatty infiltration; susceptibility to infection is very high because of chemotherapy and radiation immunosuppression in addition to malnutrition; and further muscle wasting from inactivity due to fatigue. 5. Easy-to-prepare foods. Use MyPlate to help R.M. plan nutritious meals within her cultural and individual preferences, as previously assessed. Use high-calorie, high-protein supplements. Teach her how to add a protein supplement or powdered milk to foods, decrease fluids with meals so that more calories are consumed, and eat small multiple feedings that are of nutritional value. Provide all written instructions in Spanish. Refer R.M. to community resources for socialization and Meals on Wheels. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to anorexia and decreased food intake Activity intolerance related to fatigue and weakness Hopelessness related to belief that cancer therapy is ineffective Risk for infection related to decreased host defense mechanisms Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: li ver failure, electrolyte imbalance CHAPTER 41 Answer Key 1 . a . 202 \u00d7 703 = 142,006 \u00f7 4225 \u00d7 65) = 33.6 kg/m2; obesity b. 32 \u00f7 36 = 0.88; an increased risk for health complications 2. b . Twin studies and studies with adopted children have shown that body shape and weight gain are influenced by genetics but more research is needed. Older obese people do have exacerbated aging problems related to declines in physical function. African Americans and Hispanics have a higher incidence of obesity than whites. Women have a higher incidence of obesity and more difficulty losing weight than men because women have a higher percentage of metabolically less-active fat. 394 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 3. b. The 56-year-old woman has a body mass index (BMI) of 38 kg/m2 (obese, Class II) with a waist-to-hip ratio of 1.1 with android obesity and is more at risk (very high) than the other patients. The 30-year-old woman has the least risk with a BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (overweight) and gynoid shape. The 42-year-old man has a BMI of 24.2 kg/m2 (normal weight) with one risk factor in the waist-to-hip ratio of 1.0 and the 68-year-old man has a BMI of 27.9 kg/m2 (overweight) with a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.9. 4. b. A patient who is obese (BMI of 32.2) but has a waist- to-hip ratio of less than 0.8, indicating gynoid obesity, has an increased risk for osteoporosis. The other conditions are risks associated with android obesity. (See Table 41-2.) 5. a. Motivation is essential. Focus on the reasons for wanting to lose weight. The rest of the options will assist in planning the weight loss if the patient is motivated. 6. a, b, c, d, e, f. Normally ghrelin and neuropeptide Y stimulate appetite. Leptin suppresses appetite and hunger. Insulin decreases appetite. Peptide YY and cholecystokinin inhibit appetite by slowing gastric emptying and sending satiety signals to the hypothalamus. 7. a, c. To restrict dietary intake so that it is below energy requirements, the moderately obese woman should limit or avoid alcohol intake because it increases caloric intake and has low nutritional value. Portion sizes have increased over the years and are larger than they should be. Teach the patient to determine portion sizes by weight or learn equivalencies such as that a serving of fruit is the size of a baseball. A progressive exercise program will increase energy requirements and a diet with an initial 800- to 1200-calorie limit would decrease calorie intake. Overeaters Anonymous would not restrict dietary intake below energy requirements, although it may offer support for the patient. 8. c. With reducing diets that severely restrict carbohydrates, the body's glycogen stores become depleted within a few days. The glycogen normally binds to water in fat cells and it is this water loss that causes weight loss in the first few days. Fat is not burned until the glycogen-water pool is depleted. Although psychosocial components (i.e., using food for comfort or reward and inability to buy high-nutritional quality food) may have an influence on weight gain, these factors along with lack of physical exercise, underestimation of portion size, and genetics contribute to weight gain. Weekly weighing is recommended as a more reliable indicator of weight loss because daily weighing shows frequent fluctuation from retained water (including urine) and elimination of feces. Men are able to lose weight more quickly than women because women have a higher percentage of metabolically less-active fat. 9. a. Plateau periods during which no weight is lost are normal occurrences during weight reduction and may last for several days to several weeks but weight loss will resume if the prescribed weight reduction plan is continued. Weight loss may stop if former eating habits are resumed but this is not the most common cause of plateaus. 10. d. A chicken breast the size of a deck of cards is about 3 oz, a recommended portion size of meat. Other normal portions include a 3-inch bagel, \u00bd cup of chopped vegetables, and a piece of cheese the size of six dice. 11. b. Medications are used only as adjuncts to diet and exercise programs in the treatment of obesity. Drugs do not cure obesity; without changes in food intake and physical activity, weight gain will occur when the medications are discontinued. The medications used work in a variety of ways to control appetite but over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are probably the least effective and most abused of these drugs. 12. a. Qsymia is a combination of phentermine and topiramate. It must not be used in patients with glaucoma or hyperthyroidism. 13. d. People who have undergone behavior therapy are more successful in maintaining weight losses over time because most programs deemphasize the diet, focus on how and when the person eats and education, and provide support from others. Weighing daily is not recommended and plateaus may not allow for consistent weight loss. A goal for weight loss must be set and 1 to 2 pounds a week is realistic. A more rapid loss often causes skin and underlying tissue to lose elasticity and become flabby folds of tissue. Exercising more often depresses appetite and exercise need not be limited. 14. b. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common combination of restrictive (limiting the size of the stomach) and malabsorptive (less food is absorbed) surgery. Lipectomy is used to remove unsightly flabby folds of adipose tissue. Adjustable gastric banding is the most common restrictive procedure. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive procedure that preserves stomach function. 15. b, e. The adjustable gastric banding procedure is reversible and allows a change in gastric stoma size by inflation or deflation of the band around the fundus of the stomach. The vertical sleeve gastrectomy removes 85% of the stomach and eliminates the hormones produced in the stomach that stimulate hunger. The biliopancreatic diversion is a maladaptive surgery that prevents absorption of nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reduces the stomach size with a gastric pouch anastomosed to the small intestine, so it is both restrictive and malabsorptive. 16. c. Special considerations are needed for the care of the severely obese patient because most hospital units are not prepared with beds, chairs, BP cuffs, and other equipment that will need to be used with the very obese patient. Consideration of all aspects of care should be made before implementing care for the patient, including extra time and perhaps assistance for positioning, physical assessment, and transferring the patient. 17. c, e, f. Obese patients are at higher risk for cancer, sleep apnea and sleep deprivation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular problems. The other options are not related to obesity. 18. b. Patients with histories of untreated depression or psychosis are not good candidates for surgery. All other historical information includes medical complications of severe obesity that would help to qualify the patient for the surgery. 19. d. Turning, coughing, and deep breathing are essential to prevent postoperative complications. Protecting the incision from strain is important since wound dehiscence is a problem for obese patients. If a nasogastric (NG) tube that is present following gastric surgery for severe obesity becomes blocked or needs repositioning, the health ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 395 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. care provider should be notified. Ambulation is usually started on the evening of surgery and additional help will be needed to support the patient. Respiratory function is promoted by keeping the head of the bed elevated at an angle of 35 to 40 degrees. 20. a. Fluids and foods high in carboh ydrates tend to promote diarrhea and symptoms of dumping syndrome in patients with gastric bypass surgery. The diet generally should be high in protein and low in carbohydrates, fat, and roughage and consist of six small feedings a day because of the small stomach size. Liquid diets are likely to be used longer for the patient with a gastroplasty. 21. b . Three of the following five measures are needed for a woman to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome: waist circumference >35 in, triglycerides >150 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, >130 mm Hg systolic or >85 mm Hg diastolic, fasting blood glucose > 110 mg/dL. Although the other options have some abnormal measures, none has all three measures in the diagnostic ranges. The criteria for metabolic syndrome for both women and men are listed in Table 41-10. 22. a, c, d, e. P atients with metabolic syndrome need to lower their risk factors by reducing and maintaining weight, increasing physical activity, establishing healthy diet habits, and smoking cessation. Some patients with metabolic syndrome are diabetic and would need to monitor glucose levels frequently. When monitoring weight reduction, it is recommended to check weight weekly, not daily. 23. c. Insulin resistance is the main underlying risk f actor for metabolic syndrome. Aging is associated with metabolic syndrome. High cholesterol, hypertension, and increased clotting risk are characteristics of metabolic syndrome. Case Stu dy 1. L.C. 's BMI has a risk for almost all health problems associated with obesity: type 2 diabetes, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, osteoarthritis, gout, lumbar disc disease, chronic low back pain, sudden cardiac death, heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gallstones, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, renal disease, cancer. He already has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, impaired mobility, and depression. 3. L.C. w ould qualify for bariatric surgery. He has a BMI >40 kg/m2, has one or more obesity-related medical complications, is age 18 years or older, understands the risks and benefits of the surgery, has tried and failed other methods of weight loss, has no serious endocrine problems that are causing the obesity, is psychiatrically and socially stable, and is able to follow up on a long-term basis. Surgery would lessen the risks for obesity complications. 4. Surgical Procedure Advantages Disadvantages Roux-en-Y gastric bypass Excellent patient tolerance, sustained long-term weight loss, low complication rates, most commonly used bariatric procedure, improved glucose control or type 2 diabetes reversal, normalization of BP, decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides, decreased GERD, decreased sleep apneaAbsorption deficiencies of iron, cobalamin, folic acid, and calcium; mortality rate of 2% in first month; dumping syndrome with vomiting, nausea, weakness, sweating, and faintness; irreversible Adjustable gastric bandingStomach remains intact, an earlier sense of fullness with smaller stomach accommodation, small stoma size delays stomach emptying that provides further satiety, digestion is not altered, successful weight loss, can be modified or reversedPossible intractable vomiting, distention of pouch wall, rupture of staple line, erosion of the band into the stomach 5. This patient needs to be instructed in proper coughing technique, deep breathing, and turning methods. He should be taught to use an incentive spirometer. He will also need to take several showers per day for a few days before surgery. If he uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at home, he should also use one at the hospital. He should be told what to expect postoperatively: an IV , NG tube, and urinary catheter. He also should be prepared for frequent assessment, early ambulation, active and passive range of motion, the use of antiembolism stockings or pneumatic compression devices, low-dose heparin administered subcutaneously, the need for pain medication, and initiation of oral liquids (30 mL every 2 hours while awake). 6. On dischar ge this patient needs to be taught about the signs of infection, wound dehiscence, and delayed healing; the need for a measured amount of a high-protein liquid diet, to eat slowly and stop eating when feeling full, and to avoid consuming liquids with solids. The patient also needs to be instructed on the need for a multivitamin with iron and calcium supplements to prevent deficiencies. The dietitian's contact information will also be helpful for him. A progressive exercise program will need to be included as well. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Activity intolerance related to fatigue Sense of powerlessness related to lack of control of eating Ineffective breathing pattern related to obesity Ineffective individual coping related to changes in social participation Health-seeking behavior: expressed desire for weight loss and health maintenance mechanisms Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: CAD, respiratory complications, type 2 diabetes, renal failure, liver failure, musculoskeletal problems, skin breakdown, postoperative wound infection, pain396 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 42 Answer Key 1. d. The parasympathetic nervous system causes increased salivation and gastric mobility as well as relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The acid-base imbalance that occurs with vomiting is metabolic alkalosis from the loss of hydrochloric acid. The vomiting center in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) can be caused by chemical stimuli of drugs, toxins, and labyrinthine stimulation. V omiting requires the coordination of closing the glottis, deep inspiration with contraction of the diaphragm in the inspiratory position, closure of the pylorus, relaxation of the stomach and lower esophageal sphincter, and contraction of abdominal muscles. 2. c. The loss of gastric hydrochloric acid causes metabolic alkalosis and an increase in pH; loss of potassium, sodium, and chloride; and loss of fluid, which increases the hematocrit. 3. b. The patient with severe or persistent vomiting requires IV replacement of fluids and electrolytes until able to tolerate oral intake to prevent serious dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Oral fluids are not given until vomiting has been relieved and parenteral antiemetics are often not used until a cause of the vomiting can be established. Nasogastric (NG) intubation may be indicated in some cases but fluid and electrolyte replacement is the first priority. 4. a. Water is the fluid of choice for rehydration by mouth. Very hot or cold liquids are not usually well tolerated and although broth and Gatorade have been used for the patient with severe vomiting, these substances are high in sodium and should be administered with caution. 5. d. Ondansetron (Zofran) is one of several serotonin antagonists that act both centrally and peripherally to reduce vomiting: centrally on the vomiting center in the brainstem and peripherally by promoting gastric emptying. Dronabinol (Marinol) is an orally active cannabinoid that causes sedation and has a potential for abuse and it is used when other therapies are ineffective. Antihistamines used as antiemetics also cause sedation. 6. c. Implementing safety precautions (placement close to the nurses' station, call bell in reach, hourly visual checks, use of sitters) is the priority. The patient would not be kept in a flat position because of the potential for aspiration of vomitus. Because the older patient is more likely to have cardiac or renal insufficiency, the patient's fluid and electrolyte status are monitored more closely (laboratory, intake and output). Monitor vital signs along with breath sounds. Assess mucous membranes, skin turgor, and color to assess for dehydration. Assess level of consciousness closely. Check dosing of antiemetics. Assess for weakness and fatigue. 7. a. When gingivitis is untreated, abscesses form and teeth are loosened with periodontitis. Herpes simplex is the viral infection related to the upper respiratory system and has shallow, painful vesicular ulcerations of lips and mouth. Aphthous stomatitis has infectious ulcers of the mouth and lips with a defined erythematous base occurring as a result of systemic disease. 8. b. Stomatitis is inflammation of the mouth related to systemic diseases and cancer chemotherapy medications. There is excessive salivation, halitosis, and a sore mouth. Parotitis is a Staphylococcus infection that may occur with prolonged NPO status and results in decreased saliva and ear pain. Oral candidiasis is seen with prolonged antibiotic or corticosteroid therapy; it has white membranous lesions on the mucosa of the mouth and larynx. Vincent's infection is a bacterial infection predisposed by fatigue, stress, and poor oral hygiene. There are painful, bleeding gums and increased metallic-tasting saliva. 9. c. A positive history of use of tobacco and alcohol is the most significant etiologic factor in oral cancer. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a factor in the development of cancer of the lip. Herpes simplex infections have not been associated with oral cancer. Difficulty swallowing and ear pain are symptoms of advanced oral cancer, not risk factors. 10. b. Because surgical treatment of oral cancers involves extensive excision, a tracheostomy is usually performed with the radical dissections. The first goal of care is that the patient will have a patent airway. The other goals are appropriate but of lesser priority. 11. b. Measures to assess and treat withdrawal from alcohol should be implemented with patients who have heavy use of this substance because alcohol is a strong risk factor and withdrawal can be life threatening. Tobacco withdrawal also may be uncomfortable for the patient. Nutritional needs may need to be addressed with tube feedings postoperatively and pain medications may need to be increased because of cross-tolerance. Counseling about lifestyle changes is not a priority in the early postoperative course. 12. a, c, e, f. Alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, and cola sodas (caffeine) as well as peppermint and spearmint will decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. Root beer and herbal tea do not have caffeine. Citrus fruits will not affect LES pressure. 13. c. The use of blocks to elevate the head of the bed facilitates gastric emptying by gravity and is strongly recommended to prevent nighttime reflux. Liquids should be taken between meals to prevent gastric distention with meals. Small meals should be eaten frequently but patients should not eat at bedtime or lie down for 2 to 3 hours after eating. Activities that involve increasing intraabdominal pressure, such as bending over, lifting, or wearing tight clothing, should be avoided. 14. c. Eating a high-calorie, high-protein diet, perhaps in liquid form, is the highest priority preoperatively. Because of dysphagia, the patient frequently has poor nutritional status because of the inability to ingest adequate amounts of food before surgery. An esophageal stent may be placed to improve the nutritional status. Turning and deep breathing will be done and the patient will need to know about postoperative care but these are not the priorities. Meticulous oral care is done but it may be done with swabs or gauze pads to prevent the injury and pain brushing may incur. 15. b. Following esophageal surgery, the patient should be positioned in semi-Fowler's or Fowler's position to prevent reflux and aspiration of gastric sections. NG drainage is ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 397 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. expected to be bloody for 8 to 12 hours postoperatively. Abdominal distention is not a major concern following esophageal surgery and even though the thorax may be opened during the surgery, clear breath sounds should be expected in all areas of the lungs. 16. b . Barrett's esophagus is an esophageal metaplasia primarily related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Achalasia is a rare chronic disorder with the absence of peristalsis of the lower two thirds of the esophagus. Esophageal strictures are narrowing of the esophagus from scarring by many causes. Esophageal diverticula are saclike outpouchings of one or more layers of the esophagus commonly seen above the esophageal sphincter. 17. d. Eosinophilic esophagitis is swelling of the esophagus caused by infiltration of eosinophils in response to food triggers or environmental allergens. Esophageal cancer is usually caused by adenocarcinoma, with the remainder being squamous cell tumors. Esophageal varices are dilated vessels in the esophagus caused by portal hypertension. Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus commonly seen with GERD. 18. a. Acute g astritis is most likely to occur with an isolated drinking binge. Chronic gastritis is usually caused by Heliobacter pylori or viral and fungal infections. Autoimmune gastritis is an inherited condition. 19. b . A nonirritating diet with six small meals a day is recommended to help control the symptoms of gastritis. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often as irritating to the stomach as aspirin and should not be used in the patient with gastritis. Antacids are often used for control of symptoms but have the best neutralizing effect if taken after meals. Alcohol and caffeine should be eliminated entirely because they may precipitate gastritis. 20. a, c, f. Duodenal ulcers ha ve increased gastric secretion, which causes the burning and cramping in the midepigastric area, and the pain is relieved with food. The other options occur with both duodenal and gastric ulcers. 21. a. The 55-year -old female smoker experiencing nausea and vomiting is more likely to have a gastric ulcer. The other patients are not in the highest-risk age range or do not have enough risk factors. Although lower socioeconomic status, smoking, and drug use do increase the risk of gastric ulcers, these patients are more likely to experience duodenal ulcers but further assessment is needed. 22. c. Corticosteroids decrease the rate of mucous cell renewal. H. pylori produces the enzyme urease. Alcohol ingestion increases the secretion of hydrochloric acid. Aspirin and NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of mucus and prostaglandins. 23. a. The ultimate damage to the tissues of the stomach and duodenum, precipitating ulceration, is acid back diffusion into the mucosa. The gastric mucosal barrier is protective of the mucosa but without the acid environment and damage, ulceration does not occur. Ammonia formation by H. pylori and release of histamine impair the barrier but are not directly responsible for tissue injury. 24. b . Back pain is a common manifestation of ulcers located on the posterior aspect of the duodenum and is important for nurses to keep in mind during assessment of the patient, because the more typical epigastric burning and pain may not be present. Duodenal ulcers are more often relieved by food than are gastric ulcers and when epigastric discomfort occurs, it is lower than that of gastric ulcers. Eating stimulates gastric acid production, increasing discomfort for patients with gastric ulcers, whereas the pain of duodenal ulcers usually occurs several hours after eating. 25. c. There is no specif ic diet used for the treatment of peptic ulcers and patients are encouraged to eat as normally as possible, eliminating foods that cause discomfort or pain. Eating six meals a day prevents the stomach from being totally empty and is also recommended. Caffeine and alcohol should be eliminated from the diet because they are known to cause gastric irritation. Milk and milk products do not need to be avoided but they can add fat content to the diet. 26. d. NG intubation is used with acute e xacerbation of peptic ulcer disease to remove the stimulation for hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsin secretion by keeping the stomach empty. Stopping the spillage of GI contents into the peritoneal cavity is used for peritonitis. Removing excess fluids and undigested food from the stomach is the rationale for using NG intubation for gastric outlet obstruction. 27. b, c, f. Antacids need a high dose and frequenc y, which may lead to noncompliance; prevent the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin; and may stimulate the release of gastrin. Amoxicillin/clarithromycin/omeprazole are used in patients with verified H. pylori. Sucralfate (Carafate) covers the ulcer to protect it from acid erosion. 28. a, c, d, e. F amotidine (Pepcid) reduces HCl secretion by blocking histamine Sucralfate (Carafate) acid erosion. Misoprostol (Cytotec) mixture has antisecretory effects. Amoxicillin/clarithromycin/omeprazole are used in patients with verified H. pylori. 29. c. Increased v agal stimulation from emotional stress causes hypersecretion of hydrochloric acid and stress reduction is an important part of the patient's management of peptic ulcers, especially duodenal ulcers. If side effects to medications develop, the patient should notify the health care provider before altering the drug regimen. Although effective treatment will promote pain relief in several days, the treatment regimen should be continued until there is evidence that the ulcer has healed completely. Interchanging brands and preparations of antacids and histamine (H 2)- receptor blockers without checking with health care providers may cause harmful side effects and patients should take only prescribed medications. 30. c. Perforation of an ulcer causes sudden, se vere abdominal pain that is often referred to the back, accompanied by a rigid, boardlike abdomen and other signs of peritonitis. V omiting of blood indicates hemorrhage of an ulcer and gastric outlet obstruction is characterized by projectile vomiting of undigested food, hyperactive stomach sounds, and upper abdominal swelling.398 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 31. a. If symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach distention, occur while the patient is on NPO status or has an NG tube, the patency of the NG tube should be assessed. A recumbent position should not be used in a patient with a gastric outlet obstruction because it increases abdominal pressure on the stomach and vital signs and circulatory status assessment are important if hemorrhage or perforation is suspected. Deep breathing and relaxation may help some patients with nausea but not when stomach contents are obstructed from flowing into the small intestine. 32. d. Abdominal pain that causes the knees to be drawn up and shallow, grunting respirations in a patient with peptic ulcer disease are characteristic of perforation and the nurse should assess the patient's vital signs and abdomen before notifying the health care provider. Irrigation of the NG tube should not be performed because the additional fluid may be spilled into the peritoneal cavity and the patient should be placed in a position of comfort, usually on the side with the head slightly elevated. 33. a. 3; b. 4; c. 2; d. 1 34. d. Because there is no sphincter control of food taken into the stomach following a Billroth II procedure, concentrated food and fluid move rapidly into the small intestine, creating a hypertonic environment that pulls fluid from the bowel wall into the lumen of the intestine, reducing plasma volume and distending the bowel. Postprandial hypoglycemia occurs when the concentrated carbohydrate bolus in the small intestine results in hyperglycemia and the release of excessive amounts of insulin into the circulation, resulting in symptoms of hypoglycemia. Irritation of the stomach by bile salts causes epigastric distress after meals, not dumping syndrome. 35. a. Dietary control of dumping syndrome includes small, frequent meals with low carbohydrate content and elimination of fluids with meals. The patient should also lie down for 30 to 60 minutes after meals. These measures help to delay stomach emptying, preventing the rapid movement of a high-carbohydrate food bolus into the small intestine. 36. d. If the patient's NG tube becomes obstructed following a gastrectomy with an intestinal anastomosis, gastric secretions may put a strain on the sutured anastomosis and cause serious complications. Be sure that the suction is working and the health care provider may order periodic gentle irrigation with normal saline solution. Because of the danger of perforating the gastric mucosa or disrupting the suture line, the nurse should notify the health care provider if the tube needs to be repositioned or replaced. 37. b. A total gastrectomy removes the parietal cells responsible for secreting intrinsic factor necessary for absorption of cobalamin. Lifelong administration of cobalamin is necessary to prevent the development of pernicious anemia. Wound healing is usually impaired in the patient with a total gastrectomy performed for gastric cancer because of impaired nutritional status before surgery. Following a total gastrectomy, the patient also requires diet modifications as a result of dumping syndrome and postprandial hypoglycemia. Peptic ulcers are not a common finding after total gastrectomy. 38. a. Melena is black, tarry stools from slow bleeding from an upper GI source when blood passes through the GI tract and is digested. Occult blood is the presence of guaiac-positive stools or gastric aspirate. Coffee-ground emesis is blood that has been in the stomach for some time and has reacted with gastric secretions. Profuse bright-red hematemesis is arterial blood that has not been in contact with gastric secretions, as in esophageal or oral bleeding. 39. b. Although all of the interventions may be indicated when a patient has upper GI bleeding, the first nursing priority with bright-red (arterial) blood is to perform a focused assessment of the patient's condition, with emphasis on blood pressure (BP), pulse, and peripheral perfusion to determine the presence of hypovolemic shock. 40. d. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that has been shown to reduce upper GI bleeding and inhibit the release of GI hormones such as gastrin, thereby decreasing hydrochloric acid secretion. Nizatidine is a histamine (H2)-receptor blocker that decreases acid secretion and omeprazole inhibits the proton pump necessary for the secretion of hydrochloric acid. Vasopressin has a vasoconstriction action useful in controlling upper GI bleeding. 41. b. All over-the-counter (OTC) drugs should be avoided because their contents may include drugs that are contraindicated because of the irritating effects on the gastric mucosa. Patients are taught to test suspicious vomitus or stools for occult blood but all stools do not need to be tested. Antacids cannot be taken with all medications because they prevent the absorption of many drugs. Misoprostol is used to protect the gastric mucosa in patients who must take NSAIDs for other conditions because it inhibits acid secretion stimulated by NSAIDs. 42. d. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is usually elevated with a significant hemorrhage because blood proteins are subjected to bacterial breakdown in the GI tract. With control of bleeding, the BUN will return to normal. During the early stage of bleeding, the hematocrit (Hct) is not always a reliable indicator of the amount of blood lost or the amount of blood replaced and may be falsely high or low. A urinary output of 20 mL/hr indicates impaired renal perfusion and hypovolemia and a urine specific gravity of 1.030 indicates concentrated urine typical of hypovolemia. 43. b. Food poisoning caused by Escherichia coli is characterized by profuse diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloody stools and is most often associated with contaminated beef, especially ground beef. Salmonella contamination most often occurs with poultry, staphylococcal infections occur with milk and salad dressings, and botulism occurs with fish and low-acid canned products. Case Study 1. Infiltration of the gastric wall by a tumor causes epigastric discomfort. Growth of the tumor into the gastric lumen can cause anorexia and weight loss. Release of substances by cancer cells also contributes to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting may also be caused if the tumor obstructs the gastric outlet. Fatigue and other symptoms of anemia occur because of chronic blood loss as the lesion erodes through the mucosa. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 399 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2. Malnutrition is indicated in this patient by weight loss, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, decreased serum albumin, skin changes and discoloration, and her emaciated appearance. 3. Other f actors that may contribute to S.E.'s malnutrition include the increased metabolic demands of tumor cells; responses to radiation therapy, such as vomiting, stomatitis, esophagitis, diarrhea, and decreased bone marrow function; and perhaps pernicious anemia resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor common with gastric cancer. 4. Malnourished patients do not respond well to radiation therapy and normal cells do not recover from radiation damage when malnutrition is present. Depletion of protein stores also places S.E. at risk for impaired immune function. 5. A plan for this patient and her f amily should include the following: Increasing nutrition with bland, warm, high-calorie, high-protein foods; small, frequent feedings; and nutritional supplements as tolerated Oral care to prevent stomatitis and make eating more pleasurable Skin care for radiation therapy Anticipatory planning for pain relief and continuing care as she becomes more impaired Discussion of feelings and concerns of the patient and her family, with explanations of realistic expectations of outcome of her condition 6. In responding to S.E., the nurse should pro vide accurate information in a way that will decrease her stress and promote her decision making and coping skills. It is important to tell her that although it is unlikely she will recover from her cancer, the radiation treatment can help to shrink the tumor mass, improve her nutritional status, and promote a feeling of well-being. She should be told that her family and health care providers will help her to function effectively for as long as possible. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to inability to ingest, digest, and absorb nutrients Fatigue related to anemia and effects of radiation therapy Activity intolerance related to generalized weakness Impaired skin integrity related to malnutrition and radiation therapy Ineffective self-health management related to lack of knowledge regarding disease progression Nausea related to radiation therapy Grieving related to perceived unfavorable diagnosis and impending death Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: sepsis related to immuno - suppression, negative nitrogen balance, organ failure CHAPTER 43 Answer Key 1. c. Antiperistaltic agents, such as loperamide (Imodium) and paregoric, should not be used in infectious diarrhea because of the potential of prolonging exposure to the infectious agent. Demulcent agents may be used to coat and protect mucous membranes in these cases. The other options are all appropriate measures to use in cases of infectious diarrhea. 2. c. W earing gloves will avoid hand contamination and washing hands with soap and water will remove more Clostridium difficile spores than alcohol-based hand cleaners and ammonia-based disinfectants. The entire room will need to be disinfected with a 10% solution of household bleach. Probiotics may help to prevent diarrhea in the patient on antibiotics by replacing normal intestinal bacteria. 3. d. The f irst intervention to establish bowel regularity includes promoting bowel evacuation at a regular time each day, preferably by placing the patient on the bedpan, using a bedside commode, or walking the patient to the bathroom. To take advantage of the gastrocolic reflex, an appropriate time is 30 minutes after the first meal of the day or at the patient's usual individual time. Perianal pouches are used to protect the skin only when regularity cannot be established and evacuation suppositories are also used only if other techniques are not successful. 4. d. Ignoring the ur ge to defecate causes the muscles and mucosa in the rectal area to become insensitive to the presence of feces and drying of the stool occurs. The urge to defecate is decreased and stool becomes more difficult to expel. Taking a bulk-forming agent with fluids or high- fiber diet with fluids prevent constipation. Hemorrhoids are the most common complication of chronic constipation, caused by straining to pass hardened stool. The straining may cause problems in patients with hypertension but these do not cause constipation. Other things that may cause constipation are a history of diverticulosis, which is seen in individuals with low fiber intake, small stool mass, and hard stools. Chronic laxative use and chronic dilation and loss of colonic tone may also cause chronic constipation. 5 . c. Of the foods listed, dried beans contain the highest amount of dietary fiber and are an excellent source of soluble fiber. Bran and berries also have large amounts of fiber. 6 a. Enemas are f ast acting and beneficial in the immediate treatment of acute constipation but should be limited in their use. Bulk-forming medication stimulates peristalsis but takes 24 hours to act. Stool softeners have a prolonged action, taking up to 72 hours for an effect, and fluids can help to decrease the incidence of constipation. 7. a. The patient with an acute abdomen may ha ve significant fluid or blood loss into the abdomen and evaluation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) should be the first intervention, followed by assessment of the abdomen and the nature of the pain. Analgesics should be used cautiously until a diagnosis can be determined so that symptoms are not masked. 8. b, c, e, f. An immediate sur gical consult is needed for acute ischemic bowel, foreign-body perforation, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or ruptured abdominal aneurysm. A diagnostic laparoscopy may be done or a laparotomy may be done to repair a ruptured abdominal aneurysm or remove the appendix. Surgery is not needed for pancreatitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, as these can be diagnosed and treated without surgery.400 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 9. c. An adequately functioning nasogastric (NG) tube should prevent nausea and vomiting because stomach contents are continuously being removed. The first intervention in this case is to check the amount and character of the recent drainage and check the tube for patency. Decreased or absent bowel sounds are expected after a laparotomy and the Jackson-Pratt drains only fluid from the tissue of the surgical site. Antiemetics may be given if the NG tube is patent because anesthetic agents may cause nausea. 10. a. The abdominal pain and distention that occur from the decreased motility of the bowel should be treated with increased ambulation and frequent position changes to increase peristalsis. If the pain is severe, cholinergic drugs, rectal tubes, or application of heat to the abdomen may be prescribed. Assessment of bowel sounds is not an intervention to relieve the pain and a high Fowler's position is not indicated. Opioids may still be necessary for pain control and motility can be increased by other means. 11. d. The patient is having symptoms of an acute abdomen and should be evaluated by a health care provider immediately. The patient's age, location of pain, and other symptoms are characteristic of appendicitis. Heat application and laxatives should not be used in patients with undiagnosed abdominal pain because they may cause perforation of the appendix or other inflammations. Fluids should not be taken until vomiting is controlled, nor should they be taken in the event that surgery may be performed. 12. b. Because there is no definitive treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and patients become frustrated and discouraged with uncontrolled symptoms, it is important to develop a trusting relationship that will support the patient as different treatments are implemented and evaluated. Diagnosis of IBS can be established by Rome criteria and by elimination of other problems. Although IBS can be precipitated and aggravated by stress and emotions, it is not a psychogenic illness. High-fiber diets may help but they might also increase the bloating and gas pains of IBS. Medications are available but usually used as a last resort because of side effects. 13. a. It is likely that the patient could be developing a peritonitis, which could be life-threatening, and assessment of vital signs for hypovolemic shock should be done to report to the health care provider. If an IV line is not in place, it should be inserted and pain may be eased by flexing the knees. 14. b. The patient's manifestations are characteristic of appendicitis. After laboratory test and CT scan confirmation, the patient will have surgery. Laxatives are not used. The 6 hours of fluids and antibiotics preoperatively would be used only if the appendix was ruptured. The NG tube is more likely to be used with abdominal trauma. 15. c. IV fluid replacement along with antibiotics, NG suction, analgesics, and surgery would be expected. Peritoneal lavage may be used to determine abdominal trauma. Peritoneal dialysis would not be performed. Oral fluids would be avoided with peritonitis. 16. a, c, e, f. Crohn's disease may have severe weight loss, segmented distribution through the entire wall of the bowel, and crampy abdominal pain. Rectal bleeding and toxic megacolon are more often seen with ulcerative colitis. 17. c. In the patient with ulcerative colitis, decreased Na+, K+, Mg+, Cl-, and HCO3- are a result of diarrhea and vomiting. Hypoalbuminemia may be present. Elevated WBCs occur with toxic megacolon. Decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) occur with bloody diarrhea. 18. d. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have many of the same extraintestinal symptoms, including erythema nodosum and osteoporosis, as uveitis, Colonic dilation and celiac disease are not extraintestinal. 19. a, b, e, f. With an acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to rest the bowel the patient will be NPO, receive IV fluids and parenteral nutrition, and have nasogastric suction. Sedatives would be used to alleviate stress. Enteral nutrition will be used as soon as possible. 20. c. Cobalamin and iron injections will help to correct malnutrition. Correcting malnutrition will also indirectly help to improve quality of life and fight infections. 21. c. Antidiarrheal agents only relieve symptoms. Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) are used to treat and control inflammation with various diseases. 22. b. The initial procedure for a total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch and anal anastomosis, and a temporary ileostomy. A loop ileostomy is the most common temporary ileostomy and it may be held in place with a plastic rod for the first week. A rectal tube to suction is not indicated in any of the surgical procedures for ulcerative colitis. A colostomy is not used and an NG tube would not be used to irrigate the pouch. A permanent ileostomy stoma would be expected following a total proctocolectomy with a permanent ileostomy. 23. a. Initial output from a newly formed ileostomy may be as high as 1500 to 2000 mL daily and intake and output must be accurately monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Ileostomy bags may need to be emptied every 3 to 4 hours but the appliance should not be changed for several days unless there is leakage onto the skin. A terminal ileum stoma is permanent and the entire colon has been removed. A return to a normal, presurgical diet is the goal for the patient with an ileostomy, with restrictions based only on the patient's individual tolerances. 24. a. Signs of malnutrition include pallor from anemia, hair loss, bleeding, cracked gingivae, and muscle weakness, which support a nursing diagnosis that identifies impaired nutrition. Diarrhea may contribute to malnutrition but is not a defining characteristic. Anorectal excoriation and pain relate to problems with skin integrity. Hypotension relates to problems with fluid deficit. 25. b. V olvulus is the bowel twisting on itself. The bowel folding on itself is intussusception. Emboli of arterial blood supply to the bowel is vascular obstruction. Protrusion of bowel in a weak or abnormal opening is a hernia. 26. c. Intermittent crampy abdominal pain, nausea, projectile vomiting, and dehydration are characteristics of mechanical upper small intestinal obstruction. With continued vomiting, metabolic alkalosis may occur. Large bowel obstruction is ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 401 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. characterized by constipation, low-grade abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Fecal vomiting is seen with lower small intestinal obstruction. 27. b . Mouth care should be done frequently for the patient with a small intestinal obstruction who has an NG tube because of vomiting, fecal taste and odor, and mouth breathing. No ice chips are allowed when a patient is NPO because of a bowel obstruction. The NG tube should be checked for patency and irrigated as ordered. The position of the patient should be one of comfort. 28. c. Although all polyps are abnormal gro wths, the most common type of polyp (hyperplastic) is non-neoplastic, as are inflammatory, lipomas, and juvenile polyps. However, adenomatous polyps are characterized by neoplastic changes in the epithelium and most colorectal cancers appear to arise from these polyps. Only patients with a family history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have close to a 100% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer. 29. a. A diet high in red meat and lo w fruit and vegetable intake is associated with development of colorectal cancer (CRC), as are alcohol intake and smoking. Family and personal history of CRC also increases the risk. Other environmental agents are not known to be related to colorectal cancer. Long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with reduced CRC risk. 30. d. W ith an abdominal perineal-resection (APR), an abdominal incision is made and the proximal sigmoid colon is brought through the abdominal wall and formed into a permanent colostomy. The patient is repositioned, a perineal incision is made, and the distal sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus are removed through the perineal incision, which may be left open, packed, and have drains. 31. d. The ileostomy drainage is e xtremely irritating to the skin, so the skin must be cleaned and a new solid skin barrier and pouch applied as soon as a leak occurs to prevent skin damage. The pouch is usually worn for 4 to 7 days unless there is a leak. Because the initial drainage from the ileostomy is high, the fluid intake must not be decreased. The pouch must always be worn, as the liquid drainage, not formed bowel movements, is frequent. 32. b . A normal new colostomy stoma should appear bright red, have mild to moderate edema, and have a small amount of bleeding or oozing of blood when touched. A purplish stoma indicates inadequate blood supply and should be reported. The colostomy will not have any fecal drainage for 2 to 4 days but there may be some earlier mucus or serosanguineous drainage. Bowel sounds after extensive bowel surgery will be diminished or absent. 33. d, e. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) can monitor and record observations related to the drainage and can measure and record the amount. The LPN could also monitor the skin around the stoma for breakdown. LPNs can irrigate a colostomy in a stable patient but this patient is only 2 days postoperative. The other actions are responsibilities of the RN (teaching, assessing stoma, and developing a care plan). 34. d. Se xual dysfunction may result from an anterior-posterior repair but the nurse should discuss with the patient that different nerve pathways affect erection, ejaculation, and orgasm and that a dysfunction of one does not mean total sexual dysfunction and also that an alteration in sexual activity does not have to alter sexuality. Simple reassurance of desirability and ignoring concerns about sexual function do not help the patient to regain positive feelings of sexuality. 35. d. The patient with a transv erse colostomy has semiliquid to semiformed stools needing a pouch and needs to have fluid balance monitored. The ascending colostomy has semiliquid stools needing a pouch and increased fluid. The ileostomy has liquid to semiliquid stools needing a pouch and increased fluid. The sigmoid colostomy has formed stools and may or may not need a pouch but will need irrigation. 36. a. Encouraging the patient to share concerns and ask questions will help the patient to begin to adapt to living with the colostomy. The other options do not support the patient and do not portray the nurse's focus on helping the patient or treating the patient as an individual. 37. b . Following infusion of the fluid into the stoma, the solution and feces will take about 30 to 45 minutes to return and the patient can plan to read or perform other quiet activities during the wait time. Between 500 and 1000 mL of warm tap water should be used. A cone tip on the end of the tubing prevents bowel damage that could occur if a stiff plastic catheter is used. Fluid should be elevated about 18 to 24 inches above the stoma, or to about shoulder level, to prevent too rapid infusion of the solution and cramping. 38. c. F ormation of diverticula is common when decreased bulk of stool, combined with a more narrowed lumen in the sigmoid colon, causes high intraluminal pressures that result in saccular dilation or outpouching of the mucosa through the muscle of the intestinal wall. To prevent the high intraluminal pressure, fecal volume should be increased with use of high-fiber diets and bulk laxatives, such as psyllium (Metamucil). Anticholinergic drugs are used only during an acute episode of diverticulitis and the lesions are not premalignant. 39. a. The inflammation and infection of di verticula cause small perforations with spread of the inflammation to the surrounding area in the intestines. Abscesses may form or complete perforation with peritonitis may occur. Systemic antibiotic therapy is often used but medicated enemas would increase intestinal motility and increase the possibility of perforation, as would the application of heat. Surgery is only necessary to drain abscesses or to resect an obstructing inflammatory mass. 40. a, d. The v entral or incisional hernia is due to a weakness of the abdominal wall at the site of a previous incision. It is reducible when it returns to the abdominal cavity. Inguinal hernias are at the weak area of the abdominal wall where the spermatic cord in men or the round ligament in women emerges. A femoral hernia is a protrusion through the femoral ring into the femoral canal. Incarcerated hernias do not reduce. 41. c. A strangulated femoral hernia obstructs intestinal flo w and blood supply, thus requiring emergency surgery. The other options are incorrect. 4 2. b . Scrotal edema is a common and painful complication after an inguinal hernia repair and can be relieved in part by 402 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. application of ice and elevation of the scrotum with a scrotal support. Heat would increase the edema and the discomfort and a truss is used to keep unrepaired hernias from protruding. Coughing is discouraged postoperatively because it increases intraabdominal pressure and stress on the repair site. 43. b. The most common type of malabsorption syndrome is lactose intolerance and it is managed by restricting the intake of milk and milk products. Antibiotics are used in cases of bacterial infections that cause malabsorption, pancreatic enzyme supplementation is used for pancreatic insufficiency, and restriction of gluten is necessary for control of adult celiac disease (celiac sprue, gluten-induced enteropathy). 44. c. The autoimmune process associated with celiac disease continues as long as the body is exposed to gluten, regardless of the symptoms it produces, and a lifelong gluten-free diet is necessary. The other statements regarding celiac disease are all true. 45. b. Short bowel syndrome results from extensive resection of portions of the small bowel and would occur if a patient had an extensive resection of the ileum. The other conditions primarily affect the large colon and result in fewer and less severe symptoms. 46. b. An anorectal abscess is a collection of perianal pus. An ulcer in the anal wall is an anal fissure. Sacrococcygeal hairy tract describes a pilonidal sinus. A tunnel leading from the anus or rectum is an anorectal fistula. 47. c. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with about 80% of anal cancer cases. Other risk factors include multiple sexual partners, smoking, receptive anal sex, and HIV infection, as well as being female, age 60, and African American. The other options are not considered risk factors for anal cancer. 48. d. Warm sitz baths provide comfort, healing, and cleansing of the area following all anorectal surgery and may be done three or four times a day for 1 to 2 weeks. Stool softeners may be prescribed for several days postoperatively to help keep stools soft for passage but laxatives may cause irritation and trauma to the anorectal area and are not used postoperatively. Early passage of a bowel movement, although painful, is encouraged to prevent drying and hardening of stool, which would result in an even more painful bowel movement. Case Study 1. Changes in bowel patterns with alternating constipation and diarrhea, changes in stool caliber with ribbon or pencil stools, rectal bleeding, sensation of incomplete evacuation, unexplained weight loss, and vague abdominal pain. 2. Assess drains placed in the wound and the type and amount of drainage. Assess the skin around the drain for inflammation and keep the area clean and dry. Assess the incision for suture integrity and signs and symptoms of wound infection. Assess drainage from the wound for amount, color, and characteristics. Monitor for edema, erythema, and drainage around the suture line as well as fever and elevated WBC count. Take warm sitz baths at 100.4 \u00b0F to 106 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C to 41.1 \u00b0C) for 10 to 20 minutes three to four times a day and use pressure-reducing chair cushions for comfort. Make sterile dressing changes. 3. To be able to manage care independently; have normal skin integrity; adapt to new dietary needs to manage bloating, gas, diarrhea, and bowel evacuation; and adjust to altered body image. 4. It appears that C.D. is depersonalizing the stoma and, to preserve his body image, is seeing it as something separate from him, with a name and personality of its own. 5. Anxiety, ineffective coping, and fear may influence C.D.'s tolerance of pain. 6. With stage III rectal cancer, adjuvant therapy is recommended. Current chemotherapy protocols include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (leucovorin) alone oxaliplatin (Eloxatin). Oral fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine [Xeloda]) may also be used alone or with oxaliplatin. Metastatic colorectal cancer may be treated with bevacizumab (Avastin), an angiogenesis inhibitor, to prevent blood supply to tumors. Cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) block the epidermal growth factor. 7. Care of the perineal wound; importance of fluids and diet and dietitian contact information; care for colostomy, including skin care, odor control, supplies needed, and where to obtain supplies; signs and symptoms of complications to report and when to seek medical care; name and contact information for the wound, ostomy, and continence (WOC) nurse; name and contact information for the ostomy association and community resources; follow-up appointments with the surgeon and WOC nurse; and potential effects of ostomy on sexual activity, social life, work, and recreation and strategies to manage these situations. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Disturbed body image related to presence of stoma Acute pain related to surgical incisions and inadequate pain-control measures Risk for impaired skin integrity related to stoma drainage and open perineal wound Fear and anxiety related to diagnosis and further treatment of rectal cancer and possible terminal illness Collaborative problems: Potential complications: perineal infection; stomal necrosis, retraction, obstruction CHAPTER 44 Answer Key 1. c. Gallstones cause obstructive or posticteric jaundice and may elevate both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. 2. d. Hemolytic jaundice from a blood transfusion reaction is from increased breakdown of RBCs producing increased unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Hepatocellular jaundice results from hepatocellular disease. Hemolytic jaundice occurs with malaria. Obstructive jaundice is from obstructed bile flow through the liver or biliary duct system. 3. d. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is associated with poor sanitation and contaminated water in developing countries. 4. b. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that is transmitted via infectious blood and body products and is required for hepatitis D virus (HDV) replication, and ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 403 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. chronic HBV along with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for 80% of hepatocellular cancer cases. Hepatitis A virus (HA V), HCV , HDV , and HEV are all RNA viruses. 5. c. Immunization to HBV after v accination is identified with the hepatitis B surface antibody Anti-HBs. Anti-HBcIgG indicates previous or ongoing HBV infection. Surface antigen HBsAg is present in acute and chronic infection. Core antigen Anti-HBcIgM indicates acute infection and does not appear after vaccination. 6. d. HBV DN A quantitation is the best indicator of viral replication and effectiveness of therapy for chronic HBV . HBsAg is present in acute or chronic infection. HBeAg indicates high infectivity and can also be used to determine clinical management of patients with chronic HBV . Anti-HBcIgM indicates acute infection and anti-HBcIgG indicates ongoing infection. Anti-HDV is present in past or current infection with HDV and therefore HBV . Anti-HBs indicate previous infection with HBV or immunization. 7. d. Anti-HA V immunoglobulin M (IgM) indicates acute HA V infection. Anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG) indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV . Anti-HBc IgM indicates acute HBV infection. Anti-HA V IgG indicates previous infection with HA V . 8. b . HCV genotyping is done to predict HCV response to drug therapy. Anti-HCV and HCV RNA quantitation are tests completed to diagnose HCV . Recombinant immunoblot assays are used to confirm anti-HCV reactivity. 9. d. The systemic manifestations of rash, angioedema, arthritis, fever, and malaise in viral hepatitis are caused by the activation of the complement system by circulating immune complexes. Liver manifestations include jaundice from hepatic cell damage and cholestasis as well as anorexia. Impaired portal circulation usually does not occur in uncomplicated viral hepatitis but would be a liver manifestation. 10. c. Incubation symptoms occur before the onset of jaundice and include a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as well as discomfort and heaviness in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Pruritus, dark urine, and light-colored stools occur with the onset of jaundice in the acute phase. Easy fatigability and malaise are seen in the convalescent phase as jaundice disappears. 11. d. The most common cause of acute li ver failure is drugs, usually acetaminophen in combination with alcohol abuse. HBV is the second most common cause. 12. d. HBV v accine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) are used together prophylactically after a needle stick. Interferon is used to treat chronic HBV . 13. c. Indi viduals who have been exposed to hepatitis A through household contact or foodborne outbreaks should be given immune globulin within 1 to 2 weeks of exposure to prevent or modify the illness. Hepatitis A vaccine is used to provide preexposure immunity to the virus and is indicated for individuals at high risk for hepatitis A exposure. Although hepatitis A may be spread by sexual contact, the risk is higher for transmission with the oral- fecal route. 14. c. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (e.g., lami vudine), ribavirin, and pegylated interferon are used to treat chronic hepatitis B or C. Protease inhibitors are also used to treat chronic hepatitis C. No specific drugs are effective in treating acute viral hepatitis, although supportive drugs, such as antiemetics, sedatives, or antipruritics, may be used for symptom control. 15. b . The patient with hepatitis B is infectious for 4 to 6 months and precautions to prevent transmission through percutaneous and sexual contact should be maintained until tests for HbsAg or Anti-HBcIgM are negative. Close contact does not have to be avoided but close contacts of the patient should be vaccinated. Alcohol should not be used for at least a year and rest with increasing activity during convalescence is recommended. 16. a. Adequate nutrition is especially important in promoting regeneration of liver cells but the anorexia of viral hepatitis is often severe, requiring creative and innovative nursing interventions. Strict bed rest is not usually required, and the patient usually has only minor discomfort with hepatitis. Diversional activities may be required to promote psychologic rest but not during periods of fatigue. 17. c. Immunosuppressi ve agents are indicated in hepatitis associated with immune disorders to decrease liver damage caused by autoantibodies. Autoimmune hepatitis is similar to viral hepatitis in presenting signs and symptoms and may become chronic and lead to cirrhosis. 18. c. Corneal Fleischer rings, bro wnish red rings in the cornea near the limbus, are the hallmark of Wilson's disease. Pruritus (not seen with Wilson's disease) is commonly seen with jaundice or primary biliary cirrhosis. Renal failure associated with hepatorenal syndrome is not seen with Wilson's disease. Elevated serum iron levels are seen with hemochromatosis. 19. d. The majority of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) also have ulcerative colitis. The manifestations are otherwise similar to cirrhosis and PSC may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. 20. a, c, d. The anemia of cirrhosis is related to o veractivity of the enlarged spleen that removes blood cells from circulation. Vitamin B deficiencies from altered intake and metabolism of nutrients and decreased prothrombin production can increase bleeding tendencies. The other options do not contribute to anemia in the patient with cirrhosis. 21. a, b, d. There is no treatment for nonalcoholic f atty liver disease (NAFLD) except to control the other diseases that are frequently diagnosed in these individuals. These measures include weight loss for obesity, control of blood glucose for diabetes, control of hyperlipidemia, and treating hypertension if it is present. Ulcerative colitis is unrelated to NAFLD. 22. c. Esophageal v arices occur when collateral channels of circulation develop inelastic fragile veins as a result of portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is from scarring and nodular changes in the liver leading to compression of the veins and sinusoids, causing resistance of blood flow through the liver from the portal vein. It contributes to peripheral edema and ascites. Jaundice is from the inability of the liver to conjugate bilirubin. Biliary cirrhosis causes the loss of small bile ducts and ultimate cholestasis in patients with other autoimmune disorders. 404 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 23. d. Blood flow through the portal system is obstructed and causes portal hypertension that increases the blood pressure in the portal venous system. Decreased albumin production leads to decreased serum colloidal oncotic pressure that contributes to ascites. Hyperaldosteronism increases sodium and water retention and contributes to increased fluid retention, hypokalemia, and decreased urinary output. The retained fluid has low oncotic colloidal pressure and it escapes into the interstitial spaces, causing peripheral edema. Portal hypertension also contributes to esophageal varices. Reduced renal blood flow and increased serum levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) also contribute to impaired water excretion and ascites. 24. b. Serum bilirubin, both direct and indirect, would be expected to be increased in cirrhosis. Serum albumin and cholesterol are decreased and liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are initially elevated but may be normal in end-stage liver disease. 25. a. Oral hygiene may improve the patient's taste sensation. Food preferences are important but some foods may be restricted if the patient is on a low-sodium diet. The patient will feel more independent with self-feeding and will be more likely to increase intake by having someone sit with the patient while the patient eats. Snacks and supplements should be available whenever the patient desires them but should not be forced on the patient. 26. b, c. With diuretic therapy, fluid and electrolyte balance must be monitored; serum levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate must be monitored, especially hypokalemia. Renal function must be monitored with blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Water excess is manifested by muscle cramping, weakness, lethargy, and confusion. GI bleeding, body image disturbances, and bleeding tendencies seen with cirrhosis are not related to diuretic therapy. 27. d. Early signs (grade 1) of this neurologic condition include changes in mentation (e.g., depression, apathy, irritability, confusion, agitation, drowsiness, lethargy). Loss of consciousness (grade 4) is usually preceded by asterixis (grades 2 and 3), disorientation, hyperventilation, hypothermia, and alterations in reflexes. Increasing oliguria is a sign of hepatorenal syndrome. 28. c. Ammonia must be reduced to treat hepatic encephalopathy. The laxative, lactulose, decreases ammonia by trapping the ammonia and eliminating it in the feces. A -adrenergic blocker will be used to decrease portal venous pressure and decrease variceal bleeding. The proton pump inhibitor will decrease gastric acidity but will not eliminate blood already in the GI tract. The rifaximin will decrease bacterial flora and therefore decrease ammonia formation from protein metabolism. 29. c. The patient may not be oriented or able to walk to the bathroom alone because of hyperreflexia, asterixis, or decreased motor coordination. Turning should be done every 2 hours to prevent skin breakdown. Activity is limited to decrease ammonia as a by-product of protein metabolism. Although constipation will be prevented, it will not keep the patient safe. 30. b. The patient with advanced, complicated cirrhosis requires a high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet with moderate to low fat. Patients with cirrhosis are at risk for edema and ascites and their sodium intake may be limited. The tomato sandwich with salt-free butter best meets these requirements. Rough foods, such as popcorn, may irritate the esophagus and stomach and lead to bleeding. Peanut butter is high in sodium and fat and canned chicken noodle soup is very high in sodium. 31. d. Monitoring for viral, fungal, and bacterial infection after the liver transplant is essential, as only fever may be present with an infection. Alcohol will not be any better for the patient after the transplant than it was before the transplant. HBIG is given for postexposure protection from HBV . The head of the bed is elevated to improve ventilation with severe ascites. 32. c. Bleeding esophageal varices are a medical emergency. During an episode of bleeding, management of the airway and prevention of aspiration of blood are critical factors. Occult blood as well as fresh blood from the GI tract would be expected. Vasopressin causes vasoconstriction, decreased heart rate, and decreased coronary blood flow. IV nitroglycerin may be given with the vasopressin to counter these side effects. Portal shunting surgery is performed for esophageal varices but not during an acute hemorrhage. 33. d. By shunting fluid sequestered in the peritoneum into the venous system, pressure on esophageal veins is decreased and more volume is returned to the circulation, improving cardiac output and renal perfusion. However, because ammonia is diverted past the liver, hepatic encephalopathy continues. These procedures do not prolong life or promote liver function. 34. c. Abstinence from alcohol is very important in alcoholic cirrhosis and may result in improvement if started when liver damage is limited. Although further liver damage may be reduced by rest and nutrition, most changes in the liver cannot be reversed. Exercise does not promote portal circulation and very moderate exercise is recommended. Acetaminophen should not be used by the patient with alcoholic cirrhosis because this liver is more sensitive to the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. 35. c. Because the prognosis for cancer of the liver is poor and treatment is largely palliative, supportive nursing care is appropriate. The patient exhibits clinical manifestations of liver failure, as seen in any patient with advanced liver failure. Whether the cancer is primary or metastatic, there is usually a poor response to chemotherapy and surgery is indicated in the few patients that have localization of the tumor when there is no evidence of invasion of hepatic blood vessels. 36. d. Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with cirrhosis as well as for many adults and children with other irreversible liver diseases. Although health care providers make the decisions regarding the patient's qualifications for transplantation, nurses should be knowledgeable about the indications for transplantation and be able to discuss the patient's questions and concerns related to transplantation. Rejection is less of a problem in liver transplants than with other organs such as the kidney. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 405 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 37. d. A pancreatic abscess is a collection of pus that must be drained to prevent infection of adjacent organs and sepsis. Tetany from hypocalcemia is treated with IV calcium gluconate (10%). Although pseudocysts usually resolve spontaneously, they may be treated with surgical, percutaneous catheter, or endoscopic drainage to prevent perforation. Pleural effusion is treated by treating the cause (pancreatitis) and monitoring for respiratory distress and oxygen saturation. 38. d. The predominant symptom of acute pancreatitis is se vere, deep abdominal pain that is usually located in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) but may be in the midepigastrium. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent, temperature is elevated only slightly, and the patient has hypovolemia and may manifest symptoms of shock. 39. b . Although serum lipase levels and urinary amylase levels are increased, an increased serum amylase level is the criterion most commonly used to diagnose acute pancreatitis in the first 24 to 72 hours. Serum calcium levels are decreased. 40. c. P ancreatic rest and suppression of secretions are promoted by preventing any gastric contents from entering the duodenum, which would stimulate pancreatic activity. Surgery is not indicated for acute pancreatitis but may be used to drain abscesses or cysts. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatic related to gallstones. Pancreatic enzyme supplements are necessary in chronic pancreatitis if a deficiency in secretion occurs. 41. c. Positions that fle x the trunk and draw the knees up to the abdomen help to relieve the pain of acute pancreatitis and positioning the patient on the side with the head elevated decreases abdominal tension. Diversional techniques are not as helpful as positioning in controlling the pain. The patient is usually NPO because food intake increases the pain and inflammation. Bed rest is indicated during the acute attack because of hypovolemia and pain. 42. c. Sodium restriction is not indicated for patients reco vering from acute pancreatitis but the stools should be observed for steatorrhea, indicating that fat digestion is impaired, and glucose levels may be monitored for indication of impaired -cell function. Alcohol is a primary cause of pancreatitis and should not be used. 43. c. Chronic damage to the pancreas causes a def iciency of digestive enzymes and insulin resulting in malabsorption and diabetes mellitus. Abstinence from alcohol is necessary in both types of pancreatitis, as is a high-carbohydrate, high-protein, and low-fat diet. Although abdominal pain is a major manifestation of chronic pancreatitis, more commonly a constant heavy, gnawing feeling occurs. 44. a, b, c. Measures to pre vent attacks of pancreatitis are those that decrease the stimulation of the pancreas. Lower fat intake and foods that are less stimulating and irritating (bland) should be encouraged. Higher carbohydrates are less stimulating. Avoid alcohol and nicotine, since both stimulate the pancreas. Monitor for steatorrhea to determine effectiveness of the enzymes and because it may indicate worsening pancreatic function. Pancreatic enzymes should be taken with, not after, meals. 45. b . Major risk factors for pancreatic cancer are cigarette smoking, high-fat diet, diabetes, and exposure to benzidine. Pancreatic cancer is not directly associated with alcohol intake, as pancreatitis is. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. 46. d. In a Whipple procedure the head of the pancreas, gallbladder, part of the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, and sometimes the pylorus of the stomach are removed. The duodenum is responsible for the breakdown of food in the small intestine and regulates the rate of stomach emptying, which affects the patient's nutritional status. 47. a, b, c, e, f. Incidence of cholelithiasis is higher in w omen, multiparous women, persons over 40 years of age, and those with family history and obesity. Postmenopausal women taking estrogen therapy have a higher incidence than women taking oral contraceptives. Alcohol intake and diet do not increase the incidence of cholelithiasis. 4 8. a, c, d. Acalculous cholec ystitis is associated with prolonged immobility, nutrition, and diabetes mellitus. Hypothyroidism, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and absence of bile in the intestine are unrelated to this condition. 49. b . Absence of bile salts in the intestine and duodenum lead to clay-colored stools and steatorrhea. Soluble bilirubin in the blood excreted into the urine leads to dark urine. Contraction of the inflamed gallbladder leads to pain with fatty food intake. Obstruction of the common bile duct prevents bile drainage into the duodenum, with congestion of bile in the liver. Bilirubin absorption in the blood leads to jaundice. 50. a. Ultrasonograph y is 90% to 95% accurate in detecting gallstones and is a noninvasive procedure. An IV cholangiogram uses radiopaque dye to outline the gallbladder and the ducts. Liver function tests will be elevated if liver damage has occurred but do not indicate gallbladder disease. 51. a. NPO and nasog astric (NG) suction prevent gallbladder stimulation by food or fluids moving into the duodenum. Incisional choleycystectomy removes the gallbladder, not its stimulation. Administration of antiemetics decreases nausea and vomiting but does not decrease gallbladder stimulation. Anticholinergics counteract the smooth muscle spasms of the bile ducts to decrease pain. 52. d. The laparoscopic cholec ystectomy requires one to four small abdominal incisions to visualize and remove the gallbladder and the patient has small dressings placed over these incisions. The patient with an incisional cholecystectomy is usually hospitalized for 2 to 3 days, whereas the laparoscopic procedure allows same-day or next-day discharge with return to work within 1 week. A T-tube is placed in the common bile duct after exploration of the duct during an incisional cholecystectomy. 53. c. After remo val of the gallbladder, bile drains directly from the liver into the duodenum and a low-fat diet is recommended until adjustment to this change occurs. Most patients tolerate a regular diet with moderate fats but should avoid excessive fats, as large volumes of bile previously stored in the gallbladder are not available. Steatorrhea could occur with a large fat intake.406 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 54. a. The T-tube drains bile from the common bile duct until swelling from trauma has subsided and bile can freely enter the duodenum. The tube is placed to gravity drainage and should be kept open and free from kinks to prevent bile from backing up into the liver. The tube is not normally irrigated. 55. c. Bile-colored drainage or pus from any incision may indicate an infection and should be reported to the health care provider immediately. The bandages on the puncture sites should be removed the day after surgery, followed by bathing or showering. Referred shoulder pain is a common and expected problem following laparoscopic procedures, when carbon dioxide used to inflate the abdominal cavity is not readily absorbed by the body. Nausea and vomiting are not expected postoperatively and may indicate damage to other abdominal organs and should be reported to the health care provider. Case Study 1. Some etiologic factor causes injury to pancreatic cells or activation of the pancreatic enzymes in the pancreas rather than in the intestine and the activated enzymes digest the pancreas itself, a process known as autodigestion. Activated trypsin can digest the protein of the pancreas and activate other enzymes that cause damage to the pancreas. The pancreas may be edematous or it may become necrotic. 2. The two most common causes are gallbladder disease and alcohol abuse. After these, causes include cigarette smoking, biliary sludge, hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, certain drugs, metabolic disorders, and vascular diseases. 3. The serum and urinary amylase levels and serum lipase levels are elevated, indicating release of these enzymes into the blood circulating through the pancreas. The WBC count is high, indicating marked inflammation. The blood glucose level is elevated, indicating impairment of insulin production and release by the -cells. The decreased calcium indicates hypocalcemia, a sign of severe pancreatitis. 4. Hypocalcemia occurs in part because calcium combines with fatty acids released during fat necrosis of the pancreas. The nurse should observe for symptoms of tetany, such as jerking, irritability, muscular twitching, and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs. Numbness or tingling around the lips and in the fingers is an early indicator of hypocalcemia. 5. The pain is usually located in the LUQ but may be in the midepigastric area and frequently radiates to the back. It has a sudden onset and is described as severe, deep, piercing, and continuous. It is aggravated by eating and often begins when the patient is recumbent. It is not relieved by vomiting and may be accompanied by flushing, cyanosis, and dyspnea. 6. Hypovolemia, shock, and the local complications of pseudocysts and abscesses; paralytic ileus with abdominal distention; and crackles in the lungs. Seepage of blood-stained exudates may cause Grey Turner's or Cullen's signs. 7. NPO status and suction with an NG tube prevent gastric contents from entering the duodenum and stimulating pancreatic secretion. 8. Morphine is for pain relief. Pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor) is to decrease hydrochloric acid production by the stomach because hydrochloric acid stimulates pancreatic activity. Omeprazole (Prilosec) may be taken orally when the patient is no longer NPO. 9. Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to distention of the pancreas and peritoneal irritation Deficient fluid volume related to nausea, vomiting, NG suction, and restricted oral intake Impaired oral mucous membrane related to NG tube and NPO status Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to dietary restrictions, nausea and vomiting, and impaired digestion Collaborative problems: Potential complications: hypovolemia and shock, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, fluid and electrolyte imbalance CHAPTER 45 Answer Key 1. a. Adrenal gland; b. hilus; c. cortex; o. ureter; p. renal vein; q. renal artery; r. pyramid 2. a, 1; b, 4; c, 3; d, 6; e, 5; f, 2. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus and the ultrafiltrate flows from the Bowman's capsule to the tubules for reabsorption of essential materials and secretion of nonessential ones. In the proximal convoluted tubule, most electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and small proteins are reabsorbed. Water is conserved in the loop of Henle with chloride and sodium reabsorbed in the ascending loop. The distal convoluted tubules complete final water balance and acid-base balance. 3. a, c, e, f. The distal tubules regulate water and acid- base balance by reabsorption of water under antidiuretic hormone influence, secreting H+ reabsorbing and of Ca+2 with the influence of parathormone. The reabsorption of water without ADH occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule and the descending loop of Henle. The reabsorption of glucose and amino acids occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule. Active reabsorption of Cl - and passive reabsorption of Na+ occurs in the ascending loop of Henle. 4. a, c. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) responds to increased atrial distention by increasing sodium excretion and inhibiting renin, ADH, and angiotensin action. Aldosterone secretion is also suppressed. ANP also causes afferent arteriole relaxation that increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 5. c. GFR is primarily dependent on adequate blood flow and hydrostatic pressure. The glomerulus filters the blood. The GFR is the amount of blood filtered each minute by the glomeruli, which determines the concentration of urea in the blood. Increased permeability in the glomerulus causes loss of proteins in the urine. The prostaglandins increase the GFR with increased renal blood flow. 6. a. Renin is released in response to decreased arterial blood pressure (BP), renal ischemia, decreased extracellular fluid (ECF), decreased serum Na + concentration, and increased urinary Na+ concentration. It is the catalyst of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, which raises BP when ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 407 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. stimulated. ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to serum hyperosmolality and low blood volume. Aldosterone is secreted only after stimulation by angiotensin II. Kidney prostaglandins lower BP by causing vasodilation. 7. a. Erythropoietin is released when the oxygen tension of the renal blood supply is low and stimulates production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Hypotension causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as release of ADH. Hyperkalemia stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and fluid overload does not directly stimulate factors affecting the erythropoietin release by the kidney. 8. a, b, e. T esting would include urinalysis to see crystals and look for red blood cells. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan may also be done. 9. b . When the amount of urine in the bladder has reached 1200 mL, the person would need relief and probably catheterization. The bladder capacity ranges from 600 to 1000 mL. When there is 250 mL of urine in the bladder, the person will usually feel the urge to urinate and 400 to 600 mL will be uncomfortable. 10. c. Relaxation of female urethra, bladder , vagina, and pelvic floor muscles may contribute to stress and urge incontinence and urinary tract infections. The short urethra of women allows easier ascension and colonization of bacteria in the bladder than occurs in men and the urethra does not lengthen with age. The bladder capacity of men and women is the same but decreases with aging. 11. d. Decreased renal blood flo w and altered hormone levels result in a decreased ability to concentrate urine that results in an increased volume of dilute urine, which does not maintain the usual diurnal elimination pattern. A decrease in bladder capacity also contributes to nocturia but decreased bladder muscle tone results in urinary retention. Decreased renal mass decreases renal reserve but function is generally adequate under normal circumstances. 12. Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Response to Urinary Problem Health perception-health managementSmoking history, occupational history and history of exposure to carcinogenic and nephrotoxic chemicals, family history of kidney disease, geographic residence Nutritional-metabolic Low fluid intake or loss of fluids, high calcium and purine intake; caffeine, alcohol, carbonated beverage, artificial sweetener, or spicy food intake; weight gain resulting from fluid retention; anorexia, nausea, or vomiting; supplements and herbal therapy Elimination Change in appearance and amount of urine, change in urinary patterns, necessary assistance in emptying bladder, bowel function Activity-exercise Change in energy level, sedentary lifestyle, urine leakage during activity Sleep-rest Sleep deprivation from nocturia Cognitive-perceptual Pain in flank, groin, or suprapubic area; dysuria; absence of pain with other urinary symptoms; cognitive impairment affecting continence; mobility, visual acuity, and dexterity Self-perception-self-concept Decreased self-esteem and body image because of urinary problems Role-relationship Problems maintaining job and social relationships Sexuality-reproductive Change in sexual pleasure or performanceCoping-stress tolerance Withdrawal or ineffective coping with incontinence or urinary problemValue-belief Any treatment decisions that are affected by value syste 13. c. T o assess for kidney tenderness, the nurse strikes the fist of one hand over the dorsum of the other hand at the posterior costovertebral angle. The upper abdominal quadrants and costovertebral angles are auscultated for vascular bruits in the renal vessels and aorta and an empty bladder is not palpable. The kidneys are palpated through the abdomen, with the patient supine. 14. d. Stress incontinence is in voluntary urination with increased pressure when sneezing or coughing and is seen with weakness of sphincter control. Nocturia is frequent urination at night. Micturition is the evacuation of urine. Urge incontinence is involuntary urination is preceded by urinary urgency. 15. a. Retention is the inability to v oid. Anuria is no urine formation. Polyuria is a large amount of urine output over time. Frequency is increased incidence of urination. 16. b . Hesitancy is difficulty starting the urine stream and is common with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oliguria is scanty urine formation and output. Hematuria is blood in the urine. Pneumaturia is urine containing gas, as is caused by a fistula between the bowel and bladder. 17. c. Enuresis is in voluntary urination at night. Ascites is excess fluid in the intraperitoneal cavity. Dysuria is painful urination. Urgency is the feeling of needing to void immediately. 18. b . Bacteria in warm urine specimens multiply rapidly and false or unreliable bacterial counts may occur with urine that has been sitting for periods of time. Glucose, specific gravity, and WBCs do not change in urine specimens but pH becomes more alkaline, RBCs are hemolyzed, and casts may disintegrate.408 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 19. b. Cloudiness in a fresh urine specimen, WBC count above 5 per high-power field (hpf), and the presence of casts are all indicative of urinary tract infection (UTI). The pH is usually elevated because bacteria in urine split the urea alkaline ammonia. Cloudy, brown urine usually indicates hematuria or the presence of bile. Colorless urine is usually very dilute. Option a is characteristic of normal urine. 20. a. A urine specific gravity of 1.002 is low, indicating dilute urine and the excretion of excess fluid. Fluid overload, diuretics, or lack of ADH can cause dilute urine. Normal urine specific gravity is 1.003 to 1.030. A high urine specific gravity indicates concentrated urine that would be seen in dehydration. 21. d. During a renal arteriogram, a catheter is inserted, most commonly at the femoral artery. Following the procedure the patient is positioned with the affected leg extended with a pressure dressing applied. Peripheral pulse monitoring is essential to detect the development of thrombi around the insertion site, which may occlude blood supply to the leg. Gross bleeding in the urine is a complication of a renal biopsy. Allergy to the contrast medium should be established before the procedure. 22. c. The rate at which creatinine is cleared from the blood and eliminated in the urine approximates the GFR and is the most specific test of renal function. The renal scan is useful in showing the location, size, and shape of the kidney and general blood perfusion. 23. a. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is increased in patients with renal problems. It may also be increased when there is rapid or extensive tissue damage from other causes. Low protein intake may cause a low BUN. 24. Laboratory Finding Impaired Kidney Function Serum Ca2+: 7.2 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)Impaired conversion of inactive vitamin D to active vitamin D results in poor calcium absorption from the bowel, resulting in hypocalcemia. Hb: 9.6 g/dL (96 g/L)Loss of cells that produce erythropoietin results in lack of stimulation of bone marrow to produce RBCs. Serum creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL (283 mmol/L)This serum creatinine level is high, indicating the loss of tubular secretion (passage of substances from the blood into the tubule) by the kidney. 25. b. Bleeding from the kidney following a biopsy is the most serious complication of the procedure and urine must be examined for both gross and microscopic blood, in addition to vital signs and hematocrit levels being monitored. Following a cystoscopy the patient may have burning with urination and warm sitz baths may be used. Urinary infections are a complication of any procedure requiring instrumentation of the bladder. 26. a, d, e. A clean-catch urine specimen is obtained in a sterile container after cleaning the meatus. The patient will void a small amount in the toilet, stop, and then void in the container to catch the urine midstream. The first morning specimen is best for a urinalysis. A full bladder is necessary for a urine flow study. A urinary catheter is inserted immediately after voiding to assess residual urine. 27. c. A cathartic the evening before the procedure and sensitivity to iodine are important for both intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and renal arteriogram but the salty taste is only a possibility with IVP. The cystometrogram involves filling the bladder with water or saline to measure tone and stability. The kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) is an x-ray that may have bowel preparation. CHAPTER 46 Answer Key 1. a. An upper urinary tract infection (UTI) affects the renal parenchyma, renal pelvis, and ureters. A lower UTI is an infection of the bladder and/or urethra. A complicated UTI exists in the presence of obstruction, stones, or preexisting diseases. An uncomplicated UTI occurs in an otherwise normal urinary tract. 2. c. The usual classic manifestations of UTI are often absent in older adults, who tend to experience nonlocalized abdominal discomfort and cognitive impairment characterized by confusion or decreased level of consciousness rather than dysuria and suprapubic pain. 3. c. Unless a patient has a history of recurrent UTIs or a complicated UTI, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMX) or nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin) is usually used to empirically treat an initial UTI without a culture and sensitivity or other testing. Asymptomatic bacteriuria does not justify treatment but symptomatic UTIs should always be treated. 4. b. The bladder should be emptied at least every 3 to 4 hours. Fluid intake should be increased to about 2000 mL/day without caffeine, alcohol, citrus juices, and chocolate drinks, because they are potential bladder irritants. Cleaning the urinary meatus with an antiinfective will irritate the meatus but the perineal area should be wiped from front to back after urination and defecation to prevent fecal contamination of the meatus. 5. c. Ascending infections from the bladder to the kidney are prevented by the normal anatomy and physiology of the urinary tract unless a preexisting condition, such as vesicoureteral reflux or lower urinary tract dysfunction (bladder tumors, prostatic hyperplasia, strictures, or stones), is present. Resistance to antibiotics and failure to take a full prescription of antibiotics for a UTI usually result in relapse or reinfection of the lower urinary tract. 6. a. Systemic manifestations of fever and chills with leukocytosis and nausea and vomiting are more common in pyelonephritis than in a lower UTI. Dysuria, frequency, and urgency can be present with both. 7. d. A urine specimen specifically obtained for culture and sensitivity is required to diagnose pyelonephritis because it will show pyuria, the specific bacteriuria, and what drug the bacteria is sensitive to for treatment. The renal biopsy is used to diagnose chronic pyelonephritis or cancer. Blood cultures would be done if bacteremia is suspected. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) would increase renal irritation, but CT urograms may be used to assess for signs of infection in the kidney and complications of pyelonephritis. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 409 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8. d. The symptoms of interstitial c ystitis (IC) imitate those of an infection of the bladder but the urine is free of infectious agents. Unlike a bladder infection, the pain with IC increases as urine collects in the bladder and is temporarily relieved by urination. Acidic urine is very irritating to the bladder in IC and the bladder is small but urinary retention is not common. 9. d. Calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief) alkalinizes the urine and can help to relieve the irritation from acidic foods. A diet low in acidic foods is recommended and if a multivitamin is used, high-potency vitamins should be avoided because these products may irritate the bladder. A voiding diary is useful in diagnosis but does not need to be kept indefinitely. 10. c. Glomerulonephritis is not an infection b ut rather an antibody-induced injury to the glomerulus, where either autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) directly damage the tissue or antibodies reacting with nonglomerular antigens are randomly deposited as immune complexes along the GBM. Prior infection by bacteria or viruses may stimulate the antibody production but is not present or active at the time of glomerular damage. 11. d. An ele vated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) indicates that the kidneys are not clearing nitrogenous wastes from the blood and protein may be restricted until the kidney recovers. Proteinuria indicates loss of protein from the blood and possibly a need for increased protein intake. Hypertension is treated with sodium and fluid restriction, diuretics, and antihypertensive drugs. The hematuria is not specifically treated. 12. a. Most patients reco ver completely from acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) with supportive treatment. Chronic glomerulonephritis that progresses insidiously over years and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis that results in renal failure within weeks or months occur in only a few patients with APSGN. In Goodpasture syndrome, antibodies are present against both the GBM and the alveolar basement membrane of the lungs and dysfunction of both renal and pulmonary are present. 13. c. The massi ve proteinuria that results from increased glomerular membrane permeability in nephrotic syndrome leaves the blood without adequate proteins (hypoalbuminemia) to create an oncotic colloidal pressure to hold fluid in the vessels. Without oncotic pressure, fluid moves into the interstitium, causing severe edema. Hypercoagulability occurs in nephrotic syndrome but is not a factor in edema formation and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is not necessarily affected in nephrotic syndrome. 14. a. 6; b . 3; 4; e. 5; g. 2; h. 7 15. b . The manifestations of renal tuberculosis are described. Urosepsis is when the UTI has spread systemically. Urethral diverticula are localized outpouching of the urethra and occur more often in women. Goodpasture syndrome manifests with flu-like symptoms with pulmonary symptoms that include cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary insufficiency and renal manifestations that include hematuria, weakness, pallor, anemia, and renal failure. 16. c. Because crystallization of stone constituents can precipitate and unite to form a stone when in supersaturated concentrations, one of the best ways to prevent stones of any type is by drinking adequate fluids to keep the urine dilute and flowing (e.g., an output of about 2 L of urine a day). Sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for renal stones but exercise also causes fluid loss and a need for additional fluids. Protein foods high in purine should be restricted only for the small percentage of patients with uric acid stones and although UTIs contribute to stone formation, prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. 17. c. Calcium oxalate calculi are most common and small enough to get trapped in the ureter. 18. b . Struvite calculi are most common in women and always occur with UTIs. They are also usually large staghorn type. 19. b, e. This patient is most lik ely to have uric acid calculi, which have a high incidence in Jewish men, and gout is a predisposing factor. The treatment will include allopurinol and reducing animal protein intake to reduce purine, as uric acid is a waste product from purine metabolism. Reducing oxalate and using thiazide diuretics help to treat calcium tiopronin prevent cystine crystallization for cystine calculi. Reducing intake of milk products to reduce calcium intake may be used with calcium calculi. 20. a. Calcium phosphate calculi are typically mix ed with struvite or oxalate stones and related to alkaline urine. Cystine calculi are associated with a genetic autosomal recessive defect and defective GI and kidney absorption of cystine. Struvite calculi are three to four times more common in women than in men. 21. c. A classic sign of the passage of a calculus do wn the ureter is intense, colicky back pain that may radiate into the testicles, labia, or groin and may be accompanied by mild shock with cool, moist skin. Many patients with renal stones do not have a history of chronic UTIs. Stones obstructing a calyx or at the ureteropelvic junction may produce dull costovertebral flank pain and large bladder stones may cause bladder fullness and lower obstructive symptoms. 22. d. Oxalate-rich foods should be limited to reduce oxalate excretion. Foods high in oxalate include spinach, rhubarb, asparagus, cabbage, and tomatoes, in addition to chocolate, coffee, and cocoa. Currently, it is believed that high dietary calcium intake may actually lower the risk for renal stones by reducing the intestinal oxalate absorption and therefore the urinary excretion of oxalate. Milk, milk products, dried beans, and dried fruits are high sources of calcium. Organ meats are high in purine, which contributes to uric acid lithiasis. 23. b . A high fluid intake maintains dilute urine, which decreases bacterial concentration in addition to washing stone fragments and expected blood through the urinary system following lithotripsy. High urine output also prevents supersaturation of minerals. Moist heat to the flank may be helpful to relieve muscle spasms during renal colic and all urine should be strained in patients with renal stones to collect and identify stone composition but these are not related to infection. 24. b . The patient with urethral stricture will benefit from being taught to dilate the urethra by self-catheterization every few days. Renal trauma is treated related to the severity of the injury with bed rest, fluids, and analgesia. Renal artery stenosis includes control of hypertension 410 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. with possible surgical revascularization. Accelerated nephrosclerosis is associated with malignant hypertension that must be aggressively treated as well as monitoring kidney function. 25. b. Adult-onset polycystic kidney disease is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder that often manifests after the patient has children but the children should receive genetic counseling regarding their life choices. The disease progresses slowly, eventually causing progressive renal failure. Hereditary medullary cystic disease causes poor concentration ability of the kidneys and classic Alport syndrome is a hereditary nephritis that is associated with deafness and deformities of the optic lens. 26. d. Systemic lupus erythematosus causes connective tissue damage that affects the glomerulus. Gout deposits uric acid crystals in the kidney. Amyloidosis deposits hyaline bodies in the kidney. Diabetes mellitus causes microvascular damage affecting the kidney. 27. a. Both cancer of the kidney and cancer of the bladder are associated with smoking. A family history of renal cancer is a risk factor for kidney cancer and cancer of the bladder has been associated with the use of phenacetin-containing analgesics and recurrent upper UTIs. 28. c. There are no early characteristic symptoms of cancer of the kidney and gross hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable mass do not occur until the disease is advanced. The treatment of choice is a partial or radical nephrectomy, which can be successful in early disease. Many kidney cancers are diagnosed as incidental imaging findings. Targeted therapy is the preferred treatment for metastatic kidney cancer. Radiation is palliative. The most common sites of metastases are the lungs, liver, and long bones. 29. d, e, f. Urge incontinence is involuntary urination preceded by urgency caused by overactivity of the detrusor muscle when the bladder contracts by reflex, which overrides central inhibition. Treatment includes treating the underlying cause and retraining the bladder with urge suppression, anticholinergic drugs, or containment devices. The other options are characteristic of stress incontinence. Patients may have a combination of urge and stress incontinence. 30. a. Reflex incontinence occurs with no warning, equally during the day and night, and with spinal cord lesions above S2. Overflow incontinence is when the pressure of urine in the overfull bladder overcomes sphincter control and is caused by bladder or urethral outlet obstruction. Functional incontinence is loss of urine resulting from cognitive, functional, or environmental factors. Incontinence after trauma or surgery occurs when fistulas have occurred or after a prostatectomy. 31. c, d, e. -Adrenergic blockers block the stimulation of the smooth muscle of the bladder, 5-reductase inhibitors decrease outlet resistance, and bethanechol enhances bladder contractions. Baclofen or diazepam is used to relax the external sphincter for reflex incontinence. Anticholinergics are used to relax bladder tone and increase sphincter tone with urge incontinence. 32. c. Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) increase the tone of the urethral sphincters and should be done in sets of 10 or more contractions four to five times a day (total of 40 to 50 per day). Frequent bladder emptying is recommended for patients with urge incontinence and an increase in pressure on the bladder is recommended for patients with overflow incontinence. Absorptive perineal pads should be only a temporary measure because long- term use discourages continence and can lead to skin problems. 33. c. All urinary catheters in hospitalized patients pose a very high risk for infection, especially antibiotic-resistant, health care-associated infections, and scrupulous aseptic technique is essential in the insertion and maintenance of all catheters. Routine irrigations are not performed. Turning the patient to promote drainage is recommended only for suprapubic catheters. Cleaning the insertion site with soap and water should be performed for urethral and suprapubic catheters but lotion or powder should be avoided and site care for other catheters may require special interventions. 34. b. Output from ureteral catheters must be monitored every 1 to 2 hours because an obstruction will cause overdistention of the renal pelvis and renal damage. The renal pelvis has a capacity of only 3 to 5 mL and if irrigation is ordered, no more than 5 mL of sterile saline is used. The patient with a ureteral catheter is usually kept on bed rest until specific orders for ambulation are given. Suprapubic tubes may be milked to prevent obstruction of the catheter by sediment and clots. 35. b. A nephrectomy incision is usually in the flank, just below the diaphragm or in the abdominal area. Although the patient is reluctant to breathe deeply because of incisional pain, the lungs should be clear. Decreased sounds and shallow respirations are abnormal and would require intervention. 36. a. The Kock pouch is a continent diversion created by formation of an ileal pouch with an external stoma requiring catheterization. Ileal conduit is the most common incontinent diversion using a stoma of resected ileum with implanted ureters. Orthotopic neobladder is a new bladder from a reshaped segment of intestine in the anatomic position of the bladder with urine discharged through the urethra. A cutaneous ureterostomy diverts the ureter from the bladder to the abdominal skin but there is frequent scarring and strictures of the ureters, so ileal conduits are used more often. 37. d. Urine drains continuously from an ileal conduit and the drainage bag must be emptied every 2 to 3 hours and measured to ensure adequate urinary output. Fitting for a permanent appliance is not done until the stoma shrinks to its normal size in a few weeks. With an ileal conduit, mucus is present in the urine because it is secreted by the ileal segment as a result of the irritating effect of the urine but the surgery causes paralytic ileus and the patient will be NPO for several days postoperatively. Self-catheterization is performed when patients have formation of a continent Kock pouch. 38. b. Because the stoma continuously drains urine, a wick formed of a rolled-up 4 \u00d7 4 gauze or a tampon is held against the stoma to absorb the urine while the skin is cleaned and a new appliance is attached. The skin is cleaned with warm water only because soap and other agents cause drying and irritation and clean, not sterile, technique is used. The appliance should be left in place for as long as possible before it loosens and allows leakage onto the skin, perhaps up to 14 days. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 411 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 39. e, f. The unlicensed assisti ve personnel (UAP) may assist the incontinent patient to void at regular intervals and provide perineal care. An RN should perform the assessments and teaching. In long-term care and rehabilitation facilities, UAP may use bladder scanners after they are trained. Case Study 1. The staging of bladder cancer is determined by the depth of invasion of the bladder wall and surrounding tissue. Stage II indicates that the tumor has grown into the muscle layer of the bladder but not passed completely through it. The TNM grading system indicates the characteristics of the tumor (T), the nodal involvement (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). (See Chapter 16 for TNM classification.) 2. Opioids and stool softeners may be used for a short time after the procedure. P.G. will be taught to drink a large volume of fluid and monitor the color and consistency of the urine. The urine will be pink at first but should not be red or contain clots. Seven to 10 days after the tumor resection P.G. may observe dark red or rust-colored flecks in the urine from the healing tumor resection sites. 3. The drug will be instilled into the empty bladder via a urethral catheter at weekly intervals for 6 to 12 weeks. The drug needs to be retained for about 2 hours with P.G.'s position changed about every 15 minutes to ensure that the drug comes into maximum contact with all areas of the bladder. He may have irritative symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and bladder spasms, in addition to hematuria during the weeks of treatment. Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy may cause flu-like symptoms or systemic infection because BCG stimulates the immune system rather than directly destroying cancer cells. The usual side effects of cancer chemotherapy are not experienced with BCG therapy or with intravesical chemotherapy. 4. P .G. should stop smoking; it is the only significant risk factor in his history. Maintenance therapy after the initial induction regimen may be beneficial, as there is a high rate of disease recurrence. 5. F ollow-up cystoscopies on a regular basis are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and detect any new tumors while they are in a superficial stage. Two thirds of patients have tumor recurrence within 5 years and nearly 95% have recurrence by 15 years. 6. A c ystectomy with urinary diversion would be indicated. This could be an incontinent urinary diversion or a continent urinary diversion. 7. The patient' s ability and readiness to learn must be considered. His anxiety and fear may affect the teaching. Psychosocial aspects of living with a stoma may affect the choice. Acceptance of the surgery and of alterations in body image is needed to ensure the patient's best adjustment. If a continent diversion is used, the patient must be able to catheterize the pouch every 4 to 6 hours and irrigate it daily. Orthotopic bladder reconstruction may be considered if the cancer did not involve the bladder neck or urethra and the patient has normal renal and liver function, a longer than 1- to 2-year life expectancy, adequate motor skills, and no history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. Obese patients are not good candidates for orthotopic bladder reconstruction. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety related to unknown outcome Impaired urinary elimination related to effects of treatment Acute pain related to effects of treatment Risk for infection related to effects of treatment Risk for sexual dysfunction related to reactions to treatment Collaborati ve problems: Potential complication: bladder injury , impaired skin integrity CHAPTER 47 Answer Key 1. d, e, f. Intrarenal causes of acute kidne y injury (AKI) include conditions that cause direct damage to the kidney tissue, including nephrotoxic drugs, acute glomerulonephritis, and tubular obstruction by myoglobin, or prolonged ischemia. Anaphylaxis and other prerenal problems are frequently the initial cause of AKI. Renal stones and bladder cancer are among the postrenal causes of AKI. 2. c, e. Because the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for 2 days, she is probably dehydrated and hypovolemic. Decreased cardiac output (CO) is most likely because she is older and takes heart medicine, which is probably for heart failure or hypertension. Both hypovolemia and decreased CO cause prerenal AKI. Anaphylaxis is also a cause of prerenal AKI but is not likely in this situation. Nephrotoxic drugs would contribute to intrarenal causes of AKI and renal calculi would be a postrenal cause of AKI. 3. d. Acute tub ular necrosis (ATN) is primarily the result of ischemia, nephrotoxins, or sepsis. Major surgery is most likely to cause severe kidney ischemia in the patient requiring a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion hemolytic reaction produces nephrotoxic injury if it occurs. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and acetaminophen overdose will not contribute to ATN. 4. b . Injury is the stage of RIFLE classification when urine output is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours, the serum creatinine is increased times two or the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is decreased by 50%. This stage may be reversible by treating the cause or, in this patient, the dehydration by administering IV fluid and a low dose of a loop diuretic, furosemide (Lasix). Assessing the daily weight will be done to monitor fluid changes but it is not the first treatment the nurse should anticipate. IV administration of insulin and sodium bicarbonate would be used for hyperkalemia. Checking the urinalysis will help to determine if the AKI has a prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal cause by what is seen in the urine but with this patient's dehydration, it is thought to be prerenal to begin treatment. 5. d. In prerenal oliguria, the oliguria is caused by a decrease in circulating blood volume and there is no damage yet to the renal tissue. It can be reversed by correcting the precipitating factor, such as fluid replace ment for hypovolemia. Prerenal oliguria is characterized by urine with a high specific gravity and a low sodium concentration, whereas oliguria of intrarenal failure is characterized by urine with a low specific gravity and a high sodium 412 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. concentration. Malignant hypertension causes damage to renal tissue and intrarenal oliguria. 6. b. A urine specific gravity that is consistently 1.010 and a urine osmolality of about 300 mOsm/kg is the same specific gravity and osmolality as plasma. This indicates that tubules are damaged and unable to concentrate urine. Hematuria is more common with postrenal damage. Tubular damage is associated with a high sodium concentration (greater than 40 mEq/L). 7. a. Metabolic acidosis occurs in AKI because the kidneys cannot synthesize ammonia or excrete acid products of metabolism, resulting in an increased acid load. Sodium is lost in urine because the kidneys cannot conserve sodium. Impaired excretion of potassium results in hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate is normally generated and reabsorbed by the functioning kidney to maintain acid-base balance. 8. d. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels remain high during the oliguric and diuretic phases of AKI. The recovery phase begins when the glomerular filtration returns to a rate at which BUN and creatinine stabilize and then decrease. Urinary output of 3 to 5 L/ day, decreasing sodium and potassium levels, and fluid weight loss are characteristic of the diuretic phase of AKI. 9. d. Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening complication of AKI in the oliguric phase. Muscle weakness and abdominal cramping are signs of the neuromuscular impairment that occurs with hyperkalemia. In addition, hyperkalemia can cause the cardiac conduction abnormalities of peaked T wave, prolonged PR interval, prolonged QRS interval, and depressed ST segment. Urine output of 300 mL/day is expected during the oliguric phase, as is the development of peripheral edema. 10. d. Measuring daily weights with the same scale at the same time each day allows for the evaluation and detection of excessive body fluid gains or losses. Infection is the leading cause of death in AKI, so meticulous aseptic technique is critical. The fluid limitation in the oliguric phase is 600 mL plus the prior day's measured fluid loss. Dietary sodium and potassium intake are managed according to the plasma levels. 11. b. This patient has at least three of the six common indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT), including (1) high potassium level, (2) metabolic acidosis, and (3) changed mental status. The other indications are (4) volume overload, resulting in compromised cardiac status (this patient has a history of hypertension), (5) BUN greater than 120 mg/dL, and (6) pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac tamponade. Although the other treatments may be used, they will not be as effective as RRT for this older patient. Loop diuretics and increased fluid are used if the patient is dehydrated. Insulin and sodium bicarbonate can be used to temporarily drive the potassium into the cells. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) is used to actually decrease the amount of potassium in the body. 12. a, b, c, d, e. High-risk patients include those exposed to nephrotoxic agents and advanced age (a), massive trauma (b), prolonged hypovolemia or hypotension (possibly b and c), obstetric complications (c), cardiac failure (d), preexisting chronic kidney disease, extensive burns, or sepsis. Patients with prostate cancer may have obstruction of the outflow tract, which increases risk of postrenal AKI (e). 13. a. Dysrhythmias may occur with an elevated potassium level and are potentially lethal. Monitor the rhythm while contacting the physician or calling the rapid response team. Vital signs should be checked. Depending on the patient's history and cause of increased potassium, instruct the patient about dietary sources of potassium; however, this would not help at this point. The nurse may want to recheck the value but until then the heart rhythm needs to be monitored. 14. b. During acidosis, potassium moves out of the cell in exchange for H+ ions, increasing the serum potassium level. Correction of the acidosis with sodium bicarbonate will help to shift the potassium back into the cells. A decrease in pH and the bicarbonate and PaCO2 levels would indicate worsening acidosis. 15. b. Stages of chronic kidney disease are based on the GFR. No specific markers of urinary output, mental status, or azotemia classify the degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 16. a, b, d. Pruritus is common in patients receiving dialysis. It causes scratching from dry skin, sensory neuropathy, and calcium-phosphate deposition in the skin. Vascular calcifications contribute to cardiovascular disease, not to itching skin. Uremic frost rarely occurs without BUN levels greater than 200 mg/dL, which should not occur in a patient on dialysis; urea crystallizes on the skin and also causes pruritis. 17. c. Uremic fetor, or the urine odor of the breath, is caused by high urea content in the blood. Increased ammonia from bacterial breakdown of urea leads to stomatitis and mucosal ulcerations. Irritation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from urea in CKD contributes to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Ingestion of iron salts and calcium-containing phosphate binders, limited fluid intake, and limited activity cause constipation. 18. c. Kussmaul respirations occur with severe metabolic acidosis when the respiratory system is attempting to compensate by removing carbon dioxide with exhalations. Uremic pleuritis would cause a pleural friction rub. Decreased pulmonary macrophage activity increases the risk of pulmonary infection. Dyspnea would occur with pulmonary edema. 19. d. As GFR decreases, BUN and serum creatinine levels increase. Although elevated BUN and creatinine indicate that waste products are accumulating, the calculated GFR is considered a more accurate indicator of kidney function than BUN or serum creatinine. 20. b. Hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening dysrhythmias. Hypocalcemia leads to an accelerated rate of bone remodeling and potentially to tetany. Hyponatremia may lead to confusion. Elevated sodium levels lead to edema, hypertension, and heart failure. Hypermagnesemia may decrease reflexes, mental status, and blood pressure. 21. c. The calcium-phosphorus imbalances that occur in CKD result in hypocalcemia, from a deficiency of active vitamin D and increased phosphorus levels. This leads to an increased rate of bone remodeling with a weakened bone matrix. Aluminum accumulation is also believed to ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 413 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. contribute to the osteomalacia. Osteitis fibrosa involves replacement of calcium in the bone with fibrous tissue and is primarily a result of elevated levels of parathyroid hormone resulting from hypocalcemia. 22. d. A patient with CKD may ha ve unlimited intake of sugars and starches (unless the patient is diabetic) and hard candy is an appropriate snack and may help to relieve the metallic and urine taste that is common in the mouth. Raisins are a high-potassium food. Ice cream contains protein and phosphate and counts as fluid. Pickled foods have high sodium content. 23. a. Erythropoietin is used to treat anemia, as it stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. 24. b . Nifedipine (Procardia) is a calcium channel blocker and furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic. Both are used to treat hypertension. 25. a, b, d. Cinacalcet (Sensipar), a calcimimetic agent binder; and calcium acetate (PhosLo), a calcium-based phosphate binder are used to treat mineral and bone disorder in CKD. IV glucose and insulin and IV 10% calcium gluconate along with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) are used to treat the hyperkalemia of CKD. 26. d. In the patient with CKD, when serum calcium le vels are increased, calcium-based phosphate binders are not used. The nutrient supplemented for patients on dialysis is folic acid. The various body system manifestations occur with uremia, which includes azotemia. Meperidine is contraindicated in patients with CKD related to possible seizures. 27. c. The most common causes of CKD in the United States are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The nurse should obtain information on long-term health problems that are related to kidney disease. The other disorders are not closely associated with renal disease. 28. c, e. Peritoneal dialysis is less stressful for the cardiovascular system and requires fewer dietary restrictions. Peritoneal dialysis actually contributes to more protein loss and increased hyperlipidemia. The fluid and creatinine removal are slower with peritoneal dialysis than hemodialysis. 29. c. De xtrose or icodextrin or amino acid is added to dialysate fluid to create an osmotic gradient across the membrane to remove excess fluid from the blood. The dialysate fluid has no potassium so that potassium will diffuse into the dialysate from the blood. Dialysate also usually contains higher calcium to promote its movement into the blood. Dialysate sodium is usually less than or equal to that of blood to prevent sodium and fluid retention. 30. a. 3; b . 2; c. 1 31. b . Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is the type of dialysis in which the patient dialyzes during sleep and leaves the fluid in the abdomen during the day. Long nocturnal hemodialysis occurs while the patient is sleeping and is done up to six times per week. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is a type of continuous renal replacement therapy used to treat AKI. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is dialysis that is done with exchanges of 1.5 to 3 L of dialysate at least four times daily. 32. b . Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and may require catheter removal and termination of dialysis. Infection occurs from contamination of the dialysate or tubing or from progression of exit-site or tunnel infections and strict sterile technique must be used by health professionals as well as the patient to prevent contamination. Too-rapid infusion may cause shoulder pain and pain may be caused if the catheter tip touches the bowel. Difficulty breathing, atelectasis, and pneumonia may occur from pressure of the fluid on the diaphragm, which may be prevented by elevating the head of the bed and promoting repositioning and deep breathing. 33. c. A more permanent, soft, fle xible Silastic double-lumen catheter is used for long-term access when other forms of vascular access have failed. These catheters are tunneled subcutaneously and have Dacron cuffs that prevent infection from tracking along the catheter. 34. a. While patients are under going hemodialysis, they can perform quiet activities that do not require the limb that has the vascular access. Blood pressure is monitored frequently and the dialyzer monitors dialysis function but cardiac monitoring is not usually indicated. The hemodialysis machine continuously circulates both the blood and the dialysate past the semipermeable membrane in the machine. Graft and fistula access involve the insertion of two needles into the site: one to remove blood from and the other to return blood to the dialyzer. 35. b . A patent arteriovenous fistula (A VF) creates turbulent blood flow that can be assessed by listening for a bruit or palpated for a thrill as the blood passes through the graft. Assessment of neurovascular status in the extremity distal to the graft site is important to determine that the graft does not impair circulation to the extremity but the neurovascular status does not indicate whether the graft is open. 36. c. Continuous renal replacement therap y (CRRT) is indicated for the patient with AKI as an alternative or adjunct to hemodialysis to slowly remove solutes and fluid in the hemodynamically unstable patient. It is especially useful for treatment of fluid overload, but hemodialysis is indicated for treatment of hyperkalemia, pericarditis, or other serious effects of uremia. 37. d. Extensi ve vascular disease is a contraindication for renal transplantation, primarily because adequate blood supply is essential for the health of the new kidney. Other contraindications include disseminated malignancies, refractory or untreated cardiac disease, chronic respiratory failure, chronic infection, or unresolved psychosocial disorders. Coronary artery disease (CAD) may be treated with bypass surgery before transplantation and transplantation can relieve hypertension. Hepatitis B or C infection is not a contraindication. 38. a. Fluid and electrolyte balance is critical in the transplant recipient patient, especially because diuresis often begins soon after surgery. Fluid replacement is adjusted hourly based on kidney function and urine output. Urine-tinged drainage on the abdominal dressing may indicate leakage from the ureter implanted into the bladder and the health care provider should be notified. The donor patient may have a flank or laparoscopic incision(s) where the kidney 414 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. was removed. The recipient has an abdominal incision where the kidney was placed in the iliac fossa. The urinary catheter is usually used for 2 to 3 days to monitor urine output and kidney function. 39. a. Infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after transplantation because the surgery, the immunosuppressive drugs, and the effects of CKD all suppress the body's normal defense mechanisms, thus increasing the risk of infection. The nurse must assess the patient as well as use aseptic technique to prevent infections. Rejection may occur but for other reasons. Malignancy occurrence increases later due to immunosuppressive therapy. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death after renal transplantation but this would not be expected to cause death within the first month after transplantation. Case Study 1. The kidney is recognized as foreign and, as a foreign substance, stimulates activation of the immune system. T helper cells are activated to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and T cytotoxic lymphocytes are sensitized. After T cytotoxic lymphocytes proliferate, they attack the transplanted kidney, setting in process the activation of the inflammatory and complement systems. This usually occurs 4 days to 6 months after the transplant but it may occur later. It is not uncommon to have at least one rejection episode. 2. All laboratory test results are abnormal, except potassium at high normal, and are typical of renal insufficiency that occurs during acute rejection: Serum creatinine\u2014decreased excretory function of kidneys BUN\u2014decreased ability of the kidney to excrete urea Glucose\u2014D.B. has diabetes and the combination of this disease and the insulin resistance that occurs in CKD may be increasing the glucose levels. In addition, the corticosteroid therapy and stress response from the disease increase glucose levels. Potassium\u2014decreased ability of the kidney to excrete potassium Bicarbonate\u2014impaired generation and reabsorption by the kidney, as it is being used to buffer acid load Nursing care includes monitoring for central nervous system (CNS) depression and skin and oral mucous breakdown from high urea; monitoring capillary blood glucose and administering insulin to keep glucose within normal range; and monitoring for increasing weakness and cardiac changes related to hyperkalemia and for symptoms of metabolic acidosis, such as Kussmaul respirations. 3. Immunosuppressive therapy is designed to reduce proliferation and action of T cytotoxic lymphocytes that are responsible for acute rejection. Muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD3 receptors on T cells, causing cell lysis. It inhibits the function of T cytotoxic cells and is given via IV push to treat acute rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) is a cytotoxic antiproliferative drug that inhibits purine synthesis and suppresses proliferation of T and B cells. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) is a corticosteroid that suppresses inflammatory response. It inhibits cytokine production and T-cell activation and proliferation. Tacrolimus (Prograf) is a calcineurin inhibitor that prevents production and release of IL-2 and -interferon in addition to inhibiting production of T cytotoxic lymphocytes and B cells. Supportive therapy is designed to treat underlying disease and control the symptoms produced by renal insufficiency. Furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic that is not influenced by GFR and is used to promote sodium, potassium, and fluid loss through the kidney. It helps to relieve hypervolemia and hypertension. Nifedipine (Procardia) is a calcium channel blocker that reduces cardiac output to control blood presssure. Sodium bicarbonate helps to control the metabolic acidosis of renal insufficiency and replaces that which is not produced or reabsorbed by the kidney. Metformin and IV insulin control the hyperglycemia resulting from diabetes and insulin resistance of CKD. 4. Many side effects may occur from immunosuppressive therapy but the most common is decreased resistance to infection and increased incidence of cancer because of depression of T cytotoxic lymphocytes. Muromonab-CD3 causes fever, chills, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. Anaphylactic reactions include pulmonary edema and cardiac or respiratory arrest. Mycophenolate mofetil causes gastrointestinal toxicity with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; severe neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; increased risks of infection; and malignancy. As a corticosteroid, methylprednisolone may cause Cushing syndrome with sodium and water retention, redistribution of fat, muscle weakness with protein wasting, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, delayed healing, easy bruising, and increased risk of infection. Tacrolimus is nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and gingival hyperplasia; and lymphoma. 5. Long-term problems include increased risk for infections and malignancies; chronic liver disease; increased risk for atherosclerosis, with CAD a major cause of death; joint necrosis from chronic steroid therapy; psychologic adjustment (constant fear of rejection and wondering how long the transplant will last); and depression if there is failure and a return to dialysis. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Excess fluid volume related to inability of kidney to excrete fluid Grieving related to threat of loss of kidney Risk for acute confusion related to CNS changes induced by uremic toxins and immunosuppressive drugs Risk for infection related to suppressed immune system Collaborative problems: Potential complications: hypertension, hyperkalemia with cardiac dysrhythmias, acidosis, infection ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 415 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

As the osmolality rises, ADH is released from the posterior pituitary gland and acts on the kidney to cause reabsorption of water from the kidney tubule, resulting in more dilute blood and more concentrated urine. Aldosterone, the major mineralocorticoid, causes sodium reabsorption from the kidney and potassium excretion. Calcium levels are not a factor in serum osmolality. 8. d. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is secreted in response to high blood volume and high serum sodium levels and has an inhibiting effect on ADH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the effects of which would make the blood volume even higher. The relationship between cortisol and insulin is indirect; cortisol raises blood glucose levels and insulin secretion is stimulated by high glucose levels. Glucagon secretion inhibits insulin secretion but insulin does not inhibit glucagon. Testosterone and estrogen have no reciprocal action and both are secreted by the body in response to tropic hormones. 9. d. Usually insulin and glucagon function in a reciprocal manner, except after a high-protein, carbohydrate-free meal, in which both hormones are secreted. Glucagon increases gluconeogenesis and insulin facilitates transport of amino acids across muscle membranes for protein synthesis. 10. a. Hypokalemia inhibits aldosterone release as well as insulin release. 11.

Although cortisol is a glucocorticoid, it has action on mineralocorticoid receptors, which causes sodium retention and potassium excretion from the kidney, resulting in hypokalemia. Because water is reabsorbed with the sodium, serum sodium remains normal. In its effect on glucose and fat metabolism, cortisol causes an elevation in blood glucose as well as increases in free fatty acids and triglycerides. 13. b . Many symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, mental impairment, dry skin, and constipation, that would be apparent in younger persons are attributed to general aging in the older adult; as a result, hypothyroidism goes unrecognized as a treatable condition. 14. c. Assessment of the endocrine system is often dif ficult because hormones affect every body tissue and system, 416 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. causing great diversity in the signs and symptoms of endocrine dysfunction. Weight loss, fatigue, and depression are signs that may occur with many different endocrine problems or other diseases. Goiter, exophthalmos, and the three \"polys\" are specific findings of endocrine dysfunction. 15. c. In the patient with thyroid disease, palpation can cause the release of thyroid hormone into circulation, increasing the patient's symptoms and potentially causing a thyroid storm. Examination should be deferred to a more experienced clinician if possible. Pressure should not be so great as to damage the cricoid cartilage or laryngeal nerve and if the thyroid is palpated correctly, the carotid arteries are not compressed. 16. b, c, e. Heat intolerance, exophthalmos, and a goiter are all related to thyroid dysfunction. Tetanic muscle spasms are related to hypofunction of the parathyroid. Hyperpigmentation is related to hypofunction of the adrenal gland. Increased hand and foot size is related to excess growth hormone secretion. 17. a. Endocrine disorders related to hormone secretion from glands that are stimulated by tropic hormones can be caused by a malsecretion of the tropic hormone or of the target gland. If the problem is in the target gland, it is known as a primary endocrine disorder; a problem with tropic hormone secretion is known as a secondary endocrine disorder. Serum levels of tropic hormones can illustrate the status of the negative feedback system in relation to target organ hormone levels. Normally, if a target organ produces low amounts of hormone, tropic hormones will be increased; if a target organ is overproducing hormones, tropic hormones will be low or undetectable. 18. c. To ensure that the level is a fasting level, a minimum of 8 hours should be allowed. Water may be taken, however, and does not affect the glucose level. Many medications also may influence results, which will need to be evaluated. 19. b, d, e. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are used gonad problems from insufficiency. LH and FSH are low in pituitary insufficiency and high in gonadal failure. The MRI would be used to identify tumors involving the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Thyroglobulin is a tumor marker for thyroid cancer. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), along with calcium and phosphorus levels, are checked for parathyroid function. The ACTH suppression test assesses adrenal function, especially with hyperactivity. 20. d. The elevated cortisol of Cushing syndrome manifests in elevated blood pressure and blood glucose. Also seen are moon face, hirsutism, decreased muscle mass from protein wasting, increased weight, and fragile skin with striae across the abdomen. 21. d. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) is used to assess blood glucose control during the previous 3 months. Water deprivation (ADH stimulation) is used to differentiate causes of diabetes insipidus. Fasting blood glucose will measure only the current blood glucose result. The oral glucose tolerance test is used to diagnose diabetes when abnormal fasting blood glucose levels do not clearly indicate diabetes.CHAPTER 49 Answer Key 1. d. Insulin is an anabolic hormone that is responsible for growth, repair, and storage. It facilitates movement of amino acids into cells, synthesis of protein, storage of glucose as glycogen, and deposition of triglycerides and lipids as fat into adipose tissue. Glucagon is responsible for hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Fat is used for energy when glucose levels are depleted. 2. c, e. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle require insulin to allow the transport of glucose into the cells. Brain, liver, and blood cells require adequate glucose supply for normal function but do not depend directly on insulin for glucose transport. 3. b. The counter regulatory hormones have the opposite effect of insulin by stimulating glucose production and output by the liver and by decreasing glucose transport into the cells. The counter regulatory hormones and insulin together regulate the blood glucose level. 4. a, b, c, d, e, f. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, -cell exhaustion, altered production of adipokines, genetic predisposition, inherited defect in insulin receptors, and inappropriate glucose production by the liver. 5. d. Prediabetes is defined as impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose or both. Fasting blood glucose results between 100 mg/dL (5.56 mmol/L) and 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) indicate prediabetes. A diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance is made if the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results are between 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L). 6. a, e. To reduce the risk of developing diabetes, the patient with prediabetes should learn to monitor for symptoms of diabetes, have blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) tested regularly, maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet. 7. b. Polydipsia is caused by fluid loss from polyuria when high glucose levels cause osmotic diuresis. Cellular starvation from lack of glucose and the use of body fat and protein for energy contribute to fatigue, weight loss, and polyphagia in type 1 diabetes. 8. c. Type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic influence and offspring of parents who both have type 2 diabetes have an increased chance of developing it. In contrast, type 1 diabetes is associated with a genetic susceptibility that is related to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Offspring of parents who both have type 1 diabetes have a 1% to 4% chance of developing the disease. Other risk factors for type 2 diabetes include obesity; being a Native American, Hispanic, or African American; and being 55 years or older. Although 50% of people with a parent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) will develop MODY , it is autosomal dominant and treatment depends on which genetic mutation caused it. It is not associated with obesity or hypertension and is not currently considered preventable. 9. a. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities that include elevated glucose levels, abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Overweight individuals with metabolic syndrome can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes through a program of weight loss. Exercise is also important but normal weight is most important. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 417 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 10. a, c. The patient has one prior test result that meets criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes but this test must be confirmed on a subsequent day. The A1C is greater than 6.5% so it also indicates diabetes according to criteria for diabetes diagnosis. These criteria include a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), A1C OGTT level 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss) or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose 200 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L). 1 1. d. Impaired glucose tolerance e xists when a 2-hour OGTT level is higher than normal but lower than the level diagnostic for diabetes (i.e., >200). Impaired fasting glucose exists when fasting glucose levels are greater than the normal of 100 mg/dL but less than the 126 mg/dL diagnostic of diabetes. Both abnormal values are diagnostic for a condition known as prediabetes. 12. b . U100 insulin must be used with a U100 syringe but for those using low doses of insulin, syringes that have increments of 1 unit instead of 2 units are available. Errors can be made in dosing if patients switch back and forth between different sizes of syringes. Aspiration before injection of the insulin is not recommended, nor is the use of alcohol to clean the skin. Because the rate of peak serum concentration varies with the site selected for injection, injections should be rotated within a particular area, such as the abdomen, before changing to another area. 13. c. A split-mix ed dose of insulin requires that the patient adhere to a set meal pattern to provide glucose for the peak action of the insulin and a bedtime snack is usually required when patients take an intermediate-acting insulin late in the day to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is most likely to occur with this dose late in the afternoon and during the night. When premixed formulas are used, flexible dosing based on glucose levels is not recommended. 14. d. Lispro is a rapid-acting insulin that has an onset of action of approximately 15 minutes and should be injected at the time of the meal to within 15 minutes of eating. Regular insulin is short acting with an onset of action in 30 to 60 minutes following administration and should be given 30 to 45 minutes before meals. 15. a. When mixing re gular and intermediate-acting insulin, regular insulin should always be drawn into the syringe first to prevent contamination of the regular insulin vial with intermediate-acting insulin additives. Air is added to the neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) vial. Then air is added to the regular vial and the regular insulin is withdrawn, bubbles are removed, and the dose of NPH is withdrawn. 16. b . Checking the temperature of the bath water is part of assisting with activities of daily living (ADLs) and within the scope of care for unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP). This is important for the patient with neuropathy. Discussion of complications, teaching, and assessing learning are appropriate for RNs. 17. d. Insulin glar gine (Lantus), a long-acting insulin that is continuously released with no peak of action, cannot be diluted or mixed with any other insulin or solution. Mixed insulins should be stored needle-up in the refrigerator and warmed before administration. Currently used bottles of insulin can be kept at room temperature out of sunlight. 18. a. Insulin pumps pro vide tight glycemic control by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion based on the patient's basal profile, with bolus doses at mealtime at the patient's discretion and related to blood glucose monitoring. Errors in insulin dosing and complications of insulin therapy are still potential risks with insulin pumps. 19. c. The patient' s elevated glucose on arising may be the result of either dawn phenomenon or Somogyi effect. The best way to determine whether the patient needs more or less insulin is by monitoring the glucose at bedtime, between 2:00 am and 4:00 am, and on arising. If predawn levels are below 60 mg/dL, the insulin dose should be reduced. If the 2:00 am to 4:00 am blood glucose is high, the insulin should be increased. 20. b . Biguanides (e.g., metformin [Glucophage]) are most commonly used with type 2 diabetes. They reduce glucose production by the liver and increase insulin sensitivity at the tissue level that improves glucose transport into the cells. Insulin is not taken orally, as it is ineffective. Meglitinides and sulfonylureas increase insulin production from the pancreas. 21. a, d, e. Acarbose (Precose) is an -glucosidase inhibitor that is taken with the first bite of each meal. The effectiveness is measured with 2-hour postprandial blood glucose testing, as it delays glucose absorption from the GI tract. The other options describe thiazolidinediones. 22. c. Rapid deep respirations are symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), so this is the priority of care. Stage II pressure ulcers and bilateral numbness are chronic complications of diabetes. The lumps and dents on the abdomen indicate a need to teach the patient about site rotation. 23. a. The body requires food at re gularly spaced intervals throughout the day and omission or delay of meals can result in hypoglycemia, especially for the patient using conventional insulin therapy or oral hypoglycemic agents. Weight loss may be recommended in type 2 diabetes if the individual is overweight but many patients with type 1 diabetes are thin and do not require a decrease in caloric intake. Fewer than 7% of total calories should be from saturated fats and simple sugar should be limited but moderate amounts can be used if counted as a part of total carbohydrate intake. 24. b . Maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels and achievement of optimal serum lipid levels with dietary modification are believed to be the most important factors in preventing both short- and long-term complications of diabetes. There is no longer a specific \"diabetic diet\" and use of dietetic foods is not necessary for diabetes control. Most diabetics eat three meals a day and some require a bedtime snack for control of nighttime hypoglycemia. Loss of weight, which may or may not be to ideal body weight, may improve insulin resistance. The other goals of nutrition therapy include prevention of chronic complications of diabetes, attention to individual nutritional needs, and maintenance of the pleasure of eating. 25. b . During exercise, a diabetic person needs both adequate glucose to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia and adequate insulin, because counter regulatory hormones are produced during the stress of exercise and may cause hyperglycemia. Exercise after meals is best but a 15-g carbohydrate snack may be taken if exercise is performed before meals or is prolonged. Blood glucose levels should be monitored before, during, and after exercise to determine the effect of exercise on the levels.418 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 26. c. Cleaning the puncture site with alcohol is not necessary and may interfere with test results and lead to drying and splitting of the fingertips. Washing the hands with warm water is adequate cleaning and promotes blood flow to the fingers. Blood flow is also increased by holding the hand down. Punctures on the side of the finger pad are less painful. Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) should be performed before and after exercise. 27. b. The American Diabetes Association recommends that testing for type 2 diabetes with a FPG, A1C, or 2-hour OGTT should be considered for all individuals at the age of 45 and above and, if normal, repeated every 3 years. Testing for immune markers of type 1 diabetes is not recommended. Testing at a younger age or more frequently should be done for members of a high-risk ethnic population, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Overweight adults with additional risk factors should be tested. 28. a. During minor illnesses, the patient with diabetes should continue drug therapy and food intake. Insulin is important because counter regulatory hormones may increase blood glucose during the stress of illness. Food or a carbohydrate liquid substitution is important because during illness the body requires extra energy to deal with the stress of the illness. Blood glucose monitoring should be done every 4 hours and the health care provider should be notified if the level is greater than 240 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) or if fever, ketonuria, or nausea and vomiting occur. 29. c. When insulin is insufficient and glucose cannot be used for cellular energy, the body releases and breaks down stored fats and protein to meet energy needs. Free fatty acids from stored triglycerides are released and metabolized in the liver in such large quantities that ketones are formed. Ketones are acidic and alter the pH of the blood, causing acidosis. Osmotic diuresis occurs as a result of elimination of both glucose and ketones in the urine. 30. a, b, c, d, e, f. In DKA, ketosis leads to ketonuria in trying to decrease the blood glucose and ketonemia. The metabolic acidosis leads to the Kussmaul respirations trying to decrease the acid in the system. The sweet, fruity breath odor is from DKA. Thirst and dehydration are found with both DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS). 31. c. The management of DKA is similar to that of HHS except that HHS requires greater fluid replacement because of the severe hyperosmolar state. Bicarbonate is not usually given in DKA to correct acidosis unless the pH is <7.0 because administration of insulin will reverse the abnormal fat metabolism. Total body potassium deficit is possible in both conditions, requiring potassium administration, and in both conditions glucose is added to IV fluids when blood glucose levels fall to 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L). 32. c. Hypoglycemia causes epinephrine release that contributes to shakiness and irritability from nervousness and anxiety. Without glucose in the brain, the patient may have difficulty speaking, visual disturbances, stupor, confusion, or coma. It is better to treat for hypoglycemia when unsure of the actual blood glucose level. 33. a, c, e, f. Manifestations of hyperglycemia include abdominal cramps, polyuria, weakness, fatigue, and headache. The headache can also be seen with hypoglycemia that is manifested by the remaining options. 34. d. If a diabetic patient is unconscious, immediate treatment for hypoglycemia must be given to prevent brain damage and IM or subcutaneous administration of 1 mg of glucagon should be done. If the unconsciousness has another cause, such as ketosis, the rise in glucose caused by the glucagon is not as dangerous as the low glucose level. Following administration of the glucagon, the patient should be transported to a medical facility for further treatment and evaluation. Insulin is contraindicated without knowledge of the patient's glucose level and oral carbohydrates cannot be given when patients are unconscious. 35. a. 3; b. 2; c. 1; d. 5; e. 4; f. 6. As with all patients, first establish an airway. With a patient with diabetes and abnormal behavior, the blood glucose must then be checked to determine if the patient's symptoms are related to the diabetes. In this case, it is hyperglycemia, so an IV must be started for fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. The last food intake and times at which medications were recently taken may establish a cause for the hyperglycemia and aid in determining further treatment. 36. a. Blood glucose levels of 80 to 90 mg/dL (4.4 to 5 mmol/L) are within the normal range and are desired in the patient with diabetes, even following a recent hypoglycemic episode. Hypoglycemia is often caused by a single event, such as skipping a meal, taking too much insulin, or vigorous exercise. Once corrected, normal glucose control should be maintained. 37. b. The development of atherosclerotic vessel disease seems to be promoted by the altered lipid metabolism common in diabetes. Although tight glucose control may help to delay the process, it does not prevent it completely. Atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes does respond somewhat to a reduction in general risk factors, as it does in nondiabetics, and reduction in fat intake, control of hypertension, abstention from smoking, maintenance of normal weight, and regular exercise should be carried out by all patients. 38. b, d. Macrovascular disease causes coronary artery disease and ulceration and results in amputation of the lower extremities. However, neuropathy may also contribute to not feeling ulcerations. The remaining options are related to microvascular complications of diabetes. 39. b, e, f. Autonomic neuropathy affects most body systems. Manifestations of autonomic neuropathy include erectile dysfunction in men and decreased libido, gastroparesis (nausea, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux and feeling full), painless myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, and resting tachycardia. The remaining options would occur with sensory neuropathy. 40. d. Complete or partial loss of sensitivity of the feet is common with peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and patients with diabetes may suffer foot injury and ulceration without ever having pain. Feet must be inspected during daily care for any cuts, blisters, swelling, or reddened areas. 41. a. Older adults have more conditions that may be treated with medications that impair insulin action. Hypoglycemic unawareness is more common, so these patients are more likely to suffer adverse consequences from blood glucose- lowering therapy. Because the clinical manifestations of long- term complications of diabetes take 10 to 20 years to develop, the goals for glycemic control are not as rigid as in the younger population. Treatment is indicated and insulin may be used if the patient does not respond to oral agents. The patient's needs rather than age determine the responsibility of others in care. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 419 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Case Study 1. The h ypoglycemia might have been prevented by F.W. taking time to eat breakfast and perhaps increasing food intake in anticipation of strenuous exercise. She also should have checked her glucose level before exercising. She should be carrying a quick-acting carbohydrate with her and taking advantage of the snacks or drinks offered along the marathon route. 2. Sympathetic response to h ypoglycemia: Weakness, nervousness, tremor Vasoconstriction with pallor, numbness, coldness, headache, tachycardia Lo w glucose levels in the brain: Confusion, slurred speech, unsteady gait 3. The h ypoglycemia should be treated with 15 g of a fast- acting carbohydrate: 120 to 180 mL of orange juice or regular soda, five or six hard candies, 1 tbs syrup or honey, or 4 tsp jelly. Repeat the carbohydrate in 15 minutes if symptoms are still present or if blood glucose remains less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). When glucose is above 70 mg/dL, a regularly scheduled meal or snack of complex carbohydrate and protein should be eaten. The blood glucose should be checked again about 45 minutes after treatment to ensure that hypoglycemia does not recur. 4. F .W. should be taught how to recognize situations that lead to hypoglycemia; the effects of exercise on glucose levels and the need for both adequate glucose and insulin; and how to balance exercise, food, and insulin. Have the patient discuss insulin dosage for running and racing with her health care provider. 5. F .W. should monitor her blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; increase dietary intake before exercise; manage insulin doses with her health care provider; exercise 60 to 90 minutes after meals; and carry simple carbohydrates to take at first symptoms of hypoglycemia. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective self-health management related to non- compliance with recommended regimen Collaborative problems: Potential complications: brain damage, coma, seizures, death CHAPTER 50 Answer Key 1. d. A normal response to gro wth hormone (GH) secretion is stimulation of the liver to produce somatomedin C, or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which stimulates growth of bones and soft tissues. The increased levels of somatomedin C normally inhibit GH but in acromegaly the pituitary gland secretes GH despite elevated IGF-1 levels. When both GH and IGF-1 levels are increased, overproduction of GH is confirmed. GH also causes elevation of blood glucose and normally GH levels fall during an oral glucose challenge but not in acromegaly. 2. c. The increased production of GH in acrome galy causes an increase in thickness and width of bones and enlargement of soft tissues, resulting in marked changes in facial features, oily and coarse skin, and speech difficulties. Infertility is not a common finding because GH is usually the only pituitary hormone involved in acromegaly. Height is not increased in adults with GH excess because the epiphyses of the bones are closed. 3. a. A transsphenoidal h ypophysectomy involves entry into the sella turcica through an incision in the upper lip and gingiva into the floor of the nose and the sphenoid sinuses. Postoperative clear nasal drainage with glucose content indicates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from an open connection to the brain, putting the patient at risk for meningitis. After surgery, the patient is positioned with the head elevated to avoid pressure on the sella turcica. Coughing and straining are avoided to prevent increased intracranial pressure and CSF leakage. Although mouth care is required every 4 hours, toothbrushing should not be performed because injury to the suture line may occur. 4 . d. Compression of the optic chiasm can cause visual problems as well as signs of increased intracranial pressure, including headache, nausea, and vomiting. About 30% of prolactinomas will have excess prolactin secretion with manifestations of impotence in men, galactorrhea or amenorrhea in women without relationship to pregnancy, and decreased libido in both men and women. There is decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). 5. a, b, d, e. W ith panhypopituitarism, lifetime hormone replacement is needed for cortisol, vasopressin, thyroid, and GH. Sex hormones will not be replaced because of the patient's history of breast cancer. Dopamine agonists will not be used because they reduce secretion of GH, which has already been achieved with the radiation. 6. b . With increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the permeability of the renal distal tubules is increased, so water is reabsorbed into circulation. Decreased output of concentrated urine with increased urine osmolality and specific gravity occur. In addition, fluid retention with weight gain, serum hypoosmolality, dilutional hyponatremia, and hypochloremia occur. 7 . a. The patient with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has marked dilutional hyponatremia and should be monitored for decreased neurologic function and seizures every 2 hours. Sodium intake is supplemented because of the hyponatremia and sodium loss caused by diuretics. ADH release is reduced by keeping the head of the bed flat to increase left atrial filling pressure. A reduction in blood pressure (BP) indicates a reduction in total fluid volume and is an expected outcome of treatment. 8. b . The patient with SIADH has water retention with hyponatremia, decreased urine output, and concentrated urine with high specific gravity. Improvement in the patient's condition is reflected by increased urine output, normalization of serum sodium, and more water in the urine, thus decreasing the specific gravity. 9. c. P atients with diabetes insipidus (DI) excrete large amounts of urine with a specific gravity of less than 1.005. Blood glucose would be tested to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The serum sodium level is expected to be low with DI but is not diagnostic. To diagnose central DI a water deprivation test is required. Then a CT of the head may be done to determine the cause. Nephrogenic DI is differentiated from central DI with determination of the level of ADH after an analog of ADH is given. 10. d. A patient with central diabetes insipidus has a def iciency of ADH with excessive loss of water from the kidney, hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and dilute urine with a low specific gravity. When vasopressin is administered, the symptoms are reversed, with water retention, decreased 420 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. urinary output that increases urine osmolality, and an increase in BP. 11. c. Normal urine specific gravity is 1.005 to 1.025 and urine with a specific gravity of 1.002 is very dilute, indicating that there continues to be excessive loss of water and that treatment of diabetes insipidus is inadequate. Headache, weight gain, and oral intake greater than urinary output are signs of volume excess that occur with overmedication. Nasal irritation and nausea may also indicate overdosage. 12. b. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the kidney is unable to respond to ADH, so vasopressin or hormone analogs are not effective. Thiazide diuretics slow the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney and produce a decrease in urine output. Low-sodium diets (<3 g/day) are also thought to decrease urine output. Fluids are not restricted because the patient could easily become dehydrated. 13. d. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid tissue is destroyed by autoimmune antibodies. An enlarged thyroid gland is a goiter. Viral-induced hyperthyroidism is subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Acute thyroiditis is caused by bacterial or fungal infection. 14. a. Exophthalmos or protrusion of the eyeballs may occur in Graves' disease from increased fat deposits and fluid in the orbital tissues and ocular muscles, forcing the eyeballs outward. Graves' disease is the most common form of hyperthyroidism. Increased metabolic rate and sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system lead to the clinical manifestations. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is decreased in Graves' disease. 15. d. In Graves' disease, antibodies to the TSH receptor are formed, attach to the receptors, and stimulate the thyroid gland to release triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T4), or both, creating hyperthyroidism. The disease is not directly genetic but individuals appear to have a genetic susceptibility to develop autoimmune antibodies. Goiter formation from insufficient iodine intake is usually associated with hypothyroidism. 16. c. A hyperthyroid crisis results in marked manifestations of hyperthyroidism, with severe tachycardia, heart failure, shock, hyperthermia, restlessness, irritability, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, and coma. Although exophthalmos may be present in the patient with Graves' disease, it is not a significant factor in hyperthyroid crisis. Hoarseness and laryngeal stridor are characteristic of the tetany of hypoparathyroidism and lethargy progressing to coma is characteristic of myxedema coma, a complication of hypothyroidism. 17. b. The -adrenergic blocker atenolol is used to block the sympathetic nervous system stimulation by thyroid hormones. Potassium iodide is used to prepare the patient for thyroidectomy or for treatment of thyrotoxic crisis to inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Antithyroid medications inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy destroys thyroid tissue, which limits thyroid hormone secretion. 18. a, d, e. RAI causes hypothyroidism over time by damaging thyroid tissue and is the treatment of choice for nonpregnant adults. Potassium iodide decreases the release of thyroid hormones and decreases the size of the thyroid gland preoperatively. Propylthiouracil (PTU) blocks peripheral conversion of T 4 to T3 and may be used with iodine to produce a euthyroid state before surgery. 19. a. To prevent strain on the suture line postoperatively, the patient's head must be manually supported while turning and moving in bed but range-of-motion exercises for the head and neck are also taught preoperatively to be gradually implemented after surgery. There is no contraindication for coughing and deep breathing and these should be carried out postoperatively. Tingling around the lips or fingers is a sign of hypocalcemia, which may occur if the parathyroid glands are inadvertently removed during surgery. This sign should be reported immediately. 20. a. A tracheostomy tray is in the room to use if vocal cord paralysis occurs from recurrent laryngeal nerve damage or for laryngeal stridor from tetany. The oxygen equipment may be useful but will not improve oxygenation with vocal cord paralysis without a tracheostomy. IV calcium salts will be used if hypocalcemia occurs from parathyroid damage. The paper and pencil for communication may be helpful, especially if a tracheostomy is performed, but will not aid in emergency oxygenation of the patient. 21. d. With the decrease in thyroid hormone postoperatively, calories need to be reduced substantially to prevent weight gain. When a patient has had a subtotal thyroidectomy, thyroid replacement therapy is not given because exogenous hormone inhibits pituitary production of TSH and delays or prevents the restoration of thyroid tissue regeneration. Regular exercise stimulates the thyroid gland and is encouraged. Saltwater gargles are used for dryness and irritation of the mouth and throat following radioactive iodine therapy. 22. d. Both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are autoimmune disorders that eventually destroy the thyroid gland, leading to primary hypothyroidism. Thyroid tumors most often result in hyperthyroidism. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs as a result of pituitary failure and iatrogenic hypothyroidism results from thyroidectomy or radiation of the thyroid gland. 23. b. Cardiorespiratory response to activity is important to monitor in this patient to determine the effect of activities and plan activity increases. Monitoring changes in orientation, cognition, and behavior are interventions for impaired memory. Monitoring bowels is needed to plan care for the patient with constipation. Assisting with meal planning will help the patient with imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements to lose weight if needed. 24. d. All these manifestations may occur with treatment of hypothyroidism. However, as a result of the effects of hypothyroidism on the cardiovascular system, when thyroid replacement therapy is started myocardial oxygen consumption is increased and the resultant oxygen demand may cause angina, cardiac dysrhythmias, and heart failure, so monitoring for dysrhythmias is most important. 25. b. Because of the mental sluggishness, inattentiveness, and memory loss that occur with hypothyroidism, it is important to provide written instructions and repeat information when teaching the patient. Replacement therapy must be taken for life and alternate-day dosing is not therapeutic. Although most patients return to a normal state with treatment, cardiovascular conditions and psychoses may persist. 26. d. The patient with hyperparathyroidism may have calcium nephrolithiasis, skeletal pain, decreased bone density, psychomotor retardation, or cardiac dysrhythmias. The other endocrine problems would not be related to calcium kidney stones or decreased bone density. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 421 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2 7. b . A high fluid intake is indicated in hyper parath yroidism to dilute the hypercalcemia and flush the kidneys so that calcium stone formation is reduced. Seizures are not associated with hyperparathyroidism. Impending tetany of hypoparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy can be noted with Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs. The patient with hyperparathyroidism is at risk for pathologic fractures resulting from decreased bone density but mobility is encouraged to promote bone calcification. 2 8. b, c, d, e, f. In h ypoparathyroidism the patient has inadequate circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) that leads to hypocalcemia from the inability to maintain serum calcium levels. With hypocalcemia there is muscle stiffness and spasms, which can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias and abdominal cramps. There can also be personality and visual changes and dry, scaly skin. 29. b . Rebreathing in a paper bag promotes carbon dioxide retention in the blood, which lowers pH and creates an acidosis. An acidemia enhances the solubility and ionization of calcium, increasing the proportion of total body calcium available in physiologically active form and relieving the symptoms of hypocalcemia. Saline promotes calcium excretion, as does furosemide. Phosphate levels in the blood are reciprocal to calcium and an increase in phosphate promotes calcium excretion. 30. c. The h ypocalcemia that results from PTH deficiency is controlled with calcium and vitamin D supplementation and possibly oral phosphate binders. Replacement with PTH is not used because of antibody formation to PTH, the need for parenteral administration, and cost. Milk products, although good sources of calcium, also have high levels of phosphate, which reduce calcium absorption. Whole grains and foods containing oxalic acid also impair calcium absorption. 3 1. a. The ef fects of adrenocortical hormone excess, especially glucocorticoid excess, include weight gain from accumulation and redistribution of adipose tissue, sodium and water retention, glucose intolerance, protein wasting, loss of bone structure, loss of collagen, and capillary fragility leading to petechiae. Clinical manifestations of adrenocortical hormone deficiency include hypotension, dehydration, weight loss, and hyperpigmentation of the skin. 32. c. Although the patient with Cushing syndrome has e xcess corticosteroids, removal of the glands and the stress of surgery require that high doses of corticosteroids (cortisone) be administered postoperatively for several days before weaning the dose. The nurse should monitor the patient's vital signs postoperatively to detect whether large amounts of hormones were released during surgical manipulation, obtain morning urine specimens for cortisol measurement to evaluate the effectiveness of the surgery, and provide dressing changes with aseptic technique to avoid infection as usual inflammatory responses are suppressed. 33. b . V omiting and diarrhea are early indicators of Addisonian crisis and fever indicates an infection, which is causing additional stress for the patient. Treatment of a crisis requires immediate glucocorticoid replacement and IV hydrocortisone, fluids, sodium, and glucose are necessary for 24 hours. Addison's disease is a primary insufficiency of the adrenal gland and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is not effective, nor would vasopressors be effective with the fluid deficiency of Addison's disease. Potassium levels are increased in Addison's disease and KCl would be contraindicated. 3 4. b . A weight reduction in the patient with Addison's disease may indicate a fluid loss and a dose of replacement therapy that is too low rather than too high. Because vomiting and diarrhea are early signs of crisis and because fluid and electrolytes must be replaced, patients should notify their health care provider if these symptoms occur. Patients with Addison's disease are taught to take two to three times their usual dose of steroids if they become ill, have teeth extracted, or engage in rigorous physical activity and should always have injectable hydrocortisone available if oral doses cannot be taken. 35. c. Alendronate (F osamax) is used to prevent corticosteroid- induced osteoporosis. Potassium is used to prevent the mineralocorticoid effect of hypokalemia. Furosemide (Lasix) is used to decrease sodium and fluid retention from the mineralocorticoid effect. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is used to prevent gastrointestinal (GI) irritation from an increase in secretion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid. 36. c. T aking corticosteroids on an alternate-day schedule for pharmacologic purposes is less likely to suppress ACTH production from the pituitary and prevent adrenal atrophy. Normal adrenal hormone balance is not maintained during glucocorticoid therapy because excessive exogenous hormone is used. 37. a. Hyperaldosteronism is an e xcess of aldosterone, which is manifested by sodium and water retention and potassium excretion. Furosemide is a potassium-wasting diuretic that would increase the potassium deficiency. Aminoglutethimide blocks aldosterone synthesis. Spironolactone and amiloride a catecholamine-producing tumor of the adrenal medulla, which may cause severe, episodic hypertension; severe, pounding headache; and profuse sweating. Monitoring for a dangerously high BP before surgery is critical, as is monitoring for BP fluctuations during medical and surgical treatment. Case Study 1. All of the blood tests are altered because of the ef fect of elevated glucocorticoids: Elevated glucose\u2014increased gluconeogenesis by liver and induced insulin resistance Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count\u2014leukocytosis Decreased lymphocytes\u2014lymphocytopenia Increased red blood cell (RBC) count\u2014polycythemia Decreased K+\u2014increased mineralocorticoid effect causing sodium retention and potassium syndrome has se veral causes: ACTH-secreting endogenous Cushing syndrome. Ectopic ACTH production by tumors outside the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (usually of the lung or pancreas) is most common in men. The pathophysiology of Cushing syndrome reflects an excess of normal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity, an exaggeration of normal functions. Adrenal tumors are most common in women 20 to 40 years of age. Iatrogenic administration of exogenous corticosteroids is the most common cause but unrelated to this patient. 3. A 24-hour urine collection for free cortisol is done, with elevated levels indicating Cushing syndrome. Plasma ACTH levels would be measured; high or normal levels 422 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. of ACTH indicate Cushing disease from ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and low undetectable levels of ACTH indicate an adrenal or ectopic cause. 4. Treatment depends on the cause of the syndrome. With a pituitary cause, transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is performed; with an adrenal cause, adrenalectomy is performed or drug therapy is used; with an ectopic cause, the tumor is located and removed if possible. If exogenous corticosteroid therapy is the cause, discontinue or alter the dose of the exogenous corticosteroids. 5. A medical adrenalectomy involves treatment with ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, or mitotane to suppress cortisol production, alter peripheral metabolism of steroids, and decrease plasma and urine steroid levels by actually killing adrenocortical cells. 6. Priority nursing responsibilities include the following: Emotional support Assessment of signs and symptoms of hormone toxicity: \u00b0 Vital signs q4hr \u00b0 Daily weights \u00b0 Glucose monitoring \u00b0 Changes in mental status \u00b0 Administer medications (e.g., IV corticosteroids, analgesics) Assessment for complications: \u00b0 Manifestations of gynecomastia or testicular atrophy \u00b0 Manifestations of increased gastrointestinal secretions \u00b0 Manifestations of infection, such as pain or purulent drainage, because fever and inflammation may be minimal or absent \u00b0 Manifestations of thromboembolic phenomena, such as chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea \u00b0 Manifestations of bone pain or limitations in motion, indicating pathologic fractures \u00b0 Manifestations of nephrolithiasis from increased calcium excretion Preoperative preparation Instruction about exercises, coughing, and deep breathing Possible presence of nasogastric tube, urinary catheter, IV therapy, and leg sequential compression devices Explanations about early monitoring for circulatory instability Explanations about hormone replacement 7. Nursing diagnoses: Risk for infection related to lowered resistance to stress and suppression of immune system Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements related to increased appetite, high caloric intake, and inactivity Situational low self-esteem related to altered body image and diminished physical capabilities Collaborative problems: Potential mellitus, hypertensive crisis, impaired skin integrity CHAPTER 51 Answer Key 1. a. Seminal vesicle; b. ejaculatory duct; c. prostate t. u. 3. 3; 8; 2; d. 6; e. 1; f. 7; g. 4; h. 5 4. a. Ducts carry milk from the alveoli to the lactiferous sinuses. The areola is the pigmented center of the breast, the nipple is the erectile tissue that contains pores, and adipose tissue makes up the majority of the nonlactating breast tissue. 5. c. Montgomery's tubercles are similar to sebaceous glands and lubricate the nipple. The alveoli secrete milk during lactation and it is stored in the lactiferous sinuses. The nipple has erectile tissue and contains pores for milk delivery. 6. c. Menopause is identified after 1 year of amenorrhea. A Papanicolaou (Pap) test includes cells from both the endocervix and the ectocervix. The ovum is fertilized by the sperm in the fallopian tube. The reabsorption of oocytes by the body is called atresia. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the initial stage of follicular maturation, while luteinizing hormone (LH) must be present for complete maturation and ovulation to occur. 7. b, c, f. LH completes follicle maturation, stimulates testosterone production, and is called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) in men. Progesterone maintains an implanted egg. Prolactin stimulates the growth of the mammary glands. Estrogen develops and maintains secondary sex characteristics of women as well as the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle after menstruation and the uterine changes essential to pregnancy. 8. b, c, f. FSH is elevated at menopause. In men it is responsible for spermatogenesis. FSH stimulates growth and maturity of ovarian follicles. Testosterone is produced by the testes and produces male sex characteristics. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is stimulated by elevated estrogen levels and decreased testosterone levels. 9. b. Age-related changes in sexual function in men include a need for increased stimulation for an erection, a decreased need to ejaculate, and a possible decreased response to sexual stimuli. There is a decreased ability to attain an erection but it is not related to prostatic changes. A negative social attitude toward sexuality in older adults may also affect the sexual activity of people in this age-group. 10. Factor Problem Identified During Assessment Rubella Potential congenital anomalies if rubella occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy Mumps Increased sterility in young men with mumps because of testicular atrophy resulting from orchitis Diabetes mellitusImpotence and retrograde ejaculation in male diabetics in addition to erectile problems from neuropathies. In women, sexual performance and health of mother and fetus may be affected if diabetes mellitus is uncontrolled Antihypertensive agentsMany may cause impotence in men ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 423 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 11. d. The prostate is palpated through the w all of the rectum with a digital rectal examination. Inguinal hernias are detected by palpating the inguinal ring while the patient bears down and scrotal palpation is done to detect testicular masses or tumors. No specific conditions are indicated by enlargement at the base of the penis. 12. a. A decrease in the size of the penis is a normal f inding in the older man. Loss of pubic hair is not normal, nor is any enlargement of the breasts. The normally darker color of the scrotum does not change with aging. 13. c. V aginal dryness occurs with decreased estrogen and increased androgens circulating in the aging female. This also leads to breast and genital atrophy, reduction in bone mass, and increased atherosclerosis. A rectocele may occur and cause sexual or fecal elimination problems for the patient that will need treatment. 14. Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Patient Response to Reproductive Problem Health perception-health management Lack of Pap testing, breast self-examination, prostate examinations, or testicular self-examination; smoking, alcohol, and caffeine use; family history of breast, ovarian, uterine, or prostate cancer Nutritional-metabolic History of anorexia nervosa, obesity, anemia, decreased calcium intake Elimination Urge and stress incontinence; difficulty urinating in male patients; vaginal and bladder infections Activity-exercise Fatigue and activity intolerance related to menorrhagia Sleep-rest Sleep interruption related to hot flashes and Cognitive-perceptual Pelvic pain; dyspareunia Self-perception-self-concept Changes in self-concept related to sexuality and aging Role-relationship Occupational hazards related to sexual functioning and reproductive capacity; dysfunctional or changing roles and relationships with others Sexuality-reproductive Recent changes in sexual practices; dissatisfaction with sexual expression; reproductive problems that affect sexual satisfaction; changes in menstrual patterns; multiple sexual partners; no protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Coping-stress tolerance Effect of STI on sex partners; stress of sexual problems or changes; infertility Value-belief Conflict between value system and treatment; abortion issues; infertility issues 15. b . Candidiasis is a white, thick or curdy discharge and causes itching and inflammation. Cancer would be more likely to produce a bloody discharge. Trichomonas vaginalis produces a malodorous frothy green or yellow discharge. Bacterial vaginosis infection produces copious amounts of thin gray or white drainage with a fishy odor. 16. d. The vulv a should be the color of the skin or slightly pink. Redness indicates inflammation. A small amount of clear vaginal discharge is normal in females, as are episiotomy scars in women who have had children. Skene's glands should not be palpable. 17. b, d. Gram stain smears and the nucleic acid amplif ication test (NAAT) for vaginal, endocervical, urinary, and urethral samples. The NAAT can also be used to detect gonorrhea. A Pap test detects potentially cancerous cells. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR), the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) tests all screen for syphilis. 18. c. Serum estradiol measures o varian function to assess estrogen-secreting tumors and precocious female puberty or to confirm perimenopausal status in women. It may also be indicative of testicular tumors in men. Pregnancy is detected with urinary or serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Prostate cancer is detected with prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Gonadal failure secondary to pituitary dysfunction is identified with urine or serum FSH studies. 19. b . The risk for bleeding is increased following a dilation and curettage (D&C) because the endometrial lining is scraped and injury to the uterus can occur. The nurse should closely assess the amount of bleeding with frequent pad checks for the first 24 hours. Infection following D&C is uncommon and the urinary system is not affected. 20. a, b, c, e. A culdoscop y involves insertion of an endoscope through an incision made through the posterior fornix of the cul-de-sac and requires surgical anesthesia, as does the removal of cervical tissue during a conization. A D&C and laparoscopy are also operative procedures requiring surgical anesthesia. Colposcopy and endometrial biopsies do not require surgical anesthesia. 2 1. a . Huhner (or Sims-Huhner) test involves examination of a mucus sample of the cervix within 2 to 8 hours after intercourse to determine the number and mobility of sperm in the cervical mucus. A semen analysis is a simple examination of semen for the number, mobility, and structure of sperm. An endometrial biopsy provides a sample of endometrium to evaluate its changes under the influence of progesterone. A hysterosalpingogram is a contrast x-ray of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes.424 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 52 Answer Key 1. b. The value of breast self-examination (BSE) in reducing mortality rates from breast cancer in women is currently controversial and under review. However, it is still a useful tool in helping women to become self-aware of how their breasts normally look and feel. None of the other options has been validated at this time. 2. a. Annual screening mammogram every year starting at the age of 40. b. Clinical breast examination (CBE) every 3 years in their 20s and 30s and every year for women beginning at age 40. c. Optional monthly BSE starting at age 20 and reporting changes. d. In women with increased risk, decisions for additional and more frequent testing to be determined with the health care provider. 3. a. One of the major reasons why women do not examine their breasts regularly is because of a lack of confidence in BSE skill. A teaching program should include allowing time for women to use models to identify problems and perform a return demonstration of the examination on themselves. Fear and denial often interfere with BSE even when women know that the perceived risk for cancer is high, know the statistics, and know that they should seek medical care if an abnormality is detected. Examinations in premenopausal women should be done right after the menstrual period and specific dates are set for postmenopausal women or those who have had hysterectomies. 4. d. A definitive diagnosis of breast cancer can be made only by a histologic examination of biopsied tissue. A core (core needle) biopsy is as reliable as a surgical biopsy and has the advantages of decreased length of time for the procedure and recovery and reduced cost. A limitation of fine-needle aspiration is that if negative results are found, more definitive biopsy procedures are required. 5. d. MammaPrint is used in early-stage breast cancer with estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer without nodal involvement to assess risk of recurrence within 10 years without additional treatment and the likely benefit of chemotherapy. CA 27-29 is a cancer marker produced by the MUC1 gene. TNM is not a genomic assay but rather a system for staging cancer using tumor size, nodal involvement, and the presence of metastasis. Oncotype DX genomic assay is used in newly diagnosed early-stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with hormonal therapy to assess risk of occurrence and the need for treatment with chemotherapy to prevent recurrence. 6. d. Most breast lesions are benign and many mobile cystic lesions change in response to the menstrual cycle, whereas most malignant tumors do not. Caffeine has been associated with fibrocystic changes in some women but research has not established caffeine as a cause of breast pain or cysts. Questions regarding a patient's last mammogram or family history are not closely related to the nurse's findings. 7. c. Fibrocystic changes make breasts difficult to examine because of fibrotic changes and multiple lumps. A woman with this condition should be familiar with the characteristic changes in her breasts and monitor them closely for new lumps that do not respond in a cyclic manner over 1 to 2 weeks. Estrogen antagonizes the condition and fibrocystic changes are not precancerous. 8. d, e, f. Intraductal papilloma is associated with increased cancer risk, is more common in women 40 to 60 years old, and is a wartlike growth in mammary ducts beneath the areola. Fat necrosis is associated with breast trauma. Fibroadenoma occurs in 10% of young women. Multicolored, sticky nipple discharge is seen in ductal ectasia. 9. a. Mastitis occurs during lactation and is caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Ductal ectasia involves subareolar area ducts and has multicolored sticky nipple discharge and inflammatory signs. It is not associated with malignancy. Fibroadenoma occurs in 10% of women ages 15 to 40 and has well-delineated, very mobile tumors. A biopsy must be done to exclude malignancy. Senescent gynecomastia occurs in older men, probably from increased conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral circulation. It generally regresses in 6 to 12 months. 10. d. After the age of 60, the incidence of breast cancer increases dramatically and advanced age is the highest risk factor for females. Ninety-nine percent of breast cancer cases occur in women. A first-degree relative with breast cancer is a contributing factor for breast cancer. Obesity and lack of physical activity are other contributing factors. Genetic mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, ATM, and CHEK2 genes may increase the risk of breast cancer. Fibrocystic breast changes are neither a precursor of breast cancer nor a known risk factor for cancer. 11. b. On palpation, malignant lesions are characteristically hard, irregularly shaped, poorly delineated, nontender, and nonmobile and the most common site is the upper outer quadrant of the breast. A fibroadenoma is firm, defined, and mobile. Fibrocystic lesions are usually large, tender, moveable masses found throughout the breast tissue. A painful, immobile mass under a reddened area of skin is most typical of a local abscess. 12. a. Axillary lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors in primary breast cancer; the more nodes involved, the higher the risk for relapse or metastasis. Aneuploid DNA tumor content indicates that cells have abnormally high or low DNA content compared with normal cells and is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Cells in S-phase have a higher risk for recurrence and can produce earlier cancer death. Hormone receptor-negative tumors are usually poorly differentiated histologically, frequently recur, and are usually unresponsive to hormonal therapy. 13. b. Either treatment choice is indicated for women with early-stage breast cancer because the 10-year survival rate with lumpectomy with radiation is about the same as that with modified radical mastectomy. Each procedure has advantages and disadvantages that the patient must consider in making an informed choice and the nurse should make that information available to the patient to assist in decision making. 14. d. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has become the standard of care, with axillary lymph node dissection reserved for patients with clinical indications of disease in the axilla. SLND provides prognostic information and helps to determine further treatment. A lumpectomy, or breast- conservation surgery, is followed by radiation therapy to ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 425 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. the entire breast and the use of chemotherapy or hormone therapy depends on the characteristics of the tumor and evidence of metastases. 15. c. L ymphatic mapping with SLND identifies one to four lymph nodes that drain first from the tumor site. Those nodes are examined for malignant cells. If any of the nodes have malignant cells, a complete axillary lymph node dissection is done. If the sentinel nodes are negative, no additional lymph nodes are removed. 16. a, c. High-dose brach ytherapy may be completed in 5 days and is an alternative to traditional radiation for early-stage breast cancer. Primary radiation follows local excision of a tumor. Radiation as an adjuvant to surgery is used to treat possible residual cancer cells postmastectomy. Palliative radiation is used to reduce tumor size and relieve pain. 17. c. T amoxifen is an antiestrogen agent that blocks the estrogen-receptor sites of malignant cells and is the usual first choice of treatment in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive tumors, with or without nodal involvement. Tamoxifen reduces the risk for recurrent breast cancer and also that for new primary tumors. The side effects of the drug are minimal and are those commonly associated with decreased estrogen. 18. c. As early as in the reco very room following a modified radical mastectomy, the patient should start flexing and extending the fingers and wrist of the affected arm with daily increases in activity. Postoperative mastectomy exercises, such as hair care, wall climbing with the fingers, and shoulder rotation and extension, are instituted gradually to prevent disruption of the wound. 19. b . Removal of the axillary lymph nodes impairs lymph drainage from the affected arm and predisposes the patient to infection of the arm. The arm must be protected from even minor trauma and blood pressure, venipunctures, and injections should not be done on the arm. The arm should never be dependent, even during sleep, and should be elevated to promote lymph drainage. 20. c. The Reach to Reco very program consists of volunteers, all women, who have had breast cancer and can answer questions about what to expect at home, how to tell people about the surgery, and what prosthetic devices are available. It is a valuable resource for patients who have breast cancer and should be used if available in the community. If a volunteer is not available, the nurse is responsible for assisting the patient in the same manner. Although the nurse should stress the importance of wearing a prosthesis, a permanent prosthesis cannot be used until healing is complete and inflammation is resolved. 21. b . It is most important for the patient planning a mammoplasty that she have a realistic idea about what the surgery can accomplish and about possible complications. Currently surgery cannot restore nipple sensation or erectility and the breast will not fully resemble its premastectomy appearance but the outcome is usually more acceptable than the mastectomy scar. The woman's motives for breast reconstruction should not be questioned. There have been allegations of immune-related diseases associated with the use of silicone gel implants but after further evaluation the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these implants for use. 22. a. When an e xpander is used to stretch the skin and muscle at the mastectomy site, the expander is gradually increased in size by weekly injections of water or saline until the site is large enough to hold an implant. Placement of the expander can be at the time of mastectomy or at a later date. A musculocutaneous flap procedure is a type of reconstruction using the patient's own tissue. The nipple of the affected breast is removed at mastectomy and a new nipple can be reconstructed after breast reconstruction from various normal tissues. 23. b . Vinorelbine (Navelbine) is used to treat metastatic breast cancer and is better tolerated with fewer and milder side effects than other chemotherapy medications. Capecitabine (Xeloda) is used in women whose metastatic breast cancer has not responded to started chemotherapy. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a first-line chemotherapy medication and has severe side effects, especially cardiotoxicity. Eribulin mesylate (Halaven) is used in metastatic breast cancer patients who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. Case Study 1. It is lik ely that micrometastases to distant sites have occurred at the time of the diagnosis of breast cancer, even in stage I disease and almost certainly in stage III disease, supporting indications for systemic treatment of the cancer following local surgical treatment. Breast cancer is one of the solid tumors that is most responsive to chemotherapy and destruction or control of tumor cells that have spread to distant sites is the goal of systemic chemotherapy. 2. a. Cyclophosphamide [C]: alk nausea and vomiting, alopecia, photosensitivity 3. T each this patient to perform the following activities as necessary: Myelosuppression: \u00b0 Monitor her temperature every day. \u00b0 Report any chilling; sore throat; cough; or rectal, urinary, or chest pain. \u00b0 Keep the venous access catheter site clean and dry. \u00b0 Avoid crowds and anyone with communicable diseases. \u00b0 Wash the hands after toileting and before eating. \u00b0 Report any bleeding, serious bruising, or persistent headaches. \u00b0 Avoid using aspirin products. \u00b0 Examine the mouth daily for blood-filled lesions. \u00b0 Guard against bumping and other injury that might cause bleeding. Mucositis: \u00b0 Examine the mouth daily for bleeding, redness, or ulcers. \u00b0 Use a mouthwash of baking soda or salt water every 2 hours as needed. \u00b0 Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or sponge-tipped applicators for oral care.426 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

An estrogen receptor-positive tumor is estrogen-dependent and estrogen can promote growth of these breast cancer cells. Hormone receptor-positive cells usually are well differentiated, have low proliferative indices, and have a DNA content equal to that of normal cells. Medications such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex) or toremifene (Fareston) that block the estrogen receptor site of malignant cells can cause tumor regression and are widely used to treat recurrent or metastatic cancer that is estrogen-dependent. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) may be used with advanced breast cancer in women who no longer respond to tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibitors interfere with the enzyme aromatase, which is needed for the synthesis of estrogen. medications include anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara), and exemestane (Aromasin) and are treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene (Evista) may also be prescribed. It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that produces both estrogen-agonistic effects on bone and estrogen-antagonistic effects on breast tissue. 5. The nurse should do the following: Assist the patient to develop a positive but realistic attitude. Help her to identify sources of support and strength. Encourage her to verbalize her guilt and anger and fears about her diagnosis and the impact it is having on her life. Promote open communication between the patient and her husband. Provide accurate and complete answers to the patient's questions about her disease. Offer information about community resources and local support groups. 6. Fear, denial, embarrassment, and being too busy are common reasons that women do not perform BSE or have a mammogram and a lack of practice and skill at BSE undermines their confidence in performing the examination. Denial was probably a big factor for P.T. in view of the value of her breasts in her relationship with her husband. 7. The nurse should explain that some patients undergoing chemotherapy can have changes in maintaining focus, attention, and memory and difficulties in concentration. We currently do not know why this happens but research is being performed to determine the cause of chemobrain. 8. The nurse should teach her that she will need follow-up for the rest of her life at regular intervals. She should expect to have a professional examination every 3 to 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter. She should be taught to perform BSE of both breasts every month and report any changes to her health care provider. Breast imaging should also be done at regular intervals, as recurrence of breast cancer is likely to happen. 9. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective self-health management related to lack of compliance and information regarding breast cancer surveillance Ineffective coping related to reported feelings of guilt and perceived expectations of husband Impaired physical mobility related to decreased arm and shoulder mobility Disturbed body image related to physical and emotional effects of treatment modalities Collaborative problems: Potential complications: vascular access catheter displacement or infection, hyperuricemia, bleeding, septicemia, tumor recurrence, lymphedema CHAPTER 53 Answer Key 1. c. Although many factors relate to the current sexually transmitted infections (STI) rates, one major factor is the widespread use of oral contraceptives instead of condoms (both male and female). Condoms are the only contraceptive device that protects against STIs. 2. c. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause nongonococcal urethritis in men and gonorrhoeae causes gonorrhea. warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Syphilis is caused by T. pallidum. Gonorrhea is caused by N. gonorrhoeae. Genital herpes are caused by herpes simplex virus. 4. c. An established diagnosis of gonorrhea is treated with cefixime (Suprax) orally or with a single dose of IM ceftriaxone (Rocephin). If chlamydia is also present, azithromycin (Zithromax) or doxycycline (Vibramycin) may also be used. Gram stain smears are not useful in diagnosing gonorrhea in women because the female genitourinary tract normally harbors a large number of organisms that resemble N. gonorrhoeae and cultures must be performed to confirm the diagnosis in women. Penicillin was used to treat gonorrhea but gonorrhea is now resistant to penicillin. Penicillin G is used to treat syphilis. Although gonorrhea may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), its diagnosis would not necessarily indicate that the patient has PID. 5. a. Upward extension of gonorrhea or chlamydia commonly causes PID, which can cause adhesions and fibrous scarring, leading to tubal pregnancies and infertility. Disseminated gonococcal infection is rare and endocarditis and aneurysms are associated with syphilis. Polyarthritis and adenopathy are not seen in gonorrhea or chlamydia. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 427 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. d. All se xual contacts of patients with gonorrhea must be notified, evaluated, and treated for STIs. The other information may be helpful in diagnosis and treatment but the nurse must try to identify the patient's sexual partners. 7. a, b, c, d, f. In the tertiary (or late) stage of syphilis there can be gummas (chronic destructive lesions), cardiovascular problems (heart failure, aneurysms, valve insufficiency), and neurosyphilis manifestations (mental deterioration, tabes dorsalis, and speech disturbances). Generalized cutaneous rash occurs in the secondary stage of syphilis, a few weeks after the chancre appears. 8. a. Lack of clinical manifestations b ut a positive treponemal antibody test with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs in the latent stage. The primary stage is characterized by a chancre, regional lymphadenopathy, and genital ulcers. The secondary stage has flu-like symptoms and cutaneous lesions. The late or tertiary stage is characterized by gummas, cardiovascular changes, and neurosyphilis. 9. c. Man y other diseases or conditions may cause false- positive test results on nontreponemal Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagent (RPR) tests and additional testing is needed before a diagnosis is confirmed or treatment is administered. The diagnosis is confirmed by specific treponemal tests, such as the fluorescent antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) test or the TP-PA test. Analysis of CSF is used to diagnose asymptomatic neurosyphilis. 10. c. The risk f actors of drug abuse and sexual promiscuity are found in patients with both syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and persons at highest risk for acquiring syphilis are also at high risk for acquiring HIV . Syphilitic lesions on the genitals enhance HIV transmission. Also, HIV-infected patients with syphilis appear to be at greatest risk for central nervous system (CNS) involvement and may require more intensive treatment with penicillin to prevent this complication of HIV . 11. b . Notification and treatment of sexual partners are necessary to prevent recurrence and the \"ping-pong effect\" of passing STIs between partners. Vibramycin is prescribed twice a day for 7 days and although alcohol may cause more urinary irritation in the patient with chlamydia, it will not interfere with treatment. 12. b . The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is more sensitive than other diagnostic tests, can be done with a urine sample, and has results within 24 hours. A cell culture can be used to detect chlamydia organisms but it requires specific handling and is not as easy or as fast to perform as the NAAT. Gonorrhea and chlamydia have very similar symptoms in men and frequently occur together. Gram stain smears and cultures for N. gonorrhoeae do not definitively diagnose Chlamydia. Manifestations of epididymitis or proctitis may be present, as with other STIs, but are not diagnostic. 13. c, e. Se xual activity and stress may precipitate the recurrence of genital herpes symptoms of painful vesicular lesions that rupture and ulcerate. Acyclovir only decreases recurrences of genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) may cause oral or genital lesions. Prevention of the spread of genital herpes is best done with avoidance of sexual activity when lesions are present. 14. d. HPV is responsible for causing genital w arts, which manifest as discrete single or multiple white to gray warts that may coalesce to form large cauliflower-like masses on the vulva, vagina, cervix, and perianal area. Purulent vaginal discharge is with gonorrhea or chlamydia. Painful perineal vesicles and ulcerations are characteristic of genital herpes and a chancre of syphilis is a painless indurated lesion on the vulva, vagina, lips, or mouth. 15. a. There is a strong association of genital w arts with the development of dysplasia and neoplasia of the genital tract, especially when lesions involve the cervix, introitus, and perianal and intraanal mucosa of women or the penis and perianal and anal mucosa of men. Regular Papanicolaou (Pap) tests in women are critical in detecting early malignancies of the cervix. Oral acyclovir is used to treat HSV-2 but topical use has no value in treating viral STIs. Sexual partners of patients with HPV should be examined and treated but because treatment does not destroy the virus, condoms should always be used during sexual activity. Genital warts often grow more rapidly during pregnancy but pregnancy is not contraindicated. 16. d. W omen with an active herpes simplex virus (HSV) genital lesion at the time of delivery have the highest risk of transmitting genital herpes to the neonate, so delivery will be done with a cesarean section (C-section). Syphilis is spread to the fetus in utero and has a high risk of stillbirth but C-sections are not required. Treatment with parenteral penicillin will cure both the mother and the fetus. Chlamydia spread to the fetus can be prevented by treating the pregnant woman, so a C-section is not required. Prevention of the spread of gonorrhea to the neonate's eyes is done with erythromycin ophthalmic ointment or silver nitrate aqueous solution. 17. c. A v accine is available for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 that protects against genital warts and cervical cancer. Although sexual abstinence is the most certain method of avoiding all STIs, it is not usually a feasible alternative. Undamaged condoms also serve to protect against infection. Conscientious hand washing and voiding after intercourse are positive hygienic measures that will help to prevent secondary infections but will not prevent STIs. 18. a. STIs, such as syphilis, that can be treated with a single dose or short course of antibiotic therapy often lead to a casual attitude about the outcome of the disease, which leads to nonadherence with instructions and delays in treatment. This is particularly true of diseases that initially show few distressing or uncomfortable symptoms, such as syphilis. Case Study 1. The nurse should tell C.J. that he must tell his f ianc\u00e9e the truth about the sexual encounter and that it is most important for her to be evaluated for the disease. She may have the disease without symptoms and yet be at risk for developing PID and infertility as a result of the gonorrhea. The nurse may offer a counseling referral, if necessary, for them to work through problems in their relationship. 2. Females often do not ha ve any symptoms but Ms. A could have vaginal discharge, dysuria, urinary frequency, or changes in her menstrual patterns.428 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 3. For the patient, the diagnosis can be confirmed by a positive Gram stain smear of urethral drainage. For the fianc\u00e9e, a positive culture of cervical secretions or the urethra, anus, or oropharynx is necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis. 4. Support and counseling may be needed from the nurse and the couple should be assisted to verbalize their feelings and concerns. Active listening with a nonjudgmental attitude is important. Referral for professional counseling may be indicated. 5. Cefixime (Suprax) orally in a single dose or ceftriaxone (Rocephin) administered intramuscularly in a single dose and doxycycline (Vibramycin) or azithromycin (Zithromax) twice daily for 7 days is the recommended treatment for gonorrhea with a possible concurrent chlamydia infection. Because chlamydia infections are closely associated with gonococcal infections, both infections are usually treated concurrently, even without diagnostic evidence. Sexual activity is avoided during treatment and for 7 days after treatment. 6. Men: Prostatitis, urethral strictures, tubal Both men and women: Possible development of disseminated gonococcal infection 7. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety related to impact of condition on relationships and disease outcomes Disturbed body image related to symptoms associated with gonorrhea Risk for infection related to failure to practice precautionary measures Collaborative problem: Potential complication: infertility CHAPTER 54 Answer Key 1. a. The initial visit of a couple seeking assistance with infertility includes a history and physical for both partners, testing for medical problems and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) test, possible semen analysis, and instruction for at-home ovulation testing. A discussion of possible future testing options and cost is also done. If the couple decides to continue with treatment, further visits will include more intensive evaluation, including postcoital testing, a hysterosalpingogram, pelvic ultrasound, and midluteal progesterone and prolactin levels. 2. c. Drug therapy will be used before more invasive treatments. Drugs may include selective estrogen receptor modulators, menotropin (human If the husband's reproductive system is functioning, intrauterine insemination with his sperm will be done. The assisted reproductive technologies may be used if this is not successful. The surgery for endometriosis could be done if this was diagnosed but that is not included in this question. 3. b. In the presence of a confirmed pregnancy, uterine cramping with vaginal bleeding is the most important sign of spontaneous abortion. Other conditions causing vaginal bleeding, such as an incompetent cervix, do not usually cause cramping. There is no evidence that any medical treatment improves the outcome for spontaneous abortion. Blood loss can be significant and the loss of the pregnancy may cause long-term grieving. Dilation and curettage (D&C) (if needed) is performed after the abortion to minimize blood loss and reduce the chance of infection. 4. d. There is physical and emotional pain and grieving after an abortion that puts the patient in need of support. D&C is needed only if the products of conception do not pass completely or bleeding becomes excessive. The time it takes for the products of conception to pass depends on the type of abortion being done and is immediate with surgical abortion and slower with medical abortion. 5. d. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is diagnosed when other possible causes for symptoms have been eliminated. A diagnosis is based on a symptom diary that indicates the same symptoms during the luteal phase, approximately 1 week before menses, for two or three consecutive menstrual cycles. Oral contraceptives may be used to control the symptoms of PMS by suppressing ovulation and although progesterone may also relieve the symptoms of PMS, its effectiveness is not associated with the diagnosis of PMS. There are no laboratory findings that account for the premenstrual symptoms. 6. b. Limitation of refined sugar and caffeine in the diet has been shown to decrease the PMS symptoms of abdominal bloating, increased appetite, and irritability. Exercise is encouraged because it increases the release of endorphins, which elevates the mood, and also has a tranquilizing effect on muscle tension. Estrogen is not used during the luteal phase but progesterone may be tried. Vitamin B 6 and foods high in tryptophan may promote serotonin production, which improves symptoms. 7. c. The release of excess prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) from the endometrium at the time of menstruation or increased sensitivity to the prostaglandin is responsible for symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea and drugs that inhibit prostaglandin production and release, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are effective in many patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives may be used for primary dysmenorrhea by reducing endometrial hyperplasia. 8. c. Young female athletes may experience amenorrhea related to excessive exercise, low body weight, or severe dieting as well as stress. If she had increased sexual activity, she would be assessed for pregnancy but decreased sexual activity will not affect her menses. Excess prostaglandin production leads to dysmenorrhea. Metrorrhagia is associated with endometrial cancer or uterine fibroids. 9. c. When ovulation does not occur, estrogen continues to be unopposed by progesterone and excessive buildup of the endometrium occurs. To prevent the risk of endometrial cancer by the buildup of the endometrium or to prevent menorrhagia from an unstable endometrium, progesterone or birth control pills are prescribed to ensure that the patient's endometrial lining will be shed at least four to six times a year. Balloon therapy to treat menorrhagia is contraindicated in women who desire future fertility. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 429 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 10. d. Menorrhagia is increased duration or amount of bleeding with menses. Pain with menses is called dysmenorrhea. Metrorrhagia is excessive bleeding at irregular intervals or spotting between menstrual periods. 11. b . Ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition. If the fallopian tube ruptures, profuse bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock. All of the interventions are indicated but the priority is monitoring the vital signs and pain for evidence of bleeding. 12. a, c. The lack of estrogen in menopause contrib utes to many of the signs of aging, including cessation of menses, vasomotor instability (hot flashes), atrophic changes of vaginal and external genitalia and breast tissue, increased risks for coronary artery disease and osteoporosis, redistribution of fat, muscle and joint pain, loss of skin elasticity, and atrophic lower urinary tract changes. 13. b . Taking combination hormone therapy (HT) increases bone marrow density and decreases fractures. Both progestin and estrogen are recommended for a menopausal woman with a uterus. The risk for breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke are increased and the risk for endometrial cancer is decreased with combination HT. 14. c. Bacterial v aginosis is characterized by watery vaginal discharge with a fishy odor. Cervicitis displays mucopurulent discharge and postcoital spotting. Trichomoniasis has frothy greenish or gray discharge. Vulvovaginal candidiasis has thick, white, curdy discharge. 15. a, d. \"Y east infection\" or vulvovaginal candidiasis has intense itching and dysuria from urine coming in contact with fissures or irritated areas in the vulva. The discharge is thick, white, and curdlike. Hemorrhagic cervix and vagina occur with trichomoniasis and produce a pruritic, frothy greenish or gray discharge. Mucopurulent discharge and postcoital spotting from cervical inflammation is seen with cervicitis. 16. a. Gardnerella vaginalis infection is a bacterial vaginosis that may be sexually transmitted and both partners may be infected. Treatment of the condition includes vaginal treatment with metronidazole (Flagyl) or clindamycin (Cleocin) or treatment via the oral route. Sexual activity is avoided until both partners are infection free. Minipads may be used to contain vaginal secretions but they do not prevent reinfection. Vaginal suppositories and creams are used at bedtime so that the medication remains in the vagina for a long period of time. 17. b . Sexual activity with multiple partners increases the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and there is often a history of an acute infection of the lower genital tract caused by gonococcal or chlamydial microorganisms. The only significant contraceptive issue related to PID is that condom use will help to prevent STIs that may lead to PID. 18. b . Bed rest in semi-Fowler's position promotes drainage of the pelvic cavity by gravity and may prevent the development of abscesses high in the abdomen. Coitus, douching, and tampon use should be avoided to prevent spreading infection upward from the vagina, although frequent perineal care should be performed to remove infectious drainage. 19. c. The risk for infertility follo wing PID is high and the nurse should allow time for the patient to express her feelings, clarify her concerns, and begin problem solving with regard to the outcomes of the disease. Responses that do not allow for discussion of feelings and concerns or that tell the patient how she should feel or what she should worry about are not therapeutic. 20. c. The treatment of endometriosis and leiomyomas is surgical when the patient does not tolerate the symptoms, with the type of surgery for endometriosis dependent on the desire for pregnancy. Endometriosis and leiomyomas subside with the onset of menopause. Therefore the medications to treat them create a pseudomenopause. The ectopic uterine tissue is endometriosis, while leiomyomas are fibrous smooth muscle tumors. 21. d. Left untreated, polyc ystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may lead to cardiovascular disease and abnormal insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hirsutism may be treated with spironolactone. Leuprolide is used to treat hyperandrogenism but PCOS cannot be cured. Severity of symptoms is associated with obesity but the hormone abnormalities will be treated along with the obesity to prevent complications. If this treatment is not successful, a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy and oophorectomy may be performed. 22. b . A stage 0 cervical cancer indicates cancer in situ that is confined to the epithelial layer of the cervix and requires treatment. Stage 0 is the least invasive. Stage I is confined to the cervix. Stage II has spread beyond the cervix to the upper two thirds of the vagina but not the tissues around the uterus. Stage III involves the pelvic wall, lower third of the vagina, and/or kidney problems. Stage IV indicates spread to distant organs. 23. c. Conization (an e xcision of a cone-shaped section of the cervix) and laser treatment both are effective to locally remove or destroy malignant cells of the cervix and preserve fertility. Radiation treatments frequently impair ovarian and uterine function and lead to sterility. A subtotal hysterectomy would be contraindicated in the treatment of cervical cancer because the cervix would be left intact in this procedure. 24. a. Postmenopausal v aginal bleeding is the first sign of endometrial cancer. When it occurs, a sample of endometrial tissue must be taken to exclude cancer. An endometrial biopsy can be done as an office procedure and is indicated in this case. Abdominal x-rays and Pap tests are not reliable tests for endometrial cancer. Laser treatment of the cervix is indicated only for cervical dysplasia. 25. b . Treatment of ovarian cancer is determined by staging from the results of laparoscopy with multiple biopsies of the ovaries and other tissue throughout the pelvis and lower abdomen. The patient's desire for fertility is not a consideration because of the high mortality rate associated with ovarian cancer. Although diagnosis of ovarian tumors may be made by transvaginal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan, the treatment of ovarian cancer depends on the staging of the tumor. 26. a. V aginal cancer is usually related to metastases of other cancers or intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES). 27. a, b, f. Endometrial cancer is at higher risk in obese patients because adipose cells store estrogen, which is the major risk factor, especially unopposed estrogen. Smoking is a risk factor for endometrial and cervical cancer. Early sexual activity is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Family history and early menarche and late menopause causing increased menstrual cycles are risk factors for ovarian cancer.430 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 28. a. Early signs of cancer of the vulva include pruritus, soreness of the vulva, unusual odor, and discharge or bleeding of the vulva, with edema of the vulva and lymphadenopathy occurring as the disease progresses. Labial lesions and excoriation more commonly occur with infections and nodules are more often cysts or lipomas. 29. c. A total hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus and possibly the cervix but the fallopian tubes and ovaries are left intact. Although menstruation is terminated, normal ovarian production of estrogen continues. When the tubes and ovaries are removed, it is called a bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy. A panhysterectomy is the procedure in which the uterus and cervix as well as the tubes and ovaries are removed. 30. c. A pelvic exenteration is the most radical gynecologic surgery and results in removal of the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, bladder, urethra, and pelvic lymph nodes and, in some situations, also the descending colon, rectum, and anal canal. There are urinary and fecal diversions on the abdominal wall, the absence of a vagina, and the onset of menopausal symptoms, all of which result in severe altered body structure and changes in body image. The patient and family will need much understanding and support during the long recovery period, including verbalization of feelings. 31. d. To prevent displacement of the intrauterine implant, the patient is maintained on absolute bed rest with turning from side to side. Bowel elimination is discouraged during the treatment by cleaning the colon before implantation and urinary elimination is maintained by an indwelling catheter. Because the patient is radioactive, no individual nurse should spend more than 30 minutes daily with the patient and visitors are restricted to less than 3 hours each day at a minimum of 6 feet from the patient. 32. a. The muscles that should be exercised are those affected by trying to stop a flow of urine. Kegel exercises help to strengthen muscular support of the perineum, pelvic floor, and bladder and are also beneficial for problems with pelvic support and stress incontinence. 33. c. A uterine prolapse occurs when the uterus is displaced through the vagina, causing the feeling of something coming down her vagina, a backache, dyspareunia, or a heavy feeling in the pelvis. 34. d. The primary goal of care is to prevent wound infection and pressure on the vaginal incision, which requires perineal cleansing at least twice daily and after each urination and defecation. An ice pack and stool softener will be used but they are not the priority. The enema would have been done preoperatively. 35 a. An anterior colporrhaphy involves repair of a cystocele and an indwelling urinary catheter is left in place for several days postoperatively while healing occurs. Bowel function should not be altered and is maintained with a low-residue diet and a stool softener if necessary to avoid straining and pressure on the incision. 36. b. Sexual assault is an act of violence and the first priority of care for the patient should be assessment and treatment of serious injuries involving extragenital areas, such as fractures, subdural hematomas, cerebral concussions, and intraabdominal injuries. All of the other options are appropriate treatments but treatment for shock and urgent medical injuries is the first priority. 37. a. Specific informed consent must be obtained from the rape victim before any examination can be made or rape data collected. Following consent, the patient is advised not to wash, eat, drink, or urinate before the examination so that evidence can be collected for medicolegal use. Prophylaxis for STIs, hepatitis B, and tetanus is administered following examination and follow-up testing for pregnancy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is done in several weeks. Case Study 1. The gonococcus spreads directly along the endometrium to the tubes and into the peritoneum, resulting in salpingitis, pelvic peritonitis, or tubo-ovarian abscesses. 2. Clinical manifestations include crampy or continuous bilateral lower abdominal pain that is increased with movement or ambulation. Other manifestations are irregular menstrual bleeding and vaginal discharge that is purulent with a foul odor, dyspareunia, fever and chills, and possible nausea and vomiting. 3. Outpatient management would include oral antibiotics, increased fluid intake, good nutrition, restriction of activities, rest with the head elevated, and examination and treatment of her partner(s). She should be instructed to avoid intercourse, douching, and tampons and to return for follow-up in 48 to 72 hours. She should be instructed to return to the hospital if the pain is not relieved, if symptoms of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (e.g., right upper quadrant pain, pelvic or generalized peritonitis) occur, or if symptoms of septic shock (e.g., shortness of breath, decreased urination, confusion) occur. 4. Chronic pelvic pain occurs in up to one third of women who have PID. There may be severe steady pain, intermittent pain, dull and achy pain, pelvic pressure or heaviness, and sharp pains or cramping as well as pain during intercourse or while having a bowel movement. 5. Elevating the head of the bed promotes drainage of the pelvic cavity by gravity and may prevent the development of abscesses high in the abdomen. Monitoring vital signs for septic shock is also a priority. 6. Clarify the possible course and outcomes of the disease with the patient. Although early treatment may help to prevent complications, it is realistic that sterility often results from PID because of adhesions and strictures of the fallopian tubes. She is at increased risk for ectopic pregnancies. Discuss and listen to her concerns about her future childbearing ability. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of protective measures against STIs Pain related to movement and sexual intercourse Anxiety related to outcome of disease on reproductive status Risk for impaired skin integrity related to vaginal drainage Collaborative problems: Potential complications: peritonitis, septic shock, thromboembolism, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis WORKSHEETS 431 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 55 Answer Key 1. d. Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells and in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), it is thought that the enlargement caused by the increase in new cells results from hormonal changes associated with aging. Hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of existing cells. The hyperplasia is not considered a tumor, nor has BPH been proven to predispose to cancer of the prostate. 2. c. Classic symptoms of uncomplicated BPH are those associated with irritative symptoms, including nocturia, frequency, urgency, dysuria, bladder pain, and incontinence associated with inflammation or infection. Urinary obstruction symptoms include diminished caliber and force of the urinary stream, hesitancy, difficulty initiating voiding, intermittent urination, dribbling at the end of urination, and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying because of urinary retention. 3. c. Urinary flo w meters are used to measure the urinary flow rate, which is slowed with increased obstruction. Cystourethroscopy may also evaluate the degree of obstruction but a cystometrogram measures bladder tone. A transrectal ultrasound may determine the size and configuration of the prostate gland. Postvoiding catheterization measures residual urine. 4. a. Finasteride results in suppression of androgen formation by inhibiting the formation of the testosterone metabolite dihydroxytestosterone, the principal prostatic androgen, and results in a decrease in the size of the prostate gland. -Adrenergic blockers are used to cause smooth muscle relaxation in the prostate that improves urine flow. Drugs affecting bladder tone are not indicated. 5. c. Because of edema, urinary retention, and delayed sloughing of tissue that occurs with a laser prostatectomy, the patient will have postprocedure catheterization for up to 7 days. The procedure is done under local anesthetic, and incontinence or urinary retention is not usually a problem with laser prostatectomy. 6. d. The prostate gland can be easily palpated by rectal examination and enlargement of the gland is detected early if yearly examinations are performed. If symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia are present, further diagnostic testing, including a urinalysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and cystoscopy, may be indicated. 7. b . The transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) uses low- wave radiofrequency to heat the prostate, causing necrosis. Laser prostatectomy uses a laser beam. Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) uses microwave radiating heat to produce coagulative necrosis of the prostate and is not used for men with rectal problems. Transurethral electrovaporization of prostate (TUVP) uses electrosurgical vaporization and desiccation to destroy prostate tissue. 8. e, f. The transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the most common surgical procedure to treat BPH and uses a resectoscopic excision and cauterization of prostate tissue. A simple open prostatectomy is used for a large prostate and has an external incision. Transurethral incision into the prostate to expand the urethra for a small to moderate-sized prostate is done with a transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). 9. b, c, d. TUN A, TUIP, and TUMT are currently done on an outpatient basis or in a health care provider's office. 10. b . Because of injury to the internal urinary sphincter, there is usually some degree of retrograde ejaculation following most transurethral surgeries, especially following TURP. The semen is ejaculated into the bladder and is eliminated with the next voiding. Urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and continued catheterization are uncommon following TURP. 11. c. Bleeding and blood clots from the bladder are e xpected after prostatectomy and continuous irrigation is used to keep clots from obstructing the urinary tract. The rate of the irrigation may be titrated to keep the clots from forming, if ordered, but the nurse should also check the vital signs because hemorrhage is the most common complication of prostatectomy. The traction on the catheter applies pressure to the operative site to control bleeding and should be relieved only if specific orders are given. The catheter does not need to be manually irrigated unless there are signs that the catheter is obstructed and clamping the drainage tube is contraindicated because it would cause distention of the bladder. 12. b . The nurse should first check for the presence of clots obstructing the catheter or tubing and then may administer a belladonna and opium (B&O) suppository if one is ordered. The patient should not try to void around the catheter because this will increase the spasms. The flow rate of the irrigation fluid may be decreased if orders permit because fast-flowing, cold fluid may also contribute to spasms. 13. b . Activities that increase intraabdominal pressure should be avoided until the surgeon approves these activities at a follow-up visit. Stool softeners and high-fiber diets may be used to promote bowel elimination but enemas should not be used because they increase intraabdominal pressure and may initiate bleeding. Because TURP does not remove the entire prostate gland, the patient needs annual prostatic examinations to screen for cancer of the prostate. Fluid intake should be high but caffeine and alcohol should not be used because they have a diuretic effect and increase bladder distention. 14. c. Most prostate cancers (about 75%) are considered sporadic. About the only modifiable risk factor for prostate cancer is its association with a diet high in red and processed meat and high-fat dairy products along with a low intake of vegetables and fruits. Age, ethnicity, and family history are risk factors for prostate cancer but are not modifiable. Simple enlargement or hyperplasia of the prostate is not a risk factor for prostate cancer. 15. c. A prostatectomy performed with a perineal approach has a high risk for infection because of the proximity of the wound to the anus, so wound care is the priority. Chemotherapy is usually not the first choice of drug therapy following surgery, nor is sildenafil. The catheter size would not be changed but the catheter would be removed. Urinary incontinence is a bigger problem than retention. 16. a, b, f. Pelvic or perineal pain, f atigue, malaise, and a hard asymmetric prostate may be present with prostate cancer. Annual prostate examination is recommended starting at a younger age for African American men because of increased diagnosis and mortality from prostate cancer in this ethnic group. An orchiectomy may be done with prostatectomy or for metastatic stages of prostate cancer. 432 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Hormonal treatment includes androgen deprivation therapy, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, and androgen receptor blockers. Early detection of prostate cancer is best detected with annual rectal exams and serum PSA. Elevated prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) will be seen with metastasis, not a new diagnosis. 17. d. The prostate with chronic bacterial prostatitis feels enlarged and firm, often described as boggy, and is tender. The other options are true of both chronic and acute prostatitis. 18. c. Hypospadias is the urethral meatus located on the ventral surface of the penis. Scrotal lymphedema is called a hydrocele. An undescended testicle is Inflammation of the prepuce or foreskin is called phimosis. 19. d. Paraphimosis is tightness of the foreskin and the inability to pull it forward from a retracted position to return it over the glans. It is usually associated with poor hygiene techniques. Painful, prolonged erection is priapism. Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis. A painful downward curvature of an erect penis is chordee. 20. d. The cremasteric reflex is elicited by light stroking of the inner aspect of the thigh in a downward direction with a tongue blade. In testicular torsion, or a twisted spermatic cord that supplies blood to the testes and epididymis, this reflex is absent on the swollen side. Varicocele is dilation of the veins that drain the testes. Hydrocele is scrotal lymphedema from interference with scrotum. Spermatocele is a sperm-containing cyst of the (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are glycoproteins that may be elevated in testicular cancer. If they are elevated before surgical treatment, the levels are noted, and if response to therapy is positive, the levels will decrease. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may also be elevated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a normal cytokine responsible for tumor surveillance and destruction. C-reactive protein (CRP) is found in inflammatory conditions and widespread malignancies. PSA and PAP are used for screening of prostatic cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker for cancers of the GI system. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is found most frequently in autoimmune disorders. 22. d. Testicular tumors most often present on the testis as a lump or nodule that is very firm, is nontender, and cannot be transilluminated. There may also be scrotal swelling and a feeling of heaviness. All of the other options are normal findings. 23. c. Until sperm distal to the anastomotic site is ejaculated or absorbed by the body, the semen will contain sperm and alternative contraceptive methods must be used. When a postoperative semen examination reveals no sperm, the patient is considered sterile. Following vasectomy, there is rarely noticeable difference in the amount of ejaculate because ejaculate is primarily seminal fluid. Vasectomy does not cause erectile dysfunction, nor does it affect testicular production of sperm or hormones. 24. a. Before treatment for erectile dysfunction is initiated, the cause must be determined so that appropriate treatment can be planned. Only a small percentage of erectile dysfunction is caused by psychologic factors. In the case of the 80% to 90% of erectile dysfunction that is of physiologic causes, interventions are directed at correcting or eliminating the cause or restoring function by medical means. New invasive or experimental treatments are not widely used and should be limited to research centers and patients with systemic diseases can be treated medically if the cause cannot be eliminated. 25. d. Intraurethral devices include the use of vasoactive drugs administered as a topical gel, an injection into the penis (intracavernosal self-injection), or a medication pellet (alprostadil) inserted into the urethra (intraurethral) using a medicated urethral system for erection (MUSE) device. A medication pellet inserted into the urethra using a MUSE device, a topical gel, or the intracavernosal self-injection of vasoactive drugs may be used for erectile dysfunction. The vasoactive drugs enhance blood flow into the penile arteries for erection. Erectogenic drugs (e.g., tadalafil [Cialis]) cause smooth muscle relaxation and increase blood flow to promote an erection. Blood drawn into corporeal bodies and held with a ring is achieved with a vacuum constriction device (VCD). Devices implanted into corporeal bodies to firm the penis are penile implants. Androgen or testosterone replacement therapy may also be used for erectile dysfunction. 26. a. The gel may spread the testosterone to others if it is not washed off of his hands after application. If his wife applies the gel, she should wear gloves to prevent absorption of the testosterone and its effects on her body. Clothing over the area until it has dried is recommended. The gel is only topical; a buccal testosterone tablet is called Striant. 27. d. Varicocele is the most common testicular cause of infertility. Surgical ligation of the spermatic vein is done to correct the problem. Antibiotics are used if there is an infection but this is not as common as a varicocele. Semen analysis is the first study done when investigating male infertility but it is not a treatment. Avoidance of scrotal heat is a lifestyle change that may be used with idiopathic infertility. Case Study 1. Testicular tumors develop either from the cellular components of the testis (very rare and usually benign) or from the embryonal precursors (germinal tumors that are almost always malignant). Risk factors include age between 15 and 35, a history of cryptorchidism, family history of testicular cancer, orchitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, maternal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), and testicular cancer in the contralateral testis. 2. The primary difference on testicular examination between a spermatocele and a testicular cancer is that spermatocele will transilluminate whereas cancer cannot be transilluminated. 3. About 95% of patients with testicular cancer that is found in early stages obtain a complete remission. This patient has no back pain or gynecomastia, which are manifestations that would indicate metastatic disease. His prognosis is positive but he will need careful monitoring to detect any relapse early. 4. AFP and hCG are frequently elevated in testicular cancer and should be noted before treatment. If these markers are elevated before treatment and then decrease after treatment, ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 433 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. a positive response to treatment is indicated. The levels of AFP and hCG are monitored during long-term follow-up to detect any relapse of the tumor. 5. The nurse should initiate con versation with him about his concerns and allow him to talk about them. It is important to discuss the option of sperm banking before his surgery in case he later wants to have children. 6. The orchiectomy and lymph node resection will most lik ely be followed by radiation of the remaining lymph nodes and/or a single or multiple chemotherapy regimens. The surgery will cause sterility but the surgery and additional treatment should not alter his sexual function. 7. Seminoma germ cell tumors are v ery sensitive to radiation and germ cell tumors are more sensitive to systemic chemotherapy than other adult solid tumors, so its use is recommended. 8. Spermatogenesis may return b ut because of the high risk for infertility, sperm may be cryopreserved in a sperm bank before treatment begins. However, ejaculatory dysfunction may be impaired. 9. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety related to effects of surgery Fear related to outcome of disease process and prognosis Deficient knowledge related to unfamiliarity with information CHAPTER 56 Answer Key 1. a. Mitochondrion; b . nucleolus; i. j. synaptic knobs; neuron white central h. spinal cord; i. gray matter; j. anterior horn; k. spinal ganglia; l. spinal nerves; m. transverse process of vertebra; n. sympathetic ganglion; o. body of vertebra 3. d. The protecti ve fluid of the central nervous system (CNS) is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The synaptic cleft is the space where neurotransmitters cross from neuron to neuron. The limbic system is the area of the brain concerned with emotion, aggression, feeding behavior, and sexual response. Myelin is the white insulator for the conduction of impulses in the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). 4. c. Schw ann cells are the macroglial cells that myelinate peripheral nerve fibers. Astrocytes provide structural support to neurons and form the blood-brain barrier with the endothelium of blood vessels. Ependymal cells line the brain ventricles and aid in secretion of CSF. Neurons are not glial cells. 5. c. The presynaptic terminal submits neurotransmitter impulses through the synaptic cleft to the receptor site on the postsynaptic cell, either another neuron or a gland or muscles. If there are enough presynaptic cells releasing excitatory neurotransmitters on a single neuron, the sum of their input is enough to generate an action potential. The synapse is not a physical connection between neurons, as there is a space between them where the neurotransmitter goes from one to the other. 6. b . The dendrite carries impulses to the nerve cell body. The gap in the peripheral nerve axons is the node of Ranvier that allows an action potential to travel faster by jumping from node to node without traversing the insulated membrane segment. The axon carries impulses from the nerve cell body. Regeneration may occur with damage to peripheral axons. 7. b . The fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus tracts carry information and transmit impulses concerned with touch, deep pressure, vibration, position sense, and kinesthesia. Spinothalamic tracts carry pain and temperature sensations. The spinocerebellar tracts carry subconscious information about muscle tension and body position. Descending corticobulbar tracts carry impulses responsible for voluntary impulses from the cortex to the cranial and peripheral nerves. 8. a. The cell bodies of lo wer motor neurons that send impulses to skeletal muscles in the arms, legs, and trunk are located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and lesions generally cause weakness or paralysis, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Upper motor neurons include the brainstem and cerebral cortex motor neurons that influence skeletal muscle movement. Lesions at this point cause weakness and paralysis with hyperreflexia and spasticity. 9. a. The medulla contains the vital centers concerned with respiratory, vasomotor, and cardiac function. The cerebellum maintains trunk stability and equilibrium but is not related to respiratory or cardiac function. The parietal lobe interprets spatial information and controls the sensory cortex. Wernicke's area is responsible for language comprehension. 10. b . The occipital lobes are responsible for visual perception. This patient may experience inability to identify colors, hallucinations, vision loss, or total blindness. Heat is sensed with the sensory part of the cerebrum. The olfactory nerve is responsible for identifying smells. Broca's area regulates verbal expression. 11. c. Endocrine and autonomic nerv ous system (ANS) function is regulated by the hypothalamus. The basal ganglia function includes initiation, execution, and completion of voluntary movements, learning, emotional response, and automatic movements associated with skeletal muscle activity. The temporal lobe integrates somatic, visual, and auditory data and contains Wernicke's area. The reticular activating system regulates arousal and sleep-wake transitions with communication among the brainstem, reticular formation in the brainstem, and the cerebral cortex. 12. c. The thalamus relays sensory and motor input to and from the cerebrum. Auditory input is registered by the superior temporal gyrus. Past experiences are integrated by the anterior temporal lobe. The basal ganglia controls and facilitates learned and automatic movements. 13. d. Some cranial nerv es (CNs) are only efferent motor nerves (e.g., III, IV , VI, VII, XI, XII), some are only afferent sensory nerves (e.g., I, II, VIII), and some have both motor and sensory functions (e.g., V , IX, X) but spinal nerves always have both sensory and motor fibers. Both cranial and spinal nerves occur in pairs and whereas most cell bodies of CNs are located in the brain, the primary cell bodies of CN I, II, and XI are located outside of the brain.434 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 14. b, c, d, e. Descriptions or characteristics of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) include being necessary for male ejaculation, increases heart rate (HR) and dilates coronary arteries. Most postganglionic fibers release norepinephrine and preganglionic cell bodies are located in spinal segments T1-L2. 15. b. The circle of Willis is a vascular circle formed by the arteries that join the basilar artery and the internal carotid arteries. It may act as an anastomotic pathway when occlusion of a major artery on one side of the brain occurs. The middle cerebral artery supplies the outer portions of the frontal, parietal, and superior temporal lobes but the circle of Willis may accommodate for plaque in this artery. 16. b. The falx cerebri is a fold of the dura that separates the cerebral hemispheres and slows expansion of brain tissue. The ventricles produce CSF. The arachnoid layer is a membrane that forms a space with the pia mater for blood vessels and nerves to pass through. The tentorium cerebella is a fold of dura that separates the cerebral hemispheres from the posterior fossa that contains the brainstem and cerebellum. 17. b. The blood-brain barrier physiologically protects the brain from harmful agents in the blood. The skull protects the brain from external trauma. The vertebral column allows flexibility while protecting the spinal cord. The dura mater is the outer protective membrane. 18. c. A decrease in sensory receptors caused by degenerative changes leads to a diminished sense of touch, temperature, and pain in the older adult. Reflexes are decreased but not normally absent and intelligence does not decrease, although there may be some loss of memory. Hypothalamic modifications lead to increased frequency of spontaneous awakening with interrupted sleep and insomnia. 19. a, c, e. When taking the history of a patient with a neurologic problem, avoid suggesting symptoms or asking leading questions. The mode of onset and course of the illness are especially important. Validate the history if the patient's mental status causes question as to the reliability of the history. The other options are part of the physical assessment and will depend on the patient's history and manifestations. 20. Functional Health Pattern Risk Factor for or Patient Response to Neurologic Problem Health perception-health managementUncontrolled hypertension, lack of appropriate helmet or seat belt use, family history of neurologic problems, substance abuse, smoking, malnutrition, mental or physical changes noticed by others Nutritional-metabolic Difficulty chewing and swallowing, B-vitamin deficiency Elimination Bowel or bladder incontinence, constipation; frequency of episodes, sensations and measures to control Activity-exercise Problems in mobility, strength, and coordination; history of falling; activities of daily living (ADL) performance Sleep-rest Sleep disturbances from pain or immobility; insomnia, frequent awakening; hallucinations Cognitive-perceptual Pain; sensory changes, dizziness; Self-perception-self-concept Decreased self-worth and body image; unkempt physical appearance and hygiene Role-relationship Changes in roles at work or in family from neurologic problems Sexuality-reproductive Decreased sexual desire, stimulation, function, or response Coping-stress tolerance Sense of being overwhelmed, inadequate coping patterns Value-belief Life-changing effects; religious or cultural beliefs that interfere or assist with planned treatment 21. b, d, e. The trochlear (CN IV), abducens (CN VI), and oculomotor (CN III) nerves cause oblique eye movement. The optic nerve (CN II) is for vision. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) provides sensation from the face and the motor function of mastication. 22. c. The trigeminal (CN V) and facial (CN VII) nerves both respond to the corneal reflex test. The optic (CN II) nerve responds to confrontation. The vagus (CN X) nerve provides the gag reflex with the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) nerve. The spinal accessory (CN XI) nerve is tested with the resistive shoulder shrug. 23. c, e, f. The facial (CN VII) nerve is assessed with the corneal reflex test; smile, frown, and close eyes; and salt and sugar discrimination. Gag reflex is used to evaluate the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves. Confrontation is used to assess the optic (CN II) nerve. Light touch to the face and the corneal reflex test are used to evaluate the trigeminal (CN V) nerve. 24. c. The hypoglossal (CN XII) nerve is tested with tongue protrusion. The vagus (CN X) and glossopharyngeal (CN IX) nerves are tested with the gag reflex. The olfactory (CN I) nerve is tested with odor identification. 25. d. The cochlear branch of the acoustic (CN VIII) nerve should enable the patient to hear. The patient may be distracted or hard of hearing but the damage to the nerve is most likely the cause of the inability to hear the ticking watch, as the nurse should ensure that there are no distractions or extraneous noise when performing this test. The vagus (CN X) nerve is unrelated to hearing. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 435 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 26. c. The primary purposes of the nursing neurologic examination are to determine the effects of neurologic dysfunction on daily living and the patient's and the family's ability to cope with neurologic deficits. The examination should be viewed in terms of functional disabilities rather than dysfunction of component parts of the nervous system. Findings of the examination should be used to plan appropriate care for deficits in self-care and in ADLs. 27. b . The heel-to-shin test tests coordination and cerebellar function. Muscle tone is assessed by passively moving limbs through their range of motion. Plantar stimulation tests extensor plantar response. Loss of proprioception (or position sense) is assessed by placing the thumb and forefinger on either side of the patient's forefinger or great toe and gently moving it up and down, then asking the patient to indicate the direction in which the digit was moved. 28. d. Extinction is assessed by simultaneously stimulating both sides of the body; it is abnormal if the patient extinguishes one stimulus and perceives the stimulus only on one side. P ain sensation is assessed by touching the sharp and dull end of a pin to each of the patient's limbs with the patient responding \"sharp\" or \"dull\" each time. The cotton wisp assesses light touch. A tuning fork to bony prominences assesses vibration sense. 29. c. A positi ve Romberg test is demonstrated when the patient is unable to maintain balance with the feet together and then closing the eyes. Pronator drift is observed when the patient holds both arms fully extended at shoulder level in front of him with the palms upward but the patient is unable to maintain the position. Absent patellar reflex is when there is no response to striking the patellar tendon just below the patella. Absence of two-point discrimination is seen when the two points of a calibrated compass are on the tips of the fingers and are not recognized as two distinct points. 30. b . The normal response of the triceps reflex is extension of the arm or visible contraction of the triceps. The normal response of the biceps reflex is flexion of the arm at the elbow whereas the presence of the brachioradialis reflex is seen with flexion and supination at the elbow. 31. b . This is a normal patellar reflex response. Deep-tendon grading response; 4/5 hyperreflexia with clonus. 32. d. T o facilitate insertion of the spinal needle between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, the patient should round the spine by flexing the knees, hips, and neck while in a lateral recumbent position. Sitting on the edge of the bed and bending only the spine does not separate the vertebrae as efficiently. Stimulants are withheld for 8 hours before an electroencephalogram (EEG) and sedation is used for more invasive tests, such as myelograms and angiography. 33. a. A spinal headache, which may be caused by loss of CSF at the puncture site, is common following a lumbar puncture or a myelogram and nuchal rigidity may also occur as a result of meningeal irritation. The patient is not in danger of paralysis with a lumbar puncture, nor does hemorrhage from the site occur. Contrast media are not used with a lumbar puncture. 34. b . Following a myelogram (and a lumbar puncture), the patient is positioned flat in bed for several hours to avoid a spinal headache and fluids are encouraged to help in the excretion of the contrast medium. Pain at the insertion site is rare and the most common complaint after a myelogram is a headache. 35. b . Cerebral angiography involves the injection of contrast media through a catheter inserted into the femoral or brachial artery and passed into the base of a carotid or vertebral artery and is performed when vascular lesions or tumors are suspected. Allergic reactions to the contrast medium may occur and vascular spasms or dislodgement of plaques is possible. Neurologic and vital signs must be monitored every 15 to 30 minutes for 2 hours, every hour for the next 6 hours, and then every 2 hours for 24 hours following the test. EEGs and transcranial Doppler sonography are not invasive studies. 36. d. Normal glucose le vels in CSF are 40 to 70 mg/dL. All types of organisms consume glucose, and a decreased glucose level reflects bacterial activity. Increased levels are associated with diabetes. The other values are all normal. CHAPTER 57 Answer Key 1. a, c, e. Blood adapts with increased v enous outflow, decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), and collapse of veins and dural sinuses. Brain tissue adapts with distention of the dura, slight compression of tissue, or herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) adapts with increased absorption, decreased production, and displacement into the spinal canal. Skull bone and scalp tissue do not adapt to changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). 2. 56 mm Hg Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + 13 (systolic blood pressure [SBP] - DBP) = 52 + 18 = 70 Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) = MAP ICP = 70 14 = 56 3. 45 mm Hg MAP = DBP + 13 (SBP DBP) = 64 + 15 = 79 CPP = MAP ICP = 79 34 = 45 4. c, e. Cerebral blood flo w is decreased when the MAP and the PaCO2 are decreased. The other options increase cerebral blood flow. 5 . b, e. V asogenic cerebral edema, the most common type of edema, occurs mainly in the white matter and is characterized by leakage of macromolecules from the capillaries into the surrounding extracellular space. This results in an osmotic gradient that favors the flow of fluid from the intravascular to the extravascular space. A variety of insults, such as brain tumors, abscesses, and ingested toxins, may cause an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and produce an increase in the extracellular fluid volume. Hydrocephalus causes interstitial cerebral edema. 6. a, b, d. Increased ICP is caused by v asodilation and edema from the initial brain insult or necrotic tissue. Blood vessel compression and brainstem compression and herniation occur as a result of increased ICP. 436 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 7. c. One of the most sensitive signs of increased ICP is a decreasing level of consciousness (LOC). A decrease in LOC will occur before changes in vital signs, ocular signs, or projectile vomiting occur. 8. c. Cushing's triad consists of three vital sign measures that reflect ICP and its effect on the medulla, hypothalamus, pons, and thalamus. Because these structures are very deep, Cushing's triad is usually a late sign of ICP. The signs include an increasing SBP with a widening pulse pressure, a bradycardia with a full and bounding pulse, and irregular respirations. 9. c. The dural structures that separate the two hemispheres and the cerebral hemispheres from the cerebellum influence the patterns of cerebral herniation. A cingulate herniation occurs where there is lateral displacement of brain tissue beneath the falx cerebri. Uncal herniation occurs when there is lateral and downward herniation. Tentorial herniation occurs when the brain herniates down through the opening created by the brainstem. The temporal lobe can be involved in central herniation. 10. a. An intraventricular catheter is a fluid-coupled system that can provide direct access for microorganisms to enter the ventricles of the brain and aseptic technique is a very high nursing priority to decrease the risk for infection. Constant monitoring of ICP waveforms is not usually necessary and removal of CSF for sampling or to maintain normal ICP is done only when specifically ordered. 11. b. An inaccurate ICP reading can be caused by CSF leaks around the monitor device, obstruction of the intraventricular catheter, kinks or bubbles in the tubing, and incorrect height of the transducer or drainage system relative to the patient's reference point. The P2 wave being higher than the P1 wave indicates poor ventricular compliance. The transducer height should be at the tragus of the ear. The drain of the CSF drainage device should be closed for 6 minutes preceding the reading. 12. b. The normal pressure of oxygen in brain tissue (PbtO2) is 20 to 40 mm Hg. The normal jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) is 55% to 75% and indicates total venous brain tissue extraction of oxygen; this is used for short-term monitoring. The MAP of 70 to 150 mm Hg is needed for effective autoregulation of CBF. The normal range for PaO 2 is 80 to 100 mm Hg. 13. c. Mannitol (Osmitrol) (25%) is an osmotic diuretic that expands plasma and causes fluid to move from tissues into the blood vessels. Hypertonic saline reduces brain swelling by moving water out of brain tissue. Oxygen administration is done to maintain brain function. Pentobarbital (Nembutal) and other barbiturates are used to reduce cerebral metabolism. The corticosteroid dexamethasone (Decadron) is used to treat vasogenic edema to stabilize cell membranes and improve neuronal function by improving CBF and restoring autoregulation. 14. d. A patient with increased ICP is in a hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic state and needs adequate glucose to maintain fuel for the brain and other nutrients to meet metabolic needs. Malnutrition promotes cerebral edema and if a patient cannot take oral nutrition, other means of providing nutrition should be used, such as tube feedings or parenteral nutrition. Glucose alone is not adequate to meet nutritional requirements and 5% dextrose solutions may increase cerebral edema by lowering serum osmolarity. Patients should remain in a normovolemic fluid state with close monitoring of clinical factors such as urine output, fluid intake, serum and urine osmolality, serum electrolytes, and insensible losses. 15. a. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to quickly assess the LOC with a standardized system. The three areas assessed are the patient's ability to speak, obey commands, and open eyes to verbal or painful stimulus. Although best motor response is an indicator, it is not used to assess coordination. 16. b. No opening of eyes = 1; incomprehensible words = 2; flexion withdrawal = 4. Total = 7 17. d. Of the body functions that should be assessed in an unconscious patient, cardiopulmonary status is the most vital function and gives priorities to the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). 18. c. One of the functions of cranial nerve (CN) III, the oculomotor nerve, is pupillary constriction and testing for pupillary constriction is important to identify patients at risk for brainstem herniation caused by increased ICP. The corneal reflex is used to assess the functions of CN V and VII and the oculocephalic reflex tests all cranial nerves involved with eye movement. Nystagmus is commonly associated with specific lesions or chemical toxicities and is not a definitive sign of ICP. 19. a. Nursing care activities that increase ICP include hip and neck flexion, suctioning, clustering care activities, and noxious stimuli. They should be avoided or performed as little as possible in the patient with increased ICP. Lowering the PaCO 2 below 20 mm Hg can cause ischemia and worsening of ICP. 20. c. A PaO2 of 70 mm Hg reflects hypoxemia that may lead to further decreased cerebral perfusion. PaO2 should be maintained at greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg. The pH and SaO2 are within normal range and a PaCO2 of 35 mm Hg reflects a normal value. 21. a, b, d, e. The first sign of increased ICP is a change in LOC. Other manifestations are dilated ipsilateral pupil, changes in motor response such as posturing, and fever, which may indicate pressure on the hypothalamus. Changes in vital signs would be an increased SBP with widened pulse pressure and bradycardia. 22. b. If reflex posturing occurs during range of motion (ROM) or positioning of the patient, these activities should be done less frequently until the patient's condition stabilizes because posturing can cause increases in ICP and may indicate herniation. Neither restraints nor central nervous system (CNS) depressants would be indicated. 23. d. A cerebral concussion may include a brief disruption in LOC, retrograde amnesia, and a headache, all of short duration. A basilar skull fracture may have a dural tear with CSF or brain otorrhea, rhinorrhea, hearing difficulty, vertigo, and Battle's sign. A temporal fracture would have a boggy temporal muscle because of extravasation of blood, Battle's sign, or CSF otorrhea. 24. c. The posterior fossa fracture causes occipital bruising resulting in cortical blindness or visual field defects. A cerebral contusion is bruising of brain tissue within a focal area. An orbital skull fracture would cause periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) and possible optic nerve injury. A frontal lobe skull fracture would expose the brain to contaminants through the frontal air sinus and the patient would have CSF rhinorrhea or pneumocranium. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 437 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 25. c. The compound skull fracture is a depressed skull fracture and scalp lacerations with communicating pathway(s) to the intracranial cavity. A linear skull fracture is a straight break in the bone without alteration in the fragments. A depressed skull fracture is an inward indentation of the skull that may cause pressure on the brain. A comminuted skull fracture has multiple linear fractures with bone fragmented into many pieces. 26. b . Testing clear drainage for CSF in nasal or ear drainage may be done with a Dextrostik or Tes-Tape strip but if blood is present, the glucose in the blood will produce an unreliable result. To test bloody drainage, the nurse should test the fluid for a \"halo\" or \"ring\" that occurs when a yellowish ring encircles blood dripped onto a white pad or towel within a few minutes. 27. d. An arterial epidural hematoma is the most acute neurologic emergency and typical symptoms include unconsciousness at the scene with a brief lucid interval followed by a decrease in LOC. An acute subdural hematoma manifests signs within 48 hours of an injury. A chronic subdural hematoma develops over weeks or months. 28. d. When there is a depressed fracture or a fracture with loose fragments, a craniotomy is indicated to elevate the depressed bone and remove free fragments. A craniotomy is also indicated in cases of acute subdural and epidural hematomas to remove the blood and control the bleeding. Burr holes may be used in an extreme emergency for rapid decompression or to aid in removing a bone flap but with a depressed fracture, surgery would be the treatment of choice. 29. a. In addition to monitoring for a patent airw ay during emergency care of the patient with a head injury, the nurse must always assume that a patient with a head injury may have a cervical spine injury. Maintaining cervical spine precautions in all assessment and treatment activities with the patient is essential to prevent additional neurologic damage. 30. a. Residual mental and emotional changes of brain trauma with personality changes are often the most incapacitating problems following head injury and are common in patients who have been comatose for longer than 6 hours. Families must be prepared for changes in the patient's behavior to avoid family-patient friction and maintain family functioning and professional assistance may be required. There is no indication the patient will be dependent on others for care but he likely will not return to pretrauma status. 31. d. The positron emission tomograph y (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to reliably detect very small tumors. The computed tomography (CT) and brain scans are used to identify the location of a lesion. Angiography could be used to determine blood flow to the tumor and further localize it. Electroencephalography (EEG) would be used to rule out seizures. 32. b . Frontal lobe tumors often lead to loss of emotional control, confusion, memory loss, disorientation, seizures, and personality and judgment changes that are very disturbing and frightening to the family. Physical symptoms, such as blindness, speech disturbances, or disturbances in sensation and perception that occur with other tumors, are more likely to be understood and accepted by the family. 33. d. A craniectomy is e xcision of cranial bone without replacement, so the patient will need to protect the brain from trauma in this surgical area. Burr holes are opened into the cranium with a drill to remove blood and fluid. A craniotomy is opening the cranium with removal of a bone flap to open the dura. The replaced bone flap is wired or sutured after surgery. A cranioplasty replaces part of the cranium with an artificial plate. 34. b . A stereotactic radiosurgery technique uses precisely focused radiation to destroy tumor cells. The radiation is computer and imagery guided. Radioactive seeds are used to deliver radiation. Ventricular shunts are used to redirect CSF from one area to another. A craniotomy is done by first making burr holes and then opening the cranium by connecting the holes to remove a flap of bone to expose the dura mater. 35. a. T o prevent undue concern and anxiety about hair loss and postoperative self-esteem disturbances, a patient undergoing cranial surgery should be informed preoperatively that the head is usually shaved in surgery while the patient is anesthetized and that a turban, scarf, or cap may be used after the dressings are removed postoperatively and a wig also may be used after the incision has healed to disguise the hair loss. In the immediate postoperative period the patient is very ill and the focus is on maintaining neurologic function but preoperatively the nurse should anticipate the patient's postoperative need for self-esteem and maintenance of appearance. 36. d. The primary goal after cranial sur gery is prevention of increased ICP and interventions to prevent ICP and infection postoperatively are nursing priorities. The residual deficits, rehabilitation potential, and ultimate function of the patient depend on the reason for surgery, the postoperative course, and the patient's general state of health. 37. c. The symptoms of brain abscess closely resemble those of meningitis and encephalitis, including fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and increased ICP, except that the patient also may have some focal symptoms that reflect the local area of the abscess. 38. b, c, e. Encephalitis is usually caused by a virus that inflames the brain and can be transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes. The other options are characteristics of meningitis. 39. d. Meningitis is often a result of an upper respiratory infection or a penetrating wound of the skull, where organisms gain entry to the CNS. Epidemic encephalitis is transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes and nonepidemic encephalitis may occur as a complication of measles, chickenpox, or mumps. Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus carries a high fatality rate. 40. b . High fever, severe headache, nuchal rigidity, nausea, and vomiting are key signs of meningitis. Other symptoms, such as papilledema, generalized seizures, hemiparesis, and decreased LOC, and cranial nerve dysfunction may occur as complications of increased ICP in meningitis. 41. b . LOC must be monitored because it will decrease with the increased brain metabolism that the fever causes. Analgesics will not aid in lowering the body temperature, although acetaminophen will be used as an antipyretic. Rapid cooling may lead to shivering that increases metabolism. Monitoring cerebral edema will be done. Peripheral edema is unrelated and there will not be a rapid 438 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. fluid infusion for the fever. Fluid replacement will be calculated with 800 mL/day for respiratory losses and 100 mL for each degree of temperature above 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). 42. c. Any warm-blooded mammal, including livestock, can carry rabies. Worldwide, dogs are the most common carrier of rabies; however, in developed countries raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes are the primary animal carriers. Because rabies is usually fatal, it is much better to prevent its spread. Case Study 1. The temperature elevation and nuchal rigidity in the presence of increased ICP and decreasing LOC indicate that this patient has developed a meningeal infection. 2. The risks for meningitis after head injury and surgery include penetrations into the intracranial cavity with the compound fracture that involves a depressed skull fracture with scalp lacerations with a communicating pathway to the intracranial cavity and the incisions necessary for craniotomy for hematoma evacuation. Postoperative drains, invasive monitoring, environmental pathogens, and impaired immune response also contribute to the development of meningitis. 3. Acute inflammation and infection of the pia mater and the arachnoid membrane cause nuchal rigidity, a sign of meningeal irritation, and fever. The inflammatory response increases CSF production with an increase in pressure and as the purulent secretion produced by microbial infection spreads to other areas of the brain, cerebral edema and increased ICP occur. Increased ICP is thought to be a result of swelling around the dura, increased CSF volume, and endotoxins produced by the bacteria. 4. Priority interventions include reduction of fever, reduction of ICP, maintaining antibiotic schedule to keep therapeutic levels, maintaining fluid balance, protection from injury if seizures occur, and minimizing environmental stimuli. 5. Access to the meninges could have occurred from facial and cranial fractures, sinuses, and the surgical incisions. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Risk for ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to cerebral tissue swelling Hyperthermia related to infection and abnormal temperature regulation Ineffective breathing pattern related to decreased LOC and immobility Risk for injury related to potential for seizures Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to hypermetabolism and inability to ingest food and fluids Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility Collaborative problems: Potential complications: increased ICP, seizures, hydrocephalus, disseminated intravascular coagulation, brain herniation CHAPTER 58 Answer Key 1. c. The highest risk factors for thrombotic stroke are hypertension and diabetes. African Americans have a higher risk for stroke than do white persons, probably because they have a greater incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Factors such as diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol, cigarette smoking, metabolic syndrome, sedentary lifestyle, and excessive alcohol use are also risk factors but carry less risk than hypertension. 2. c. The communication between the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation in the circle of Willis provides a collateral circulation, which may maintain circulation to an area of the brain if its original blood supply is obstructed. All areas of the brain require constant blood supply and atherosclerotic plaques are not readily reversed. Neurologic deficits can result from ischemia caused by many factors. 3. d. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary focal loss of neurologic function caused by ischemia of an area of the brain, usually lasting an hour or less. TIAs may be due to microemboli that temporarily block blood flow and are a warning of progressive cerebrovascular disease. Evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the neurologic deficit and provide prophylactic treatment if possible. 4. a, b, e. Strokes from intracerebral hemorrhage have a poor prognosis, are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel, are frequently atherosclerotic, and create a mass that compresses the brain. Thrombotic strokes are related to hypertension and occur during sleep or after sleep. 5. a. Embolic strokes are associated with endocardial disorders such as atrial fibrillation, have a rapid onset, and are unrelated to activity. 6. c. Clinical manifestations of altered neurologic function differ, depending primarily on the specific cerebral artery involved and the area of the brain that is perfused by the artery. The degree of impairment depends on rapidity of onset, the size of the lesion, and the presence of collateral circulation. 7. a. L; b. R; c. R; d. L; e. R; f. R; g. L 8. c. Receptive aphasia is the lack of comprehension of both verbal and written language. Dysarthria is disturbance in muscular control of speech. In fluent dysphasia speech is present but contains little meaningful communication. Expressive aphasia is the loss of the production of language. 9. c. MRI could be used to rapidly distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and determine the size and location of the lesion. A noncontrast CT scan could also be used. Lumbar punctures are not performed routinely because of the chance of increased intracranial pressure causing herniation. Cerebral arteriograms are invasive and may dislodge an embolism or cause further hemorrhage. They are performed only when no other test can provide the needed information. 10. c. A carotid endarterectomy is the removal of an atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries that may impair circulation enough to cause a stroke. The other procedures described may also be used to prevent strokes. An extracranial-intracranial bypass involves cranial surgery to bypass a sclerotic intracranial artery. Stenting may improve circulation in the brain. A percutaneous transluminal angioplasty uses a balloon to compress stenotic areas in the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries and often includes inserting a stent to hold the artery open. 11. c. The administration of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), and combined dipyridamole and aspirin (Aggrenox), reduces the incidence of stroke in those at risk. Anticoagulants are also used for prevention of embolic strokes but increase the risk for hemorrhage. Diuretics are not indicated for stroke prevention other than for their role ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 439 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. in controlling blood pressure (BP) and antilipidemic agents have not been found to have a significant effect on stroke prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine is used in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage to decrease the effects of vasospasm and minimize tissue damage. 12. d. The f irst priority in acute management of the patient with a stroke is preservation of life. Because the patient with a stroke may be unconscious or have a reduced gag reflex, it is most important to maintain a patent airway for the patient and provide oxygen if respiratory effort is impaired. IV fluid replacement, treatment with osmotic diuretics, and avoiding hyperthermia may be used for further treatment. 1 3. b . Surgical management with clipping of an aneurysm to decrease rebleeding and vasospasm is an option for a stroke caused by rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. Placement of coils into the lumens of the aneurysm via interventional neuroradiology can also be done to prevent the blood from circulating through the aneurysm and to reduce the risk of rupture. Hyperventilation therapy would increase vasodilation and the potential for hemorrhage. Thrombolytic therapy would be absolutely contraindicated and if a vessel is patent, osmotic diuretics may leak into tissue, pulling fluid out of the vessel and increasing edema. 14. a. The body responds to the v asospasm and decreased circulation to the brain that occurs with a stroke by increasing the BP, frequently resulting in hypertension. The other options are important cardiovascular factors to assess but they do not result from impaired cerebral blood flow. 15. a, b, c, d, f. The secondary assessment and ongoing neurologic monitoring include the gaze, facial palsy, distal motor function (part of the NIH Stroke Scale), sensation, proprioception, cognition, motor abilities, cerebellar function, and deep tendon reflexes. Current medications and history of hypertension are part of the primary assessment. 1 6. d. Acti ve range of motion (ROM) should be initiated on the unaffected side as soon as possible and passive ROM of the affected side should be started on the first day. Having the patient actively exercise the unaffected side provides the patient with active and passive ROM as needed. Use of footboards is controversial because they stimulate plantar flexion. The unaffected arm should be supported but immobilization may precipitate a painful shoulder-hand syndrome. The patient should be positioned with each joint higher than the joint proximal to it to prevent dependent edema. 1 7. a. The presence of homon ymous hemianopia in a patient with right hemisphere brain damage causes a loss of vision in the left field bilaterally. Early in the care of the patient, objects should be placed on the right side of the patient in the field of vision and the nurse should approach the patient from the right side. Later in treatment, patients should be taught to turn the head and scan the environment and should be approached from the affected side to encourage head turning. Eye patches are used if patients have diplopia (double vision). 18. a. Usually the speech therapist will ha ve completed a swallowing study before a diet is ordered. The first step in providing oral feedings for a patient with a stroke is ensuring that the patient has an intact gag reflex because oral feedings will not be provided if the gag reflex is impaired. After placing the patient in an upright position, the nurse should then evaluate the patient's ability to swallow ice chips or ice water. 19. c. Soft foods that pro vide enough texture, flavor, and bulk to stimulate swallowing should be used for the patient with dysphagia. Thin liquids are difficult to swallow and patients may not be able to control them in the mouth. Pureed foods are often too bland and too smooth and milk products should be avoided because they tend to increase the viscosity of mucus and increase salivation. 20. d. Recombinant tissue plasminogen acti vator (tPA) dissolves clots and increases the risk for bleeding. It is not used with hemorrhagic strokes. If the patient had a thrombotic or embolic stroke, the timeframe of 3 to 4.5 hours after onset of clinical signs of the stroke would be important as well as a history of surgery. The nurse should answer the question as accurately as possible and then encourage the wife to talk with the physician if she has further questions. 21. a, d, e, f. The patient' s rehabilitation potential and the expectations of the patient and caregiver related to the rehabilitation program will have a big impact on planning and carrying out the rehabilitation plan. The other things the rehabilitation nurse will assess are the physical status of all of the patient's body systems, presence of complications caused by the stroke or other chronic conditions, the cognitive status of the patient, and the family (including the patient and caregiver) resources and support. 22. b . During rehabilitation, the patient with aphasia needs frequent, meaningful verbal stimulation that has relevance for him or her. Conversation by the nurse and family should address activities of daily living (ADLs) that are familiar to the patient. Gestures, pictures, and simple statements are more appropriate in the acute phase, when patients may be overwhelmed by verbal stimuli. Flashcards are often perceived by the patient as childish and meaningless. Not responding verbally does not promote communication. 23. c. Unilateral ne glect, or neglect syndrome, occurs when the patient with a stroke is unaware of the affected side of the body, which puts the patient at risk for injury. During the acute phase, the affected side is cared for by the nurse with positioning and support but during rehabilitation the patient is taught to care consciously for and attend to the affected side of the body to protect it from injury. Patients may be positioned on the affected side for up to 30 minutes. 24. c. P atients with left-brain damage from stroke often experience emotional lability, inappropriate emotional responses, mood swings, and uncontrolled tears or laughter disproportionate to or out of context with the situation. The behavior is upsetting and embarrassing to both the patient and the family and the patient should be distracted to minimize its presence. Maintaining a calm environment and avoiding shaming or scolding the patient is important. Patients with right-brain damage often have impulsive, rapid behavior that requires supervision and direction. 25. d. The patient and f amily need accurate and complete information about the effects of the stroke to problem-solve and make plans for chronic care of the patient. It is uncommon for patients with major strokes to return completely to prestroke function, behaviors, and role and both the patient and family will mourn these losses. The patient's specific needs for care must be identified and rehabilitation efforts should be continued at home. Family therapy and support groups may be helpful for some patients and families.440 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 26. c. Medication administration is within the scope of practice for a licensed practical nurse (LPN). Assessment and teaching are within the scope of practice for the RN. Case Study 1. A noncontrast CT or MRI scan would be able to determine the size and location of a lesion and to differentiate between an infarction and a hemorrhage. A lumbar puncture would not be indicated because of the chance that hemorrhage had increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Other tests that might be used when hemorrhage is evident include cerebral angiography to identify the source of subarachnoid hemorrhage; intraarterial digital subtraction angiography, cerebral angiography; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography that measures the velocity of blood flow in the major cerebral arteries; and carotid duplex scanning. 2. Unconsciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5, and wide pulse pressure with a decrease in pulse and respiration all indicate increased ICP. 3. The loss of consciousness is associated with a poor prognosis for recovery and the family should be told that her condition is very guarded. 4. The highest priorities for interventions are those that support the patient's life processes: airway and respiratory function with oxygen administration, fluid management without overloading the vascular system, and measures that decrease ICP. 5. Anything that impairs clotting is contraindicated in a stroke: anticoagulants, and thrombolytic therapy. Hyperosmolar diuretics are also contraindicated because they may escape from an injured vessel, causing increased edema in brain tissue. 6. Hypothermia and barbiturate therapy may be used but these treatments have not proved effective. Surgery is the only other option and clipping or coiling of an aneurysm may be performed or the aneurysm may be wrapped or reinforced with muscle. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Decreased intracranial adaptive capacity related to increase in ICP secondary to hemorrhage Risk for ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to hemorrhage Ineffective airway clearance related to unconsciousness Risk for aspiration related to decreased level of consciousness Impaired physical mobility related to unconsciousness Self-care deficit related to altered mental state Risk for injury related to inability to monitor personal safety Risk for infection related to immobility Collaborative problems: Potential complications: increased ICP, brain herniation, seizures CHAPTER 59 Answer Key 1. b. Migraine headaches are frequently unilateral and usually throbbing. They may be preceded by a prodrome and frequently there is a family history. Cluster headaches are also unilateral with severe bone-crushing pain but there is no prodrome or family history. Frontal-type headache is not a functional type of headache. Tension-type headaches are bilateral with constant, squeezing tightness without prodrome or family history. 2. b, c, d, f. Cluster headaches have only alcohol as a dietary trigger and have an abrupt onset lasting 5 minutes to 3 hours with severe, sharp, penetrating pain. Cluster headaches may be accompanied by unilateral ptosis, lacrimation, rhinitis, facial flushing or pallor and commonly recur several times each day for several weeks, with months or years between clustered attacks. Family history and nausea, vomiting, or irritability may be seen with migraine headaches. Bilateral pressure occurring between migraine headaches and intermittent occurrence over long periods of time are characteristics of tension-type headaches. 3. d. The primary way to diagnose and differentiate between headaches is with a careful history of the headaches, requiring assessment of specific details related to the headache. Electromyelography (EMG) may reveal contraction of the neck, scalp, or facial muscles in tension- type headaches but this is not seen in all patients. CT scans and cerebral angiography are used to rule out organic causes of the headaches. 4. d. Triptans (sumatriptan [Imitrex]) affect selected serotonin receptors that decrease neurogenic inflammation of the cerebral blood vessels and produce vasoconstriction. Both migraine headaches and cluster headaches appear to be related to vasodilation of cranial vessels and drugs that cause vasoconstriction are useful in treatment of migraine and cluster headaches. Methysergide blocks serotonin receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is used for prevention of migraine and cluster headaches. -adrenergic blockers and tricyclic antidepressants are used prophylactically for migraine headaches but are not effective for cluster headaches. 5. a. When the anxiety is related to a lack of knowledge about the etiology and treatment of a headache, helping the patient to identify stressful lifestyle patterns and other precipitating factors and ways of avoiding them are appropriate nursing interventions for the anxiety. Interventions that teach alternative therapies to supplement drug therapy also give the patient some control over pain and are appropriate teaching regarding treatment of the headache. The other interventions may help to reduce anxiety generally but they do not address the etiologic factor of the anxiety. 6. c. The unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) is able to obtain equipment from the supply cabinet or department. The RN may need to provide a list of necessary equipment and should set up the equipment and ensure proper functioning. The RN is responsible for the initial history and assessment as well as teaching the patient about the room's call system. Padded tongue blades are no longer used and no effort should be made to place anything in the patient's mouth during a seizure. 7. d. Generalized seizures have bilateral synchronous epileptic discharge affecting the entire brain at onset of the seizure. Loss of consciousness is also characteristic but many focal seizures also include an altered consciousness. Focal seizures begin in one side of the brain but may spread to involve the entire brain. Focal seizures that start with a local focus and spread to the entire brain, causing a secondary generalized seizure, are associated with a transient residual neurologic deficit postictally known as Todd's paralysis. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 441 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8. c. The typical absence seizure is also kno wn as petit mal and the child has staring spells that last for a few seconds. Atonic seizures occur when the patient falls from loss of muscle tone accompanied by brief unconsciousness. Simple focal seizures have focal motor, sensory, or autonomic symptoms related to the area of the brain involved without loss of consciousness. Staring spells in atypical absence seizures last longer than those in typical absence seizures and are accompanied by peculiar behavior during the seizure or confusion after the seizure. 9. c, d, f. Comple x focal seizures are psychomotor seizures with automatisms such as lip smacking. They cause altered consciousness or loss of consciousness producing a dreamlike state and may involve behavioral, emotional, or cognitive experiences without memory of what was done during the seizure. In generalized tonic-clonic seizures (previously known as grand mal seizures) there is loss of consciousness and stiffening of the body with subsequent jerking of extremities. Incontinence or tongue or cheek biting may also occur. 10. d. T onic-clonic status epilepticus is most dangerous because the continuous seizing can cause respiratory insufficiency, hypoxemia, cardiac dysrhythmia, hyperthermia, and systemic acidosis, which can all be fatal. Subclinical seizures may occur in a patient who is sedated, so there is no physical movement. Myoclonic seizures may occur in clusters and have a sudden, excessive jerk of the body that may hurl the person to the ground. Psychogenic seizures are psychiatric in origin and diagnosed with video- electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. They occur in patients with a history of emotional abuse or a specific traumatic episode. 11. c. A seizure is a paroxysmal, uncontrolled discharge of neurons in the brain, which interrupts normal function, but the factor that causes the abnormal firing is not clear. Seizures may be precipitated by many factors and although scar tissue may make the brain neurons more likely to fire, it is not the usual cause of seizures. Epilepsy is established only by a pattern of spontaneous, recurring seizures. 12. b . Most patients with seizure disorders maintain seizure control with medications but if surgery is considered, three requirements must be met: the diagnosis of epilepsy must be confirmed, there must have been an adequate trial with drug therapy without satisfactory results, and the electroclinical syndrome must be defined. The focal point must be localized but the presence of scar tissue is not required. 13. c. Serum le vels of antiseizure drugs are monitored regularly to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug, above which patients are likely to experience toxic effects and below which seizures are likely to occur. Many newer drugs do not require drug level monitoring because of large therapeutic ranges. A daily seizure log and urine testing for drug levels will not measure compliance or monitor for toxicity. EEGs have limited value in diagnosis of seizures and even less value in monitoring seizure control. 14. c. If antiseizure drugs are discontinued abruptly , seizures can be precipitated. Missed doses should be made up if the omission is remembered within 24 hours and patients should not adjust medications without professional guidance because this also can increase seizure frequency and may cause status epilepticus. Antiseizure drugs have numerous interactions with other drugs and the use of other medications should be evaluated by health professionals. If side effects occur, the physician should be notified and drug regimens evaluated. 15. a, b, c. The focus is on maintaining a patent airw ay and preventing patient injury. The nurse should not place objects in the patient's mouth or restrain the patient. 1 6. b . In the postictal phase of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, patients are usually very tired and may sleep for several hours and the nurse should allow the patient to sleep as long as necessary. Suctioning is performed only if needed and decreased level of consciousness is not a problem postictally unless a head injury has occurred during the seizure. 17. b . One of the most common complications of a seizure disorder is the effect it has on the patient's lifestyle. This is because of the social stigma attached to seizures, which causes patients to hide their diagnosis and to prefer not to be identified as having epilepsy. Medication regimens usually require only once- or twice-daily dosing and the major restrictions of lifestyle usually involve driving and high-risk environments. Job discrimination against the handicapped is prevented by federal and state laws and patients only need to identify their disease in case of medical emergencies. 18. c. Restless le gs syndrome that is not related to other pathologic processes, such as diabetes mellitus or rheumatic disorders, may be caused by a dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuits that use the neurotransmitter dopamine, which controls movements. Dopamine precursors and dopamine agonists, such as those used for parkinsonism, are effective in managing sensory and motor symptoms. Polysomnography studies during sleep are the only tests that have diagnostic value and although exercise should be encouraged, excessive leg exercise does not have an effect on the symptoms. 19. c. Huntington' s disease (HD) involves deficiency of acetylcholine and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the basal ganglia and extrapyramidal system that causes the opposite symptoms of parkinsonism. Myasthenia gravis involves autoimmune antibody destruction of cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. 20. a. Most patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) ha ve remissions and exacerbations of neurologic dysfunction or a relapsing-remitting initial course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus that progressively cause loss of motor, sensory, and cerebellar functions. Intellectual function generally remains intact but patients may experience anger, depression, or euphoria. A few people have chronic progressive deterioration and some may experience only occasional and mild symptoms for several years after onset. 21. c. Specif ic neurologic dysfunction of MS is caused by destruction of myelin and replacement with glial scar tissue at specific areas in the nervous system. Motor, sensory, cerebellar, and emotional dysfunctions, including paresthesias as well as patchy blindness, blurred vision, pain radiating along the dermatome of the nerve, ataxia, and severe fatigue, are the most common manifestations of MS. Constipation and bladder dysfunctions, short-term memory loss, sexual dysfunction, anger, and depression or euphoria may also occur. Excessive involuntary movements and tremors are not seen in MS.442 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 22. d. There is no specific diagnostic test for MS. A diagnosis is made primarily by history and clinical manifestations. Certain diagnostic tests may be used to help establish a diagnosis of MS. Positive findings on MRI include evidence of at least two inflammatory demyelinating lesions in at least two different locations within the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have increased immunoglobulin G and the presence of oligoclonal banding. Evoked potential responses are often delayed in persons with MS. 23. b. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) cannot be used for more than 2 to 3 years because it is an antineoplastic drug that causes cardiac toxicity, leukemia, and infertility. It is a monoclonal antibody given IV monthly when patients have inadequate responses to other drugs. It increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 24. c. The main goal in care of the patient with MS is to keep the patient active and maximally functional and promote self-care as much as possible to maintain independence. Assistive devices encourage independence while preserving the patient's energy. No care activity that the patient can do for himself or herself should be performed by others. Involvement of the family in the patient's care and maintenance of social interactions are also important but are not the priority in care. 25. b. Corticosteroids used in treating acute exacerbations of MS should not be abruptly stopped by the patient because adrenal insufficiency may result and prescribed tapering doses should be followed. Infections may exacerbate symptoms and should be avoided and high-protein diets with vitamin supplements are advocated. Long-term planning for increasing disability is also important. 26. d. The degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of midbrain and basal ganglia lead to this triad of signs. Muscle soreness, pain, and slowness of movement are patient function consequences related to rigidity. Shuffling gait, lack of postural stability, absent arm swing while walking, absent blinking, masked facial expression, and difficulty initiating movement are all related to bradykinesia. Impaired handwriting and hand activities are related to the tremor of Parkinson's disease (PD). 27. b. Although clinical manifestations are characteristic in PD, no laboratory or diagnostic tests are specific for the condition. A diagnosis is made when at least two of the three signs of the classic triad are present and it is confirmed with a positive response to antiparkinsonian medication. Research regarding the role of genetic testing and MRI to diagnose PD is ongoing. Essential tremors increase during voluntary movement whereas the tremors of PD are more prominent at rest. 28. c. The bradykinesia of PD prevents automatic movements and activities such as beginning to walk, rising from a chair, or even swallowing saliva cannot be executed unless they are consciously willed. Handwriting is affected by the tremor and results in the writing trailing off at the end of words. Specific limb weakness and muscle spasms are not characteristic of PD. 29. c. Peripheral dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier but its precursor, levodopa, is able to enter the brain, where it is converted to dopamine, increasing the supply that is deficient in PD. Other drugs used to treat PD include bromocriptine, which stimulates dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia, and amantadine, which blocks the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic neurons. Carbidopa is an agent that is usually administered with levodopa to prevent the levodopa from being metabolized in peripheral tissues before it can reach the brain. 30. c. The shuffling gait of PD causes the patient to be off balance and at risk for falling. Teaching the patient to use a wide stance with the feet apart, to lift the toes when walking, and to look ahead helps to promote a more balanced gait. Use of an elevated toilet seat and rocking from side to side will enable a patient to initiate movement. Canes and walkers are difficult for patients with PD to maneuver and may make the patient more prone to injury. 31. b. The reduction of the acetylcholine (ACh) effect in myasthenia gravis (MG) is treated with anticholinesterase drugs, which prolong the action of ACh at the neuromuscular synapse, but too much of these drugs will cause a cholinergic crisis with symptoms very similar to those of MG. To determine whether the patient's manifestations are due to a deficiency of ACh or to too much anticholinesterase drug, the anticholinesterase drug edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) is administered. If the patient is in cholinergic crisis, the patient's symptoms will worsen; if the patient is in a myasthenic crisis, the patient will improve. 32. c. The patient in myasthenic crisis has severe weakness and fatigability of all skeletal muscles, affecting the patient's ability to breathe, swallow, talk, and move. However, the priority of nursing care is monitoring and maintaining adequate ventilation. 33. b. In ALS there is gradual degeneration of motor neurons with extreme muscle wasting from lack of stimulation and use. However, cognitive function is not impaired and patients feel trapped in a dying body. Chorea manifested by writhing, involuntary movements is characteristic of HD. As an autosomal dominant genetic disease, HD also has a 50% chance of being passed to each offspring. 34. c. Many chronic neurologic diseases involve progressive deterioration in physical or mental capabilities and have no cure, with devastating results for patients and families. Health care providers can only attempt to alleviate physical symptoms, prevent complications, and assist patients in maximizing function and self-care abilities for as long as possible. Case Study 1. The cause of MS is unknown, although research findings suggest that MS is related to genetic susceptibility with precipitating factors including infectious, immunologic, and environmental factors. T cells are activated by some unknown factor and these T cells migrate to the CNS and cause a disruption in the blood-brain barrier. Subsequent antigen-antibody reaction within the CNS results in activation of the inflammatory response and through multiple mechanisms, demyelination of axons occurs. There is loss of myelin, disappearance of oligodendrocytes, and eventual damage to the underlying axon. The nerve impulse transmission is disrupted, resulting in permanent loss of nerve function. As inflammation subsides, glial scar formation replaces the damaged tissue, resulting in characteristic hard sclerotic plaque formation scattered through the CNS. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 443 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2. The risk f actors this patient has are being female between 20 and 50 years of age and being a European American from the northern United States. 3 . The role of precipitating f actors, such as exposure to pathogenic agents, in the etiology of MS is controversial. It is possible that their association with MS is random and that there is no cause-and-effect relationship. Possible precipitating factors for this patient include emotional stress, fatigue, pregnancy, and a poorer state of health. It is also possible that the viral neuritis was a precipitating factor. 4. Because there is no def initive diagnostic test for MS, diagnosis is based primarily on history and clinical manifestations. Although MRI can detect sclerotic plaques, her initial symptoms were so nonspecific and transient that a \"wait-and-see\" approach is often taken. The evidence of at least two plaques in the white matter seen with MRI and several attacks occurring support the current diagnosis of MS. 5. P atient teaching should focus on preventing exacerbations (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, trauma, immunization, delivery after pregnancy) or worsening of the disease. Building general resistance to illness, including avoiding fatigue, stress, extremes of heat and cold, and exposure to infection, is an important measure in maintaining general health. Vigorous and early treatment of infection is critical if it does occur. It is important to teach the patient to achieve a good balance of exercise and rest, minimize caffeine intake, and eat nutritious, well-balanced meals with roughage to avoid constipation. Patients should know their treatment regimens, side effects of medications, and drug interactions with over-the-counter medications. The patient should consult a health care provider before taking nonprescription medications. 6 . Because there is no cure for MS, treatment is aimed at slowing the disease process and providing individualized symptomatic relief. The disease process is treated with drugs and symptoms are controlled with a variety of medications and other forms of therapy. Immunomodulator drugs: Interferon -1b glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) are used to modify the disease progression and prevent relapses but the drugs are administered parenterally. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an immunomodulatory agent with antiinflammatory properties. The exact mechanism of action is unknown but may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. Immunosuppressant for aggressive MS: The antineoplastic drug mitoxantrone B macrophages. Sphingosine1-phosphate receptor modulator: Oral fingolimod (Gilenya) reduces the rate of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS but has serious side effects. Monoclonal antibody: Natalizumab (Tysabri) is used when patients have an inadequate response to other drugs. Corticosteroids: These are most helpful in treating acute exacerbations of MS by reducing edema and acute inflammation at the site of demyelination but the ultimate outcome is not affected. However, the potential benefits of these drugs in patients with MS need to be weighed against the potentially serious side effects. Physical therapy and speech therapy may also help to improve neurologic function. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Interrupted family processes related to shift in health status, potential financial problems, and fluctuating physical condition Ineffective self-health management related to knowledge deficit regarding management of MS Anxiety related to diagnosis of a chronic disabling illness Disturbed sensory perception: visual related to prolonged visual evoked potential in right eye Risk for impaired parenting related to fatigue and numbness and tingling on left side Collaborati ve problems: Potential complication: blindness, impaired ph ysical mobility, urinary incontinence CHAPTER 60 Answer Key 1. a, d, e. Manifestations of delirium include cogniti ve impairment with reduced awareness, reversed sleep/wake cycle, and distorted thinking and perception. The other options are characteristic of dementia. 2. d. The diagnosis of v ascular dementia can be aided by neuroimaging studies showing vascular brain lesions along with exclusion of other causes of dementia. Overproduction of -amyloid protein contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular dementia can be prevented or slowed by treating underlying diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease). Dementia caused by hepatic or renal encephalopathy potentially can be reversed. 3. a. Depression is often associated with AD, especially early in the disease when the patient has awareness of the diagnosis and the progression of the disease. When dementia and depression occur together, intellectual deterioration may be more extreme. Depression is treatable and use of antidepressants often improves cognitive function. 4 . c. The Mini-Mental State Examination is a tool to document the degree of cognitive impairment and it can be used to determine a baseline from which changes over time can be evaluated. It does not evaluate mood or thought processes but can detect dementia and delirium and differentiate these from psychiatric mental illness. It cannot help to determine etiology. 5. c. Hypoth yroidism can cause dementia but it is a treatable condition if it has not been long standing. The other conditions are causes of irreversible dementia. 6. d. In mild cogniti ve impairment people frequently forget people's names and begin to forget important events. Delirium changes usually occur abruptly. In Alzheimer's disease the patient may not remember knowing a person and loses the sense of time and which day it is. Normal forgetfulness includes momentarily forgetting names and occasionally forgetting to run an errand. 7. b . The only definitive diagnosis of AD can be made on examination of brain tissue during an autopsy but a clinical diagnosis is made when all other possible causes of dementia have been eliminated. Patients with AD may have -amyloid proteins in the blood, brain atrophy, or isoprostanes in the urine but these findings are not exclusive to those with AD.444 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8. c. In the moderate stage of AD, the patient may need help with getting dressed. In the severe stage, patients will be unable to dress or feed themselves and are usually incontinent. 9. b. Because there is no cure for AD, collaborative management is aimed at controlling the decline in cognition, controlling the undesirable manifestations that the patient may exhibit, and providing support for the family caregiver. Anticholinesterase agents help to increase acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain but a variety of other drugs are also used to control behavior. Memory-enhancing techniques have little or no effect in patients with AD, especially as the disease progresses. Patients with AD have limited ability to communicate health symptoms and problems, leading to a lack of professional attention for acute and other chronic illnesses. 10. c. Lorazepam (Ativan) is a benzodiazepine used to manage behavior with AD. Sertraline (Zoloft) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor depression. Donepzil (Aricept) is inhibitor used for decreased memory and cognition. Risperidone (Risperdal) is an antipsychotic used for behavior Memantine (Namenda) is the N-methyl-d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist frequently used for AD patients with decreased memory and cognition. Trazodone (Desyrel) is an atypical antidepressant that may help with sleep problems. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) is an antipsychotic medication used for behavior management. Rivastigmine (Exelon) is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for decreased memory and cognition. 12. b. Patients with moderate to severe AD frequently become agitated but because their short-term memory loss is so pronounced, distraction is a very good way to calm them. \"Why\" questions are upsetting to them because they don't know the answer and they cannot respond to normal relaxation techniques. 13. a, b, f. Avoiding trauma to the brain, treating depression early, and exercising regularly can maintain cognitive function. Staying socially active, avoiding intake of harmful substances, and challenging the brain to keep its connections active and create new ones also help to keep the brain healthy. 14. a. The risk of early-onset AD for the children of parents with it is 50%. Women do get AD more often than men but that is more likely related to women living longer than men than to the type of AD. ApoE gene testing is used for research with late-onset AD but does not predict who will develop the disease. Late-onset AD is more genetically complex than early-onset AD and is more common in those over age 60 but because his parent has early-onset AD he is at a 50% risk of getting it. 15. b. Adhering to a regular, consistent daily schedule helps the patient to avoid confusion and anxiety and is important both during hospitalization and at home. Clocks and calendars may be useful in early AD but they have little meaning to a patient as the disease progresses. Questioning the patient about activities and events they cannot remember is threatening and may cause severe anxiety. Maintaining a safe environment for the patient is important but does not change the disturbed thought processes. 16. b. Family caregiver role strain is characterized by such symptoms of stress as the inability to sleep, make decisions, or concentrate. It is frequently seen in family members who are responsible for the care of the patient with AD. Assessment of the caregiver may reveal a need for assistance to increase coping skills, effectively use community resources, or maintain social relationships. Eventually the demands on a caregiver exceed the resources and the person with AD may be placed in an institutional setting. 17. a. Adult day care is an option to provide respite for caregivers and a protective environment for the patient during the early and middle stages of AD. There are also in-home respite care providers. The respite from the demands of care allows the caregiver to maintain social contacts, perform normal tasks of living, and be more responsive to the patient's needs. Visits by home health nurses involve the caregiver and cannot provide adequate respite. Institutional placement is not always an acceptable option at earlier stages of AD, nor is hospitalization available for respite care. 18. b, e. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is diagnosed with dementia plus two of the following symptoms: (1) extrapyramidal signs such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability but not always a tremor, (2) fluctuating cognitive ability, and (3) hallucinations. The extrapyramidal signs plus tremors would more likely indicate Parkinson's disease. Disturbed behavior, sleep, personality, and eventually memory are characteristics of frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD). 19. a, b, d. All caregivers are responsible for the patient's safety. Basic care activities, such as those associated with personal hygiene and activities of daily living (ADLs) can be delegated to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP). The RN will perform ongoing assessments and develop and revise the plan of care as needed. The RN will assess the patient's safety risk factors, provide education, and make referrals. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) could check the patient's environment for potential safety hazards. 20. a. Age; b. infection; c. hypoxemia (lung disease); d. intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (change in environment, sensory overload); e. preexisting dementia; f. dehydration. Also: hyperthermia and potentially medications to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. 21. d. Delirium is an acute problem that usually has a rapid onset in response to a precipitating event, especially when the patient has underlying health problems, such as heart disease and sensory limitations. In the absence of prior cognitive impairment, a sudden onset of confusion, disorientation, and agitation is usually delirium. Delirium may manifest with both hypoactive and hyperactive symptoms. 22. c. Care of the patient with delirium is focused on identifying and eliminating precipitating factors if possible. Treatment of underlying medical conditions, changing environmental conditions, and discontinuing medications that induce delirium are important. Drug therapy is reserved for those patients with severe agitation because the drugs themselves may worsen delirium. 23. d. In the severe stage of AD, the patient is at a developmental level of 15 months or less; therefore appropriate distractions would be infant toys. Watching ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 445 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. TV and playing games are more appropriate in the mild stage. Books to read would need to be at developmentally appropriate levels to be used as a diversion. Case Study 1. The pathoph ysiology of AD includes cellular changes with neurofibrillary tangles with altered tau proteins and neuritic plaques containing -amyloid protein in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There is also a loss of the connections between neurons. 2. AD is diagnosed by e xclusion. When all other possible causes of mental impairment and persistence of dementia are ruled out, the diagnosis of AD remains. Brain atrophy and enlarged ventricles seen in some patients with AD are also seen in normal people and in other conditions. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to differentiate AD from other forms of dementia. Neuroimaging techniques detect changes earlier in the disease and can be used to monitor the response to therapy. Only on autopsy can AD be confirmed by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. 3. All functions of mental capacity and ability to care for oneself are lost as the disease progresses. There will be deterioration of personal hygiene and all ADLs, progression of psychotic symptoms now evidenced by his hallucinations, loss of long-term memory and recognition of his family, and loss of communication. 4. The nurse should assess what the wife is doing no w to manage his care, teach her about the expected progression of the disease, assist her in planning respite care or arranging for home health assistants, help her to identify problem areas, encourage her to keep G.D. awake and busy during the day so that he will sleep better at night and so will she, and refer her to community resources. 5. Community resources may include Alzheimer' s support groups, adult day care, home health assistants and home nursing, and various forms of assisted living and long-term care facilities. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Risk for injury related to impaired judgment (nighttime wandering) and sensory/perceptual alteration (hallucinations) Risk for other-directed violence related to misinterpretation of environmental stimuli Impaired memory related to effects of dementia Wandering related to cognitive impairment Disturbed sleep pattern related to circadian asynchrony Self-neglect related to cognitive impairment Collaborati ve problems: Potential complication: depression, psychosis 7. Nursing diagnoses: Anxiety related to erratic behavioral patterns and cognitive decline of husband Ineffective health maintenance related to fatigue and chronic stress Caregiver role strain related to grieving over the family member's illness Risk for other-directed violence (patient abuse) related to ineffective coping Collaborati ve problems: Potential complication: depression, illnessCHAPTER 61 Answer Key 1. a, d, e, f. Bell' s palsy affects the motor branches of the facial nerve. It is treated with corticosteroids, usually prednisone. Herpes simplex virus 1 may be a precipitating factor. Moist heat, gentle massage, electrical nerve stimulation, and exercises are prescribed. Care must be taken to protect the eye with sunglasses, artificial tears or gel, and possibly taping the eyelid closed at night. Oral hygiene is important but avoidance of hot foods is not needed. 2. a. The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is e xcruciating and it may occur in clusters that continue for hours. The condition is considered benign with no major effects except the pain. Corneal exposure is a problem in Bell's palsy or it may occur following surgery for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Maintenance of nutrition is important but not urgent because chewing may trigger trigeminal neuralgia and patients then avoid eating. Except during an attack, there is no change in facial appearance in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia and body image is more disturbed in response to the paralysis typical of Bell's palsy. 3. a. Although percutaneous radiofrequenc y rhizotomy and microvascular decompression provide the greatest relief of pain, glycerol rhizotomy causes less sensory loss and fewer sensory aberrations with comparable pain relief and less danger. Gamma knife radiosurgery provides precise high doses of radiation useful for persistent pain after other surgery. 4. c. Because attacks of trigeminal neuralgia may be precipitated by hot or cold air movement on the face, jarring movements, or talking, the environment should be of moderate temperature and free of drafts and patients should not be expected to converse during the acute period. Patients often prefer to carry out their own care because they are afraid someone else may inadvertently injure them or precipitate an attack. The nurse should stress that oral hygiene be performed because patients often avoid it but residual food in the mouth after eating occurs more frequently with Bell's palsy. 5. a. The most serious complication of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is respiratory failure and it is essential that respiratory rate and depth and vital capacity are monitored to detect involvement of the autonomic nerves that affect respiration. Corticosteroids may be used in treatment but do not appear to have an effect on the prognosis or duration of the disease. Rather, plasmapheresis or administration of high-dose immunoglobulin does result in shortening recovery time. The peripheral nerves of both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems are involved in the disease and may lead to orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, and abnormal vagal responses affecting the heart. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome may affect the lower brainstem and cranial nerves (CNs) VII, VI, III, XII, V , and X, affecting facial, eye, and swallowing functions. 6. c. As nerv e involvement ascends, it is very frightening for the patient but 85% to 95% of patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome recover completely with care, although 30% may have a residual weakness. Patients also recover if 446 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ventilatory support is provided during respiratory failure. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome affects only peripheral nerves and does not affect the brain. 7. a. Tetanus is transmitted through wound contamination, causes painful tonic spasms or seizures, and can be prevented with immunization. 8. a, b, d. Neurosyphilis occurs 10 to 20 years after syphilis is contracted and is inadequately treated; it affects any part of the nervous system and causes degenerative changes in the spinal cord and brainstem in the later stages. The other options describe botulism. 9. d. Spinal cord injuries are highest in adolescent and young adult men between the ages of 16 and 30 and those who are impulsive or risk takers in daily living. Other risk factors include alcohol and drug abuse as well as participation in sports and occupational exposure to trauma or violence. 10. b. At the C7 level, spinal shock is manifested by tetraplegia and sensory loss. The neurologic loss may be temporary or permanent. Paraplegia with sensory loss would occur at the level of T1. A hemiplegia occurs with central (brain) lesions affecting motor neurons and spastic tetraplegia occurs when spinal shock resolves. 11. a. In central cord syndrome, motor weakness and sensory loss are present in both upper and lower extremities, with upper extremities affected more than lower extremities. 12. b. Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome is characterized by ipsilateral loss of motor function and position and vibratory sense and vasomotor paralysis with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the injury. Damage to the most distal cord and nerve roots with flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs and areflexic bowel and bladder is seen with cauda equine syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome. Posterior cord syndrome is rare, with cord damage resulting in loss of proprioception below the lesion level but retention of motor control and temperature and pain sensation. Anterior cord syndrome is often caused by flexion injury, with acute compression of the cord resulting in complete motor paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of injury but touch, position, vibration, and motion remaining intact. 13. c. The primary injury of the spinal cord rarely affects the entire cord but the pathophysiology of secondary injury may result in damage that is the same as mechanical severance of the cord. Complete cord dissolution occurs through autodestruction of the cord by hemorrhage, edema, and the presence of metabolites and norepinephrine, resulting in anoxia and infarction of the cord. Edema resulting from the inflammatory response may compress the spinal cord as well as increase the damage as it extends above and below the injury site. 14. c. Spinal shock occurs in about half of all people with acute spinal cord injury. In spinal shock, the entire cord below the level of the lesion fails to function, resulting in a flaccid paralysis and hypomotility of most processes without any reflex activity. Return of reflex activity, although hyperreflexive and spastic, signals the end of spinal shock. Rehabilitation activities are not contraindicated during spinal shock and should be instituted if the patient's cardiopulmonary status is stable. Neurogenic shock results from loss of vascular tone caused by the injury and is manifested by hypotension, peripheral vasodilation, and decreased cardiac output (CO). Sympathetic function is impaired below the level of the injury because sympathetic nerves leave the spinal cord at the thoracic and lumbar areas and cranial parasympathetic nerves predominate in control over respirations, heart, and all vessels and organs below the injury, which includes autonomic functions. 15. b. Until the edema and necrosis at the site of the injury are resolved in 72 hours to 1 week after the injury, it is not possible to determine how much cord damage is present from the initial injury, how much secondary injury occurred, or how much the cord was damaged by edema that extended above the level of the original injury. The return of reflexes signals only the end of spinal shock and the reflexes may be inappropriate and excessive, causing spasms that complicate rehabilitation. 16. a. Spinal injury below C4 will result in diaphragmatic breathing and usually hypoventilation from decreased vital capacity and tidal volume from intercostal muscle impairment. The nurse's priority actions will be to monitor rate, rhythm, depth, and effort of breathing to observe for changes from the baseline and identify the need for ventilation assistance. Loss of all respiratory muscle function occurs above C4 and the patient requires mechanical ventilation to survive. Although the decreased sympathetic nervous system response (from injuries above T6) and GI hypomotility (paralytic ileus and gastric distention) will occur (with injuries above T5), they are not the patient's initial priority needs. 17. b. Neurogenic shock associated with cord injuries above the level of T6 greatly decreases the effect of the sympathetic nervous system and bradycardia and hypotension occur. A heart rate of 42 bpm is not adequate to meet the oxygen needs of the body. While low, the blood pressure is not at a critical point. The oxygen saturation is satisfactory and the motor and sensory losses are expected. 18. c. With the injury at T4, the highest-level realistic goal for this patient is to be able to be independent in self-care and wheelchair use because arm function will not be affected. Indoor mobility in a manual wheelchair will be achievable but it is not the highest-level goal. Ambulating with crutches and leg braces can be achieved only by patients with injuries in T6-12 area. Independent ambulation with short leg braces and canes could occur for a patient with an L3-4 injury. (See Table 61-4.) 19. d. Although surgical treatment of spinal cord injuries often depends on the preference of the health care provider, surgery is usually indicated when there is continued compression of the cord by extrinsic forces or when there is evidence of cord compression. Other indications may include progressive neurologic deficit, compound fracture of the vertebra, bony fragments, and penetrating wounds of the cord. 20. a. The need for a patent airway is the first priority for any injured patient and a high cervical injury may decrease the gag reflex and the ability to maintain an airway as well as the ability to breathe. Maintaining cervical stability is then a consideration, along with assessing for other injuries and the patient's neurologic status. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 447 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 21. c. The de velopment of better surgical stabilization has made surgery the more frequent treatment of cervical injuries. However, when surgery cannot be done, skeletal traction with the use of Crutchfield, Vinke, or other types of skull tongs is required to immobilize the cervical vertebrae, even if a fracture has not occurred. Hard cervical collars or a sternal-occipital-mandibular immobilizer brace may be used after cervical stabilization surgery or for minor injuries or stabilization during emergency transport of the patient. Sandbags may also be used temporarily to stabilize the neck during insertion of tongs or during diagnostic testing immediately following the injury. Special turning or kinetic beds may be used to turn and mobilize patients who are in cervical traction. 22. c. Dopamine is a v asopressor that is used to maintain blood pressure during states of hypotension that occur during neurogenic shock associated with spinal cord injury. Atropine would be used to treat bradycardia. The temperature reflects some degree of poikilothermism but this is not treated with medications. 23. c. Because pneumonia and atelectasis are potential problems related to ineffective coughing and the loss of intercostal and abdominal muscle function, the nurse should assess the patient's breath sounds and respiratory function to determine whether secretions are being retained or whether there is progression of respiratory impairment. Suctioning is not indicated unless lung sounds indicate retained secretions. Position changes will help to mobilize secretions. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are used if the patient becomes exhausted from labored breathing or if arterial blood gases (ABGs) deteriorate. 24. d. During the f irst 2 to 3 days after a spinal cord injury, paralytic ileus may occur and nasogastric suction must be used to remove secretions and gas from the GI tract until peristalsis resumes. IV fluids are used to maintain fluid balance but do not specifically relate to paralytic ileus. Tube feedings would be used only for patients who have difficulty swallowing and not until peristalsis returns. Parenteral nutrition would be used only if the paralytic ileus was unusually prolonged. 25. a. During the acute phase of spinal cord injury , the bladder is hypotonic, causing urinary retention with the risk for reflux into the kidney or rupture of the bladder. An indwelling catheter is used to keep the bladder empty and to monitor urinary output. Intermittent catheterization or other urinary drainage methods may be used in long-term bladder management. Use of incontinent pads is inappropriate because they do not help the bladder to empty. 26. b . When spinal shock ends, reflex movement and spasms will occur, which may be mistaken for return of function; however, with the resolution of edema, some normal function may also occur. It is important when movement occurs to determine whether the movement is voluntary and can be consciously controlled, which would indicate some return of function. 27. a. 5; b . 2; c. 6; d. 3; e. 1; f. 4. The patient is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia. The initial response by the nurse should be to elevate the head of bed (HOB) to decrease blood pressure (BP) and then to remove noxious stimulation. Frequently the trigger is bladder distention, which can be dealt with quickly. The physician needs to be notified as soon as possible and, depending on the communication system available to the nurse, he or she should have the call placed. Meanwhile, the nurse should stay with the patient and loosen any restrictive clothing. The physician may order an antihypertensive and documentation should be an accurate and thorough description of the entire episode. 28. b . Intermittent self-catheterization five to six times a day is the recommended method of bladder management for the patient with a spinal cord injury and reflexic neurogenic bladder because it more closely mimics normal emptying and has less potential for infection. The patient and family should be taught the procedure using clean technique and if the patient has use of the arms, self-catheterization should be performed. Indwelling catheterization is used during the acute phase to prevent overdistention of the bladder and surgical urinary diversions are used if urinary complications occur. 29. d. Most patients with a complete lo wer motor neuron lesion are unable to have either psychogenic or reflexogenic erections and alternative methods of obtaining sexual satisfaction may be suggested. Patients with incomplete lower motor neuron lesions have the highest possibility of successful psychogenic erections with ejaculation whereas patients with incomplete upper motor neuron lesions are more likely to experience reflexogenic erections with ejaculation. Patients with complete upper motor neuron lesions usually have only reflex sexual function with rare ejaculation. 30. a. W orking through the grief process is a lifelong process that is triggered by new experiences, such as marriage, child rearing, employment, or illness, which the patient must adjust to throughout life within the context of his or her disability. The goal of recovery is related to adjustment rather than acceptance and many patients do not experience all components of the grief process. During the anger phase, patients should be allowed outbursts and the nurse may use humor to displace some of the patient's anger. 31. b . Most metastatic or secondary tumors are extradural lesions in which treatment, including surgery, is palliative. Primary spinal tumors may be removed with the goal of cure. Most tumors of the spinal cord are slow-growing, do not cause autodestruction, and, if removal is possible, can have complete function restored. Radiation is used to treat metastatic tumors that are sensitive to radiation and that have caused only minor neurologic deficits in the patient. Radiation is also used as adjuvant therapy to surgery for intramedullary tumors. Case Study 1. S.M. is e xperiencing central cord syndrome of the cervical cord, which is an incomplete spinal cord injury with compression on anterior horn cells. It usually occurs as a result of hyperextension. 2. The cell bodies of lo wer motor neurons, which send axons to innervate the skeletal muscles of arms, trunk, and legs, are located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The cervical segments of the spinal cord contain the lower 448 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. motor neurons for the arms. A cervical injury that affects the anterior horn will affect the arms to a greater extent than it affects the legs. 3. Injury to the cord may occur without fracture of the vertebrae, with traumatic twisting or stretching of the cord. The response to the trauma includes secondary injury leading to edema, hemorrhage, and ischemia of the cord, impairing function. 4. High doses of methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury have been found to significantly improve motor function and sensation in patients with incomplete as well as complete spinal cord injuries. It blocks lipid peroxidation by-products and is thought to improve blood flow and reduce edema in the spinal cord. 5. Shock and denial are common first reactions to the loss of function with spinal cord injuries, followed by anger and depression. During the acute phase, S.M. will probably have unrealistic expectations concerning her recovery, sleep a lot, and withdraw. It is best to explain the injury, provide honest information, and encourage the patient's recovery. As S.M. progresses, she will become angry and refuse to discuss her limitations. It is important for her to participate in self-care and the nurse should support family members and allow patient outbursts. Assist her through depression by encouraging family involvement and use of resources in planning graded rehabilitation steps to give S.M. success, avoid sympathy, and use kind firmness. Altered body image will be a big problem because she will see herself as different from her peers, an important developmental issue during adolescence. 6. Intensive rehabilitation that focuses on refined retraining physiologic function of her limbs should be planned and will involve much physical therapy over time. S.M. should be mobilized as quickly as appropriate to prevent hazards of immobility and to encourage her in her progress. Balance support systems to encourage independence, set goals with patient input, and emphasize potentials. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Impaired physical mobility related to spinal cord injury and prescribed bed rest Risk for disuse syndrome related to immobilization Self-care deficit: feeding, bathing, and grooming related to upper extremity weakness Risk for injury related to sensory deficit and lack of self-protective abilities Ineffective coping related to loss of control over body Collaborative problems: Potential complications: progression of lesion, hypoventilation, spinal shock, skin lesions CHAPTER 62 Answer Key 1. a. Epiphysis; b. diaphysis; c. articular cartilage; h. cavity; i. yellow marrow; periosteum Periosteum; b. canaliculi; c. blood vessels; d. osteon 3. a. cavity i. blood vessel; j. synovial membrane; k. bone 4. c. Osteoblasts form bone. Osteocytes are mature bone cells. Osteoclasts are responsible for the resorption of bone. A sarcomere is the contractile unit of myofibrils. 5. b. Atrophy is when the muscle size decreases. Hyaline is the most common type of cartilage tissue. Isometric is a muscle contraction that produces hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is the increase in the size of cells causing an increase in the organ. 6. d. A loss of elasticity in cartilage, ligaments, and tendons increases rigidity in the neck, shoulders, back, hips, and knees of older patients. Actin (thin) filaments and myosin (thick) filaments make up the contractile unit of the myofibrils, which decrease in strength with lack of use. Fascia is connective tissue that can withstand limited stretching. 7. d. Periosteum is the fibrous connective tissue covering bone. Synovium is the lining of a joint capsule. Striated is a characteristic of skeletal muscle. Hyaline is the most common type of cartilage. 8. a. The function of the tendon is to attach muscle to bone. The ligament attaches bone to bone at the joint. Fascia encloses individual muscles but does not connect cartilage to muscle in joints. The bursae are lined with a synovial membrane and are located in joints to relieve pressure and decrease friction between moving parts. 9. a, c, e, f. Abduction is moving the part away from the midline of the body and adduction is moving the part toward the midline of the body. These movements can be done with the hip, wrist, thumb, and shoulder. The knee and elbow move with flexion and extension. 10. d. Loss of water from discs between vertebrae, vertebral disc compression, and narrowing of intervertebral spaces all contribute to a loss of height in the older adult. Although bone density decreases and cartilage is lost from joints, these do not affect the long bones or the height of the person. 11. d. Loss of muscle mass and strength, decreased motor neurons, limited movement because of joint changes, and less flexible tendons and ligaments all contribute to the older adult's risk for falls. Although rest and nutrients are important, fatigue and a high risk for impaired skin integrity are not directly related to changes associated with aging in the musculoskeletal system. Being overweight will increase stress on joints. Providing all care only contributes to weakening of muscles and decreased independence. 12. a. Corticosteroids cause protein catabolism with skeletal muscle wasting and increased osteoclast activity with loss of bone mass, which can have a marked detrimental effect on mobility and activity. Potassium-depleting diuretics may cause hypokalemia, which is associated with muscle weakness and cramps. Oral hypoglycemic drugs and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not known to affect the musculoskeletal system.

Muscle strength is graded on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 = no detection of muscle contraction and 5 = active movement against full resistance without evident fatigue (normal). Active movement against gravity and some resistance = 4. 15. b . There is no indication to measure the length of limbs during assessment unless a gait disturbance or limb length discrepancy is noted and then the limb should be measured between two bony prominences and compared with the measurement of the other extremity. Muscle mass measurement and joint movement may affect gait but differences in limb length will always affect gait. Palpating for crepitus will identify friction between bones, usually at joints. 16. c. A goniometer is a protractor de vice that measures the angle of joints and can be used to determine specific degrees of joint range of motion (ROM). It is used when a specific musculoskeletal problem that affects ROM has been identified. 17. b . Scoliosis is a lateral \"S\" curve of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Kyphosis is an exaggerated forward an exaggerated lumbar curvature or swayback. Ankylosis is fixation of a joint. 18. c. A contracture is shortening of a muscle or lig ament that causes resistance of movement. A fluid-filled cyst is a ganglion cyst. Generalized muscle pain is myalgia. Crepitation is a grating sensation between bones with movement. 19. d. T orticollis is the neck twisted in an unusual position to one side, so the nurse should provide enough pillows to support the patient's head comfortably. An immobilizer to hold bones in place may be used with dislocation or for a joint with subluxation. Pillows to support the knees while sleeping may be done for valgum or varum deformities or for any patient's comfort. Exercises to increase or maintain muscle strength and maintain ROM are appropriate for most patients. 20. c. Plantar f asciitis presents as burning sharp pain at the sole of the foot that is worse in the morning. Pes planus is abnormal flatness of the sole and arch of the foot. Tenosynovitis is pain along a tendon sheath. Muscle atrophy presents as flabby-appearing muscle leading to decreased function and tone. 21. d. Steppage g ait uses increased hip and knee flexion in order to clear the foot from the floor and then the foot slaps down on the walking surface. Ataxic gait is a staggering, uncoordinated gait, often with a sway. Spastic gait has short steps with dragging of the foot in a jerky cross-knee movement. Antalgic gait is a shorted stride with as little weight bearing as possible on the painful side. 22. c. A standard x-ray e valuates structural or functional changes of bones and joints and can determine density of bone. Myelogram is a sensitive test for nerve impingement and can detect very subtle lesions and injuries. Arthroscopy is used to visualize, diagnose, or repair joint problems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to view soft tissue. 23. d. Dual ener gy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures bone mass of spine, femur, forearm, and total body and is used to diagnose and monitor changes in bone density with treatment. Bone scan is done with the injection of a radioisotope that is taken up by the bone to identify osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, and primary and metastatic malignant lesions. A diskogram is an x-ray with contrast media to evaluate intervertebral disc abnormalities. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) evaluates density, elasticity, and strength of bone, which is commonly assessed at the calcaneus (heel). 24. c, d, e. Increases in rheumatoid f actor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as well as depletion of complement, total hemolytic, and 450 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 may occur in rheumatoid arthritis. Uric acid may be elevated in gout. Anti-DNA antibody is the most specific test for systemic lupus erythematosus. CHAPTER 63 Answer Key 1. d. Almost all older adults have some degree of decreased muscle strength, joint stiffness, and pain with motion. The use of mild antiinflammatory agents decreases inflammation and pain and can help the patient to maintain activity and prevent further deconditioning but other prescribed drugs and potential abdominal problems must be considered by the patient. Musculoskeletal problems in the older adult can be prevented with appropriate strategies, especially exercise. Stair walking can create enough stress on fragile bones to cause a hip fracture and use of ramps may help to prevent falls. Walkers and canes should be used as necessary to decrease stress on joints so that activity can be maintained. 2. c. Warm-up exercises \"prelengthen\" potentially strained tissues by avoiding the quick stretch often encountered in sports and also increase the temperature of muscle, resulting in increased speed of cell metabolism, increased speed of nerve impulses, and improved oxygenation of muscle fibers. Stretching is also thought to improve kinesthetic awareness, lessening the chance of uncoordinated movement. Muscle strength is not a key factor in soft tissue injuries and taping or wrapping joints may actually predispose a person to injury by weakening the joint, unless a previous injury is being treated. 3. b. An avulsion fracture occurs when a ligament pulls a bone fragment loose, with pain similar to a sprain. A fracture with two or more fragments is a comminuted fracture. It is a spiral fracture when it is twisted around a bone shaft. It is a transverse fracture when the line of fracture is at right angles to the longitudinal axis. 4. c. A pathologic fracture is a spontaneous fracture at the site of bone disease, such as osteoporosis. An open fracture is when there is communication with the external environment. The oblique fracture has a slanted fracture line. A greenstick fracture is splintered on one side and the other side is bent. 5. d. Carpal tunnel syndrome would be expected related to the continuous wrist movements. Injuries of the menisci, which are fibrocartilage in the knee, are common with athletes. Radial-ulnar fractures are seen with great force such as a car accident or a fall. Rotator cuff injuries occur with sudden adduction forces applied to the cuff while the arm is held in abduction. They are commonly seen with repetitive overhead motions. 6. c. Bursitis is inflammation of synovial membrane sac at friction sites. Tearing of a ligament is a sprain. Stretching of muscle and fascia sheath is a strain. Incomplete separation of articular surfaces of joints caused by ligament injury is subluxation. 7. b. Application of cold, compression, and elevation are indicated to prevent edema resulting from sprain and some strain injuries. Muscle spasms are usually treated with heat applications and massage and repetitive strain injuries require cessation of the precipitating activity and physical therapy. Dislocations or subluxations require immediate reduction and immobilization to prevent vascular impairment and bone cell death. 8. a, b, c, e. Consider the principle of RICE. Rest: movement should be restricted. Ice: cold should be used to promote vasoconstriction and to reduce edema. C: compression helps to decrease swelling. E: elevate the extremity above the level of the heart. Mild nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be needed to manage pain. Warm, moist compresses may be used after 48 hours for 20 to 30 minutes at a time to reduce swelling and provide comfort. 9. a. Ossification is the stage of fracture healing when there is clinical union and enough strength to prevent movement at the fracture site. Remodeling is the normal function of the bone. Consolidation is when the distance between bone fragments eventually closes and radiologic union first occurs. The callus formation stage appears by the end of the second week of injury when minerals and new bone matrix are deposited in the osteoid that is produced in the granulation tissue stage. 10. a, b, c, e. When the remodeling stage of healing occurs, radiologic union is present. Excess callus is reabsorbed, trabecular bone is laid, and the bone returns to its preinjury structure strength and shape. The osteoblasts and osteoclasts function normally in response to stress. The fracture hematoma stage is when the hematoma at the ends of the fragments becomes a semisolid blood clot. There is an unorganized network of bone composed of cartilage, osteoblasts, calcium, and phosphorus woven around fracture parts in the callus formation stage. 11. b. Deformity is the cardinal sign of fracture but may not be apparent in all fractures. Other supporting signs include edema and swelling, localized pain and tenderness, muscle spasm, ecchymosis, loss of function, crepitation, and an inability to bear weight. 12. a. A malunion occurs when the bone heals in the expected time but in an unsatisfactory position, possibly resulting in deformity or dysfunction. Nonunion occurs when the fracture fails to heal properly despite treatment and delayed union is healing of the fracture at a slower rate than expected. In posttraumatic osteoporosis, the loss of bone substances occurs as a result of immobilization. 13. a. Open reduction uses a surgical incision to correct bone alignment but infection is the main disadvantage, as well as anesthesia complications or the effect of preexisting medical conditions. Skin irritation and nerve impairment is most likely with skin traction. Prolonged immobility is possible with skeletal traction. 14. d. Complaints of abdominal pain or pressure, nausea, and vomiting are signs of cast syndrome that occur when hip spica casts or body jacket braces are applied too tightly, causing compression of the superior mesenteric artery against the duodenum. The cast may need to be split or removed and the health care provider should be notified. Elevation is not indicated for a spica cast and the patient with a spica cast should not be placed in the prone position during the initial drying stage because the cast is so large and heavy it may break. A cast should never be covered with a blanket because heat builds up in the cast and may increase edema. 15. b. Infection is the greatest risk with an open fracture and all open fractures are considered contaminated. Tetanus ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 451 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. prevention is always indicated if the patient has not been immunized or does not have current boosters. Prophylactic antibiotics are often used in management of open fractures but recent antibiotic therapy is not relevant, nor is previous injury to the site. 16. d. Pulses, sensation, and motor function distal to the injury should be checked before and after splinting to assess for nerve or vascular damage and documented to avoid doubts about whether a problem discovered later was missed during the original examination or was caused by the treatment. Elevation of the limb and application of ice should be instituted after the extremity is splinted. 17. b . Neurologic assessment includes evaluation of motor and sensory function and, in the upper extremity, includes abduction and adduction of the fingers, opposition of the fingers, and supination and pronation of the hands. It also includes sensory perception in the fingers. Evaluation of the feet would occur in lower extremity injuries. Assessment of color, temperature, capillary refill, peripheral pulses, and edema evaluates vascular status. 18. b . A patient with any type of cast should exercise the joints above and below the cast frequently and moving the fingers frequently will improve circulation and help to prevent edema. Unlike plaster casts, thermoplastic resin or fiberglass casts are relatively waterproof and, if they become wet, can be dried with a hair dryer on low setting. Tape petals are used on plaster casts to protect the edges from breaking and crumbling but are not necessary for synthetic casts. After the cast is applied, the extremity should be elevated at about the level of the heart to promote venous return and ice may be used to prevent edema. 19. c. P ain that is distal to the injury and is unrelieved by opioid analgesics is the earliest sign of compartment syndrome. Paralysis and absence of peripheral pulses will eventually occur if it is not treated but these are late signs that often appear after permanent damage has occurred. The overlying skin may appear normal because the surface vessels are not occluded. 20. a. Soft tissue edema in the area of the injury may cause an increase of pressure within the closed spaces of the tissue compartments formed by the nonelastic fascia, creating compartment syndrome. If symptoms occur, it may be necessary to incise the fascia surgically, a procedure known as a fasciotomy. Amputation is usually necessary only if the limb becomes septic because of untreated compartment syndrome. 21. c. The fractured humerus may cause radial nerv e and brachial artery damage and it may be reduced nonsurgically with a hanging arm cast. A fractured tibia and femoral shaft are in the leg. The Colles' fracture is in the wrist and manifests with pronounced swelling and obvious deformity of the wrist; it is treated with closed manipulation and immobilization. 22. c. A Colles' fracture most often occurs in patients o ver 50 years of age with osteoporosis and frequently when the patient attempts to break a fall with an outstretched arm and hand. Dislocation is the complete separation of articular surfaces of the joint caused by a ligament injury. Open fracture is when there is communication with the external environment. A fracture is incomplete if only part of the bone shaft is fractured and the bone is still in one piece. 23. a, c. Airw ay patency and cervical spinal cord injury are the emergency considerations with facial fractures. Oral examination and cranial nerve assessment will be done after the patient is stabilized. Immobilization of the jaw is done surgically for a mandibular fracture. 24. b . The spine should be kept straight by turning the shoulders and hips together (logrolling). This keeps the spine in good alignment until union has been accomplished. Bed rest may be required for a short time but not until the pain is gone. Analgesics should be taken only as ordered. If they do not relieve the pain, the health care provider should be notified. Bone cement is used by the surgeon to stabilize vertebral compression fractures. 25. a. Initial manifestations of f at embolism usually occur 24 to 48 hours after injury and are associated with fractures of long bones and multiple fractures related to pelvic injuries, including fractures of the femur, tibia, ribs, and pelvis. 26. c. P atients with fractures are at risk for both fat embolism and pulmonary embolism from venous thromboembolism but there is a difference in the time of occurrence, with fat embolism occurring shortly after the injury and thrombotic embolism occurring several days after immobilization. They both may cause pulmonary symptoms of chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, apprehension, tachycardia, and cyanosis. However, fat embolism may cause petechiae located around the neck, anterior chest wall, axilla, buccal membrane of the mouth, and conjunctiva of the eye, which differentiates it from thrombotic embolism. 27. a. A hip prosthesis is usually used for intracapsular fractures. The other options are all extracapsular fractures. 28. d. The classic signs of a hip fracture are shortening of the leg and external rotation accompanied by severe pain at the fracture site and additional injury could be caused by weight bearing on the extremity. The patient may not be able to move the hip or the knee but movement in the ankle and toes is not affected. 2 9. c. Although sur gical repair is the preferred method of managing intracapsular and extracapsular hip fractures, initially patients frequently may be treated with skin traction, such as Buck's traction or Russell's traction, to immobilize the limb temporarily and to relieve the painful muscle spasms before surgery is performed. Prolonged traction would be required to reduce the fracture or immobilize it for healing, creating a very high risk for complications of immobility. 30. a. Because the fracture site is internally f ixed with pins or plates, the fracture site is stable and the patient is moved from the bed to the chair on the first postoperative day. Ambulation begins on the first or second postoperative day without weight bearing on the affected leg. Weight bearing on the affected extremity is usually restricted for 6 to 12 weeks until adequate healing is evident on x-ray. The patient may be positioned on the operative side following internal fixation and abductor pillows are used for patients who have total hip replacements. 3 1. d. P atients with hip prostheses with a posterior approach must avoid extreme flexion, adduction, or internal rotation for at least 6 weeks to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. Gradual weight bearing on the limb is allowed and ambulation should be encouraged. The leg should be not be externally rotated. 32. c. The lo w-bulk, high-carbohydrate liquid diet and intake of air through a straw required during mandibular fixation often lead to constipation and flatus, which may be relieved 452 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. with bulk-forming laxatives, prune juice, or ambulation. Wires or rubber bands should be cut only in the case of cardiac or respiratory arrest and patients should be taught to clear their mouth of vomitus or secretions. The mouth should be thoroughly cleaned with water, saline, or alkaline mouthwashes or using a Water Pik as necessary to remove food debris. Hard candy should not be held in the mouth. 33. c. The compression dressing or bandage supports the soft tissues, reduces edema, hastens healing, minimizes pain, and promotes residual limb shrinkage. If the dressing is left off, edema will form quickly and may delay rehabilitation. Elevation and ice will not be as effective at preventing the edema that will form. Dressing the incision with dry gauze will not provide the benefits of a compression dressing. 34. b. Phantom sensation or phantom pain may occur following amputation, especially if pain was present in the affected limb preoperatively. The pain is a real sensation to the patient and will first be treated with analgesics and other pain interventions (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], mirror therapy, acupuncture). As recovery and ambulation progress, phantom limb sensation usually subsides. 35. a. Because the device covers the residual limb, the surgical site cannot be directly seen and postoperative hemorrhage is not apparent on dressings, requiring vigilant assessment of vital signs for signs of bleeding. Elevation of the residual limb with an immediate prosthetic fitting is not necessary because the device itself prevents edema formation. Exercises to the leg are not performed in the immediate postoperative period to avoid disruption of ligatures and the suture line. 36. a. Flexion contractures, especially of the hip, may be debilitating and delay rehabilitation of the patient with a leg amputation. To prevent hip flexion, the patient should avoid sitting in a chair with the hips flexed or having pillows under the surgical extremity for prolonged periods and the patient should lie on the abdomen for 30 minutes three to four times a day to extend the hip. 37. a. Skin breakdown on the residual limb can prevent the use of a prosthesis so the limb should be inspected every day for signs of irritation or pressure areas. No substances except water and mild soap should be used on the residual limb and range-of-motion (ROM) exercises are not necessary when the patient is using a prosthesis. A residual limb shrinker is an elastic stocking that is used to mold the limb in preparation for prosthesis use but a cotton residual limb sock is worn with the prosthesis. 38. c. Debridement removes degenerative tissue from joints. Osteotomy corrects bone deformity by removal of a wedge or slice of bone. Arthrodesis surgically fuses a joint to relieve pain. Synovectomy removes tissue involved in joint destruction from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 39. c. An arthroplasty is reconstruction or replacement of a joint to relieve pain and correct deformity, especially with osteoarthritis, RA, avascular necrosis, congenital deformities, or dislocations. Arthrodesis is the surgical fusion of a joint to relieve pain. An osteotomy removes a wedge of bone to correct a bone deformity. Synovectomy is used in RA to remove the tissue involved in joint destruction. 40. d. Physical therapy is initiated on the first postoperative day with ambulation and weight bearing using a walker for a patient with a cemented prosthesis and non-weight bearing on the operative side for an uncemented prosthesis. In addition, the patient sits in the chair at least twice a day and is turned to both sides and back with the operative leg supported. 41. b. Following a total hip arthroplasty with a posterior approach, during hospitalization an abduction pillow is placed between the legs to maintain abduction and the leg is extended. Extremes of internal rotation, adduction, and 90-degree flexion of the hip must be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. 42. b. Continuous passive motion machines are frequently used following knee surgery to promote earlier joint mobility. Because joint dislocation is not a problem with knee replacements, early exercise with straight leg raises and gentle ROM is also encouraged postoperatively. 43. b. Neurovascular checks of the fingers following surgery of the hands are essential to detect compromised vascular and neurologic function caused by trauma or edema. Postoperatively, the hands are elevated with a bulky dressing in place and when the dressing is removed, a guided splinting program is started. Exercises are performed three to four times a day when the splints are removed and the patient is discharged. Before surgery, it must be made clear to the patient that the goal of the surgery is to restore function related to grasp, pinch, stability, and strength and the hands will not necessarily have good cosmetic appearance. 44. d. The patient with a tight cast may be at risk for neurovascular compromise (impaired circulation and peripheral nerve damage) and should be assessed first. The other patients should be seen as soon as possible. Providing analgesia for the patient with phantom pain would be the next priority. The patient in skeletal traction needs explanation of the purpose and functioning of the traction. She may need analgesia or muscle relaxants to help tolerate the traction. Case Study 1. The knee and ankle should be immobilized with a splint. Unless the joints above and below the site are immobilized, the affected area is unstable. 2. The 6 Ps\u2014pulses, paresthesias, pallor, pressure, paralysis, and pain\u2014should be assessed, especially unrelieved pain, which may indicate compartment syndrome. 3. The wound should be cleaned with extensive irrigation using normal saline and if the wound is highly contaminated, surgical debridement may be necessary. Tetanus immunization is required if a dose of tetanus toxoid has not been given in the past 5 to 10 years. If the patient has had fewer than three doses of toxoid, then tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) are recommended. Bleeding should be controlled with sterile dressings. 4. Measures to relieve pain include elevating the limb and applying ice to decrease swelling, administering analgesics, and keeping the limb immobilized. 5. It can take up to 1 year for complete healing of the fracture but ossification should take place in 3 weeks to 6 months. The limb can be casted and H.A. can be mobile with crutches with no weight bearing on the affected limb. Weight bearing will be restricted for 6 to 12 weeks, depending on the rate of healing. His return to work will depend on how he is able to perform on crutches. 6. The RN can delegate to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) positioning (position the casted leg above heart ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 453 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. level); applying ice as directed by the RN; maintaining body position; assisting the patient with passive and active ROM exercises; and notifying the RN about patient complaints of pain, tingling, or decreased sensation in the right leg. 7. H.A. 's wife should be called, informed of her husband's accident, and told that he is alert and oriented but has a fractured leg and will require hospitalization. Care should be taken not to panic her and to reassure her that his condition is stable. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to edema and muscle spasms Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to vascular insufficiency and nerve compression secondary to edema Risk for infection related to disruption of skin integrity and presence of environmental pathogens Anxiety related to unknown outcome and restrictions Readiness for enhanced self-health management related to questions about activity restrictions Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: f at embolism, compartment syndrome, infection, malunion or nonunion CHAPTER 64 Answer Key 1. b . Chronic infection of the bone leads to formation of scar tissue from the granulation tissue. This avascular scar tissue provides an ideal site for continued microorganism growth and is impenetrable to antibiotics. Surgical debridement is often necessary to remove the poorly vascularized tissue and dead bone and to instill antibiotics directly to the area. Involucrum is new bone laid down at the infection site, which seals off areas of sequestra. Antibiotics can be effective during acute osteomyelitis and prevention of chronic osteomyelitis requires early antibiotic treatment. Bone and skin grafting may be necessary following surgical removal of infection if destruction is extensive. 2. b . The patient with osteomyelitis is at risk for pathologic fractures at the site of the infection because of weakened, devitalized bone and careful handling of the extremity is necessary. Careful handling of dressings is necessary to prevent the spread of infection to others but is not related to preventing injury to this patient. Splints may be used to immobilize the limb, range-of-motion (ROM) exercises will be limited because of the possibility of spreading infection, and edema is not a common finding in osteomyelitis. 3. c. Because lar ge doses of appropriate antibiotics are necessary in the treatment of acute osteomyelitis, it is important to identify the causative microorganism. The definitive way to determine the causative agent is by bone biopsy or biopsy of the soft tissue surrounding the site. The other tests may help to establish the diagnosis but do not identify the causative agent. 4. c. Acti vities such as exercise or heat application, which increase circulation and serve as stimuli for the spread of infection, should be avoided by patients with acute osteomyelitis. Oral or IV antibiotic therapy is continued at home for 4 to 6 weeks, weight bearing is contraindicated to prevent pathologic fractures, and notification of the health care provider if increased pain occurs is necessary. 5 . b . One of the most common adverse effects of prolonged and high-dose antibiotic therapy is overgrowth of Candida albicans in the oral cavity and genitourinary tract. These infections are manifested by whitish-yellow, curdlike lesions of the mucosa. A dry, cracked, furrowed tongue is characteristic of severe dehydration and vesicles are characteristic of herpes simplex infections. Mouth and lip ulcers are characteristic of aphthous somatitis, or canker sores. 6 . d. Osteochondroma is a benign o vergrowth of bone and cartilage near the end of the bone at the growth plate, especially in long bones, pelvis, or scapula. It may transform to a malignant form. Osteoclastoma is a benign bone tumor with a high rate of recurrence, but does not become malignant. Endochroma is benign but is an intramedullary cartilage tumor found in a cavity of a single hand or foot bone. Ewing's sarcoma develops in the medullary cavity of long bones, especially the femur, humerus, pelvis, and tibia. 7. b . Osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone cancer, occurs in the metaphyseal region of long bones of the arms, legs, or pelvis. It is extremely malignant and metastasizes early and is often brought to attention by injury. A high rate of local recurrence occurs with osteoclastoma that arises in cancellous ends of long bones. Ewing's sarcoma develops in the medullary cavity of long bones as above. 8. b . Promotion of muscle activity is important in any patient with muscular dystrophy but when the disease has progressed to cardiomyopathy or respiratory failure, activity must be balanced with oxygen supply. At this stage of the disease, care should be taken to prevent skin or respiratory complications. The patient should be encouraged to perform as much self-care and exercise as energy allows but this will be limited. 9 . d. Interv ertebral disc herniation is generally indicated by radicular pain radiating down the buttock, below the knee, and along the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Cervical disc disease has pain radiating into the arms and hands. Acute lumbosacral strain causes acute low back pain. Degenerative disc disease is a structural degeneration of discs that is a normal process of aging and results in intervertebral discs losing their elasticity, flexibility, and shock-absorbing capabilities. 10. a. Proper daily e xercise is an important part of the prevention of back injury, with the goal of maintaining mobility and strength in the back. Patients should sit with the knees higher than the hips and should sleep in a side-lying position, with knees and hips bent, or on the back, with a device to flex the hips and knees. Good body mechanics with proper transfer and turning techniques are necessary in all jobs and activities. 11. b . Urinary incontinence following spinal surgery may indicate nerve damage and should be reported to the health care provider. Paralytic ileus is common following surgery and is expected. Pain at the graft site, usually the iliac crest or the fibula, often is more severe than pain at the fused area. Although movement and sensation of the arms and legs should not be more impaired than before surgery, they often are not relieved immediately after surgery. 1 2. c. After spinal sur gery, patients are logrolled to maintain straight alignment of the spine at all times, requiring the patient to be turned with a pillow between the legs and moving the body as a unit. The head of the bed is usually kept flat and the legs are extended.454 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 13. a. A plantar wart is a papilloma growth on the sole of the foot. Thickened skin on the weight-bearing part of the foot is a callus. Local thickening of skin caused by pressure on bony prominences is a corn. A tumor on nerve tissue between the third and fourth metatarsal heads is a Morton's neuroma. 14. c. This patient has a hallux valgus (bunion) that will be treated surgically by removing the bursal sac and bony enlargement. Metatarsal arch support is conservative treatment for hammer toe. A corn is trimmed with a scalpel after softening. Intraarticular corticosteroids and passive manual stretching are conservative treatment for hallux rigidus from osteoarthritis. 15. c. Poorly fitted shoes selected for fashion rather than comfort are the primary factor in the development of foot problems. A few congenital problems predispose to foot problems. Poor hygiene in patients with peripheral vascular disease may lead to foot infections but these factors are in the minority compared with the effect of ill-fitting shoes. 16. c, f. Paget's disease is abnormal remodeling and resorption of bone with replacement of normal marrow with vascular connective tissue. Osteoporosis is loss of total bone mass and substance with abnormal remodeling and resorption of bone and is most common in bones of the spine, hips, and wrists. Osteomalacia results from vitamin D deficiency and causes generalized bone decalcification with bone deformity. 17. b, d, e. Risk factors for osteoporosis include age greater than 65, white or Asian ethnicity, cigarette smoking, inactive lifestyle, low body weight, and postmenopausal estrogen deficiency including premature menopause. Other factors include family history, excessive alcohol use, long-term use of medications such as corticosteroids, thyroid replacement, heparin, long-acting sedatives, or antiseizure drugs. 18. b, c. To specifically prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, increased calcium and vitamin D intake and weight-bearing exercises (i.e., walking) are the best methods. Beef is not high in calcium or vitamin D. Although 20 minutes in the sun each day provides vitamin D for most women, it is recommended that postmenopausal women take supplemental vitamin D doses of 800 to 1000 IU per day. Although estrogen replacement will protect the woman against bone loss and fractures, it is no longer given specifically to prevent osteoporosis because of increased risk of heart disease and breast or uterine cancer. 19. a. The bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, must be taken at least 30 minutes before food or other medications to promote their absorption. As well, because they are very irritating to the stomach and esophagus, the patient must remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication to prevent reflux into the esophagus. These drugs will prevent further bone loss and increase bone density but calcium and vitamin D supplementation is still needed for bone formation. Case Study 1. Risk factors for back pain in G.B. include excess body weight, cigarette smoking, and a job that requires heavy lifting and prolonged periods of sitting. 2. Preoperative preparation includes teaching about the restrictions on positioning and movement required following surgery, measures for pain control, and assessments that will be carried out postoperatively. The nurse should ensure that G.B. has received information about the procedure from the surgeon and understands the benefits and risks of the surgery. 3. G.B. will probably be restricted to flat bed rest for at least the first 24 hours to avoid straining the surgical area. Pillows may be used under the thigh of each leg to prevent strain on the back muscles and between the legs with turning to maintain alignment. When turning is allowed, he must be turned with the help of several personnel to avoid changing the alignment of the spine or he must be logrolled. Depending on the surgeon's preference, ambulation will usually begin by the second postoperative day, again keeping the spine in alignment. 4. The following postoperative assessments should be carried out by the nurse q2-4hr during the first 24 to 48 hours: Sensation: In all extremities in all appropriate dermatomes Circulation and vital signs Movement: Of all extremities Muscle strength: Note any new weakness of the extremities Wound: Assess dressing for drainage and note amount, color, characteristics; clear or light yellow drainage should be tested for the presence of glucose, which would indicate spinal fluid leakage Pain: Document location and intensity of pain; evaluate pain after administration of analgesia Bowel activity: Assess bowel sounds, passage of flatus, and abdomen; paralytic ileus is common for several days Urinary function: Incontinence or retention may indicate nerve damage and should be reported; intermittent catheterization may be required for bladder emptying, especially until G.B. is allowed to stand to void. 5. Discharge instructions include teaching G.B. to report any persistent limb weakness, abnormal sensations, or pain to the health care provider. He should be instructed to avoid standing or sitting for prolonged periods. Walking, lying down, and shifting weight from one foot to another should be encouraged. Twisting of the spine is harmful and he should be taught to think through any activity before bending, lifting, or stooping. A firm mattress or bed board should be used at home and sleeping on the side or back with knees and hips flexed should be encouraged. To prevent further back problems, weight loss and smoking cessation should be encouraged. He should be taught correct body mechanics and to do strengthening back exercises after recovery from the surgery. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Acute pain related to nerve root compression, muscle spasms, and surgical incision Impaired physical mobility related to pain Ineffective self-health management related to lack of knowledge regarding posture, exercises, body mechanics, and weight reduction Collaborative problem: Potential complication: paralysis CHAPTER 65 Answer Key 1. d. Cartilage destruction in the joints affects the majority of those affected by the age of 40 and when the destruction becomes symptomatic, osteoarthritis (OA) is said to be present. Degenerative changes cause symptoms after age 50 or 60 but more than half over age 65 have x-ray evidence ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 455 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. of OA. Joint pain and functional disability should not be considered a normal finding in aging persons. OA is not a systemic disease but is usually caused by a known event or condition that directly damages cartilage or causes joint instability. 2. a. 3; b . 5; c. 6; d. 1; e. 4; f. 2 3. d. The pain in later O A is caused by bone surfaces rubbing together after the articular cartilage has deteriorated. Crepitation occurs earlier in the disease with loose particles of cartilage in the joint cavity. Bouchard's nodes and Heberden's nodes are tender but occur as joint space decreases and as early as 40 years of age. 4. b . Principles of joint protection and energy conservation are critical in being able to maintain functional mobility in the patient with OA and patients should be helped to find ways to perform activities and tasks with less stress. Range-of-motion (ROM), isotonic, and isometric exercises of the affected joints should be balanced with joint rest and protection but during an acute flare of joint inflammation, the joints should be rested. If a joint is painful, it should be used only to the point of pain and masking the pain with analgesics may lead to greater joint injury. 5. a. Some relief for moderate to se vere arthritic pain but not for mild arthritic pain has been observed with the use of over-the-counter glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. These substances should be discontinued if there are no effects after consistent use over 90 to 120 days. They may decrease the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs and increase the risk of bleeding. 6. a. Common side ef fects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include gastrointestinal (GI) and bleeding, dizziness, rash, headache, and tinnitus. Misoprostol (Cytotec) is used to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers and gastritis and would increase the patient's tolerance of any of the NSAIDs. The use of naproxen would cause the same gastric effects as ibuprofen. The daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 g/day to prevent liver damage and antacids interfere with the absorption of NSAIDs. 7. a. O A is not systemic or symmetric. Morning joint stiffness resolves in about 30 minutes. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and characterized by being systemic and affecting small joints symmetrically. Morning joint stiffness lasts 60 minutes to all day. 8. d. P ain and immobility of OA may be aggravated by falling barometric pressure. OA affects weight-bearing joints of knees and hips. Stiffness occurs on arising but usually subsides after 30 minutes. Pain during the day is relieved with rest. Fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss are nonspecific manifestations of the onset of RA. 9 . c. In early disease, the f ingers of the patient with moderate RA (1) may become spindle shaped from synovial hypertrophy and thickening of the joint capsule, (2) have no joint deformities but may have limited joint mobility, (3) have adjacent muscle atrophy, and (4) may be inflammed. Splenomegaly may be found with Felty syndrome in patients with severe nodule-forming RA. Heberden's nodes and crepitus on movement are associated with osteoarthritis. 10. d. The anti-citrullinated protein antibody (A CPA) is more specific than RF for RA and may allow for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Other tests include C-reactive protein (CRP) that is elevated from inflammatory reactions of RA, a finding that is useful in monitoring the response to therapy. The white blood cell (WBC) count may be increased in response to inflammation and is also elevated in synovial fluid. Anemia, rather than polycythemia, is common, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels are normal. 11. b . Rheumatoid nodules develop in 20% to 30% of patients with RA. Felty syndrome is most common in patients with severe, nodule-forming RA. It is characterized by splenomegaly and leukopenia. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome occurs as a disease by itself or with other arthritic disorders. Lyme disease is a spirochetal infection transmitted by an infected deer tick bite. Spondyloarthropathies are interrelated multisystem inflammatory disorders that affect the spine, peripheral joints, and periarticular structures but they do not have serum antibodies. 1 2. b . Entanercept binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its interaction with the TNF cell surface receptors, which decreases the inflammatory response. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, thus decreasing the inflammatory response. Leflunomide is an antiinflammatory that inhibits proliferation of lymphocytes. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant that inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. 13. b . Certolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is a TNF inhibitor and stays in the system longer and may show a more rapid reduction in RA symptoms. Parenteral gold alters immune responses that may suppress synovitis of active RA but it takes 3 to 6 months to be effective. Tocilizumab blocks the action of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalaria drug used initially for mild RA and requires periodic eye examinations to assess for retinal damage. 14. c. Because older adults are more lik ely to take many drugs, the use of multidrug therapy in RA is particularly problematic because of the increased likelihood of adverse drug interactions and toxicity. Rheumatic disorders do occur in older adults but usually in milder form. Older adults are not less compliant with drug regimens but may need help with complex regimens. Interpretation of laboratory values in older adults is more difficult in diagnosing RA because of age-related serologic changes but the disease can be diagnosed. 1 5. b . Most patients with RA experience morning stiffness and morning activities should be scheduled later in the day after the stiffness subsides. A warm shower in the morning and time to become more mobile before activity are advised. Management of RA includes daily exercises for the affected joints and protection of joints with devices and movements that prevent joint stress. Splinting should be done during an acute flare to rest the joint and prevent further damage. 16. b . Pacing activities and alternating rest with activity are important in maintaining self-care and independence of the patient with RA, in addition to preventing deconditioning and a negative attitude. The nurse should not carry out activities for patients that they can do for themselves but instead should support and assist patients as necessary. A warm shower or sitting in a tub with warm water and towels over the shoulders may help to relieve some stiffness. 17. d. Cold therap y is indicated to relieve pain during an acute inflammation, can be applied with frozen packages of vegetables, and should last only 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Heat in the form of heating pads, moist warm packs, 456 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. paraffin baths, or warm baths or showers is indicated to relieve stiffness and muscle spasm. Heat should not be applied for more than 20 minutes at a time. 18. c. The best aerobic exercise is aquatic exercises in warm water to allow easier joint movement because of the buoyancy of the water. Water produces more resistance and can strengthen the muscles. Tai Chi is also a good form of gentle, stretching exercise that would be appropriate. Dancing and walking impact the joints of the feet and even low-impact aerobics could be damaging. Exercises for patients with RA should be gentle. 19. d. The diagnosis of gout is established by finding needle- like monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid of an inflamed joint or tophus. Hyperuricemia and elevated urine uric acid are not diagnostic for gout because they may be related to a variety of drugs or may exist as a totally asymptomatic abnormality in the general population. Although there is a familial predisposition to hyperuricemia, both environmental and genetic factors contribute to gout. 20. b. Colchicine has an antiinflammatory action specific for gout and is the treatment of choice during an acute attack, often producing dramatic pain relief when given within 12 to 24 hours. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is used to control hyperuricemia by blocking production of uric acid. Probenecid is a uricosuric drug that is used to control hyperuricemia by increasing the excretion of uric acid through the kidney. Aspirin inactivates the effect of uricosuric drugs and should not be used when patients are taking probenecid and other uricosuric drugs. 21. b. During therapy with probenecid or allopurinol, the patient must have periodic determination of serum uric acid levels to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy and to ensure that levels are kept low enough to prevent future attacks of gout. With the use of medications, strict dietary restrictions on alcohol and high-purine foods are usually not necessary. When the patient is taking probenecid, urine output should be maintained at 2 to 3 L per day to prevent urate from precipitating in the urinary tract and causing kidney stones. Patients should not alter their doses of medications without medical direction and the drugs used for control of gout are not useful in the treatment of an acute attack. Joint immobilization is used for an acute attack of gout. 22. d. An unusually high frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis and these diseases have a predilection for involvement of the spine, peripheral joints, and periarticular structures as well as an absence of rheumatoid factor and autoantibodies. 23. d. Kyphosis and involvement of costovertebral joints in ankylosing spondylitis lead to a bent-over posture and a decrease in chest expansion, manifestations that are managed with chest expansion and deep-breathing exercises. Postural training emphasizes avoiding forward flexion during any activities and the patient should sleep on the back without the use of pillows. 24. b, f. Reactive arthritis is self-limiting and follows GI or sexually transmitted infection, with symptoms including urethritis and conjunctivitis. Methotrexate is the treatment of choice for psoriatic arthritis. Hypersensitive tender points diagnose fibromyalgia. There is increased risk of septic arthritis in persons with decreased host resistance. Joint infection may be caused by the hematogenous route. 25. a. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoantibodies are produced to nucleic acids, erythrocytes, coagulation proteins, lymphocytes, platelets, and many other self-proteins. This is a hypersensitive response, not immunodeficiency. Overproduction of collagen is characteristic of systemic sclerosis and abnormal IgG reactions with autoantibodies are characteristic of RA. 26. c. All body systems are affected by SLE. When the atrioventricular and sinus nodes are fibrosed and dysrhythmias occur, this is ominous. Although lupus nephritis can occur and lead to chronic kidney disease, treatment is available. Anemia, mild leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are often present. Disordered thought processes, disorientation, memory deficits, and depression may occur. 27. b. Patients with SLE often find that one of the most difficult facets of the disease is its extreme variability in severity and progression. There is no characteristic pattern of progressive organ involvement, nor is it predictable as to which systems may become affected. SLE is now associated with a normal life span but patients must be helped to adjust to the unknown course of the disease. 28. a. Efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs is best monitored by serial serum complement levels and anti-DNA titers, both of which will decrease as the drugs have an effect. A reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is not as specific and the patient with SLE often has a chronic anemia that is not affected by drug therapy. 29. a. Acute exacerbations of SLE may be precipitated by overexposure to ultraviolet light, physical and emotional stress, fatigue, and infection or surgery. Dietary recommendations include small, frequent meals and adequate iron intake. Although SLE has an identified genetic association with HLA-DR3, genetic counseling is not a usual recommendation. The major concern in planning a pregnancy is that there are increased risks for the mother and fetus during pregnancy and exacerbations are common following delivery. Although nonpharmacologic methods of pain control are encouraged, the use of NSAIDs is often necessary to help control inflammation and pain. 30. a. Scleroderma is a disorder of connective tissue that causes skin thickening and tightening, resulting in symmetric, painless swelling or thickening of the skin of the fingers and hands, expressionless facial features, puckering of the mouth, and a small oral orifice. It does not cause the swan neck or ulnar drift deformities seen in RA or SLE. Low back pain and spinal stiffness are associated with ankylosing spondylitis. 31. d. One of the most common and early manifestations of CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) is Raynaud's phenomenon, which causes paroxysmal vasospasms of the digits with diminished blood flow to the fingers and toes on exposure to cold or stress, followed by cyanosis and then erythema on rewarming. The hands and feet must be protected from cold exposure and possible burns or cuts that might heal slowly and smoking is contraindicated. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light is not a factor in scleroderma, nor is fluid intake. Cardiovascular involvement may occur but it does not require patient monitoring. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 457 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 32. b . Dermatomyositis produces symmetric weakness of striated muscle and weak neck and pharyngeal muscles may produce dysphagia. Weakened pharyngeal muscles lead to a poor cough, difficulty swallowing, and increased aspiration risk. Muscle tenderness or pain is uncommon, as is joint involvement. During an acute attack the patient is so weak that bed rest is needed and passive ROM is usually required. 33. b . People with fibromyalgia typically experience nonrestorative sleep, morning stiffness, irritable bowel syndrome, and anxiety in addition to the widespread, nonarticular musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Fibromyalgia is nondegenerative, nonprogressive, and noninflammatory. Neither muscle weakness nor muscle spasms are associated with the disease, although there may be tics in the muscle at the tender points. 34. d. The American Colle ge of Rheumatology identifies two criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia: (1) pain is experienced in 11 of the 18 tender points on palpation and (2) the patient has a history of widespread pain for at least 3 months. The other findings may also be present but are not diagnostic for fibromyalgia. 35. d. The pain and related symptoms of f ibromyalgia cause significant stress and anxiety is a common finding. Stress management is an important part of the treatment and may include any of the commonly used relaxation strategies as well as psychologic counseling. 36. b, d, f, g. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention, National Institutes of Health, and International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group identified the four major criteria for diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome: (1) fatigue not due to ongoing exertion; (2) fatigue not substantially alleviated by rest; (3) unexplained, persistent, or relapsing chronic fatigue of new and definite onset; and (4) a reduction in occupational, education, social, or personal activities from fatigue. The other options are some of the minor criteria; four or more minor criteria must be present with the major criteria for 6 months or more before the diagnosis can be made. (See Table 65-20.) Case Study 1. N.M. needs to kno w that it is not known what causes RA but that in a genetically susceptible person autoantibodies, or RF, are formed that react with substances causing inflammation and damage to a variety of organs. Inflammation and fibrosis of the joint capsule and supporting structures may lead to complete immobilization of the joint and cause deformities similar to those she is developing in her hands. She should be told that RA is a disease that affects her whole body, even though her joints are primarily affected at this time. She should be told that the fatigue and low-grade fever she has are part of the disease and that with disease control these symptoms will improve. 2. Manifestations of RA include N.M. 's painful, stiff hands and feet; fatigue; low-grade fever; and ulnar drift deviation. 3. Although diagnosis of RA is often based on history and physical findings, positive RF occurs in approximately 80% of adult patients and titers rise during active disease. Testing for ACPA is a more specific test for RA than RF. Synovial fluid analysis in early disease will show an increase in the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 enzyme and WBC count. ESR and CRP are general indicators of active inflammation. An increase in antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers is also seen in some RA patients. X-rays are not specifically diagnostic of RA, although they may reveal soft tissue swelling and possible bone demineralization early in the disease. (See Table 65-7; a score of 6 or greater is definitive for RA.) 4. Methotre xate is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) because it has an antiinflammatory effect, reducing symptoms in days to weeks. However, it causes bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity, so frequent laboratory monitoring, including CBC and chemistry panel must be done. Its dosage in RA is much smaller than that used for cancer therapy and side effects are not as common. Teaching N.M. about methotrexate is an important nursing responsibility. Along with periodic laboratory monitoring, N.M could take a daily supplement of folic acid and should report signs of anemia or any infection. Methotrexate is teratogenic and N.M. should be informed that contraception must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. 5. Protection of N.M. 's joints will be enhanced if she can maintain a normal weight; avoid tasks that cause pain; use assistive devices to prevent joint stress; avoid forceful, repetitive movements; use good posture and proper body mechanics; seek assistance with tasks that cause pain; and modify home and work environments to create less stressful ways to perform tasks. To protect small joints N.M. should be taught to maintain joints in neutral position to minimize deformity, use the strongest joint available for any task, distribute weight over many joints instead of stressing a few, and change positions frequently (see Table 65-10). She should plan regularly scheduled rest periods alternated with activity throughout the day and should develop organizing and pacing techniques that spread tasks through the day or the week. Suggesting that she take a warm shower or bath in the morning to relieve her morning stiffness might be helpful. Exercise regimens will be prescribed and she should be encouraged to follow the regimens daily. 6. Because of the chronicity and disability associated with arthritis, patients are often vulnerable to claims of unproven remedies. The nurse should recognize that the copper bracelet will do no harm but may be a waste of money for N.M. It is important to encourage her to recognize that regular, proven methods of treatment used on a consistent basis are the best way to control her condition. The more she is taught about the disease and its management, the more compliant she will be with treatment regimens. 7. Additional sources of information and sharing are a vailable from the Arthritis Foundation (www.arthritis.org) and should be suggested to N.M. 8. Nursing diagnoses: Acute and chronic pain related to joint inflammation Impaired physical mobility related to joint pain, stiffness, and deformity Fatigue related to disease activity Ineffective self-health management related to use of unproven remedies Risk for infection related to altered immune function Disturbed body image related to chronic disease activity, long-term treatment, deformities, stiffness, and inability to perform usual activities Collaborati ve problem: Potential complication: bone marro w suppression458 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 66 Answer Key 1. d. One of the primary characteristics of critical care nurses that is different from those of generalist medical-surgical nurses is the use of advanced technology to measure physiologic parameters accurately to manage life-threatening complications. All nursing addresses human responses to health problems and requires knowledge of physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and psychologic support to the patient and family. Diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening diseases are roles of medicine. 2. a. 1; b. 2; c. 2; d. 3 3. b. Anxiety in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient is related to the environment, which has unfamiliar equipment, high noise and light levels, and an intense pace of activity that leads to sensory overload. The nurse should eliminate as much of this source of stress as possible by muting phones, limiting overhead paging, setting alarms appropriate to the patient's condition, and eliminating unnecessary alarms during care when possible. Offering flexible visiting schedules for family members and providing as much autonomy in decisions about care as possible are indicated when impaired communication and loss of control contribute to the anxiety. Use of sedation to reduce anxiety should be carefully evaluated and implemented when nursing measures are not effective. 4. b. The caregivers of the critically ill patient are very important in the recovery and well-being of the patient and the extent to which the family is involved and supported affects the patient's clinical course. Although the cost of planning and providing critical care is a concern to caregivers, it is not the major reason that caregivers are included in the patient's care. Caregivers may be responsible for making decisions about the patient's care only when the patient is unable to make personal decisions. Most caregivers have questions regarding the patient's quality of care because of anxiety and lack of information about the patient's condition. 5. b. Decreased heart rate (HR) causes decreased cardiac output (CO). The other options contribute to an increased CO. 6. d. Impedance cardiography (ICG) is noninvasive and transmits continuous or intermittent electric current through the chest that travels through the path of least resistance: the blood. Thoracic fluid status or impedance-based hemodynamic parameters (CO, stroke volume [SV], and systemic vascular resistance [SVR]) are calculated from the average impedance of fluid in the thorax. ICG measures the change in impedance in the ascending aorta and left ventricle over time. Generalized edema or third spacing interferes with accurate signals because of the excess volume. 7. c. Increased fluid administration increases preload, which will increase CO. Diuretics will decrease preload. Intropin (dopamine) does not affect preload but increases CO with increased cardiac contractility. Calcium channel blockers do not affect preload but decrease contractility. 8. c. CO is dependent on HR and SV . SV is determined by preload, afterload, and contractility. If CO is decreased and HR is unchanged, SV is the variable factor. If the preload (determined by pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP]) and the afterload (determined by SVR) are unchanged, the factor that is changed is the contractility of the myocardium. 9. b. Referencing hemodynamic monitoring equipment means positioning the monitoring equipment so that the zero reference point is at the vertical level of the left atrium of the heart. The port of the stopcock nearest the transducer is placed at the phlebostatic axis, the external landmark of the left atrium. The phlebostatic axis is the intersection of two planes: a horizontal line midchest, halfway between the outermost anterior and posterior surfaces, transecting a vertical line through the fourth intercostal space at the sternum. 10. c. The pressure obtained when the balloon of the pulmonary artery catheter is inflated reflects the preload of the left ventricle. The pulmonary artery flow-directed catheter's balloon floats into the pulmonary artery. In the absence of mitral valve impairment, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or left ventricular preload is reflected by the PAWP. The low pressure alarm in the arterial catheter placed for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling detects disconnection of the line, which is a medical emergency. 11. d. During insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter, it is necessary to monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG) continuously because of the risk for dysrhythmias, particularly when the catheter reaches the right ventricle. During the catheter insertion, the patient is placed supine with the head of the bed flat. It is the health care provider's responsibility to obtain informed consent regarding the catheter insertion. An Allen test to confirm adequate ulnar artery perfusion is performed before insertion of an arterial catheter in the radial artery for arterial pressure monitoring. 12. d. Although arterial pressure-based CO (APCO) monitoring is in use with patients on mechanical (control mode) ventilation with fixed respiratory rates and there is less risk of infection, more research is needed to determine the accuracy of the measures in comparison to pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is contraindicated for patients with coagulopathy and mechanical tricuspid or pulmonic valves. 13. c. The continuous CO (CCO) method of determining CO uses a heat exchange catheter that produces and detects the change in temperature. The bedside computer displays digital measurements every 30 to 60 seconds that reflect the average CO for the past 3 to 6 minutes. Fluid boluses are not needed, as with intermittent bolus thermodilution CO (TDCO). This makes the CCO method faster, easier, and safer for the patient. SVR can be calculated with either method. 14. a. Mean arterial pressure (MAP): 75 mm Hg = (90 mm Hg + 136 mm Hg)/3 Pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP): 26 mm Hg = (38 mm Hg + 40 mm Hg)/3 SV: 25.8 mL/beat SVR: 1525 dynes/sec/cm-5 = Hg - 14 mm Hg \u00d7 80/3.2 L/min) b. All of the changes in the hemodynamic parameters are characteristic findings in the patient with heart failure: increased pulmonary congestion and pressures; increased pressure in the left atrium and ventricle; increased SVR; and decreased stroke volume, CO, and systemic blood pressure (BP). 15. b. The normal central venous oxygen saturation/mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2/SvO2) becomes decreased with decreased arterial oxygenation, low ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 459 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. CO, low hemoglobin, or increased oxygen consumption. With normal CO, arterial oxygenation, and hemoglobin, the factor that is responsible for decreased ScvO 2/SvO2 is increased oxygen consumption, which can result from increased metabolic rate, pain, movement, or fever. 16. d. When a pulmonary artery pressure tracing indicates a wedged waveform when the balloon is deflated, this indicates that the catheter has advanced and has become spontaneously wedged. If the catheter is not repositioned immediately, a pulmonary infarction or a rupture of a pulmonary artery may occur. If the catheter is becoming occluded, the pressure tracing becomes blunted and pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary congestion increase the pulmonary artery waveform. Balloon leaks found when injected air does not flow back into the syringe do not alter waveforms. 17. d. The counterpulsation of the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) increases diastolic arterial pressure, forcing blood back into the coronary arteries and main branches of the aortic arch, increasing coronary artery perfusion pressure and blood flow to the myocardium. The IABP also causes a drop in aortic pressure just before systole, decreasing afterload and myocardial oxygen consumption. These effects make the IABP valuable in treating unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, and a variety of surgical heart situations. Its use is contraindicated in incompetent aortic valves, dissecting aortic and thoracic aneurysms, and generalized peripheral vascular disease. 18. d. During intraaortic counterpulsation, the balloon of the IABP is inflated during diastole and deflated during systole. This causes decreased HR, decreased peak systolic pressure, and decreased afterload. (See Table 66-6.) 19. c. Because the IABP is inserted into the femoral artery and advanced to the descending thoracic aorta, compromised distal extremity circulation is common and requires that the cannulated extremity be extended at all times. Repositioning the patient to prevent pneumonia is limited to side-lying or supine positions with the head of the bed elevated no more than 30 to 45 degrees. Assessment for bleeding is important because the IABP may cause platelet destruction and occlusive dressings are used to prevent site infection. 20. d. W eaning from the IABP involves reducing the pumping to every second or third heartbeat until the IABP catheter is removed. The pumping and infusion flow are continued to reduce the risk for thrombus formation around the catheter until it is removed. 21. b . Ventricular assist devices (V ADs) are temporary devices that can partially or totally support circulation until the heart recovers and can be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass or until a donor heart can be obtained. The devices currently available do not permanently support circulation. 22. c. A nasal endotracheal (ET) tube is longer and smaller in diameter than an oral ET tube, creating more airway resistance and increasing the work of breathing. Suctioning and secretion removal are also more difficult with nasal ET tubes and they are more subject to kinking than are oral tubes. Oral tubes require a bite block to stop the patient from biting the tube and may cause more laryngeal damage because of their larger size. 23. a. The patient is positioned with the mouth, pharynx, and trachea in direct alignment, with the head extended in the \"sniffing position,\" but the head must not hang over the edge of the bed. The patient may be asked to extrude the tongue during nasal intubation. Speaking is not possible during intubation or while the oral ET tube is in place because the tube separates the vocal cords. 24. b . The first action of the nurse is to use an end tidal CO2 detector. If no CO2 is detected, the tube is in the esophagus. The second action by the nurse following ET intubation is to auscultate the chest to confirm bilateral breath sounds and observe to confirm bilateral chest expansion. If this evidence is present, the tube is secured and connected to an O 2 source. Then the placement is confirmed immediately with x-ray and the tube is marked where it exits the mouth. The patient should be suctioned as needed. 25. c. The minimal occluding v olume (MOV) involves adding air to the ET tube cuff until no leak is heard at peak inspiratory pressure but ensures that minimal pressure is applied to the tracheal wall to prevent pressure necrosis of the trachea. The MOV should be between 20 and 25 cm H2O of pressure to prevent tracheal injury. The cuff does not secure the tube in place but rather prevents escape of ventilating gases through the upper airway. 26. 100 to 120 mm Hg 27. c. Suctioning an ET tube is performed when adv entitious sounds over the trachea or bronchi confirm the presence of secretions that can be removed by suctioning. Visible secretions in the ET tube, respiratory distress, suspected aspiration, increase in peak airway pressures, and changes in oxygen status are other indications. Peripheral wheezes or crackles are not an indication for suctioning. Suctioning as a means of inducing a cough is not recommended because of the complications associated with suctioning. 28. c. Nursing care for a patient with an ET tube includes (1) hyperoxygenation before and after suctioning, (2) keeping suctioning equipment and a self-inflating bag-valve-mask (BVM) at the bedside, and (3) using either one-time use sterile suction catheters for open suction technique or a suction catheter that is enclosed in a plastic sleeve connected directly to the patient ventilator circuit, which is changed per facility protocol for the closed suction technique. Used suction catheters are not left at the bedside. 29. d. If ne w dysrhythmias occur during suctioning, the suctioning should be stopped and the patient should be slowly ventilated via BVM with 100% oxygen until the dysrhythmia subsides. Patients with bradycardia should not be suctioned excessively. Ventilation of the patient with slow, small-volume breaths using the BVM is performed when severe coughing results from suctioning. 30. a, e. T o prevent dislodgement of the oral ET tube during care, two nurses work together; one holds the tube while it is unsecured and the other performs care. After completion of care, confirm the presence of bilateral breath sounds to ensure that the position of the tube was not changed and reconfirm cuff pressure. Suction pressure less than 120 mm Hg will prevent tracheal mucosal damage. Although the use of water swabs prevents mucosal drying, humidified inspired gas helps to thin secretions. Secretions are moved to larger airways with turning, postural drainage, and percussion; these actions will not prevent or detect tube dislodgement. 460 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 31. b, c, e. Because the patient with an ET tube cannot protect the airway from aspiration and cannot swallow, the cuff should always be inflated and the head of the bed (HOB) elevated while the patient is receiving tube feedings or mouth care is being performed. The HOB elevated 30 to 45 degrees reduces risk of aspiration. The mouth and oropharynx should be suctioned with Yankauer or tonsil suction to remove accumulated secretions that cannot be swallowed. Clearing the ventilatory tubing of condensed water is important to prevent respiratory infection. 32. c. Sedation may be appropriate. As well, having someone the patient knows at the bedside talking to him and reassuring him may decrease his anxiety and calm him. Restraints have not been shown to be an absolute deterrent to self-extubation and the patient will need ongoing and frequent assessment of need. Reminding the patient of the need for the tube may help but it may not be enough to prevent him from pulling out the tube if he becomes extremely anxious. Moving the patient near the nurses' station will not be enough to prevent self-extubation since it can be done quickly. 33. b, e. Cystic fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most likely of these diagnoses to need mechanical ventilation related to severe hypoxia or respiratory muscle fatigue. Other indications for mechanical ventilation are apnea or impending inability to breathe and acute respiratory failure. 34. a, d. Positive pressure ventilators require an artificial airway and are most frequently used with acutely ill patients. The other options describe negative pressure ventilators. 35. a, c, e. Positive pressure ventilation has a predetermined peak inspiratory pressure, which increases the risk for hyperventilation and hypoventilation because the volume delivered varies based on the selected pressure and the patient's lung compliance. The other options describe volume ventilation. 36. d. Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is described. Assist-control ventilation (ACV) has a preset tidal volume delivered at a set frequency and more frequently when the patient attempts to inhale. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) applies positive pressure only during inspiration that supplies a rapid flow of gas with spontaneous respirations. Pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (PC-IRV) delivers prolonged inspiration and shortened expiration to promote alveolar expansion and prevent collapse. 37. a. Positive pressure ventilation, especially with end- expiratory pressure, increases intrathoracic pressure with compression of thoracic vessels, resulting in decreased venous return to the heart, decreased left ventricular end- diastolic volume (preload), decreased CO, and lowered BP. None of the other factors is related to increased intrathoracic pressure. 38. d. Decreased CO associated with positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) results in decreased renal perfusion, release of renin, and increased aldosterone secretion, which causes sodium and water retention. ADH may be released because of stress but ADH is responsible only for water retention. Increased intrathoracic pressure will decrease, not increase, the release of atrial natriuretic factor, causing sodium retention. There is decreased, not increased, insensible water loss via the airway during mechanical ventilation. 39. a. LPN; b. RN; c. LPN; d. UAP; g. h. UAP; i. RN; j. UAP 40. c. Neuromuscular blocking agents produce a paralysis that facilitates ventilation but they do not sedate the patient. It is important for the nurse to remember that the patient can hear, see, think, and feel and should be addressed and given explanations accordingly. Communication with the patient is possible, especially from the nurse, but visitors for an anxious and agitated patient should provide a calming, restful effect on the patient. 41. c. The patient is experiencing effects of inadequate nutrition: anemia, delayed ventilator weaning with decreased respiratory strength, decreased resistance to infection, and prolonged recovery. Hypoxemia is related to anemia. Enteral feeding would provide needed nutrition. Decreased activity may be related to muscle weakness from lack of nutrition. 42. b. A leaking cuff can lower tidal volume or respiratory rates. An SIMV rate that is too low, the presence of lung secretions, or obstruction can decrease tidal volume. A decreased PaCO 2 and increased pH indicate a respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation and cardiac dysrhythmias can occur with either hyperventilation or hypoventilation. 43. b. A variety of ventilator weaning methods is used but all should provide weaning trials with adequate rest between trials to prevent respiratory muscle fatigue. Weaning is usually carried out during the day, with the patient ventilated at night until there is sufficient spontaneous ventilation without excess fatigue. If the patient becomes hypoxemic, ventilator support is indicated. 44. a. Care of a ventilator-dependent patient in the home requires that the caregiver know how to manage the ventilator and take care of the patient on it. Before final decisions and arrangements are made, the nurse should ensure that caregivers understand the potential sacrifices they may have to make and the impact that home mechanical ventilation will have over time. Placement in long-term care facilities is not usually necessary unless the caregiver can no longer manage the care or the patient's condition deteriorates. Case Study 1. The best indicators to use to monitor D.V .'s hemodynamic status are the values determined from the pulmonary artery catheter, the urinary output, and the BP because infectious processes are altering his level of consciousness (LOC), skin temperature, and other vital signs that may commonly be used to monitor hemodynamic status. Of the hemodynamic parameters, it is most important to monitor CO, SVR, and SvO 2 because these parameters are the most out of range and suggest septic shock. 2. PEEP is used for D.V . to increase his oxygenation because his PaO2 is decreased. However, PEEP can increase intrathoracic pressure, suppressing venous return and increasing intracranial pressure (ICP). There may also be a risk of barotrauma with PEEP >5 cm H 2O. 3. D.V .'s MAP is 64 mm Hg (100 + [46 \u00d7 2]/3). The MAP that is necessary to promote tissue and cerebral perfusion and not increase ICP would be one that maintains a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 70 mm Hg. With an ICP of 22 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 461 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. mm Hg, MAP needs to be 92 mm Hg to maintain cerebral perfusion and not increase ICP (CPP = MAP - ICP, or 70 = 92 - 22). D.V .'s current MAP results in a CPP of 42, which is inadequate to maintain cerebral perfusion. 4. Fluid therap y would include rapid administration of 0.9% sodium chloride, colloids, or both to expand vascular volume and maintain tissue perfusion, with monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), PAWP, and CO to evaluate fluid replacement. Lactated Ringer's solution is contraindicated because of the patient's elevated lactate levels. Antibiotics specific for cryptococcal infections, such as fluconazole (Diflucan), should be initiated immediately and a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as an aminoglycoside, is indicated for bacterial prophylaxis. Vasopressor agents, such as norepinephrine (Levophed), dopamine (Intropin), or (Neo-Synephrine), are indicated to promote vasoconstriction and increase SVR. After fluid therapy has been initiated, an osmotic diuretic, such as mannitol, may be used to pull water out of the brain tissue and decrease ICP. Aspirin or other antipyretics should be given to control D.V .'s temperature because increased temperature increases the metabolic rate and oxygen need. Sodium bicarbonate is not indicated to correct the patient's acidosis unless the pH is below 7.20. 5. Gastrointestinal ischemia may cause translocation of bo wel bacteria into the systemic circulation, creating a source of further infection and sepsis. Early institution of enteral tube feedings may help to promote gastrointestinal function and prevent bacterial translocation. 6. Assessment findings: Seizures reflect the cerebral irritation caused by the inflammation of the meninges and the increased ICP. Increased ICP is responsible for the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6 and is reflected by the ICP of 22 mm Hg. The infectious process of the meningitis is reflected by the increased body temperature and the WBC count of 18,500/\u00b5L. The response of the sympathetic nervous system to the inflammation and sepsis is seen in the elevated blood glucose level. Most of the other findings reflect the development of septic shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and possible development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Shock is evident from the lowered BP, metabolic acidosis, markedly reduced SVR, and decreased urinary output resulting from poor renal perfusion. Septic shock is characterized by activation of mediators that cause widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, resulting in decreased SVR and high CO because of the decreased peripheral resistance. The vasodilation causes the skin to be warm and dry. Septic shock also results in poor oxygen utilization, resulting in elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2). All of these processes are reflected in the assessment findings in this patient. The ABGs and increased lactate indicate the metabolic acidosis resulting from anaerobic metabolism of cells. The PaCO2 and HCO3 are low and the respiratory rate is increased, indicating the body's attempt to compensate for the metabolic acidosis by using bicarbonate to buffer lactic acid and by hyperventilation to blow off extra carbon dioxide. The decreased urinary output and decreased arterial oxygenation may reflect not only poor perfusion to the kidneys and lungs but also initial organ damage and development of MODS. 7. Nursing diagnoses: Risk for ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to cerebral tissue swelling Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to deficit in capillary blood supply Ineffective protection related to neurosensory alterations Hyperthermia related to inflammatory process Ineffective airway clearance related to unconsciousness and presence of artificial airway Risk for injury related to endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, seizure activity, and environmental hazards Risk for aspiration related to presence of artificial airway Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to increased caloric demands and inability to take nourishment orally Risk for decreased CO related to impeded venous return by PEEP Anxiety related to inability to communicate, fear of death/suffocation with being critically ill and ICU environment Impaired physical mobility related to imposed movement restrictions Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: delirium CHAPTER 67 Answer Key 1. d. Although all of the f actors may be present, regardless of the cause, the end result is inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to body cells from inadequate tissue perfusion. 2. b . Obstructive shock occurs when a physical obstruction impedes the filling or outflow of blood, resulting in reduced cardiac output (CO). 3. a, b, e, f. Hypo volemic shock occurs when there is a loss of intravascular fluid volume from fluid loss (as in hemorrhage or severe vomiting and diarrhea), fluid shift (as in burns or ascites), or internal bleeding (as with a ruptured spleen). Vaccines and insect bites would precipitate the anaphylactic type of distributive shock. 4. a. Older adults with chronic diseases and malnourished or debilitated patients are at risk of developing septic shock, especially when they have an infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection) or indwelling lines or catheters. 5. b . Hemodynamic monitoring in cardiogenic shock will reveal increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure 462 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (PAWP) and decreased CO. The characteristic signs of neurogenic shock are bradycardia and hypotension. Septic shock manifests with decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased CO. Hypovolemic shock is characterized by increased SVR, decreased CO, and decreased PAWP. 6. a, d, e. After sympathetic nervous system activation of vasoconstriction, blood flow to nonvital organs, such as skin, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is diverted or shunted to the most essential organs of the heart and the brain. The patient will feel cool and clammy, the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system will be activated, and the patient may develop a paralytic ileus. 7. d. Angiotensin II vasoconstricts both arteries and veins, which increases blood pressure (BP). It stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, which results in sodium and water reabsorption and potassium excretion by the kidneys. The increased sodium raises serum osmolality and stimulates the pituitary gland to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases water reabsorption, which further increases blood volume, leading to an increase in BP and CO. 8. a, c, f. In the compensatory stage of shock the patient's skin will be pale and cool ( -adrenergic stimulation). There may also be a change in level of consciousness but the person will be responsive, the BP will be lower than baseline, bowel sounds will be hypoactive ( -adrenergic stimulation), and tachypnea and tachycardia ( -adrenergic stimulation) will occur. Unresponsiveness and moist crackles in the lungs occur in the progressive stage of shock. 9. b. Thrombocytopenia can occur. When sepsis is the cause of shock, endotoxin stimulates a cascade of inflammatory responses that start with the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which stimulate other inflammatory mediators. The release of platelet- activating factor causes formation of microthrombi and vessel obstruction. There is vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, neutrophil and platelet aggregation and adhesion to the endothelium. The process does not occur in other types of shock until late stages of shock. 10. d. Decreased myocardial perfusion leads to dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, further decreasing CO and oxygen delivery to cells. The kidney's renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation causes arteriolar constriction that decreases perfusion. In the lung, vasoconstriction of arterioles decreases blood flow and a ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs. Areas of the lung that are oxygenated are not perfused because of the decreased blood flow, resulting in hypoxemia and decreased oxygen for cells. Increased capillary permeability and vasoconstriction cause increased hydrostatic pressure that contributes to the fluid shifting to interstitial spaces. 11. b. During both the compensatory and the progressive stages of shock, the sympathetic nervous system is activated in an attempt to maintain CO and SVR. In the irreversible stage of shock, the sympathetic nervous system can no longer compensate to maintain homeostasis and a loss of vasomotor tone leading to profound hypotension affects perfusion to all vital organs, causing increasing cellular hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and cellular death. 12. d. In every type of shock there is a deficiency of oxygen to the cells and high-flow oxygen therapy is indicated. Fluids would be started next, blood cultures would be done before any antibiotic therapy, and laboratory specimens then could be drawn. 13. b. In early compensatory shock, activation of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulates the release of aldosterone, which causes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by the kidney, elevating serum sodium levels and decreasing serum potassium levels. Blood glucose levels are elevated during the compensatory stage of shock in response to catecholamine stimulation of the liver, which releases its glycogen stores in the form of glucose. Metabolic acidosis does not occur until the progressive stage of shock. At this stage compensatory mechanisms become ineffective and anaerobic cellular metabolism causes lactic acid production. 14. d. In late irreversible shock, progressive cellular destruction causes changes in laboratory findings that indicate organ damage. Increasing ammonia levels indicate impaired liver function. Metabolic acidosis is usually severe as cells continue anaerobic metabolism and the respiratory alkalosis that may occur in the compensatory stage has failed to compensate for the acidosis. Potassium levels increase and blood glucose decreases. 15. a. Lactated Ringer's solution may increase lactate levels, which a damaged liver cannot convert to bicarbonate. This may intensify the metabolic lactic acidosis that occurs in progressive shock, necessitating careful attention to the patient's acid-base balance. Sodium and potassium levels as well as hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels should be monitored in all patients receiving fluid replacement therapy. 16. b. The endpoint of fluid resuscitation in septic and hypovolemic shock is a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mm Hg or a PAWP of 10 to 12 mm Hg. The CO is too low and the heart rate is too high to indicate adequate fluid replacement. 17. a. A decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) indicates that the patient has used the venous oxygen reserve and is at greater risk for anaerobic metabolism. The SvO 2 decreases when more oxygen is used by the cells, as in activity or hypermetabolism. All of the other values indicate an improvement in the patient's condition. 18. d. As a vasopressor, norepinephrine may cause severe vasoconstriction, which would further decrease tissue perfusion, especially if fluid replacement is inadequate. Vasopressors generally cause hypertension, reflex bradycardia, and decreased urine output because of decreased renal blood flow. They do not directly affect acid-base balance. 19. c. Vasoactive drugs are those that can either dilate or constrict blood vessels and are used in various stages of shock treatment. When using either vasodilators or vasoconstrictors, it is important to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 60 mm Hg so that adequate perfusion is maintained. The other goals would be appropriate only with either vasodilators or vasoconstrictors, not with all vasoactive drugs. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 463 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All reserved. Others: Angiotensin-con verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, -adrenergic blockers 2 2. c. Pre vention of shock necessitates identification of persons who are at risk and a thorough baseline nursing assessment with frequent ongoing assessments to monitor and detect changes in patients at risk. Frequent monitoring of all patients' vital signs is not necessary. Aseptic technique for all invasive procedures should always be implemented but will not prevent all types of shock. Health promotion activities that reduce the risk for precipitating conditions, such as coronary artery disease or anaphylaxis, may help to prevent shock in some cases. 23. a, b, c, e, f. Skin (color , temperature, moisture), urine output, level of consciousness, vital signs (including pulse oximetry), and peripheral pulses with capillary refill should be monitored to evaluate tissue perfusion. 24. c. If the metabolic acidosis is compensated, the pH will be within the normal range. If the patient is hyperventilating to blow off carbon dioxide to reduce the acid load of the blood, PaCO 2 will be decreased. 25. c, d, e. Antihistamines, oxygen supplementation, and colloid volume expansion are used to treat anaphylactic shock. Epinephrine, a vasopressor, is also frequently used. Only septic shock is treated with antibiotics. Vasodilators and inotropes are only used for cardiogenic shock. V olume expansion fluids vary with each type of shock. 26. d. Although some patients in shock may be treated with antianxiety and sedative drugs to control anxiety and apprehension, the nurse should always acknowledge the patient's feelings, explain procedures before they are carried out, and inform the patient of the plan of care and its rationale. Members of the clergy should be called only if the patient requests or agrees to a visit. Visits by family may have a therapeutic effect for some patients and may increase stress in others. 27. d. A common initial mediator that causes endothelial damage leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is endotoxin. MODS results from SIRS. Not all patients with septic shock develop MODS, although they do have SIRS. The respiratory system is frequently the first to show evidence of SIRS and MODS. 28. d. The ischemic or necrotic tissue mechanism triggers SIRS with myocardial infarction, and disease. Endotoxin seen with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The abscess formation mechanism occurs with intraabdominal and extremitiy abscesses. Global perfusion deficits are seen post-cardiac resuscitation and in shock states. 29. a, d, e. Mechanical tissue trauma triggering of SIRS occurs with burns, surgical procedures, and crush injuries. Fungi, viruses, bacteria, and parasites cause microbial invasion. 30. a. Early enteral feedings in the patient in shock increase the blood supply to the GI tract and help to prevent translocation of GI bacteria and endotoxins into the blood, preventing initial or additional infection. Surgical removal of necrotic tissue, especially from burns, eliminates a source of infection in critically ill patients, as does the use of strict aseptic technique in all patient procedures. Known infections are treated with specific agents and broad-spectrum agents are used only until organisms are identified. 31. b . Generally, the first body system affected by mediator- induced injury in MODS is the respiratory system. Adventitious sounds and areas with absent breath sounds will be present. Other organ damage occurs but lungs are usually first. 3 2. b . The presence of MODS is confirmed when there is defined clinical evidence of failure of two or more organs. Elevated serum bilirubin indicates liver dysfunction, a 20. 21. Type of Shock Medical Therapies Cardiogenic Restore coronary artery blood flow with thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, emergency revascularization; increase CO with inotropic agents; reduce workload by dilating coronary arteries, decreasing preload and afterload; use circulatory assist devices, such as an intraaortic balloon pump Hypovolemic Fluid and blood replacement, control of bleeding with pressure, surgery Septic Fluid resuscitation, antimicrobial agents, inotropic agents Diuretics (e.g., furosemide [Lasix]) Decrease the workload of the heart by decreasing fluid volume and reducing preload. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., Milrinone [Primacor])Increase cardiac contractility and output and decrease preload and by directly relaxing vascular smooth dilates Nitroprusside (Nipride) Acts as a potent vasodilator of veins and arteries and may increase or decrease CO, depending on the extent of preload and afterload reduction.464 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. serum creatinine of 3.8 mg/dL indicates kidney injury, and a platelet count of 15,000/\u00b5L indicates hematologic failure. Other criteria include urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 100 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count >10000/\u00b5L, upper or lower GI bleeding, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 6, and Hct 20%. A respiratory rate of 45, PaCO 2 of 60 mm Hg, and chest x-ray with bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates indicate respiratory failure but not other organ damage. Case Study 1. A.M.'s risk factors were an indwelling catheter leading to urinary tract infection (UTI) and being a compromised patient: older; chronic illnesses of diabetes, heart failure, and history of prostate cancer and myocardial infarction. 2. The nursing home staff could have used aseptic technique in catheter placement, increased fluid intake to flush the catheter, consulted with the health care provider regarding prophylactic antimicrobials, and ensured early detection of changes in urine and body temperature. 3. Release of endotoxin by gram-negative bacteria that cause inflammatory responses is the initial insult. The endotoxin binds to monocytes and lymphocytes, stimulating the release of TNF and IL-1, which in turn causes release or activation of platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane A 2, kinins, and complement. result is widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. Histamine is also released, which causes increased capillary permeability. The end result is decreased SVR and normal or increased CO as a result of the decreased SVR. Death is associated with persistent increase in heart rate and CO, with low SVR and refractory hypotension with progression to MODS. Respiratory failure is also common as the patient hyperventilates to compensate for metabolic acidosis, which results in fatigue and then respiratory acidosis. If acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops, the patient will need intubation. 4. The widespread vasodilation caused by the inflammatory process and increased capillary permeability causing fluid loss to the interstitium cause hypotension. 5.Assessment Finding Physiologic Basis Nursing Intervention Decreased level of consciousnessDecreased tissue perfusion to the brain and hypoxia of brain cellsReorientation and inform the patient of all care as given Warm, dry, and flushed skin Massive vasodilation and increased body temperature from gram-negative bacteria Cover patient only with a sheet Tachycardia Activation of sympathetic nervous system with -adrenergic stimulation, thus increasing heart rateMonitor heart rate and other vital signs Tachypnea Compensation for tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis Brush teeth every 12 hours and swab lips and oral mucosa every 2 to 4 hours Fever Bacterial infection Provide antibiotics and antipyretics as ordered, monitor temperature, use aseptic technique to avoid further infections Decreased SVR Profound vasodilation Administer vasopressors as ordered, encourage active range of motion (ROM) or provide passive ROM to decrease blood pooling in periphery Increased CO Occurs as a result of decreased vascular resistanceMonitor SvO 2/ScvO2 Oliguria Inadequate renal perfusion and possible renal failure Administer fluids as ordered and monitor input and output Hyperglycemia Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes glycogenolysis by the liver Administer insulin as ordered 6. The overall goals for this patient on admission are (1) evidence of adequate tissue perfusion, (2) restoration of normal or baseline BP, (3) return or recovery of organ function, (4) avoidance of complications from prolonged states of hypoperfusion, and (5) prevention of health care- acquired complications of disease management and care. 7. A pulmonary artery catheter was needed to monitor fluid replacement and cardiac function because of multiple system involvement. 8. Arterial blood gases: pH: Indicates an acidosis, typical of the metabolic acidosis of anaerobic metabolism of shock PaO2: Very low, indicating a marked hypoxemia PaCO2: Low as a result of hyperventilation to compensate for the metabolic acidosis HCO3: Bicarbonate is low because it is used to neutralize the acids of anaerobic metabolism. SaO2: Very low oxygen saturation. Normal is 96% to 100% and the patient's level severe hypoxemia. 9. Hemodynamic pressures: Right atrial pressure (RAP): Normal is 2 to 8 mm Hg. Marked vasodilation would decrease venous return to the heart and it would be expected to be decreased. ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 465 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP): Normal is 10 to 20 mm Hg and is an indicator of afterload or systemic vascular resistance. The patient's pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) would be expected to be decreased in septic shock, where there is profound vasodilation. PAWP: Normal is 6 to 12 mm Hg and is an indicator of afterload or systemic vascular resistance. The patient's PAWP would be expected to be low. CO: Normal is 4 to 8 L/min initially. The patient's CO would be expected to be elevated, illustrating the high CO typical of septic shock. SVR: Normal is 900 to 1400 dynes/sec/cm-5. Vasodilation would produce a decreased SVR. 10. Fluid therap y is used to increase vascular volume and BP, which increases tissue perfusion. Intropin (dopamine) is used to increase vasoconstriction to elevate systemic vascular resistance and strengthen myocardial contractions to improve CO and BP. 11. Nursing diagnoses: Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to maldistribution of blood Altered protection related to neurosensory alterations Hyperthermia related to inflammatory process Risk for disuse syndrome related to perceptual-cognitive impairment Collaborati ve organ ischemia\u2014neurologic, renal, GI; MODS CHAPTER 68 Answer Key 1. c. Respiratory f ailure results when the transfer of oxygen or carbon dioxide function of the respiratory system is impaired and, although the definition is determined by PaO 2 and PaCO2 levels, the major factor in respiratory failure is inadequate gas exchange to meet tissue oxygen (O2) needs. Absence of ventilation is respiratory arrest and partial airway obstruction may not necessarily cause respiratory failure. Acute hypoxemia may be caused by factors other than pulmonary dysfunction. 2. b, c, e, f. Hypox emic respiratory failure is often caused by ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and shunt. It is called oxygenation failure because the primary problem is inadequate oxygen transfer. There is a risk of inadequate oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and it exists when PaO 2 is 60 mm Hg or less, even when oxygen is administered at 60%. Ventilatory failure is hypercapnic respiratory failure. Hypercapnic respiratory failure results from an imbalance between ventilatory supply and ventilatory demand and the body is unable to compensate for the acidemia of increased PaCO 2. 3. c. Intrapulmonary shunt occurs when blood flo ws through the capillaries in the lungs without participating in gas exchange (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], pneumonia). Obstruction impairs the flow of blood to the ventilated areas of the lung in a V/Q mismatch ratio greater than 1 (e.g., pulmonary embolus). Blood passes through an anatomic channel in the heart and bypasses the lungs with anatomic shunt (e.g., ventricular septal defect). Gas exchange across the alveolar capillary interface is compromised by thickened or damaged alveolar membranes in diffusion limitation (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS). 4. c. There will be more v entilation than perfusion (V/Q ratio greater than 1) with a pulmonary embolus. Pain and atelectasis will cause a V/Q ratio less than 1. A ventricular septal defect causes an anatomic shunt as the blood bypasses the lungs. 5. b . Diffusion limitation in pulmonary fibrosis is caused by thickened alveolar-capillary interface, which slows gas transport. 6. b . Hypercapnic respiratory failure is associated with alveolar hypoventilation with increases in alveolar and arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2) and often is caused by problems outside the lungs. A patient with slow, shallow respirations is not exchanging enough gas volume to eliminate CO 2. Deep, rapid respirations reflect hyperventilation and often accompany lung problems that cause hypoxemic respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema and large airway resistance cause obstruction of oxygenation and result in a V/Q mismatch or shunt typical of hypoxemic respiratory failure. 7. d. In a patient with normal lung function, respiratory failure is commonly defined as a PaO2 60 mm Hg or a PaCO2 >45 mm Hg or both. However, because the patient with chronic pulmonary disease normally maintains low PaO 2 and high PaCO2, acute respiratory failure in these patients can be defined as an acute decrease in PaO2 or an increase in PaCO2 from the patient's baseline parameters, accompanied by an acidic pH. The pH of 7.28 reflects an acidemia and a loss of compensation in the patient with chronic lung disease. 8. c, d, e, f. Morning headache, respiratory acidosis, the use of tripod position, and rapid, shallow respirations would be expected. The other manifestations are characteristic of hypoxemic respiratory failure. 9. a. Because the brain is v ery sensitive to a decrease in oxygen delivery, restlessness, agitation, disorientation, and confusion are early signs of hypoxemia, for which the nurse should be alert. Mild hypertension is also an early sign, accompanied by tachycardia. Central cyanosis is an unreliable, late sign of hypoxemia. Cardiac dysrhythmias also occur later. 10. a, d, e, f. Changes from aging that increase the older adult's risk for respiratory failure include alveolar dilation, increased risk for infection, decreased respiratory muscle strength, and diminished elastic recoil in the airways. Although delirium can complicate ventilator management, it does not increase the older patient's risk for respiratory failure. The older adult's blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increase but this does not affect the risk for respiratory failure. The ventilatory capacity is decreased and the larger air spaces decrease the surface area for gas exchange, which increases the risk. 11. d. The increase in respiratory rate required to blo w off accumulated CO2 predisposes to respiratory muscle fatigue. The slowing of a rapid rate in a patient in acute distress indicates tiring and the possibility of respiratory arrest unless ventilatory assistance is provided. A decreased inspiratory-expiratory (I/E) ratio, orthopnea, and accessory muscle use are common findings in respiratory distress but do not necessarily signal respiratory fatigue or arrest. 12. a. P atients with a shunt are usually more hypoxemic than patients with a V/Q mismatch because the alveoli are 466 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. filled with fluid, which prevents gas exchange. Hypoxemia resulting from an intrapulmonary shunt is usually not responsive to high O 2 concentrations and the patient will usually require positive pressure ventilation. Hypoxemia associated with a V/Q mismatch usually responds favorably to O 2 administration at 1 to 3 L/min by nasal cannula. Removal of secretions with coughing and suctioning is generally not effective in reversing an acute hypoxemia resulting from a shunt. 13. a. When there is impaired function of one lung, the patient should be positioned with the unaffected lung in the dependent position to promote perfusion to the functioning tissue. If the diseased lung is positioned dependently, more V/Q mismatch would occur. The head of the bed may be elevated or a reclining chair may be used, with the patient positioned on the unaffected side, to maximize thoracic expansion if the patient has increased work of breathing. 14. b. Augmented coughing is done by applying pressure on the abdominal muscles at the beginning of expiration. This type of coughing helps to increase abdominal pressure and expiratory flow to assist the cough to remove secretions in the patient who is exhausted. An oral airway is used only if there is a possibility that the tongue will obstruct the airway. Huff coughing prevents the glottis from closing during the cough and works well for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to clear central airways. Slow pursed lip breathing allows more time for expiration and prevents small bronchioles from collapsing. 15. c. For the patient with a history of heart failure, current acute respiratory failure, and thick secretions, the best intervention is to liquefy the secretions with either aerosol mask or using normal saline administered by a nebulizer. Excess IV fluid may cause cardiovascular distress and the patient probably would not tolerate postural drainage with her history. Suctioning thick secretions without thinning them is difficult and increases the patient's difficulty in maintaining oxygenation. With copious secretions, this could be done after thinning the secretions. 16. a. It is most important to assess the patient for the cause of the restlessness and agitation (e.g., pain, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalances) and treat the underlying cause before sedating the patient. Although sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade are often used to control agitation and pain, these treatments may contribute to prolonged ventilator support and hospital days. 17. d. Hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter is instituted in severe respiratory failure to determine the amount of blood flow to tissues and the response of the lungs and heart to hypoxemia. Continuous BP monitoring may be performed but BP is a reflection of cardiac activity, which can be determined by the pulmonary artery catheter findings. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are important to evaluate oxygenation and ventilation status and V/Q mismatches. 18. a, b, c. Morphine and nitroglycerin (e.g., Tridil) will decrease pulmonary congestion caused by heart failure; IV diuretics (e.g., furosemide [Lasix]) are also to treat pulmonary infections. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol), an IV corticosteroid, will reduce airway inflammation. Morphine is also used to decrease anxiety, agitation, and pain. 19. d. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) involves the application of a face mask and delivery of a volume of air under inspiratory pressure. Because the device is worn externally, the patient must be able to cooperate in its use and frequent access to the airway for suctioning or inhaled medications must not be necessary. It is not indicated when high levels of oxygen are needed or respirations are absent. 20. a. A sedation holiday is needed to assess the patient's condition and readiness to extubate. A hypermetabolic state occurs with critical illness. With malnourished patients, enteral or parenteral nutrition is started within 24 hours; with well-nourished patients it is started within 3 days. With these medications, the patient will be assessed for cardiopulmonary depression. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis will be used but there is no reason to keep the legs still. Repositioning the patient every 2 hours may help to decrease discomfort and agitation. 21. a. Although ARDS may occur in the patient who has virtually any severe illness and may be both a cause and a result of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the most common precipitating insults of ARDS are sepsis, gastric aspiration, and severe massive trauma. 22. a, c, d. The injury or exudative phase is the early phase of ARDS when atelectasis and interstitial and alveoli edema occur membranes of necrotic cells, protein, and fibrin line the alveoli. Together, these decrease gas exchange capability and lung compliance. Shortness of breath occurs but it is not a physiologic change. The increased inflammation and proliferation of fibroblasts occurs in the reparative or proliferative phase of ARDS, which occurs 1 to 2 weeks after the initial lung injury. 23. c. In the fibrotic phase of ARDS, diffuse scarring and fibrosis of the lungs occur, resulting in decreased surface area for gas exchange and continued hypoxemia caused by diffusion limitation. Although edema is resolved, lung compliance is decreased because of interstitial fibrosis. Long-term mechanical ventilation is required. The patient has a poor prognosis for survival. 24. a. Refractory hypoxemia, hypoxemia that does not respond to increasing concentrations of oxygenation by any route, is a hallmark of ARDS and is always present. Bronchial breath sounds may be associated with the progression of ARDS. PaCO 2 levels may be normal until the patient is no longer able to compensate in response to the hypoxemia. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) that is normally elevated in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is normal in the pulmonary edema of ARDS. 25. c. Early signs of ARDS are insidious and difficult to detect but the nurse should be alert for any early signs of hypoxemia, such as dyspnea, restlessness, tachypnea, cough, and decreased mentation, in patients at risk for ARDS. Abnormal findings on physical examination or diagnostic studies, such as adventitious lung sounds, signs of respiratory distress, respiratory alkalosis, or decreasing PaO 2, are usually indications that ARDS has progressed beyond the initial stages. 26. b. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V AP) is one of the most common complications of ARDS. Early detection requires frequent monitoring of sputum smears and cultures ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 467 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. and assessment of the quality, quantity, and consistency of sputum. Prevention of V AP is done with strict infection control measures, ventilator bundle protocol, and subglottal secretion drainage. Blood in gastric aspirate may indicate a stress ulcer and subcutaneous emphysema of the face, neck, and chest occurs with barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. Oral infections may result from prophylactic antibiotics and impaired host defenses but are not common. 27. a. Because ARDS is precipitated by a ph ysiologic insult, a critical factor in its prevention and early management is treatment of the underlying condition. Prophylactic antibiotics, treatment with diuretics and fluid restriction, and mechanical ventilation are also used as ARDS progresses. 28. a. Positi ve end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) used with mechanical ventilation applies positive pressure to the airway and lungs at the end of exhalation, keeping the lung partially expanded and preventing collapse of the alveoli and helping to open up collapsed alveoli. Permissive hypercapnia is allowed when the patient with ARDS is ventilated with smaller tidal volumes to prevent barotrauma. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and extracorporeal CO 2 removal involve passing blood across a gas-exchanging membrane outside the body and then returning oxygenated blood to the body. 2 9. b . PEEP increases intrathoracic and intrapulmonic pressures, compresses the pulmonary capillary bed, and reduces blood return to both the right and left sides of the heart. Increased PaO 2 is an expected effect of PEEP. Preload (CVP) and cardiac output (CO) are decreased, often with a dramatic decrease in BP. 30. d. When a patient with ARDS is supine, alv eoli in the posterior areas of the lung are dependent and fluid-filled and the heart and mediastinal contents place more pressure on the lungs, predisposing to atelectasis. If the patient is turned prone, air-filled nonatelectatic alveoli in the anterior portion of the lung receive more blood and perfusion may be better matched to ventilation, causing less V/Q mismatch. Lateral rotation therapy is used to stimulate postural drainage and help mobilize pulmonary secretions. Case Study 1. The patient is e xperiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure, reflected by the elevated PaCO2 and pH of 7.3. In this case, severe COPD, with destruction of alveoli and terminal respiratory units, has led to hypoventilation, with less removal of CO2 and less space for O2 in the alveoli. The patient with severe COPD always has some degree of decompensation resulting in chronic respiratory failure but an acute exacerbation or infection may cause an acute decompensation, thus producing an acute chronic respiratory failure. 2. The primary contrib uting factor to the onset of the acute respiratory failure is the pneumonia, with inflammation, edema, and hypersecretion of exudates in the bronchioles and obstructed airways (V/Q mismatch). Other factors include the presence of chronic lung disease, her age, and immunosuppression with corticosteroids. An episode of respiratory failure may represent an acute decompensation in a patient whose underlying lung function has deteriorated to the point that some degree of decompensation is always present (chronic respiratory insufficiency). 3. The primary pathoph ysiologic effects of hypercapnia are a respiratory acidosis resulting from retained CO2 and hypoxemia resulting from alveolar retention of CO 2. In addition to the patient's ABG values, clinical manifestations of hypercapnic respiratory failure that she is experiencing include the dyspnea, shortness of breath, sitting in a tripod position, and using pursed lip breathing. Other manifestations of hypercapnia that the nurse should assess the patient for include morning headache, somnolence, confusion, dysrhythmias, and muscle weakness. Because the patient is also hypoxemic, she should be assessed for mild hypertension, tachycardia, prolonged expiration, and accessory respiratory muscle use. 4. The tripod position helps to decrease the w ork of breathing (WOB) because propping the arms up increases the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest and changes pressures in the thorax. Pursed lip breathing causes an increase in SaO 2 because it slows respiration, allows more time for expiration, and prevents the small bronchioles from collapsing. 5. NIPPV is deli vered by placing a mask over the patient's nose or nose and mouth; the patient breathes spontaneously while positive pressure is delivered. It may be used as a treatment for patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure and helps to decrease the WOB, without the need for endotracheal intubation. It is not appropriate for the patient who has absent respirations, excessive secretions, a decreased level of consciousness, high O 2 requirements, facial trauma, or hemodynamic instability. 6. The nurse should monitor the patient for change in mental status, anxiety, agitation, increased pulmonary congestion, decreased I/E ratio, retraction or use of accessory muscles, pain, oxygen saturation, fatigue with breathing, dysrhythmias, decreased CO, and adequate hemoglobin concentration (should be 9g/dL to ensure adequate O 2 saturation). Maintaining protein and energy stores with enteral or parenteral nutrition will also help. 7. T reatment of acute respiratory failure is directed toward reversing the disease process that resulted in the failure. This patient's COPD is chronic and irreversible but the IV antibiotics are critical in treating the pneumonia that precipitated the acute respiratory failure. The bronchodilators and corticosteroids will help with airway inflammation and spasm but it cannot be expected that this patient will recover without treatment of the infection. 8. Because the patient will be at increased risk for respiratory failure, her discharge teaching should include a focus on preventing pneumonia with deep breathing and coughing, use of incentive spirometry to keep airways open, and ambulation. Optimizing hydration (2 to 3 L/day if cardiac and renal status can tolerate it) and nutrition are also important to decrease her risk by making secretions easier to expel. Because she already uses O 2 therapy at home, she should use the appropriate amount and delivery device to prevent blunting of her respiratory drive. She will also need to be taught about the medications she is receiving while in the hospital and before she goes home, especially if medications have changed from those she was previously taking at home.468 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

Nursing diagnoses: Impaired gas exchange related to alveolar hypoventilation Ineffective airway clearance related to increased airway resistance and secretions Ineffective breathing pattern related to expiratory obstruction to airflow Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to shortness of breath and decreased energy level Risk for impaired skin integrity related to NIPPV mask Collaborative malnutrition, muscle mass atrophy CHAPTER 69 Answer Key 1. a. 2; b. 1; c. 2; d. 4; e. 1; f. 5; g. 2; h. 3 (See Table 69-2.) 2. d. During the primary survey of emergency care, assessment and immediate interventions are made for life-threatening problems affecting airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure/environmental control. The triage system is used initially to determine the priority of care for patients and history of the illness or accident is part of the secondary survey. Any emergency department should be able to stabilize and initially treat a patient who requires specialized care before transferring to another facility if needed. 3. d. Asymmetric chest wall movement may indicate a flail chest, which requires bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen and may require intubation. A central pulse is checked and pressure is applied to a wound when there is profuse bleeding. The cervical spine is stabilized if there is any suspicion of a head or neck injury. 4. a. Specific injuries are associated with specific types of accidents and events surrounding an incident and details of the incident and the trajectory of penetrating injuries are important in identifying and treating injury. Alcohol use is assessed with blood testing and although information may be used for regulatory agencies, the primary use of the information is for treatment of the patient. 5. b. During the \"E\" step (exposure/environmental control), the nurse will remove the patient's clothing and perform a thorough physical assessment. A full set of vital signs are obtained in the \"F \" step (full set of vital signs/focused adjuncts/facilitate family presence). The \"H\" step involves eliciting history and head-to-toe assessment. The \"C\" step (circulation) includes assessing mental status and capillary refill for signs of shock. 6. b. A nasally placed tube is contraindicated if the patient has facial fractures or a possible basilar skull fracture because the tube could enter the brain. It would not be contraindicated in the other conditions. 7. c. The mnemonic AMPLE stands for allergies, medications, past health history, last meal, and events/environment leading to the illness or injury. These things will provide information to deal with the emergency situation. The other options will be assessed if pertinent but not all of them relate to health history; many are physical assessments. 8. c. Tetanus immunoglobulin provides passive immunity for tetanus and is used in treatment of a tetanus-prone wound if the patient has not had at least three doses of active tetanus toxoid. The patient would also receive tetanus toxoid to initiate active immunity in the case of tetanus-prone wounds. If the patient has fewer than three doses of tetanus toxoid and a non-tetanus-prone wound, only tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) would be administered to initiate active immunity. In the actively immunized patient, Td is administered for tetanus-prone wounds if it has been more than 5 years since the last dose and is administered for non-tetanus-prone wounds if it has been more than 10 years since the last dose. 9. b. Therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest for 24 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation (post defibrillation) improves mortality and neurologic outcomes. Patient \"b\" might benefit from this therapy. Patient \"a\" will need airway maintenance and evaluation of the cause of unconsciousness. Patient \"c\" should have ABCs monitored and begin the cooling process. Watch for dysrhythmias and provide fluid and electrolyte replacement. Patient \"d\" will need mechanical ventilation and diuretics. 10. b. Organ procurement organizations are now called to talk with families, as they are trained to screen and counsel families, obtain informed consent, and harvest organs. 11. c. Heat cramps are related to physical exertion during hot weather without adequate fluid replacement. Heatstroke is from failure of hypothalamic thermoregulatory processes. Heat exhaustion is from prolonged exposure to heat over hours or days. 12. a, d, e. In heat exhaustion, volume and electrolyte depletion, elevated rectal temperature, profuse diaphoresis, mild confusion, headache, and pupil dilation occur. Heatstroke is characterized by an elevated core temperature (above 104\u00b0F [40\u00b0C] without sweating), the need for oxygen administration and treatment with cooling methods, and a high risk of mortality and morbidity. 13. c. Rewarming of frostbitten tissue is extremely painful and analgesia should be administered during the process. The affected part is submerged in a warm water bath at approximately 98.6\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F (37\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C). Massage or scrubbing of the tissue should be avoided because of the potential for tissue damage. Blisters form in hours to days following the injury and are not an immediate concern. 14. c. Rigidness, bradycardia, and slowed respiratory rate are signs of moderate hypothermia. The ABCs are the initial priority. Active core rewarming is indicated for moderate to severe hypothermia. Axillary temperatures are inadequate to monitor core temperature, so esophageal, rectal, or indwelling urinary catheter thermometers are used. The patient should be assessed for other injuries but should not be exposed, to prevent further loss of heat. 15. b. Patients with profound hypothermia appear dead on presentation and exhibit fixed, dilated pupils; difficult-to-detect vital signs; unconsciousness; and apnea. Shivering is seen in mild hypothermia. Moderate hypothermia is characterized by slowed respirations, blood pressure (BP) obtainable only by Doppler, and rigidity. 16. d. With saltwater near-drowning fluid is drawn from the vascular space into the alveoli, impairing alveolar ventilation and resulting in hypoxia. Surfactant destruction and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occur with both saltwater near-drowning and freshwater near-drowning. Water leaks from the alveoli to the circulation with freshwater near-drowning. 17. a. Airway and oxygenation are the first priorities. A life- threatening consequence of near-drowning of any type is ANSWERS TO WORKSHEETS 469 Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Mosby, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. hypoxia from fluid-filled and poorly ventilated alveoli. Correction of metabolic acidosis occurs with effective ventilation and oxygenation. Lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline solution is started to manage fluid balance and mannitol or furosemide may be used to treat free water and cerebral edema. 1 8. a. W ood ticks or dog ticks release a neurotoxin as long as the tick head is attached to the body. Tick removal is essential for effective treatment. Tick removal leads to return of muscle movement, usually within 48 to 72 hours. There is no antidote and hemodialysis is not known to remove the neurotoxin. Antibiotics are used to treat Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which are infections spread by tick bites. 19. c. The priority care for a patient with an animal bite is to clean it with copious irrigation and debridement (if necessary). Antibiotics will be prescribed prophylactically because this patient is at greater risk for infection because of his age and because the bite occurred 8 hours ago. Caring for the patient should be done before reporting the bite to authorities, if required. Rabies prophylaxis would be needed only if the neighbor's dog had not been vaccinated. The neurotoxin virus that mammals carry is rabies and the dressing will not prevent this exposure. 20. c. Hemodialysis is reserv ed for patients who develop severe acidosis from ingestion of toxic substances. Milk or water may be used for immediate dilution of acids such as toilet bowl cleaners. Cathartics are given with activated charcoal. Whole bowel irrigation is controversial and can cause electrolyte imbalance. 21. a, b, d, e. Gastric la vage is used for patients who ingest bleach, aspirin, iron supplements, and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline). Patients who ingest caustic agents, co-ingest sharp objects, or ingest nontoxic substances should not receive lavage. 22. d. Acti vated charcoal will absorb any of the medication left in the stomach. Cathartics are usually given with activated charcoal to increase elimination of the toxins absorbed by the charcoal. N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) will be administered for acetaminophen toxicity. V omiting should never be induced in a patient who is unconscious. 23. b . Botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum is a lethal neurotoxin that is treated by inducing vomiting, enemas, antitoxin, and mechanical ventilation. Sarin is a colorless, odorless chemical agent of terrorism that affects the nervous system. Smallpox is from a virus and causes skin lesions. Tularemia is a bacterium that primarily infects rabbits and causes influenza-like symptoms in humans. 24. d. There is no established treatment for most viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever. Plague, anthrax, and tularemia are effectively treated with antibiotics if there is a sufficient supply of the antibiotics and the organisms are not resistant to them. 25. b, c, d. There are v accines available to protect patients against anthrax, botulism, and smallpox. There are currently vaccines in development for plague and tularemia, as well as a new one for botulism. There are no vaccines for the viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever. 26. b . Because hemorrhagic fever (e.g., Marburg virus, Ebola virus) causes hemorrhage of tissues and organs, care is primarily supportive. Intramuscular injections and anticoagulants are avoided. Care of the rodent or mosquito bite, if needed, is included in supportive treatment. 27. d. Disaster medical assistance teams (DMA Ts) are composed of members with health or medical skills and directly provide medical care in disaster situations. Triage is performed by first responders such as police and designated emergency medical personnel. The hospital's emergency response plan is a specific plan that addresses how personnel and resources will be used at that facility in case of a disaster and community emergency response teams provide training to communities in general to respond to disasters. Case Study 1. Adv anced age and prolonged exposure to heat over several days are risk factors for M.M.'s development of heatstroke. 2. The nurse w ould expect the following laboratory tests and alterations: Arterial blood gases (ABGs): decreased PaO2 Electrolytes: chloride, potassium Complete blood count (CBC): hemoconcentration with elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine: elevated Serum glucose: decreased Coagulation studies: decreased prothrombin time, decreased bleeding times Liver function tests: elevated enzymes Urinalysis: elevated specific gravity, protein; possible microscopic hematuria; myoglobinuria 3. T o cool M.M., clothing would be removed and he would be covered with wet sheets and placed in front of a fan. Consider immersion in a cool water bath. If the temperature is not reduced by these methods, administer cool fluids IV or lavage with cool fluids. Closely monitor the patient's temperature and prevent shivering, which increases core temperature. 4. The follo wing treatment is indicated: 100% oxygen to compensate for the hypermetabolic state, with intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary; IV crystalloid salt solution with central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring to evaluate fluid status; continuous cardiac monitoring for dysrhythmias; cooling methods with monitoring of core temperature and prevention of shivering; administration of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) if needed to control shivering during cooling process; and indwelling catheter and monitoring on intake and output. 5. M.M. 's wife should be told that M.M. is seriously ill and that there is a chance he might not recover, because heatstroke has a very high morbidity and mortality rate. She should be kept informed of the treatment he is receiving and his response to treatment and she should be provided with emotional support and an opportunity to be at her husband's bedside. 6. Nursing diagnoses: Hyperthermia related to environmental exposure Decreased cardiac output related to hypermetabolic process Deficient fluid volume related to fluid loss greater than intake Altered protection related to altered mental state Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility Collaborati ve problems: Potential complications: h ypovolemic shock, cerebral imbalance, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)This page intentionally left blankTips to Prepare for Exams Anxiety about an exam is normal. Reduce your stress by studying often, not necessarily for long periods of time. Spend at least 15 minutes every day reviewing the \"old\" material. This action alone will greatly reduce anxiety. The more time you devote to reviewing past material, the more confident you will feel about your knowledge of the topics. If you have trouble with test anxiety, the Stress-Busting Kit for Students on the website can help you learn techniques to remain calm and focused. Ask your instructor about the exam. If he or she says that the exam will cover mostly class material, spend more time reviewing your class notes. Ask about the type of questions on the exam. Knowing the type of questions will help you develop a strategy for quizzing yourself. Work with a study group to create practice tests and flash cards. Test each other on the material. Review the learning outcomes at the beginning of each chapter. Then answer the NCLEX review questions and the questions related to the case studies at the end of the chapters. On the website for the textbook, complete the NCLEX review questions and the Pre-Tests for each chapter. There are also 55 interactive case studies online; review them and answer the related questions. After you have answered all of these questions, you will have a better idea of the areas you need to study more. Schedule study time. Study at the time of day when you are most alert and able to focus best. Planning to study 8 hours in 1 day does not work. Instead, plan to study for 1 to 2 hours each day, in 20- to 30-minute blocks, and for 3 to 4 hours on a day off. Study in an area where you are free from distractions. Get a good night's sleep prior to the exam. Staying up all night to study before an exam rarely helps. It usually interferes with the ability to concentrate. Eat breakfast or lunch before the exam. This will help keep you calm and give you energy. It is best to avoid greasy, heavy foods and to avoid overeating. Before the exam, allow enough time to get to the exam room without hurrying. Sit down 10 minutes before the exam and use the time to take slow, deep breaths and relax. Do not study! During the exam, avoid distractions. Take earplugs with you and use them if the sounds of chewing gum or moving papers distract you. Choose a seat away from doors or aisles. Tips for Taking an Exam First, write down key things you are afraid you will forget, such as formulas or laboratory values, on your scratch paper or a corner of the exam. Then, develop a plan for taking the exam. Look over the entire exam. Do not read it; simply look through it to see what type and how many questions are on it. If the exam has 60 questions and you have 1 hour to take it, you know that you should answer one question per minute. Allow more time for short-answer questions. If you are taking a computerized exam, use your scratch paper to write down key words, make notes, draw diagrams, outline short answers, solve dose calculations, and keep track of questions you did not answer. Start taking the exam. Pace yourself. Read the entire question and all answer choices before answering the question. Do not assume you know what the question is asking without reading it entirely. Start by answering all of the questions that you feel confident in answering. If you cannot think of the answer to a question immediately, give it a few seconds of thought. If the answer comes to you, mark it down and move on. If not, indicate the question number so you know to come back to it and move on to the next question. If you are taking an exam with boxes on an answer sheet that will be read electronically, be sure to skip the numbers on the answer sheet that correspond to those questions you skipped. Some students find it helpful to circle or indicate the numbers of the questions they skipped on both the exam form and the answer sheet to ensure that their numbering on the answer sheet stays on track. After you have answered all questions you feel confident about, go back and answer the questions that you skipped. Check how much time is left so you know how much time you have to figure out the answers. Note if the subjects of some questions are related; through that relationship, the answers to questions you skipped may be provided within other questions of the exam. If you are having a hard time answering a multiple-choice question, reread the question while covering the answers with your hand or scratch paper. This allows you to focus on what the question is asking. Then, write down, circle, or underline all key terms in the question and answer choices. Mark a line through the answers that you think are incorrect and make an educated guess from the remaining answers. Answer every question. A question without an answer is always a wrong answer, so go ahead and guess. When you have answered all of the questions, review your exam or answer sheet to ensure that you have not skipped any questions. Make sure that any erasures on an electronic answer sheet are thoroughly erased and that the numbering has not gone off track. Turn in the exam and dispose of your scratch paper as directed.
