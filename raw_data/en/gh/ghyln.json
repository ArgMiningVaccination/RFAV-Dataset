From around the age of three, boards for balancing can be used for the activity of standing and balancing. However, younger tots can also interact with it by using it as a seat, for climbing or as a prop in pretend play. You'll need to check the manufacturer's weight limit for each specific product, but many wobble boards will comfortably hold the weight of an adult meaning the whole family can make use of it. What are some tips for safe use of a wobble board? Firstly, ensure the board is suitable for your child's age and only used under direct adult supervision. Place it on a flat, horizontal surface with plenty of clear space around it. Beware of fingers and toes at the edges and teach your child from the first time to never hold the edges. Barefoot or non-slip shoes are best to prevent slipping. What are the benefits of a wobble board? Balance boards are toys that have far-reaching benefits for children. They get little bodies moving and help strengthen muscles, improve children's spatial awareness, sense of balance, coordination and confidence. They can be a great aid for children with special needs such as [Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd) or [Autism](https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/about-autism/what-is-autism), assisting with balance, motor skills and co-ordination. Balance boards also encourage kids to get creative by facilitating lots of open-ended play. Know a wobble board we should add to our list?
