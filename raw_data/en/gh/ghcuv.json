This survey is conducted through the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Every other year the department publishes outlook information based on these surveys. Each outlook period covers 10 years. For example, in 2003 the outlook information was published for 2004-2014. Employers are asked to report the number of employees in about 770 different occupations that cover the entire U.S. labor market. From this information, staffing patterns for different industries are established. Industry growth is projected into the future based on past trends and current economic conditions. Industry staffing patterns are then applied to the industry projections to obtain occupational projections. In many cases, these occupations are broad enough to cover many more detailed specialties of an occupation. A specific occupation may be included in a broader occupational category for which labor market data is available. When you look at the statistics for a broad category, be aware that the employment data for a specific field may differ.
