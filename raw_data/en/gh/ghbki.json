The chakra system originated in India between 1500 and 500 BC. The word chakra translated to wheel and is also a metaphor for the sun. They are like disc shaped \"energetic motors\" within the mental, emotional and physical energy fields in and around your body. One could say that the chakras are like \"receivers and transformers\" and through the chakras we can take prana (life force) and vital energy and transform them into the frequencies we need in different parts of the physical, emotional and spiritual body. And yes, there is science behind this. You can see the actual energy centers measured in brainwaves and electromagnetic activity. The chakras houses our mental and emotional strengths, but if we have physical issues it created a weakness in our emotional behavior. And vice versa. So you want your chakras to be opened and balanced and there are many techniques to do that. Meditation, yoga, mantras, mudras, aromatherapy and crystal healing are a few things that can help you. And there are ways to figure out which of your chakra that is closed and imbalanced. In the traditional scriptures it is said there are 88,000 chakras in the human body. We have 7 chakras that are primary (located inside the body), a 12 chakra system (located outside our bodies) and 40 secondary chakras, located in our inner organs, back of the neck, in the palms of your hands and under the soles of your feet.
