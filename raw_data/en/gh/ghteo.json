This case is befor e the C ourt for review of the Special Master's Febr uary 12, 2009 decision di smissing T l Cedillo's pet compensa tion under the-2-National Childhood Vaccine I njury Act of 1986, 42 U .S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 1 et seq.

P etitioners a ssert t hat their da ughter, Michelle Cedillo, suffered severe aut ism and gast rointestinal injuries from various vacc ines containing the measles, mumps and rubella (\" MMR\") vaccine. This case w as the fir st of thr ee test cases under the O ffice of Special Masters' Omnibus A utism Proceeding established in July 2002 to assi st in the r esolution of ap proxim ately 5,000 autism cases pendi ng in this Court. The ot her tw o test cases, also deci ded by Speci al Masters on Febr uary 12, 2009, are Snyder v. Secr etary of Health & Human Services, No. WL 332044 ( Fed. Cl. Hazlehur st v. Secr etary of H ealth & Human Services, N o. 03-654V, 2009 WL 332258 (Fed. Cl. Spec. 03-654V, 2009 WL 2371336 (Fed. Cl. July 24, 2009). In brief summ ary, Petitioner s argue t hat Michelle Cedillo was a nor mal child for her first sixteen m onths until she expe rience d the aining thimerosal, the MMR vaccination. Pet'r B r. 2, 17 n.41, Mar. 16, 2009. Thimerosal is a compound cons isting of m ercury and ot her component s that has been us ed since t he 1930s in ver y small amount s as a pr eservative in vacc ines to pr event fungal and bacteri al contamination. Cedillo, at *17. The C edillos claim that the et hyl mercury in thimerosal and the M MR vacc ine damaged t heir daught er's immune system, and t hat due t o her immune deficiency , she w as unabl e to clear from her body the meas les virus cont ained i n the M MR vacc ine. Instead, the m easles virus persisted and replicated in Michelle's body , caus ing her to suffer inflamm atory bow el disease . The Cedillos also cont end t hat the meas les virus ultimately en tered Michelle's brain, causing inflammation and autism. In a 174 -page d ecision, Special Master G eorge H astings rejected all of P etitioners' contentions, observing that \"t he ev idence w as overw helm ingly con trary\" to the C edillos' claims. Id. at *1. Regardi ng some 23 expert witnesses w ho testified or sub mitted repo rts, he stated that \"[t]he exper t witnesses presented by the re spondent were far better qual ified, far m ore exp erienced , and far he petitioners' exp erts, concerni of acknow ledging that Michelle Cedillo \"has tragically suffered from autism and other se vere conditions,\" the Special Master co ncluded, \"the petition ers rate that [Michelle's] vacc inations played any role at all in caus ing those problems. \" Id. Petitioner s timely filed their motion for review on M arch 16, 2009, raising seven argum ents to sup port their position that the Special Master's deci sion is arbitrary, capri cious, and not in accordance with law. Respondent filed a response memorandum on April 15, 2009, and the C ourt heard oral argu ment on July 7, 2009. Like th e Special Master, t he Court expr esses its deep s ympathy and admi ration for the C edillo fami ly in car ing for Michelle, and-3-for the count less other fami lies who deal with aut ism on a dai ly basis. However, for the reasons expl ained i n det ail below, the C ourt that Petitioner s' argum ents linking Michelle C edillo's in juries to thimerosal and the MMR vaccine are without merit. Accordingly, the C ourt affirms the Speci al Cedillo was born on A ugus t 30, 1994. Id. at *4. Mrs. Cedillo's pregnanc y and M ichelle's birth were uncompl icated. Id. Records from Michelle's visits to pediatricians during her first sixteen mont hs indicate relatively normal heal th. Id. She exper ience d a fe w typical childhood ai lments, such as an episode of vomi ting and l oose stools in March 1995, and cons tipation in June 1995. Id. At two months of age , she w as able to fix her eyes and follow a moving object, and to become startled in resp onse to a lou d noise. Id. A t one year, she spoke a f ew words, crawled on her knees , and pul led her self to stand. Id. She began walking at sixteen t o eighteen mont hs, although t he record lacks precision on t his point. See Transcript of Pr ocee dings, 1332- 33, June 11- 26, 2007 ( \"Tr.\"); Ex. 28 at 207. Michelle received t wo early hepat itis B vacc inations, one i n the hospi tal shortly after her birth, and the second on Sept ember 27, 1994. Cedillo, at *4. She received a diphtheria/ tetanus /pertussi s (\"DTP\") vacc ination on O ctober 1994, a hemophi lus influenza vaccinat ion on Decem ber 27, 1994, and a polio vacci nation on March 8, 1995. Id. She als o received a t hird hepat itis B vacc ination on M arch 8, 1995. Id. She r eceived a c hicken- pox vacc ination on Sept ember 6, 1995. Id. The DTP, hepat itis B, and hemophi lus influenza vacc ines all cont ained a s mall amount of thimerosal. Id. On December 20, 1995, at fifteen mont hs of age, Michelle received an M MR vaccination at the office of her pediatrician, Dr. Daniel Crawford, of Yuma Pediatrics. Id.; Ex. 8 at 2. She next visited her pediatric ian on January 6, 1996. Cedillo, at * 5. On that visit, Mrs. C edillo reported to Dr. Crawford that, one week after the MMR vaccination, Michelle had developed a fever and rash . Id. A lthough the fever subsided, it spiked again on January 5, 1996 and was accompanied by a cough and \"gagging to the point of vomiting.\" Id. On the m orning of Jan uary 6, 1996, Michell e's temperat ure, taken at home, was 105.7 degrees. Id. Dr. Crawford later recorded her temperature as 100.3 degrees and noted that Michelle was crying and had a \"purulent postnasal drip.\" Id . Dr. Crawford diagnosed her with vs. flu\" and pr escribed ant ibiotics. Id. Michell e visited Y uma Pediat rics again on March 15, 1996 for her schedu led well- child check-up at age eighteen months. Id.; Ex. 8 at 1. Her medical records from this visit do not reflect any significant problems, stating that she see med to \"hea r well\" and \" stool[] well.\" Cedillo, at *5. However, Dr. Crawford noted that Michelle was \"talking less since An upper endoscopy is performed by inserting a tube into the mouth, down the esophagus, into2 the sto mach and the first part o f the small intestin e.

At this visit, Michelle received additional DTP a nd hemop hilus influenza vacc inations, both of which contained thimerosal. Pet'r Br. 17. Michelle did not see a physician aga in for more than one y ear. Cedillo, at *5. On April 24, 1997, Michell e vis ited another pedi atrician, Dr. Emilia notes indicate that a \"developmental delay [is] suspected\" and that she w as referring Michelle to a specialist for further evaluation. Id . O n May 2, 1997, Dr. W illiam Masland, a neur ologist, noted in Michelle's medical history that at sixteen mont hs, she had de veloped a fev er of ov er 105 d egrees two weeks after the M MR immunization and lasting four day s. Id. He added, \"[s]ince then she [had] lost he r ability to verbalize\" and concluded, \"[i]t w ould appear that there was some neurological harm done at the time of the fevers. W hether this was a post-im munization phenomenon or a separate occurrence, would be very difficult to say.\" Id. Following thes e doctors' v isits in early 1997, medical reco rds s how that M ichelle's development became quite abnormal. I d. O n July 2 1, 1997, Dr. Karlsson Roth, a devel opm ental psychologist, exami ned M ichelle and di agnos ed her with severe aut ism and profound mental re tardation, concluding that her future potential w ould be \"extremely limited.\" Id. Michelle's evaluations in later years confi rmed these diagnos es. For exampl e, on March 1, 1999, Dr. Ira Lott, a pediatric neurologist, deter mined that M ichell e had \"auti sm of a severe degree\" and that she \"[did] not have much in the way of communicative speech.\" Id. In addi tion to her severe aut ism and mental retardation, Michelle has suffered significant gastrointestinal problems. Id. at *6. Medical records indicate that Michelle bega n exper iencing chr onic diarrhe a in M ay 1999. Id. She al so suffered symptoms in 2000 sugges ting gas troesophagea l reflux di sease, erosive esophagi tis, and fe cal impaction. Id. Beginning in June 2000, Michelle under went multiple upper and lower endos copies. Id. at *6, 116. During one such pr ocedur e in Januar y 2002, a tissue sampl e was taken f rom2 Michelle's intestine. Id. at *6. The Unigenet ics Labor atory in Dublin, Ireland performed a \"Measles Virus Detection\" t est on t his tissue sampl e, and conc luded i n a M arch 15, 2002 repor t that \"meas les virus was detected\" i n the tissue. Id. However, as will be add ressed below, Speci al Master Hastings determined t hat the U nigenet ics test results were unr eliable. Id. at *30, 46, 58-59.-5-Michelle also has e xperien ced arthrit is, uveitis (inflammation of th e eyes), pancr eatitis, and s evere feeding pr oblems, requiring the us e of a feeding tube. Id. at *6, 122. In more recent years, she has su ffered from a severe seizure disorder, resulting once i n a fractured leg when she fell. Id. at * 6. The Special Master rightly observed that Michelle Cedillo cont inually has \"suffered fr om a tragic series of m edical misfortunes .\" Id. History of Pr ocee dings Petitioner s Theresa and M ichae l Cedillo filed their claim for compensa tion under the Vaccine Act on December 9, 1998. Id. at *13. Init ially, the C edillos a sserted that M ichelle's MMR vacc ine ca used her to suffer an encepha lopathy, which is a \"Tabl e Injury\" under the Vaccine A ct. Id.; Resp't Br. 2, Apr. 15, 2009. For a \"Tabl e Injury,\" the cl aimant must show that he or she received a va ccination listed on the Vaccine Injury Table, and s uffered a l isted injury within a pr escribed per iod. Upon s uch a s howing, the vac cine is presumed to have caus ed the injury, entitling the petitioner to compensa tion unl ess the respondent shows that the injury was caused by some ot her factor. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (cit ation omitted). On January 14, 2002, the Cedillos changed their petition from a \"Table Injury\" claim to a \"ca usation-in-fact\" claim. Cedillo, at *13. Under the amended pet ition, the C edillos alleged that vacci nes con taining t himerosal , in combinat ion with the M MR vaccine, cause autism. Id. at *15. A \"causation-in-fact\" claim does not carry a presumption of ca usation, and pl aces the bur den on t he petitioner to prove t hat the vac cination act ually ed the injury in ques of H HS, 440 F.3d 1317, 1320 ( Fed. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). Michelle C edillo's case is on e of approximately 5,000 Vaccine Act cases pending in this C ourt alleging that a c hild's au tism or similar disord er w as caused by one or more vaccines. Cedillo, at *7. The term \"autism\" describes a set of developmental disord ers characterized by impairments in social interaction, impairments in ver bal and non- verbal comm unication, and r estricted or repetitive pat terns of beha vior. Id. On July 3, 2002, in an effort to manage this large group of aut ism cases, the C hief Spec ial Master instituted an Omnibus Autism Procee ding (\"OAP\"). Id. at *8. Under the O AP procedur es, a gr oup of counsel known as the Petitioners' Steering Committee (\"PSC\"), selected from the attorneys representing pet itioner s in the aut ism cases, had t he respons ibility for devel oping and presenting evidence on the general causation issue of whether the vaccines in question could caus e aut ism. Id. The Speci al Masters then w ould appl y the PSC 's evidence to individual cases. Id. -6-The C hief Spec ial Master initially designated Speci al Master Hastings to preside over the O AP, and to resol ve indi vidual peti tions al leging t hat nes or t himerosal cause autism. Id. at *9. On J anuary 11, 2007, the Chi ef Special Master named two a dditional Speci al Masters, Denise Vowell and Patricia Campbel l-Smith, to preside jointly with Speci al Master Hastings over the O AP. Id. The individual petitions were divided am ong these three Speci al Masters. Id. A petitioner coul d elect to opt out of the OAP at any time if he or she did not want to await the outcome of the general causation proceedings. Id. at *9 n.14. From 2002 t o 2006, the PSC engage d in discover y on the gene ral caus ation issue. Id. at *9. On December 20, 2006 and again on J anuar y 9, 2007, the PSC propos ed that the gener al caus ation di hree theor ies: (1) the combi nation of the MMR vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism; (2) thimerosal- containing vac cines alone can cause au tism; and (3) the M MR vaccine al one can c ause autism. Id. The PSC propos ed usi ng Michelle Cedillo as a test case in June 2007 t o present the f irst ge neral cau sation theo ry. Id. T he thre e Special Masters a greed to the PSC's proposal but directed the PSC to select two additional test cases falling within the same gener al caus ation theory . Id. a t *10. Under this plan, the PSC would present its gener al causation evidence concerning the first th eory, along with evidence specific to Michelle Cedillo's case, in June 2007, after which the PSC would present the specific evi dence for the two addi tional test cases. Id. Thereafter, the Speci al Masters would use a similar appr oach for each of t he ot her two gener al caus ation theor ies. Id. The par ties subm itted a vas t amount of evi dence in the C edillo cas e on t he gene ral causation theory that the MMR vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines can combine to cause autism. Id. Special M aster Hastings conducted an evidentiary hearing in the Cedillo case during June 11-26, 2007 to hear both general causation evidence and evidence specific to M ichelle Cedillo's ca se. Id.; Tr. 1-2917. Petitioners p resented from six (molecular bi ology); Ronald Kennedy , Ph. D. (virology); Marcel Kinsbour ne, M.D. (neur ology); and Arthur (gastroenterology). Tr. 3, 301, 578A, 861, 1026. Petitioners also cal led T heresa C edillo, Michell e's mother , to tes tify as a fact w itness. Id. at 3, 30 1, 2874. Respondent prese nted testi mony Jeffrey Brent, M.D., Ph.D. (toxicology); Stephen Bust in, Ph. D. (molecular biology); Edwin Cook, M.D. (psychiatry, genet ics); Diane G riffin, M.D., Ph. D.

(virology); and Max Wiznitzer, M 1216, 2074, 2280, Ph.D. (immunology), Michael Gershon, M .D. (neur ogastroenterology), and Andrew Zimmerman, M.D. (pediatric neurology), but these-7-experts did not testify. Resp't Br. 4. Nicholas C hadwick, Ph.D. testified as a fact w itness for Respondent . Tr. 2280. Speci al Masters Vowell and C ampbell-Smith hear d all of the testimony in Cedillo so that they could apply the gene ral caus ation evi dence to the individual test cases assigned to them. Cedillo, at *10. Special Master C ampbell-Smith co nducted an evidentiary heari ng in Hazlehurst during O ctober 15-18, 2007, and Speci al Master Vowell conduct ed an e videntiary hear ing in Sny der during N ovember 5-9, 2007. Id. at *11. All three of the Speci al Masters attended these hea rings. Id. In bot h Hazlehur st and Sny der, Speci al Master Hastings permitted the Cedillo Petitioners to submit ad ditional general causation evidence, and Respondent to subm it addi tional rebuttal evidence. Id. at *14. The par ties filed ext ensive pos t-hearing briefs between N ovember 2007 and Febr uary 2008, and Speci al Master Hastings closed the evidentiary record on J uly 30, 2008. Id. at *11, 14. The evi dentiary record in these cases easily is the largest of al l cases presented to the Court in the history of the V accine A ct. Michell e Cedillo's medical recor ds al one com prise some 7,700 pages. Id. at *14. The parties filed 23 expert repo rts in C edillo, and 50 expert repor ts in Hazlehur st and Sny der combi ned. Id. Fifteen e xper t witnesses testified in Cedillo, four in Hazlehur st, and ei ght in Sny der. Id. The hea ring transcripts cons ist of 2, 917 pages in Cedillo, 1,049 pages in Sny der, and 570 page s in Hazlehur st. Id. The record in the three cases also cont ains 939 m edical journal articles, textbook exce rpts, and ot her medical literature. Id. These materials, perhaps daunt ing even t o medical professionals, relate to the subjects of neurology, gastroenterology, virology, immunology, molecular biology, toxicology, genet at *15. On Febr uary 12, Speci al Master Hastings issued hi s deci sion deny ing the Cedillos' claim under the V accine A ct. According to the Speci al Master, Petitioner s failed to demonstrate that: (1) thimerosal-containing vaccines can harm infant immune systems in gener al, or that Michelle Cedillo's own thimer osal-containing vacc inations harmed her immune system ; (2) the M MR vaccine can cause au tism in general, or that M ichelle Cedillo's own M MR vaccinat ion con tributed to her aut ism; (3) the MMR vaccine can c ause gastrointestinal dysfunct ion in gener or that Michel own MMR vacc ination contributed to own MMR vacc ination caus ed her mental retardation or seizure disorde r. Id. Fur thermore, the Speci al Master deemed unr eliable the testing Petitioner s offered to show the pre sence of the m easles virus in Michelle Cedillo and ot her autistic chi ldren. Id. The Speci al Master also found t hat the evidence conce rning the ca usation of r egressive autism combi ned w ith gas trointestinal dysfunct ion in some individuals did not persuasively show either or both cond itions t o be vacc ine-related. Id.-8-On March 13, 2009, Petitioner s filed a mot ion for recons ideration, reques ting the Speci al Master s Febr uary 12, 2009 deci sion bas ed on new evidence not available at the June 2007 hea ring. Speci al Master Hastings denied the m otion on M arch 16, 2009 because it was not filed within the 21-day period required by RCF C, Appendix B, Vaccine R ule 10( e). Cedillo v. Sec' y of HHS, No. 98-916V , 2009 W L 996299, at *1 ( Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Mar. 16, 2009) . Even i f Pet itioner s had t imely filed their motion, the Speci al Master concl uded t hat it would not be \"i n the interest of justice\" to withdraw his deci sion. Id. On that same day, Petitioner s filed w ith the C ourt their motion for review of the Speci al Master's deci sion. Discussion A. Standar d of R eview This Court has ju risdiction under the Vaccine Act to review a S pecial Master's decision upon t he timely reques t of ei ther party. 42 U .S.C. \u00a7 12(e)(1)-(2). Master's findings under an \"a rbitrary and while the C ourt legal concl under the \"not in acc ordance with law\" standar d and di scretionar y rulings for an \"a buse of di scretion.\" M unn v. Sec' y of HHS, 970 F. 2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ; see also Lampe v. Sec' y of H HS, 219 F. 3d 1357, 1360 ( Fed. Cir. 2000) ; Johns on v. Sec' y of HHS, 33 Fed. Cl. 712, 720 ( 1995) , aff'd, 99 F. 3d 1160 ( Fed. Cir. 1996) (table). Thus, when t he C ourt is deci ding w hether sion shoul d be af firmed or se t aside, it must appl y a different standar d to eac h aspect of the Speci al Master's judgm ent. See Centmehaiey v. Sec' y of HHS, 32 Fed. Cl. 612, 619 (1995), aff'd 73 F.3d 381 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (table). Combining these standards, th is Court \"may set aside the deci sion of a s pecial master only if the special master's fact findings are arbitrary and capricious, its le gal conclusions are not in accordance with law , or its discretionar y rulings are an abus e of discretion.\" Turner v. Sec' y of H HS, 268 F. 3d 1334, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 12(e)(2)(B)). On review, the V accine A ct empowers th e Court to: (1) uphold the findings of fact and conclusions of law and sustain the decision; (2) set aside any findings of fact and conclusions of law \"found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abus e of di scretion, or otherwise not in acc ordance with law . . .\"; tition to the spe cial master fo r further action in ac cordance with the c ourt's direction.\" 42 Causation Standard For \"c ausation-in-fact\" claim under the Vaccine Act, the petitioner has the bur den of pr oving a prima facie case by a pr eponder ance the evi dence . 42 U .S.C. 300aa--9-13(a)(1)(A). The pet itioner must show the fol lowing three criteria to establish that the vaccine caused the injury: 1. A medical theor y causal ly connec ting the vac cination and t he injury; 2. A logical sequenc e of c ause and e ffect showing t hat the vacc ination w as the reason for the injury; and 3. A proximate tempora l relationship between va ccination and injury. Althen v. Sec' y of H HS, 418 F. 3d 1274, 1278 ( 2005) ; see also Andreu v. Sec' y of H HS, 569 F.3d 1367, 1374- 75 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). If the pet itioner satisfies these three element s, the bur den t hen s hifts to the respondent to show by a pr eponde rance of t he evidence that other factors unrelated to the vac cine ca used the injury. See A lthen, 418 F. 3d at 12 78 (citation omitted). The causation theory advanced by a petitioner must be supported by a reliable scien tific or medical expl anation. Grant v. Sec' H HS, 956 F. 2d 1144, 1148 ( Fed. Cir. 1992) (citation omitted); see al so RCFC, App. B, Vaccine R ule 8( b) (speci al master m ust cons ider all \"relevant and reliable\" evidence ); Knuds en v. Sec' y of H HS, 35 F. 3d 543, 548 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (stating that a ca usation theor y befor e a s pecial master must be s uppor ted by a \"sound and reliable\" m edical or sc ientifi c explanation) (cit ation omitted). C. Pet itioner s' Contentions On Review The C edillos assert seven argum ents in their motion for review to show that the Special Master's decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law: (1) A panel of three Speci al Masters shoul d not have heard the gener al caus ation evi dence ; (2) The Speci al Masters shoul d not have al lowed the last-minute expe rt repor ts and t estimony of D r. Stephen Bust in; (3) The Speci al Master improper ly discount ed the medi cal diagnos es and opinions of Michelle C edillo's trea ting physicians; (4 ) The Special M aster improperly ignor ed concessions made by Respondent 's exper t witnesses; (5) The Speci al Master ignor ed important aspects of Michelle C edillo's evidence; (6) The Special M aster abused his discretion by refusing to cons ider important post-hearing evi dence ; and ( 7) the Speci al Master's decision was contrary to law. Petitioners' arguments four and five include multiple sub-parts, specifically raising the t estimony of s ix exper t witnesses and s even s ubstantive areas of Pet itioner s' evidence that the Speci al Master allegedl y mis-evaluated. Petitioners refer to the Unigenetics Laboratory as \"O'Leary Lab,\" but they are the same3 laborato ry. In this decision, the Court will refer to it as the \"Unigenetics Labo ratory .\" -10- In analyzing Petitioner s' contentions, the C ourt first will addr ess the important issue of whether the S pecial Master pro perly found the test results of the Unigenetics Laboratory unreliable. This issue cuts acro ss m any of Petitioners' arg uments on review. Petitioners3 have s aid, and t he C ourt agrees, that the reliability of t he U nigenet ics Labor atory is \"the single-most critical issue i n the case. \" Pet'r Br. 30. Tw o of Petitioners' other ar guments, regarding the significanc e of \" high copy \" number s and \"a llelic discrimination,\" relate to the testing at the Unigenet ics Labor atory, and t he C ourt will discuss them next . The C ourt then argum ents in the sequenc e presented in the mot ion for review. 1. The Test R esults of the Unigenetics Laboratory A hotly contested issue in this case is w hether the measles virus detection tests performed by the Unigenetics Laboratory in Dublin, Ireland produced reliable results. Petitioner s' exper t witnesses, Dr. Marcel Kinsbour ne and D r. Arthur Krigsman, acknowledged that their opinion on causation depended upon the existence of a reliable labor atory finding of per sistent vacc ine-strain measles in the body of t he per son tested. Cedillo, at *29, 33, 67. Thus, absent evi dence Kinsbour ne and Dr. Krigsman ca nnot show that the M MR vacc ine ca used M ichelle's autism or her inflamm atory bow el disease. The Speci al Master devoted a l engthy sect ion of hi s decis ion to this issue, concluding that the U nigenet ics test results were not reliable. Id. at *29- 65. The parties do not dispute the underlying facts relating to the Unigenetics testing. On Januar y 31, 2002, phy sicians at Sam aritan Sur gicenters in Phoeni x, Arizona p erformed a biopsy to remove a t issue sampl e from Michelle Cedillo's small intestine to be t ested by the Unigenet ics Labor atory. Id. at *30; Ex. 44 at 13-14. On March 15, 2002, after performing measles detection testing on t he tissue sampl e, the U nigenet ics Labor atory repor ted that \"measles vi rus w as det ected\" in t he tissue. Cedillo, at *30; Ex. 28 at 179. Unigenet ics al so performed meas les detection testing on ot her persons, and r epor ted the results in an ar ticle, V. Uhlmann et al., Potential Viral Pathogen ic Mecha nism for N ew Variant Inflammatory Bowel Disease , 55 MOL ECULAR PATH OLOGY at *30 n.58. One o f the c o-authors of this article was D r. Andrew Wakefield, a B ritish physician w ho had as serted in 1998 t hat the M MR vaccine can cause aut ism. Id. The Uhlmann St udy concl uded t hat the meas les virus was detected in a large m ajority of t he devel opm entally-disabled chi ldren tested, but only in a few of the deve lopm entally-normal-11-children tested. Id. at *31. The U nigenet ics testing of M ichelle's tissue sampl e and t he results of the Uhlmann Study are key component s of Pet itioner s' caus ation-in-fact evidence . Dr. John O'Leary and his co lleagues formed Unigenetics Laboratory Ltd. as a f or- profit company to perform testing for the meas les virus, principally to provide testing of claimants in British aut ism litigation. Id. at *30. Although t he gene ral reput ations of Unigenet ics and D r. O'Leary are good, id. at *46, Respondent presented evi dence of significant shortcomings in the meas les detection w ork at Unigenet ics. For exampl e, Unigen etics w as not an ac credited l abor atory, and i t decl ined t o par ticipate in any independe nt qual ity cont rol program. Id. at *36, 47. Respondent 's exper ts observed t hat after-the-fact alterations had bee n made i n Unigenet ics' labor atory notebooks , casting doubt on the credibility of the procedures used. Id. at *3 6, 38. Dr. Thomas M acDonald, an expert witness for Respondent in Hazlehur st, testified that the U hlmann St udy was \"one of the worst\" medi cal journal articles he has ever seen, that the M olecular Pathology journal is \"the worst journal that has ever been seen,\" and t hat the journal is \"no l onger in exi stence .\" Id. at *39. Unigenetics apparently dissolve d as a business in 2 005, although Dr. O'Leary's Dublin labor atory cont inues to oper ate and publ ish work. Id. at *32. From a medi cal standpoi nt, Respondent 's exper ts were highly critical of U nigenet ics and t he U hlmann St udy. The testing m ethod us ed in the U hlmann S tudy is know n as polymerase cha in reaction (\"PCR\"). Id. at *31. Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Brian W ard, testified that PCR is a sensitive testing tech nique, and not easy to per form proper ly. Id. at *34. Dr. Ward explained that the possibility of contamination is a serious problem in PCR testing, and often can y ield fal se pos itives. Id. Dr. MacDonald criticized t he U nigenet ics testing pr ocedu res as pr oduci ng an unac ceptably high exper imental failure rate, using the wrong t echni cal controls, and cl aiming pos itive or negat ive out comes on a \"subjective or spurious\" bas is. Id. at *43. The U hlmann St udy in 2002 added t o the cont rover sy on whether the M MR vacc ine might be ca using aut ism, and l ed some medi cal exper ts to ques tion the conc actually had bee n det ected in the tested chi ldren. Accordingly, other researchers under took s eparate studies to see if they coul d replicate the results of t he Uhlmann St udy. Id. at *32. Two such st udies repor ted in 2006, know n as the A fzal Study and the D'Souza Study, cast serious doubt on the out come of t he U hlmann St udy. Id. In the Afzal Study, the researchers used a number of testing m ethodol ogies, but found none of t he sampl es positive for measles virus for any test. Id. Similarly, in the D 'Souza St udy, the researchers tested the bl ood cel ls of 88 chi ldren, 54 of t hem di agnos ed w ith aut ism spectrum disorders and 34 deve lopm entally-norm al chi ldren. Id. All but six of t he chi ldren had received t he MMR vacc ine. Id. The researchers concl uded that none of t he studied chi ldren had per sistent measles virus infection. Id. \"Primers\" are short pieces of DNA or ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") in pos itive fi ndings of m easles virus for nearly all of the tested sampl es, just as the Uhlmann Study had. Id. However, the D 'Souza group t hereafter subjected the positive sampl es to addi tional testing techni ques invol of \"melting curves\" and the size of \"amplicons.\" Id. The use of these two techni ques revea led that all but nine of the initially positive sampl es were in fact not measles virus. Id. For the ni ne remai ning positive sampl es, the D 'Souza t eam per formed a f urther procedure known as \"sequencing.\" Id. at *33. Described as the \"gold standard\" for determining w hether the mat erial being exami ned ac tually is measles virus, id., \"sequencing\" involves ascertaining the nucleotide order in a particu lar segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (\"DNA\"), se e Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at * procedur the remai ning nine pos itive sampl es, and all seven t urned out not to cont ain the measles virus. Cedillo, at *33. Although t he mat erial had appe ared to be meas les virus after the PC R testing, \"sequencing\" s howed that it was instead human genet ic mat erial. Id. The D'Souza group determ ined that the p ublished results of the Uhlmann Study were \"unlikely to be t rue.\" Id. In the D 'Souza St udy, the aut hors advanc ed pl ausible udy's that measles virus had bee n det ected in the tissue sampl es. Id. Principally, the D 'Souza S tudy found that the \"pr imers\" used in the Uhlmann Study were n ot as \"specific\" as needed to identify positively measles virus material, as oppos ed to some other material. Id. The D 'Souza gr oup concl uded t hat the U hlmann4 Study mistakenl y identified human genet ic mat erial as measles virus material. Id. Respondent 's exper ts noted other serious conce rns about the U hlmann St udy and t he Unigenet ics Labor atory that w ould cast doubt on t heir repor ted results. Id. at *34- 39. Among t hese were the improper use of \" controls.\" Id. at *36. In a labo rator y setting, \"positive c ontrols\" are s amples that po ssess the targe ted gene, while \"negative controls\" are sampl es that do not possess the t argeted gene . Id. During a l abor atory's PCR testing, the positive co ntrols always should t est positive, and the negati ve controls always should t est negat ive. Id. If these results are not obtained, a labor atory's test procedur es are not working properly. Id. At Unigenetics, the laboratory obtained positive results from negative controls for appr oximately one- third of t he testing pr ocedur es. Id. Accor ding to Respondent's experts, another problem w ith the Uni genetics testing involved \"discordant replicates.\" Id. at *37, 38. In testing two samples from the same source, the results sho uld eit her b e positive fo r bot h sam ples or nega tive fo r bot h sam ples. Id. at *37. However, Unigenet ics revealed i nstances o f one positive an d one negati ve tes t-13-from t he same source. Id. In such circumstances, Uni genetics should have retested the sampl es, but it repor ted the flawed result as a positive test instead. Id. One expe rt observed that the U nigenet ics pract ice of simply ignoring the negati ve tes t \"is a w holly unscientific practice and indicates bias in the interpretation of t hese results.\" Id. at *38. Respondent's experts c oncluded that the Unigenetics test resu lts were unreliable. Dr. Ward testified that he could place no reliance on the work of the Unigenetics Laboratory. Id. at * 35. Dr. Bustin determined that Unigenetics erroneously detected a DNA contaminant, and di d not detect the meas les virus. Id. at *37. He opi ned, \"I do not believe t here is any measles virus in any of the cas es they have l ooked at .\" Id. Dr. Bertus Rima, an expe rt for Respondent who testified in Sny der, stat ed that the U nigenet ics testing \"s imply does not work,\" m eaning that such testing is n ot able to detect reliably whether measles virus is present. Id. at *38. As noted above, Petitioner s' exper ts, Dr. Kinsbour ne and D r. Krigsman, relied upon the Unigenet ics test results in concl uding that the M MR vacc ine ca uses autism, but they could not opine o n the v alidity of the testi ng. Petitioners p resented tw o other e xperts, Dr. Karin H epner and Dr. Ronald K ennedy, who thought that the U nigenetics test resu lts were reliable. Id. at *33- 34. Dr. Hepner attempted to di stingui sh the 2006 A fzal and D 'Souza studies, pointing out that the re searchers tested bl ood cells of the chi ldren in those tests, not intestinal material. Id. at *33. Dr. Kennedy testified about a meeting that he and ot her scientists attended w ith Dr. Orla Shei ls, a col league of D r. O'Leary. Id. at *34. Dr. Kennedy and t he ot her scientists asked many ques tions of Dr. Shei ls regarding the U nigenet ics testing procedures. Id. Dr. Kennedy formed the impression that the testing was valid. Id. Weighing al l of t he evi dence , the Speci al Master concl uded t hat the U nigenet ics testing for the det ection of m easles virus was not reliable. Id. at *39. The Speci al Master emphasi zed t hat other researchers had been unabl e to replicate the U nigenet ics findings. Id. at *40-41. He found it sig nificant that Unigenetics had failed to employ \"sequencing\" in its testing proced ures. Id. at *41-43. H e was troubled by the m any problem s with Unigenet ics' procedur es, facilities, and equi pment. Id. at *43- 45. Among t hese were the fa ilure to empl oy \"blinding\" procedures so that the lab oratory tech nicians would not know whether the sampl es being test ed were from the p atient gro up of interest. Id. at *4 3. These procedures a re regar ded as \"cr itical\" to prevent conscious or subco nscious bias from affecti ng test results. Id. The Speci al Master found t he ef forts of Dr. Hepner and D r. Kennedy to defe nd the Unigenetics work largely ineffective. Id. at *44. Their testimon y was \"too summa ry and nonspecific to answer the criticism s leveled by Drs. B ustin and Rima, which were specific and det ailed.\" Id. Moreover , even the U nigenet ics' test results failed to identify any vacc ine- strain measles, which w ould have be en cr itical to linking the MMR vaccine to aut ism or inflamm atory bow el disease. Id. at *51- 53. Petitioner s neede d to show that the meas les virus-14-allegedl y detected in Michelle's tissue sampl e der ived fr om the M MR vacc ine, rather than the natural, \"wild\" form of measles virus, but they did not. Id. at *51. On balance , the Speci al Master hat Respondent's ts, Drs. Ward, Bustin, Rima, and MacDonald, had \"vastly more experience and academic credentials\" than P etitioners' expert, Dr. Hepner , and t exce eded D r. Kennedy 's. Id. at *58. The Court performed a detailed review of the record and the Special M aster's analysis of the U nigenet ics testing. The C ourt agrees with the Speci al Master t hat the evi dence strongl y favor s Respondent 's position. Aside from the superior qual ifications and expe rience of R espondent 's exper ts, the C ourt finds the results of the 2006 Afzal and D 'Souza s tudies to be most compel ling. The researchers in those studies sought to replicate the U hlmann Study upon which Pet itioner s so heavi ly rely. Not onl y did the A fzal and D 'Souza researchers fail to replicate the results of the U hlmann St udy, they came t o a conc lusion directly oppos ite to the Uhlmann St udy, and t hey offe red likely reasons to expl ain how the Uhlmann St udy had gone a stray. The C ourt also finds that the fl aws in the U nigenet ics Labor atory procedur es were so per vasive that the test results simply cannot be trusted. Without the test results o f the Unigenetics Laboratory, Petitioners have lost a cornerstone t o their caus ation theor y. The fa ct that Petitioner s did not prove t he exi stence of any persistent vaccine-stra in measles in Michelle C edillo's body leaves Petitioners well short of meeting their prima facie case that the MMR vacc ine played any role in c ausing Michelle's autism. Under the se ci rcumst ance s, Petitioner s failed to meet their burden of proof by a pr eponder ance of the evidence , and thus the bur den neve r shifted to Respondent to rebut Petitioner s' proof. See A lthen, 418 F. 3d at 1278. The Speci al Master's deci sion regarding the U hlmann St udy and t he U nigenet ics testing is reasonabl e in all respects, and could not in any sense be r egarded as arbitrary, capr icious, or an abus e of di scretion. 2. The S ignificance of \"H igh Copy Numbers\" Petitioners argue that, even if the reliability of the Unigenetics' testing procedures is subject to ques tion, the test results shoul d be accepted as accurate when the pr esence of the measles virus is high. See P et'r Br. 45-49. Respondent has expl ained t hat, in PC R testing, a \"copy num ber\" is the repor ted amount of m easles virus in a gi ven s ampl e. Resp't Br. 35 n.24. Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Rima, testified that the \"c opy num ber\" in a PC R test is the ratio bet ween t he number of ac tual copi es found of t he target, such as t he F- gene of the measles virus, and the number of copies found of a \"housekeeping gene,\" present in all cells of the body . Cedillo, at *50. Thus, the ratio of t he meas les gene t o the hous ekee ping gene is the number tha t has sign ificance. Id. W hen Unigenetics ported a \"high copy number\" of s virus, it did not nece ssarily mean t hat a large amount of m easles virus-15-had bee n found , or that a \"hi gh copy num ber\" meant that the tests shoul d be cons idered reliable. Id. at *50- 51. Dr. Rima fur ther expl ained t hat even \" high copy num bers\" can be t he result of contamination. Id. at *51. The extremel y high copy num bers for some sampl es, such as for Michelle Cedillo, were so high as to be \"compl etely and utterly biologically implausible\" on their face. Id. Dr. Rima stated that if the ce lls in those sampl es really had w ithin them as many copies of the measles virus F-gene as reported, they wou ld be so \"stuffed\" with the measles v irus F-gene alone tha t there would be no room in the cells for the other n ecessary cell component s, such as t he hous ekee ping gene. Id. Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Ward, agreed with Dr. Rima's assessment. Id. According to the Speci al Master, the Petitioner s did not reply to this argum ent. Id. The Speci al Master devot ed a s eparate section of his deci sion to the \"hi gh copy num bers\" issue, finding that even w here Unigenet ics had det ected a l arge amount of m easles virus, he still coul d not deem the U nigenet ics testing pr ocedur es accurate. Id. at *50- 51. The Special Master relied upon Dr. Bustin's t estimony that t he testing could not be tr usted just beca use Unigenet ics repor ted a \" high cop y number.\" I d. at *51. Based upon al l of t he evidence , the Speci al Master doubt ed that Unigenet ics ever reliably detected the pr esence of measles virus. Id. If the tests themsel ves are clear ly flawed, the Speci al Master saw no reason to think that a \"strong pos itive\" r esult is any more trustworthy than a \" weak pos itive\" result. Id. Upo n careful review, the Cou rt finds the Special Master's determination reasonabl e and j ustified on t he record presented. The C ourt sees no bas is to concl ude t hat the Speci al Master's treatment of the \"hi gh copy num bers\" issue is arbitrary, capr icious, or an abus e of di scretion. Finally, Petitioner s argue t hat the Spec ial Master ignor ed evi dence from two other labor atories, the C otter labora tory and t he O ldstone l abor atory, which al legedl y replicated Unigenetics' test results with respect to high copy numbers. Pet'r Br. 46. Petitioners claim that Dr. Bustin act ually provided s uppor t for the reliability of U nigenet ics testing by comparing its findings with those of the Cotter laboratory, and demonstrating that the two labor atories agreed on t he test results for high cop y num bers. Id. at 46-47. The Speci al Master, how ever, drew no concl usions from these studies beca use of very limited evi dence on this issue. The Speci al Master observed t hat \"[n] o records of D r. Cotter's work, and no testimony or statement from him, have be en pr esented\" a nd therefore \"[n]o concl *41. With regard to Dr. Oldstone, the al Master stated, \"[b] ecause Dr. Oldstone hi mself did not testify, and beca use his data were not published (for whatever reason), I have not placed any reliance on this item of evidence.\" Id. at *45 n. 75.-16-The C ourt agrees that, if the w ork of D r. Cotter or Dr. Oldstone had a ny significanc e, Petitioner s shoul d have called them t o testify. The Speci al Master had di scretion to decl ine any conclusions from these studies because of the limited evidence. See Whitecotton v. Sec'y of HHS, 81 F.3d 1099, 1108 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"Congress d esired the s pecial masters to have ve ry wide di scretion w ith respect to the evi dence they would cons ider and t he w eight to be assign ed to tha t evid ence.\"). 3. Allelic Discrimination Petitioners have explained \"allelic discrimination\" as a process used by scientists to ascertain whether a vi rus is of w ild origin or of vacc ine-strain origin. Pet'r Br. 49. Citing Exhibit 130, Petitioner s assert that the U nigenet ics Labor atory used \"a llelic discrimination\" to determine whether the measles virus detected in Michelle C edillo's tiss ue sample was in fact vacc ine-strain measles virus. Id. They argue t hat the Special Master failed to cons ider the evi dence regarding \"al lelic di scrimination.\" Id. Pet itioner s' imply in their brief that crediting Exhibit 130 would have caused the Special M aster to conclude that vaccine-stra in measles were det ected in Michelle's tissue sampl e. See i d. The Special Master included a separate sec tion in the dec ision expl aining the reasons why he di d not give any significant weight to Exhibit 130. Cedillo, at *52- 53. Exhibit 130 is a one- page doc ument that Petitioners f iled on J anuar y 31, 2008, seven mont hs after the concl usion of t he evi dentiary hear ing. Id. at *52. Appar ently, Petitioners d id not even present the issue of wild measles versus vacc ine-strain measles in their initial post-hearing brief. Id. Exhibit 130 is barely legible, but describes four brief \"synops es of pape rs,\" one of w hich appar ently is a reference to the U hlmann St udy. Id. This synops is indicates use of the techni que know n as \"allelic discrimination.\" Id. The Speci al Master observed that none of Petitioners' expert w itnesses in Cedillo, Snyder, or Hazlehurst e ven addressed this synops is or endor sed its accuracy. Id. The S pecial Master al so no ted that , if Exhibit 130 co ntains a relevan t synopsis, Petitioner s failed to present the ent ire reference d article. Id. The synops is is only a br ief summary of a pilot study, with no details provi ded. Id. Further, if a larger article exis ts, there is no evidence that the authors submitted the article for scientific peer review and publ ication. Id. Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Rima, did addr ess a \"pi lot stud y\" in the Sny der hearing, which m ay have be en the s ame st udy reference d in Exhibit 130. Id. at *53. However, Dr. Rima explained that the study did not discriminate accurately between wild measles virus and vacc ine-strain measles virus. Id. Petitioner s offe red no evi dence to rebut Dr. Rima's testimony. Id.-17-The Special Master concl uded t hat Exhibit 130 di d not offe r any significant evidence that vacc ine-strain measles virus existed in the biologic material of any autistic per son. Id. He det ermined t hat Petitioner s did not demonst rate the exi stence of m easles virus of any type in the body of M ichelle Cedillo or of any other autistic child. Id at *51. By the Speci al Master's rejection of the Unigenetics' testing altogether, an d his finding of no credible evidence that measles virus exi sted in any aut istic per son, the ques w hether Unigenet ics used \"al lelic discrimination\" t o differentiate among m easles viruses is a rather meaningless inquiry. The Court finds no error in the Special M aster's analysis of \"allelic discrimination\" or the minimal weight that he as cribed t o Exhibit 130. Whitecotton, 81 F. 3d at 1108. 4. The Panel of Three Special Masters Petitioner s cont end t hat the us e of a panel of t hree Spec ial Masters to hear the \"gene ral caus ation\" evi dence in the C edillo cas e was arbitrary, capr icious, an abus e of discretion, and not in acc ordance with the law. Pet'r Br. 26-29. Petitioner s argue that, when PSC members proposed Cedillo to be hear d as the fi rst test case for the O AP, they believed Special Master H astings was uniquely qualified to hear i t becau se he ha d co nsiderable experience in handling other test cases under the Vaccine Act. Id. at 27. The PSC objected to the appoi ntment of t wo addi tional Speci al multiple Spec ial Masters add ressing nearly identical issues of law, fact, science and medi cine . . . will gener ate significant confus ion and delay at the appe llate level, further slowing pr ogress towards resolving cl aims in the omnibus.'\" Id. at 28 (citing O AP Autism Master File, PSC Reply Br., 2, Feb. 26, 2007) . The Cedillos now assert that they had t he bur den of pe rsuading not one, but three, Speci al Masters of their causation-in-fact claim. Id. at 28. Pet itioner s allege t hat this addi tional burden violated the fundamental fairness requirement of Vaccine Rule 8. Id. at 29. As explained below, the Court sees no merit to P etitioners' argument. Vaccine R ule 8 gi ves the special masters latitude, dependi ng on the ci rcumst ance s of each case, to determine the format for taking evidence and hearing arguments. See Vaccine Rule 8. Rule 8(b) addr esses the conc ept of funda mental fairness to which Pet itioner s allude, stating, \"[i]n receiving evi denc e, the special master will not be bound by comm on law or statutory rules of evi dence but must cons ider all relevant and r eliable evi dence gover ned by principles of fundamental fairness to both parties.\" Id . Vaccine Rule 8 does not prohibit multiple special masters from presiding at an evi dentiary hear ing. While it may be true that requiring Petitioners to persuade three special masters of their \"gene ral caus ation\" t heor y would have vi olated the funda mental fairness provision of Vaccine Rule 8, Petitioners cite nothing i n the Sp ecial Master's decis ion or the record to-18-indicate that they were hel d to an i mpermissible bur den. To the cont rary, while Special Masters V owell and Campbell-Smith sat on the bench with him during the e videntiary hearing, Special Master Hastings expl ained t hat the role of t he two addi tional Speci al Masters was not to decide Cedillo, but to hear the general causation evidence provided by exper t witnesses so that they coul d apply the evi dence to the ot her individual test cases assigned t o them. Cedillo, at *10. Speci al Master Hastings noted, 'gener al caus ation' evidence is comm on to the three cases, each of us has anal yzed t hat comm on evidence independe ntly of the ot her two; each has reached hi s or her own concl usion.\" Id. at *11 n.15. A review of the record and the Special Master's d ecision shows tha t Petitioners w ere not required to persuade Special M asters Vowell and Campbell-Smith of the merits o f their case. The as signm ent of t wo addi tional Speci al Masters to hear the \"ge neral caus ation\" evidence in the test cases, and to assist in deciding some 5,000 autism cases, is a n eminently reasonabl e case management appr oach. When as ked at the or al argum ent to identify any prejudice fr om having a panel , Petitioner s' couns el responded, \"I don' t know that there was any, Your Honor .\" Tra nscript of Pr ocee dings, 19, July 7, 2009 ( \"Oral Arg. Tr.\"). Petitioner s have fai led to establish that the pr esence of three special masters required them t o convi nce a nyone bey ond Speci al M aster H astings to prevail in their case, and, therefore, their chal lenge t o the pr ocedur es used at the hea ring is unavai ling. 5. Allowance of Dr. Bustin's Testimony and Expert Reports Petitioners contend that the Special M aster's decision shortly before the hearing to allow the expe rt repor ts and t estimony of D r. Stephen Bust in was arbitrary, capr icious, and an abus e of di scretion. Pet 'r Br. 29-31. On May 31, 2007, twelve day s befor e the start of the evi dentiary hearing, Respondent filed E xhibit UU, an exper t repor t from Dr. Bustin. Id. at 29. One w eek l ater, on J une 7, 2007, Respondent filed two more reports from Dr. Bustin, Exhibits XX and W W. Id. These exhi bits addresse d the reliability of t he U nigenet ics Labor atory testing. Id. at 30. Petitioner s claim that they were har med by havi ng to review these highly technical exhibits and prepare for cross-examination of Dr. Bustin with so little time before the hearing. Id. Petitioners assert that, with respect to Exhibits XX and WW, \"Michelle's couns el neede d more time to digest the cont ents of the 123- page hi ghly techni cal repor ts.\" Id. Claimants in Great Britain also have asserted that MM R vac cinations cause autism. Saye rs v.5 SmithKline B eecham PLC, [2004] EWH C (QB) 1899. In the British leg al system , a governm ent b ody known as the Legal Se rvices C ommission (\"LS C\") provided fundin g to claim ants to assist in ass embling and presentin g evidence in su pport of claim s. Cedillo, at*35 n.69. In Septem ber 2 003, the LSC ceas ed fundin g autism claim s because the cla imants w ere n ot lik ely to demonstrate that the MMR vaccination s caused autism. Id. (citation omit ted). Lacking LSC funding, most autism claimants in Great Britain have not pursued their claims. Id. (citation omitted). -19-The exhi bits in ques tion ar e expert rep orts that Dr. Bustin prepared and f iled in the British MMR/autism proceedings during 2003 and 2004. Cedillo, at *60. repor ts in the B ritish procee dings are under seal, and may not be di vulged w ithout the permission of t he B ritish cour t. Id. at *35 n. 69. Respondent 's couns el sought leave of the British court to use Dr. Bustin's expert reports after the filing of Petitioners' expert reports in this case on Febr uary 20, 2007. Id. at *61. At that point, it beca me clear to Respondent that Petitioner s' theor y of ca usation depende d upon the val idity of the U nigenet ics testing. Id. Respondent 's couns el received Dr. Bustin's exper t repor ts from the B ritish procee dings on June 7, 2007, and fi led Exhi bits XX and W W in the C edillo case within one hour of receivin g them . Id. The Special Master f ound no fault or lack of diligence on Respondent's part in obt aining and fi ling D r. Bustin's exper ts. Id. The Speci al Master expl ained t hat a number of ot her evidentiary items w ere filed at a very late stag e in th ese test autism cases, in cluding the reports of Petitioners' ex perts, Dr. Hepner and D r. Kennedy , as well as other document s received af ter the May 25, 2007 deadline for filing exhibits. Id. Typically in Vaccine Act cases, the special m asters lib erally allow late-filed exhi bits, favor ing a pol icy to hear all of the relevant evidence rather than decide a c ase bas ed upon i ncompl ete evi dence . Id. at *62. In such ci rcumst ance s, the special masters frequent ly will allow addi tional respons ive evi dence to be fi led af ter the hea ring, or they will convene a second hearing where nece ssary. Id. Speci al Master Hastings offe red these opportunities to Petitioners here. See Evidentiary Ruling, 2, June 8, 2007. Ultimately, Petitioner s subm itted from Dr. Hepner and D r. Kennedy on October 22, 2007 and November 6, 2007 respectively, but Petitioners did not request a further evidentiary hear ing. Cedillo, at *62. At the July 7, 2009 oral a rgument, the C ourt asked Pet itioner s' couns el how the handl ing Bustin's repor ts B ritish procee dings prejudiced the C edillos, if at all. Oral Arg. Tr. 21. Petitioner s' couns el could not identify any prejudice aside fr om short-term disruption, expl aining that he t hought Dr. Bustin was helpful to the Cedillos' case, and adm itting, \"there was no ul timate prejudice\" from 21, reasons addr essed above , and desc ribed i n gr eater detail in the Speci al Master's decision, Cedillo, at *59-65, the C ourt concludes th at the Special Master's admi ssion of D r. Bustin's repor ts was reasonabl e, Petitioner s suffered no pr ejudice therefrom, and t he Speci al Master did not abuse hi s discretion in this regard. Whitecott on, 81 F.3d at 1108. The S pecial Master fu rther o bserved, and the C ourt agrees, that he w ould have decided the petition on the merits the same way even if he had disregarded D r. Bustin's testimony and expe rt repor ts. Cedillo, at of Tre ating Phy sicians Petitioners argue that the Special M aster discounted the opinions of Michelle Cedillo's treating phy sicians, allegedl y affording t he y no probative value.\" Pet'r Br. 32-33. Based upon precedent from the United States C ourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, this Court must give due regard to the medical records of treating phy sicians. Andreu, 569 F.3d at 1375 (\"[T]reating physicians are likely to be in the best position to det ermine w hether a logical sequenc e of and e ffect show[s] that the vacc ination w as the reason for the injury.\") (quot ing C apizzano, 440 F.3d at 1326) (second alteration in original); see also Zatuchni v. Sec' y of H HS, 69 Fed. Cl. 612, 623- 24 (2006) (relying upon m edical records of treating phy sicians in con clud ing that the pet itioner s had established ca usation under the V accine A ct). In this case, P etitioner s cite to the medi cal records of seven treating physicians who al legedl y \"associated [M ichelle's] illness with her MMR vacc ine.\" Pet 'r Br. 32. As the Special Master observed i n his deci sion, most of t he medi cal records of treating physicians merely indicate an a warenes s of a t empora l relationship bet ween t he fe ver Michelle C edillo experienced after the MMR vaccination and the onset of her autistic symptoms sometime thereafter. Cedillo, at *128. None of the treating phy sicians concl uded that the MMR vaccine caused Michelle's autism. Petitioners conceded this fact both in their motion for review, Pet'r Br. 32-33, and at oral argum ent, Oral Arg. Tr. 11. Moreover , none of the treating phy sicians testified at the hea ring. Id. at 12. A May 2, 1997 l etter from an A rizona ne urologist, Dr. William Masland, deserves particular m ention. Ex. 28 at 20 7. After ex amining Michelle Cedillo on May 2, 1997, Dr. Masland noted that Michell e lost her speaking ab ility after her post-MMR fever epis odes. Id. He fur ther stated, \"[i]t would appea r that there was some neur ological harm done at the time of t he fe vers.\" Id. He adde d, \"[w]hether this was a pos t-immunization phenomenon or a separate occ urrence , would be ver y difficult to say.\" Id. The Special Master concluded that Dr. M asland's le tter, a t most, sp eculated as to whether the M MR vacc ine w as caus ing M ichelle's neur ologic abnormality and di d not-21-constitute an opinion that the M MR vaccine caused Michelle's a utism. Cedillo, at *128. Dr. Masland di d not attribute the hi gh fevers to t he M MR vacc ine, and as the Speci al Master rightly noted, Michelle had not yet been diagnos ed with autism. Id. at *129. When meas ured against the ar ray med ical exper ts who testified unequi vocal ly that the M MR vacc ine di d not caus e Michelle's autism, the Speci al Master placed little weigh t on t he single-page l etter where Dr. Masland s imply ques tioned w hether the M MR vacc ine, the gh fevers, M ichelle's neur ologic condi tion were caus ally-related. Id. In ords of the Special Master, \"[i]t seems asto nishing for petitioners to n ow suggest D ained s pecul ations cont ained i n his letter of M ay 2, 1997, shoul d be held to out weigh the opi nions of those expe rts for respondent .\" Id. Once a gain, Petitioner s incor rectly cont end t hat the Speci al Master afforded t he records of the treating physicians \"abs olutely no probative val ue.\" Pet 'r Br. 32. The Speci al Master devo ted a sep arate section of the decis ion to the r ecords of the t reating physicians. Cedillo, at *127-29. As the C ourt finds that t he S pecial Master pr operly evaluat ed these recor ds, it will not disturb t he S pecial Master's conclusi ons. 7. Alleged \"Concessions\" of c ontend that the S pecial f ailed to co nsider certain e videntiary \"concessions\" made an d \"h scientists who strongl of the petitioner s' exper ts.\" Id. at 33. However, Petitioner s assert that the Speci al Master relied s olely upon t he number Respondent 's evidentiary conce ssions. Id. at 34. Pet itioner s state that \"the special master found t he respondent's experts' conclusions reliable, but their concessi ons unreliable.\" Id. This, they claim, was arbitrary, capr icious, and an a buse of di scretion. Id. Petitioner s have identified six of Respondent 's exper t witnesses whose conc essions the Speci Steph en Bustin, Dr. Bertus Rima, Dr. Diane Griffin, Dr. Brian W ard, Dr. Stephen H anaue r, and Dr. Rober t Fujinami . Id. at 34-44. The testimony of Dr. Bustin and Dr. Rima reg arding the re liability of the Unigenetics Laboratory testing al ready has been a ddressed above . Contesting the manner in which the Speci al Master eval uated expe rt testimony presents an extreme uphill challenge to Petitioners. The Federal Circuit has explained the fact-finding and revi ew process i n Vaccine A ct cases:-22-With regard to both fact-findings and fact-based conclusions, the key deci sion m aker in the fi rst instance is the special master. The [Court of Feder al Claims] owes these findings and conc lusions by the spec ial master great defe rence - no change may be made abs ent first a det ermination that the s pecial master was \"arbitrary and capri cious.\" Thi s is a standard wel l understood to be the most deferential possible. Munn, 970 F. 2d at 870 ( citation om itted); see also Hodges v. Sec' y of H HS, 9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (\"The st atute makes clear that, on review, the Court of Feder al Claims is not to second guess the Special M aster's fact-intensive conclusions; the standard of review is uniquely defe rential for what is essentially a judicial proces s.\") (citation omitted). The Federal Circuit also has observed that the abuse of discretion standard \"will rarely come into play exce pt where the special master excl udes evidence .\" M unn, 970 F. 2d at 870 n. 10. Upon car eful review of the \"c onces sions\" cited by Petitioner s, the C ourt finds that Respondent 's exper t witnesses indeed a greed w ith some aspects of Pet itioner s' theor y of caus ation. However, in their motion for review, Petitioner s simply have w oven t ogether as many areas of agr eement as pos sible, and have blindly overlooked t he compel ling concl usions advanc ed by Respondent 's exper ts. A few exampl es may be instructive. Petitioner s cite a num ber of \"conc essions\" by Dr. Griffin and Dr. Ward. Pet'r Br. 36- 42. Dr. Griffin agreed that a \"target organ\" of the measles virus is the gastrointestinal trac t, id. at 36, and t hat Michelle Cedillo's first feve r after the M MR vaccination pr obabl y was related to the M MR vacc ine, id. at 37. Dr. Griffin expl ained, how ever, that the second f ever a few days later probably was not a result of the MMR vaccine. Cedillo, at *129 n.203. Dr. Griffin has been s tudying the meas les virus for more than 30 y ears, and s he testified that \"[w]e know a lot about what measles virus does when it gets in the brain, and none of it is autism.\" Id. at *68. She al so testified that Dr. Kinsbour ne's hypothesis that the meas les virus enters t he brain a nd causes a utism is not biolog ically plausible. Id. S imilarly, Dr. Ward agreed with some of the points advanced by Petitioners, bu t his overall conclusions staunchly oppos ed Pet itioner s' theor y of ca usation. the Speci Master noted, \"Dr. Ward expl ained that when measles virus persists in a human brain, death results . . . and any other outcome would be ' new biology,' currently unknow n to medical science .\" Id. at *69. Petitioners also rely upon the \"concessions\" of Dr. Hanauer, Respondent's ex pert in gastroenterology. Pet'r Br. 34-36. While Dr. Hanauer agreed that Michelle Cedillo has significant bow el symptoms, and he c oncede d that diarrhea f requent ly follows a meas les vaccination, id. at 35, his overall conclusions were decidedly adverse to Petitioners. As noted by the S pecial Master, Dr. Hanauer, \"disagrees completely with Dr. K rigsman's-23-general opinion that the M MR vacc ine ca n caus e chr onic gas trointestinal dysfunct ion by persisting in a chi ld's body .\" Cedillo, at *104. Dr. Hanaue r was \"unaw are of any exampl es of vi ral persistence in intestinal tissue ca using chronic inflamm ation.\" Id. at *109. Dr. Fujinami co-authored an a rticle with Dr. Oldstone ent itled Virus Persistence and Avoidanc of Im mune Surveillance: H ow measles vi ruses can b e induced to persist in cell s, escape i mmune as sault, and i njure tissues, 33 Symposium of the Soci ety for Generalrd Microbiology, at 185-202 (Mar. 1982). T he Special M aster admitted this article into evidence, Ex. 132, but neither Dr. Fujinami nor Dr. Oldstone testified. Petitioners complain that the Special M aster denied them the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Fujinami about his repor t. Pet 'r Br. 42. Pet itioner s state that Dr. Fujinami \"has deca des . . that measles virus can persist in hum an ce lls, injure tissues, and ca use a pot entially damagi ng autoimmune response.\" Id . (em phasis omitted). S imply put, if Petitioners w anted this information to support their th eory of causation, they should have called Dr. Fujinami, or Dr. Oldstone, as w itnesses. This is not a ca se where the Special Master declined t o cons ider important evidence , or failed to admit relevant exhibits or testimon y. To the contrary, the Special Master thoroughly considered every viewpoint of every expert witness, both Petitioners' and Respondent's, and concluded that the e vidence was \"overwhelmingly\" in R espondent's favor . Cedillo, at *1. This Court will not second gue ss a Speci al Master's fact-intensive concl usions, especially when medical evidence of caus ation is in dispute. Hodges, 9 F .3d at 961 ( citation om itted); Mober ly v. Sec' y of H HS, 85 Fed. Cl. 571, 597 ( 2009) (citation omitted). 8. Alleged \" Ignor ing\" of Pet itioner s' Other Evidence Petitioners have identified seven substantive areas where the Special M aster allegedly \"ignor ed\" i mportant aspects of the evi dence conce rning: (1) the re liability of the U nigenet ics Labor atory test results, particularly as to \"hi gh copy num bers;\" (2) allelic discrimination; (3) persistent m easles vi rus and r eplication; (4) D r. Krigsman's di agnos is; (5) neur ation; (6) Michelle Cedillo's immune s ystem; and ( 7) mercury and i mmune system dysfunction. Pet'r Br. 45-63. The Court already has addressed items one and two above, as they relate to the pi votal issue of t he reliability of the U nigene tics testing. The Court will discuss the remaining items below. a. Per sistent Measles Virus and R eplication Petitioner s argue t hat the Speci al Master ignor ed evi dence from an ar ticle co- authored by Respon dent's expert virologi st, Dr. Griffin, regar ding repl ication of the m easles vi rus.-24-Dr. Griffin testified that the presence of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's tissue sampl e, even i f true, did not indicate disease because the vi rus coul d not replicate without protein. Pet'r B r. 50. H owever, Petitioners assert th at the Special M aster ignored an allegedly conflicting article of Dr. Griffin's stating that measles virus samples fro m other p atients were persist ent and replicating, even in the absence of protein. Id. ( citing Ex. 112, Tab L). Petitioners rely upon this article to support their contention that the measles virus found in Michelle's gut tissue w as not inert, but was multiplying and ca using har m. Id. at 50-51. As Respondent points out, Petitioners' counsel did not ask Dr. Griffin about this article during cross -exam ination, despit e the opportunity to do s o, and none of Petitioners' exper t witnesses relied upon t his article. Resp't Br. 38-39. Pet itioner s' claim that measles virus can persist and replicate without protein, therefore, represents nothing more than their counsel's in terpretatio n of the Griffin article . Id. To the extent that Petitioners offered this contention to support the reliability of the Unigenetics testing, the Special M aster correctly disregarded D r. Griffin's article when no medical exper t offe red any testimony conce rning its proper interpretation, and t he gr eat weight of the evi dence cont radicted it. The C ourt does not see a ny abuse of discreti on by the S pecial Master r egarding his treatment of Dr. Griffin's article. b. Dr. Krigsman's Diagnosis Petitioners ch allenge the Special Master's assessment Krigsman, their ex pert in gas troenterology. Petitioner s allege t hat the Speci al Master \"reserved s pecial venom\" for Dr. Krigsman and f ailed to evaluate his diagnos is of M ichelle, while crediting instead t he testimony of Respondent's expert, Dr. Hanauer. Pet'r Br. 51-55. Contrary to P etitioners' ass ertion, the S pecial Master an alyzed Dr. Krigsman's testimony in great detail, and found i t unper suasive. Cedillo, at *29, 33, 47, 79, 103- 112, 114- 127, 133, 135. Dr. Krigsman testified that Michelle Cedillo has inflamm atory bow el disease, which the MMR ination caus ed. Id. at *103- 04. The Speci al Master rejected this view: I concl ude t hat [Michelle's medical] records do not indicate that any physician other than Dr. K rigsman actually independently diagnos ed Michelle with intestinal inflammation, or any chronic inflamm ation anywhere in her gastrointestinal tract. And I find that Dr. Krigsman was not a credible witness, so that his own diagnosis in that regard is not reliable.-25-Id. at * 124. T he Special Master noted that Dr. K rigsman diagnosed Michelle w ith inflamm atory bow el disease in July 2003, befor e he ever met or exami ned her. Id. at *112 n.180. He also o bserved that Petitioners n ever offered any rebuttal testimony to D r. Hanaue r's criticisms of D r. Krigsman's opinion. Id. at *125 n. 198. The Special M aster offered three chief reasons why Dr. Krigsman's opinion should be rejected. First, Dr. Krigsman relied upon t he di scredited U nigenet ics testing in for ming his opinion. Id. at *114. Second, the Speci al Master determined that Dr. Krigsman had a \"grossly mistaken under standing of the history of Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms,\" and that h is testimony was in consistent with Michelle's m edical reco rds. Id . Third, he found Dr. Krigsman's conclusion that Michelle suffered from chronic gastrointestinal inflammation to be \"s ubstantially outweighed by a com bination of the medi cal records and t he testimony of respondent 's exper ts, especially Dr. Hanaue r.\" Id. at *115. Under the V accine A ct, \"[s]pecial masters are accorded great deference i n det ermining the cr edibility and r eliability of expe rt witnesses.\" Nilson v. Sec' y of HHS, 69 Fed. Cl. 678, 681 (200 6) (citing Hanlon v. Sec'y of HS, 191 F.3d 1344, 1349 C ir. 1999)); see al v. Dep't of Tre asury, 796 F. 2d 430, 436 ( Fed. Cir. 1986) (findings regarding the credibility of witnesses are \"virtually unreviewable\" given the opportunity of trial ju dges to exami ne the w itnesses). The C ourt gues s the Speci al Master's anal ysis and credibility assessments of D r. Hanaue r or Dr. Krigsman. See H odges , 9 F. 3d at 961; Mober ly, 85 Fed. Cl. at 597. c. Neuroinflamm ation Petitioner s assert that chapt ers from a text edited by Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, one of Respondent 's exper t pedi atric autism. Pet'r Br. 57. Petitioner s further cont end t hat persistent measles infection has resulted in two recognized brain disorders, subacut e sclerosing panenc ephal phalitis (\"MIBE\"). Id. at 56. Petitioner s argue that the Speci al Master failed to account for relevant evidence linking the measles virus to these brain disorders. Id. at 56-57. The Special Master noted, and Respondent's experts did not deny, that inflamm ation m ay exist in the br ains of aut istic per sons, and m ay possibly play a ca usal role in aut ism. Cedillo, at *69 n.109. However, the Speci al Master rejected the pr opos ition that vaccine-stra in measles virus plays any role in causing brain inflammation in autistic persons. Id. Petitioner s first subm itted the materials edited by Dr. Zimmerman with their March 13, 2009 motion for recons ideration, which the Speci al Master ruled they filed unt imely. See infra \u00a7 C(9). However, the Special Master did not ignore relevant evidence, but weighed it-26-against evidence presented by Respondent that he ul timately found m ore credible. Cedillo, at *65-71. In rejecting Petitioners' general theory that measles virus contributes to autism, the Special Master identified ni ne poi nts to suppor t his analysis, one of which w as that \"the available evi dence st ill does not dem onstrate that m easles vi rus per sistence in t he b rain would result in autism.\" Id. at *67. The Special Master ac knowledged the testi mony of Petitioners' ex pert, Dr. Marcel Kinsbour ne, that persistent measles virus in the hum an brain might caus e a different disorder besides S SPE or MIBE. Id. at *6 9. The Special Master ex plained, however, that D r. Kinsbourne \"supplied no evidence for such a pos sibility, beyond hi s own uns ubstantiated specul ation.\" Id. Conver sely, espondent 's exper ts \"to be much more credible an d persuasive.\" Id . Respondent's experts, Dr. Griffin, D r. Ward, and Dr. Wiznitzer, tes tified that a chronic infection of the brain such as SSPE or MIBE would result in a per son's deat h, rather than aut ism or inflamm ation. Id. at 68-69. Dr. Wiznitzer opined that ne's theor y would require a \"novel biologic model ,\" for which no evi dence exists. Id. at 69. Once again, the Court will not second-guess the Special M aster's reasoned analysis of expe rt testimony. See H odges , 9 F.3d at 961; Mober ly, 85 Fed. Cl. at 597. The evi dence on neuroinflammation supports the Special M aster's conclusion that Respondent's experts present ed a far more compelling position, and were much better qualified, than Petitioners' experts. T he Special M aster carefully examined every position advanced by the parties in his undeni ably thorough deci sion. The C assertion that the Speci al Master's determination was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of di scretion. See H anlon, 191 F.3d at 1349 ( finding that a special master's determination w as not arbitrary, capr icious, or an abuse of discreti on, and was in accordance with the law when ther e was ample su pport for it in the re cord). d. Michelle Cedillo's Immune Sy stem Petitioner s chal lenge t he Speci al Master's determination that Michelle Cedillo does not have a damaged i mmune s ystem. Pet 'r Br. end that the Speci al Master abus ed his discretion by favor ing Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Christine McCusker, ov er Petitioners' m use of a \"fabricated pe diatric lab value range\" to sho w that M ichelle's immune system was normal. Id. at 59 . The Special Master o bserved, however, that D r. McCusker referred to \"a publ ished s et of age- adjusted normal values devel oped i n testing of children.\" C edillo, at * 27. Using this approach, Dr. McCusker determined that Michelle had a nor mal immune s ystem. Id. The Speci al Master found t hat Dr. McCusker was \"far more per suasive\" t han D r. Byers, and w as satisfied that age-appr opriate val ues shoul d be-27-used when evaluating immune testing results of children. Id. The Speci al Master provided a full and ca reful anal ysis of these expe and Petitioner s failed to that thimerosal damaged M ichelle's immune s ystem. Id. at *25-29. The C ourt sees no basi s for di sturbing the S pecial Master's eval uation of these expert witnesses. e. Mercury and I mmune Sy stem D ysfunct ion Petitioners allege the Special M aster ignored relevant evidence regarding the effects of mercury on Michelle Cedillo's immune system. Pet'r Br. 60-63. They claim that Michelle's weakened immune system allowed the measles virus to persist long after it sh ould have e liminated the vi rus from her body . Id. Petitioner s assert that the Speci al Master \"ignored the entire b ody of literature that [Respondent's expert,] D r. Brent[,] allu ded to in demonst rating that mercury \"had a det rimental effect on al l element s of the immune s ystem.\" Id. at 62. As the Speci al Master expl ained, Dr. Brent did not dispute that mercury in some of its forms and at certain dosages can be toxic or fatal to hum ans. Cedillo, at *18. Dr. Brent emph asized, however, that Petitioners' expert, Dr. Apo shian, inappropriately relied upon instances of toxicity involving mercury in much different forms than are found in thimerosal, and mer cury expos ure in m uch gr eater amou nts than t he s mall quant ities used as preservatives in vacc ines. Id. Dr. Brent also explained that thimerosal breaks into component parts as soon as it enters t he body, releasing mercury in the form of \"ethyl mercury.\" Id . According to D r. Brent, the to xic pro perties of ethyl mercury are quite different from methyl mercury, and Dr. Aposhian improper ly relied upon t he \"r eference dose\" st andar ds of m ethyl mercury, instead of the et hyl mercury in thimerosal. Id. The Speci al Master accepted Dr. Brent's testimony that the type of mercury (ethyl or methyl) and t he dos age a mount are the most important factors in d eterm ining whether an adverse effect w ill occ ur. Id. T he examples o f Dr. Aposhian's c ited mercury toxicity leve ls inv olve vastly greater am ounts of mercury than are used in thimerosal. Id. Dr. Brent pointed out that alm ost any substance can be toxic if admi nistered in high enough quant ities, but that the same subs tance c an be harmless or benef icial at low doses. Id. Based upon all of the exper t testimony, the Speci al Master found no evidence that the amount of ethy l mercury in thim erosal ca uses a ny immune dysfunction. Id. T he record suppor ts this determination. Fur thermore, the Speci al Master provided s ufficient reasoning in his deci sion for hi s acceptance of Dr. Brent's expert analy sis instead o f Dr. Aposhian's.-28-Id. Upon car eful review, the C ourt will not disturb these conc lusions. See H anlon, 191 F. 3d at 1349. 9. Refusal to Consider Post -Hearing E vidence Petitioners challenge the dismissal of their motion for recons ideration, cont ending that the Speci al Master abus ed his di scretion by refusing to cons ider significant post-hearing evidence . Pet'r Br. 63-65. Petitioner s filed their motion for recons ideration w ith the Speci al Master on M arch 13, 2009, just three days befor e a motion for review would have be en due in this Court. Motions for reconsideration are governed by Vaccine Rule 10(e), which provides in part: (1) Initial Motion. E ither party may file a mot ion for recons ideration of the special master's deci sion w ithin 21 day s after the issuance of the deci sion, if a judgm ent has not been e ntered and no m otion for review under Vaccine R ule 23 has been f iled. (2) Response . The special master m ay seek a respons e from the nonm oving par ty, specifying bot h the met hod of and t he timing for the respons e. (3) Ruling o n the Motion. The special m aster has the discretion to grant or deny the mot ion, in the interest of justice. Vaccine R ule 10( e)(1)-(3). Here, the 21- day period for filing a mot ion for recons ideration expired on M arch 5, 2009. Petitioner s offe red no expl anation for filing their motion out side of the 21-day time period. Cedillo, 2009 WL 996299, at *1 n.1. As the S pecial Master speculated, by filing on March 13, 2009, Petitioners seemingly positioned the m otion for a prompt ruling fr om the Special Master without an oppor tunity for Respondent to ans wer. Id. The m aterial s Petitioner s subm itted w ith recons ideration cons isted of: (1) chapt ers from a book edi ted by one of Respondent 's exper ts, Dr. Andrew Zimmerman; (2) medical articles publ ished i n Sept ember 2008 and M arch 2009; (3) an affidavit from Petitioner s' exper t, Dr. Kennedy , rebutting testimony of Respondent 's exper t, Dr. Rima; and (4) addi tional medical records of M ichelle Cedillo. Exs. 134- 38. Petitioners' motion as unti mely, and held t hat he w ould not have co nsidered P etitioners' evidence even if they had timely filed it. Cedillo, 2009 WL 996299, at * 1. He observed that, with the exc eption of one medi cal journal article which he found \"of ve ry dubi ous-29-relevanc e,\" dence was avai lable \"pr ior to the filing of my Decision in this case on February 12, 2009.\" Id . He also noted that \"none of those evidentiary items constitute[s] evidence that vacc ines can c ause aut ism or gastrointestinal dysfunct ion.\" Id. The Court finds that the Speci al Master acted well within his discretion in d enying Petitioner s' motion for recons ideration. Pet itioner s did not timely file their motion under Vaccine Rule 10(e), and the Special M aster properly determined that there was no reason \"in the interest of justice\" to cons ider the evi dence proffered w ith the mot ion. 10. Whether the Speci al Master's Decision is Contrary to Law Petitioners assert essentially three arguments that the Special M aster im properly applied the law: (a) he employed Daub ert v. Merrell Dow Phar maceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 ( 1993) \"as a clout to dismiss [this] petition,\" Pet'r Br. 70; (b) he mi sapplied the ca usation requirement s of Althen, 418 F. 3d at 1278; and ( c) he di sregarded C ourt precedent granting relief to other pe titioner s, particularly where the M MR vacc ine ca used injury, based on evidence allegedl y similar to or less compel ling than t he evi dence presented her e. Each of these contentions is addressed below. a. T he Special Master's U se of Daubert Petitioners first a rgue that the Special M aster improperly applied Daubert in evaluating the reliability of their expert testimony and other scientific evidence. In Daubert, the Supreme Court se t forth four factors for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence at trial. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94. These factors are (1) general acceptance in the scientific community, (2) whether the theor y has been s ubjected to peer review and publication, (3) whether it ca n and has been tested, and (4) whether the known potential ra te of er ror is acceptable. Id. According to Pe titioners, courts may only use th e Daubert fac tors to assess exper t witnesses' methodol ogy and not their ultimate conc lusions. Pet 'r Br. 65. Therefore, the S pecial Master acted cont rary to the law in appl ying D auber t to assess the reliability of Pet itioner s' exper t witnesses and ot her scientific evi dence . Id. Feder al Circuit precedent clearly permits the Speci al Master to apply Dauber t when evaluating the reliability of the par ties' evidence . In Terran v. Secr etary of H ealth and Human Ser vices, the C ourt of Federal Claims concl uded t hat \"Dauber t is useful in providing a fram ework for eval uating the reliability of s cientific evi dence ,\" bot h under the Feder al Rules of Evi dence and in Vaccine Act cases. 41 Fed. Cl. 330, 336 ( 1998) (emphasi s added) (citation om itted), aff'd, 195 F. 3d 1302 ( Fed. Cir. In aff irming this deci sion, the Feder al Circuit found r easonabl e the trial cour t's appl ication of D auber t to as sess the reliability of an expert w itness. T erran , 195 F.3d at 13 16. Furthermore, the Supreme Court-30-has clarified language in Daubert stating that the focus of a Daubert inquiry must be \"'solely on pr inciples and met hodol ogy, not on t he conclu lusions and m ethodol ogy are distinct from one anot her . . . . A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and t he opi nion pr offered.\" G en. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 ( 1997) (quot ing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 59 5). Here, the Speci al Master concl uded t hat \"anot her impo rtant aspect of the ca usation-in- fact law under the [Vaccine] Program concerns the factors th at a s pecial m aster should cons ider in eval uating the reliability of exper t testimony and other scientific evidence relating to caus ation issues.\" Cedillo, at *3. He then r eference D aubert factors \"that federal rning scientific issues.\" Id. In appl ying D auber t, the Special M aster s imply found t hat the evidence did not suppor t the concl usions proffered Id. at The Speci al had t he di scretion under Terran to appl y Daubert when assessing the conclusions of the parties' expert witnesses, and, therefore, he did not act contrary to law. b. The Althen Causation Standard Petitioners also contend that the Special M aster improperly applied the Althen test in evaluating w hether Petitioner s had m et their burden of pr oof. Under Althen' s caus ation standard, the pe titioner has th e burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) a medical theor y caus ally connec ting the vacc ination and the injury; (2) a logical sequenc e of cause and effect sh owing that the vaccination was th e reason for the inju ry; and (3) a proximate tempora l relationship be tween va ccination and i njury. 418 F. 3d at 1278. Petitioner s claim they have met their burden of pr oof, and t he Speci al Master's concl usion to the to appl y Althen cor rectly. They argue t hat they presented a medi cal theor y beca use \"[the] evidence is over whelming that the M MR vacc ine is capable of causing a wide variety of brain injuries, including autism.\" Pet'r Br. 68. Furthermore, Petitioner s maintain that they offe red a l ogical sequence of c ause and e ffect between t he M MR vacc ine and M ichelle's injury: she had be en hea lthy, she received t he MMR vacc ine, and \"s he w as never agai n the same. \" Id. Finally, Petitioner s assert that they met the proximate temporal relationship prong of the test because Michelle's symptoms occur red w ithin the fi fteen da ys required for proving that a br ain injury resulted fr om the MMR vacc ine under the Table. Id; U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 14(a)II. Confronted with this evidence, Petitioners argue that the Special M aster could not have found in Respondent 's favor unless he had e levated the ca usation s tandar d bey ond w hat Althen requi res. Petitioners argue that they should prevail because Respondent failed to prove an alternative6 cause of Miche lle's autism . Petr. Br. 68-70. However, the b of proof does not s hift to Resp onde nt until P etitioners a prima facie case . Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 54 7 (citatio n omitted). The Co urt ha s conclude d tha t the Spec ial Master prope rly applied the Althen test to determ ine th at Petitione rs had not met their burde n of proo f. Beca use no burde n shift has occurred , the Court n eed not address Petitioners' argument. -31-The Speci al Master proper ly concl uded that Petitioner s failed to meet any of the three prongs of t he A lthen t est. Althen mandat es theor y,\" suppor ted by reputable medi cal or scientific explanation. 418 F. 3d at 1278 (emphasis added). The Special Master determined that Petitioners failed to offer a reliable medical theor y as to how the M MR vacc ine can ca use aut ism or inflamm atory bow el disease, and t hat any such t heor ies were highly specul ative. See, e.g., Cedillo, at *21- 22, 26-27, 41, 58, 89-90, 96, 101, 108. Absent proof of a persuasive medical theory, the Special M aster did not act cont rary to law in concl uding that Petitioner s failed to meet the fi rst prong of A lthen. Under the second pr ong of t he test, Petitioner s' sequenc e of caus e and e ffect depends upon a pr esence of per sistent measles virus infection in Michelle's body . However, the al Master concl uded t hat \"the pet itioner s offe red virtually no evi dence concerning this nece ssary element in their propos ed cha in of pr oof- i.e., their claim that the m easles vi rus, which they claim to pers ist in [au tistic] chi ldren, is vaccine-strain measles virus.\" Id. at *52. The Special Master also saw no logical sequence of cause and effect between the MMR vacc ine and M ichelle's devel bow el disease. the Speci al Master found D r. Krigsman's theor y that Michelle suffered fr om an M MR-induced inflamm atory bow el disease to be factually incor rect beca use Michelle did not suffer from gastrointesti nal inflammation, and Dr. Krigsman \"gravely misunderstoo d the tem poral hist ory of M ichelle's gastrointestinal problems. \" 15. The Speci Master's concl usion rate relati onship bet ween t he M MR vacc ine and Michelle's autism is eminently reasonable. He determined that they offered \"virtually no evidence \" to support their claim. See id. at *52. The Speci al Master also cor rectly noted that the ons et of an i njury following a vacc ination al one does not satisfy the third prong of the A lthen t est. See i d. at *132- 33. Petitioner s must establish a pr oximate and s cientific tempora l relationship bet and i njury . Pafford v. Sec' y of 19, 29-31 (2005) , aff'd, 451 F. 3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2006) . Petitioner s claim that Michelle first showed symptoms of autism within a few days of receiving her D ecember 20, 1995 MMR vaccination. Pet'r B r. 68. However, the Speci al Master found no evidence to suppor t this allegation, stating that \"[t]he medi cal records and t estimony . . Dr. Kinsbour ne's assumption that Michelle expe rience d an abrupt onset o f autism symptoms\" sho rtly after her M MR vaccination, and that M ichelle's overall record demonstrated that her family \"noticed symptoms of [her] autism gradually.\" Cedillo, at *99, 101. Furthermore, Dr. Kinsbourne admitted that he \"really does n't know what would be the [biologically] appropriate time period for onset of an autism condition-32-caused by the MMR vaccination\" and was, therefore, \"merely gues or at *137. red a biol ogically app ropriate temporal relationship an d w as \" completely wrong in his assum ption as to when Michell e's chronic gast rointestinal s ymptom s actually d id begin.\" Id. at *133. The Special Master provided s ubstantial evidentiary suppor t for his concl usion that Petitioner s failed to show, by a pr eponder ance of the evidence, a scientific tempora l relationship bet ween t he M MR vaccine and Michell e's autism or gastrointestinal pr oblems. There is no evidence to suppor t Petitioner s' claim that the Speci al Master elevated the bur den of pr oof s et forth in Althen. c. Other Cases Finding Injury From the M MR Vaccine Finally, Petitioner s allege that the Speci al Master disregarded precedent in which the Court granted relief to pet itioner s, particularly where the M MR vacc ine ca used injury, based on evi dence allegedl y similar to or l ess compel ling than t he evi dence presented her e. Petitioner s point to a list of cases in which medical records, affidavits, exper t testimony, and scientific articles, all based on ci rcumst antial evidence alone, established that vacc ines have caused certain injuries. P et'r B r. 11-14. They argue that, in each of these cases, as in Michelle's case, the respondent 's exper ts flatly denied that a vacc ine w as capa ble of c ausing the in jury, and yet the Court awarded relief. Id. at 14 . According to Petitioners, the Court correctly deci ded these cases beca use the Althen t est permits petitioner s to establish a prima facie case bas ed on circumst antial, rather than di rect scientific, evidence , and a s pecial master must \"c lose calls regarding caus F.3d at 1278; see al 440 F. 3d at 1326. Petitioner s cont end t hat the pur pose of this standar d is to \"al low the fi nding of ca usation in a field ber eft of compl ete and di rect proof [a s to] how vacc ines affect the human body .\" Althen, 418 F. 3d at 1280. The Speci al Master did not improper ly appl y the law in decl ining to cons ider the Vaccine Act decisions Petitioner s reference . The Speci al Master explicitly rejected Petitioner s' argum ent for faul ty logic, noting that Petitioner s failed to mention the thous ands of other cases in which special masters have denied relief for failure to prove by a prepond erance of the evi dence that a vac cine ca used an i njury. C edillo, at *130. Furthermore, he conc luded t hat Michelle's case bears no r esembl ance to those cited by Petitioner s: \"In this case, the pet itioner s have advanc ed a theor y of ca usation qui te unl ike any caus ation theor y that I have pr eviously seen i n the 20 y ears of the Program's history. I have carefully eval uated that theor y. Based upon all the evidence , I have f ound t hat theor y to be without merit.\" Id. The C ourt finds no legal error in the Speci al Master's determination that these cases are factually distinct from the case at hand. Unlike the medical issu es raised in other Vaccine A ct cases, autism is not an ar ea \"'bereft of ete proof.'\" Pet 'r F. . As al Master expl ous, reputable epi demi ological studies worldwide that have attempted, and failed, to detect an association between childhood vaccinations and autism.-33-Cedillo, at *1, 84-93. Furthermore, Petitioner s have a gain mischaracterized t he law under Althen. While a s pecial master must resolve \"c lose calls\" in favor of a pe titioner , Speci al Master Hastings concluded that this \"is not a close case ;\" rather, \"[t]he over all weight of the evidence is overw helm ingly con trary to the petitioners' causation theories.\" Id. at *134. Petitioner s still have t he bur den of pr oving their claims by a preponder ance of the evi dence , and the Special Master reasonably concluded that they failed to do so. Accordingly, Petitioner s' argum ent that the Speci al Master's deci sion w as not in acc ordance with the law is without merit. Conclusion The issue bef ore our Court is not to determine the caus es of aut ism. The C ourt can only hope tha t medical pro fession als succeed in ide ntifying the c auses a nd developing a cure for this tragic disease. Rather, the Court's task is to weigh the Speci al Master's standar ds he V accine A ct, and det ermine whether it should affirm or modify the decision to any extent. After performing this review, the Court is sa tisfied that the Special M aster's decision is ra tional and reasonable in all respects, and i s in acc ordance with law. For the reasons addr essed above , the Speci al Master's decision is AFFIRMED . IT IS SO OR DERED. s/ Thomas C . Wheeler THO MAS C. WHEELER Judge "}
