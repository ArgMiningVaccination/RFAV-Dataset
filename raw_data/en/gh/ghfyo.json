Western cultures rely more on medicinal treatments through prescription based drugs. This is also considered Allopathic medicine. Pharmaceutical companies rein in the West due to the reliance physicians and patients have on drugs that are being used as treatment. Although eastern cultures do use medicinal treatments, a lot of treatments can be herbal, physical, or mental based. A holistic approach is much more preferable to those that practice Eastern medicine. India has the world's oldest medical system known as Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word deriving from ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). It is based on ancient writing that relies on treating patients holistically and naturally instead of purely medicinally. It is still practiced in India and other parts of the world but also has seeped through some medicinal practices in the West. Ayurvedic medicine uses products derived from plants, oils, spices and herbs mainly, but it also relies on the patient's diet, therapy, exercise and lifestyle. It is usually deemed safe but some preparations may include lead, mercury, or arsenic in small amounts which can cause eventual renal failure. Ayurveda is essentially a purification process for a patient. Certain treatments have specific goals such as eliminating impurities, reducing symptoms, resistance to disease, or a happier mental state. Although most Ayurvedic medicines are regulated as dietary medicines in the United states, they are not as strictly researched as other drugs in terms of knowing the long term effects in a patient. Ayurveda stems from three doshas or \"bodily energies\" of a person. The first energy is pitta, which is linked to fire and is thought to be the energy in control of the digestive and endocrine system. Those with a lot of pitta are usually fiery in temperament and intelligent. Those who lack pitta balance can have ulcers inflammation, digestive problems, anger, heartburn, or arthritis. The second energy is vata, which is linked to air and spaces and is thought to be the energy in control of bodily movement, breathing, and blood circulation. Those with a lot of vata are usually lively, creative, and original in thoughts. Those who lack vata balance can have joint pain, constipation, dry skin, or anxiety. The last energy is kapha, which is linked to earth and water and is thought to be the energy in control of growth and strength in the chest, torso, and back. Those with a lot of kapha are usually strong in their perspective and calm. Those who lack kapha balance can have obesity, diabetes, sinus problems, insecurity, and gallbladder issues. Many scientists and nutritionists in the West do not believe the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine, but recently, well designed clinical trials say otherwise. A 2013 clinical trial focused on the comparison of Ayurvedic medicine versus an actual drug to treat patients with knee osteoarthritis. There was a similar reduction of pain of all the patients using either method. One treatment used in Ayurvedic medicine that has become prevalent in western culture is tumeric. There has been an influx of turmeric based drinks and foods due to its use in treating peptic ulcers and ability to be anti-inflammatory. It also has been used recently as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Although Ayurveda is an interesting and healing medicine that needs to be researched in the West, it is a medicinal system that has supposedly worked on numerous patients for thousands of years. Its premise to heal rather than prevent like in allopathic medicine provides a unique perspective on the diverse and various perspectives in "}
