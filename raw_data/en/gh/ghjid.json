Primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrowand the thymus which are the sources for B-cells and T-cells, respectively. B-cellsand T-cells migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs or peripheral lymphoid organsand initiate there the adaptive immune response. 1. Introduction Protection against pathogens relies on complex interactions between organs, tissues, cells and molecules that make up thebody's immune system. The immune system can be consideredas a multilayered system, comprising three major defence mecha-nisms: (i) external barriers including physical (such as skin, ciliatedepithelia, mucous membranes) and chemical (such as destructiveenzymes in secretions, stomach acids) barriers; (ii) innate and (iii)adaptive immune responses. Innate immunity represents the rst line of host defence against pathogenic micro-organisms that have entered the body. Thisinnate defence mechanism lacks memory and is mostly focusedon a limited set of microbial determinants shared by a large num-ber of pathogens. Innate responses are characterized by a lack oflearning process and rapid kinetic, providing almost immediateprotection against invading pathogens. Adaptive immunity pro-vides a second line of defence, often at a later stage of infection.This immune response is activated upon pathogen encounter andis relatively slow. Adaptive responses are characterized by a verylarge set of effector molecules and cells, able to efciently recog-nize and eliminate virtually any known pathogen. After eliminationof the pathogen, the adaptive immune response establishes a stateof \"memory\" characterized by the ability to efciently protect thebody from re-infection with the same agent. Memory is the hall-mark of the adaptive immune response and can be induced by bothnatural infection and vaccination. The organs of the immune system, the lymphoid organs, are distributed throughout the body ( Fig. 1 ). They can be divided into primary lymphoid organs, where the lymphocytes\u2014the centralactors of the immune system\u2014are generated, and secondary lym-phoid organs, where the adaptive immune responses are initiated.The primary organs are the bone marrow and the thymus, whereasthe secondary organs (also called the peripheral lymphoid organs)are the lymph nodes, spleen and the mucosal- and gut-associatedlymphoid tissues (MALT and GALT, respectively), i.e. tonsils, ade-noids, the appendix and the Peyer's patches of the small intestine [1]. The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss our current knowledge of the basic immunological mechanisms in humans.These constitute the founding principles of modern vaccinology,the evolution of which is outlined in an accompanying paper [2]. 2. Innate immunity 2.1. Cells of the innate immune system Cells of the innate immune system represent a very diverse set of cells of haematopoietic origin, comprising both tissue-residing cells(such as eosinophils and monocytes) that patrol throughoutthe body via the blood and lymph circulation. These cells can berapidly recruited at the site of infection, thus providing an imme-diate line of defence against invading pathogens. 2.2. Pathogen recognition by the innate immune system Cells of the innate immune system are able to detect an invading pathogen through a limited set of germ-line encodedreceptors. These innate immune receptors (often referred to aspattern-recognition receptors, PRRs) recognize a series of con-served molecular structures expressed by pathogens of a givenclass. These pathogen-derived molecules (or pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns, PAMPs) [3] generally represent complex molecular structures that are distinctive for a set of pathogens (suchas Gram-negative bacteria). Among PRRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs)have recently emerged as pivotal components in innate immu-nity. These molecules are capable of sensing a wide spectrum oforganisms ranging from viruses to parasites. The founding mem-ber of the TLR family, Toll, initially implicated in the developmentof polarity in the Drosophila embryo, was shown to be responsible for anti-fungal responses in the adult fly [4]. This discovery led to the identication of 10 human equivalents involved in pathogenrecognition [5]. TLRs can be classied into different groups based on their localization and the type of PAMPs they recognize (seeTable 1 ). TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are principally expressed on the cell surface, where they recognize mostly bacterial products, while TLRs3, 7, 8, 9 are localized to intracellular compartments and recognizemostly viral products and nucleic acids. By specically recognizingpathogen-derived products, TLRs represent a set of immune PRRsable to alert the immune system as soon as an infection occurs [3]. Recently, another family of \"pathogen-sensing molecules\", mostly expressed in the cytoplasm, has been identied. ThisNOD-related family of cytoplasmic molecules comprises over 20members able to react to intracellular pathogen-derived structures,thus expanding the sensing capacity of the innate immune sys-tem to virtually all cellular compartments [6]. The most remarkable property of these molecules is probably their ability to also sensecellular damage, even in the absence of a microbial trigger. Extra-cellular nucleotides, alteration in cellular ion content, or lysosomaldamage all seem to activate components of this intracellular sens-ing machinery, ultimately leading to the processing and release ofinflammatory cytokines [7]. These observations have led to the con- cept of an innate immune system well equipped to detect bothinfectious events (through direct pathogen recognition) and theconsequences of an infectious event (through the recognition ofstress signals released by dying cells). These natural ligands, alsoreferred to as DAMPs, for \"danger associated molecular patterns\",often represent normal intracellular constituents (such as ATP anduric acids), that are released upon cell lysis caused by infection ortrauma [8]. It is noteworthy that expression of PRRs is not lim- ited to cells of the innate immune response, since lymphocytes andC4 M. Moser, O. Leo / Vaccine 28S (2010) C2-C13 Table 1 non-lymphoid cells such as endothelial cells and broblasts have been found to express selected TLRs constitutively or in responseto pathogens, stress or cytokines [9]. 2.3. Effector mechanisms of the innate immune system Phagocytosis represents an important effector mechanism of the innate immune response. Virtually all cells of the innateimmune system, whether tissue-resident or moving, are effec-tive phagocytes. Upon contact with a phagocyte, pathogens areengulfed, trapped within an intracellular vesicle and targeted fordestruction by a complex set of digestive enzymes or reactive oxy-gen species (such as free radicals) produced within the cell [10] . Efcient elimination of pathogens through phagocytosis requiresrapid recruitment of effector cells to the infection site, a processoften referred to as the inflammatory response [11] . This proto- typic innate response is initiated by recognition of pathogens byinnate receptors, often expressed by non-lymphoid cells (such asendothelial cells) or macrophages residing within the proximity ofthe infection site. Upon pathogen recognition, these cells secrete aseries of chemokines (dened as small soluble proteins that func-tion as chemotactic factors by directing cellular migration) such asCCL5/RANTES that attract phagocytes from the blood circulationto the infection site [12] . Activated resident cells and phagocytes also produce soluble mediators called cytokines (dened as pro-teins released by cells that affect the behaviour of other cells) suchas tumour necrosis factor (TNF- /H9251) and interleukins that further increase the phagocytic capacities of cells of the innate immunesystem. Elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines leads torecruitment of cells and plasma proteins to the site of infection intissues through increased vessel permeability, leading to the clas-sical signs of inflammation (increased swelling, redness, pain andheat). The inflammatory response leads not only to the recruitmentof cells and soluble mediators with anti-microbial activity to thesite of infection but also plays an important role in the healingprocess of the damaged tissue [13] . It is noteworthy that this com- plex response is stereotyped in nature, since a subsequent infectionwill cause the same cascade of events, with similar kinetics andintensity. 3. Adaptive immunity Due to the limited diversity of PRRs, pathogens displaying a high mutation rate can easily escape recognition from the innateimmune system [14] . Moreover, the ability of several pathogens (such as viruses) to replicate intracellularly renders their detec-tion and elimination particularly challenging. Adaptive immunityis a highly sophisticated biological response involving antibodiesand T cell receptors as recognition systems that have evolved inresponse to the high mutation rate of pathogens and intracellularreplication. These antigen-specic receptors are expressed by lym- phocytes, the key cell population in the adaptive immune response.Similar to cells of the innate immune response, lymphocytes origi-nate from bone marrow-derived precursors and differentiate in theperiphery into mature effector cells. These cells can be found in theblood and lymph circulation, or in secondary lymphoid organs suchas lymph nodes and the spleen [1]. 3.1. Antigen recognition by antibodies Antibodies represent a set of proteins produced by a subpopu- lation of lymphocytes known as B lymphocytes. These molecules(also referred to as immunoglobulins) are characterized by analmost innite diversity (in the order of 10 12) exceeding by far the number of known genes in the human genome. In the last decades,the mechanism by which such a highly diverse set of proteins isgenerated has been uncovered. Through a complex series of somaticevents (including somatic recombination and mutations), a limitedset of genes (in the order of 1000) has been found to generate a vastnumber of proteins, each expressing a distinctive binding site for anantigen (broadly dened as a molecular structure, from pathogenicorigin or not, able to be recognized by an antibody) [15,16] .A sa consequence of this high level of diversity, antibodies can recog-nize virtually all known molecular structures, whether of biological(such as proteins, lipids or nucleic acids), or synthetic (small organiccompound) origin. During B cell development in the bone marrow, each B lym- phocyte expresses numerous copies of a unique antibody as a cellsurface receptor (B cell receptor, BCR). As a consequence, each lym-phocyte is thought to be mono-specic, i.e. able to react to a singleantigenic molecule. Upon an encounter with a specic antigen (andin the presence of adequate auxiliary cells and signals), B cellsexpressing a given antibody are stimulated to divide and differ-entiate into plasma cells and memory B cells [17,18] . Most plasma cells home back to the bone marrow, where they will produce largeamounts of soluble antibodies of a given specicity that will bereleased in the blood and other body fluids (previously referred toas \"humors\", hence the humoral response). In contrast to inflam-matory cells, antibody producing cells do not need to be present atthe site of infection, since they can ght infection \"at distance\" byproducing soluble antibodies. 3.2. Antigen recognition by T lymphocytes and the phenomenon of MHC restriction Although antibodies allow the immune system to react with a large variety of antigens, these large molecules cannot cross theplasma membrane and are therefore unable to bind and destroyintracellular pathogens such as viruses. T lymphocytes representa distinct cellular subset that allows the immune system to rec-M. Moser, O. Leo / Vaccine 28S (2010) C2-C13 C5 ognize and ght intracellular pathogens. To achieve this seemingly very difcult task, T lymphocytes exploit the ability of all nucleatedcells of our body to display at their cell surface peptide fragmentsderived from intracellular proteins. As part of a normal qualitycontrol process, intracellular proteins undergo a complex cycle ofdegradation and re-synthesis throughout the life of the cell [19] . Notably, rather than undergoing a complete degradation into sin-gle amino acids, a sample of intracellular proteins is subjected tolimited proteolysis, giving rise to a set of small sized peptides (9-11amino acids). These peptides are further transferred from the cyto-plasm into the endoplasmic reticulum where they are bound bytransmembrane \"presenting molecules\" encoded by the major his-tocompatibility complex human leukocyte antigen (HLA)genes in humans [20] . These molecules are composed of two chains that fold together to create a long cleft in which the peptide nests[21,22] . These peptide-binding, MHC-encoded molecules are then transferred to the plasma membrane, where they will display (or\"present\") these peptides (or \"antigens\") of intracellular origin tothe cell surface. Like B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes express an antigen-specic receptor, called T cell antigen receptor (TCR), on their cell surface.The TCR is very similar to immunoglobulin in structure, althoughit is encoded by a distinct set of genes. Through a similar processof somatic recombination, a limited set of TCR encoding genes willgive rise to a highly diverse repertoire of antigen-specic recep-tors [23,24] . In marked contrast to antibodies however, TCRs are not secreted, and are unable to react with soluble antigens. TCRsrepresent specialized receptors adapted and able to recognize themolecular complex composed by a given peptide fragment pre-sented by an MHC molecule. The diversity of TCRs is such thata given TCR is able to specically react to a given peptide/MHCcombination. Thus, T lymphocytes are equipped with antigen-specic receptors that are specically designed to react to peptidefragments from intracellular origin. This complex mechanism of\"antigen presentation\" and \"MHC restriction\" allows therefore theimmune system to scan and detect intracellular proteins while pre-serving cell integrity. T cells able to react to these protein fragmentsof cytoplasmic origin can be identied based on the expression of acell surface marker known as the CD8 molecule. CD8-expressingcells react to peptide fragments presented by a subset of MHC-encoded molecules known as class I MHC molecules, expressed byvirtually all nucleated cells of the organism [25] . Another T cell subset, expressing an alternative marker known as CD4, displays a similar, yet slightly distinct recognition pattern.CD4-expressing T lymphocytes react to MHC-peptide complexesthat are formed in distinct cellular compartments, the endocyticvesicles. The peptides to which CD4 T lymphocytes react derivefrom the limited digestion of extracellular proteins that have beeninternalized through endocytosis or phagocytosis. Thus, CD4 T lym-phocytes appear to react to protein antigens from the extracellularmilieu, provided that these antigens are internalized and degradedinto larger peptides (that can reach 20 residues) by a specializedset of cells, known as \"antigen presenting cells\" (APCs). The MHC-encoded proteins able to present peptides of endosomal origin areknown as class II molecules, and are only expressed by cells of theimmune system [25] . Recent observations have demonstrated that this \"division of labour\" (CD8-expressing cells detect peptides of cytoplasmic originpresented by MHC class I molecules, while CD4 cells react to pro-teins of extracellular origin whose processed peptides are loaded onMHC class II molecules) is not a strict requirement, since alternatemodes of presentation have been described. In particular, \"cross-presentation\" refers to the ability of endocytosed material to escapethe endosomal compartment and reach the cytoplasm, acquiringtherefore the ability to be presented in association with MHC class Imolecules [26,27] . This phenomenon, mostly restricted to a specicsubset of antigen presenting cells of the dendritic cell family, can explain the ability of the immune system to activate CD8-positiveMHC class I restricted cells in response to extracellular antigens.Accordingly, dendritic cells do not need to be infected by a givenvirus in order to express viral antigens in association with MHCclass I molecules. A similar process, referred to \"autophagy\" hasbeen recently invoked to explain the ability of cytoplasmic antigensto be targeted to the lysosomal compartment and to be presented inassociation with MHC class II proteins, although the immune con-sequences of this novel pathway of cross presentation remain to bermly established [28] . In conclusion, TCRs display a distinct mode of antigen recogni- tion when compared to antibodies, since TCRs: (i) can only reactto cell surface, but not to soluble, antigens presented by MHC-encoded molecules; (ii) do not react to extracellular pathogens butonly to intracellular, or previously internalized antigens; (iii) canonly react to a limited set of biochemically well dened antigens(mostly proteins). 3.3. Common traits of antigen recognition3.3.1. Generation of diversity Adaptive immunity is characterized by specicity and develops by clonal selection from a vast set of lymphocytes bearing antigen-specic receptors which are generated by a mechanism referredto as gene rearrangement. To detect, eliminate, and remember alarge number of pathogens, the adaptive immune system must beable to distinguish an innite number of different antigens, some-times very closely related. To achieve this goal, the receptors thatrecognize antigens must be produced in a huge variety of congura-tions, essentially one receptor for each different antigen that mightever be encountered. Each T or B lymphocyte expresses one type ofreceptor, and the set containing the entire lymphocyte populationrepresents what is called the repertoire of the immune system. The vast diversity of T cell antigen receptors and antibodies is generated from a relatively small set of genes (V, D and J segments)that randomly assemble to constitute an almost innite numberof combinations during lymphocyte development [16] . This pro- cess is called gene rearrangement or V(D)J recombination and themechanisms involved are similar in both cases. Antibody diversityis further increased with introduction of multiple mutations in therearranged genes, which is referred to as the process of somatichypermutation. 3.3.2. Clonal selection and immune memory The development of a very diverse immune repertoire poses a serious threat to the host, since autoreactive receptors do ariseduring the process of somatic diversication. As a consequence,both T and B lymphocytes undergo an important selection pro-cess during differentiation. Cells expressing autoreactive receptorsare eliminated from the repertoire through a process of \"nega-tive selection\" involving the selective elimination of autoreactivecells by apoptotic cell death. Cells expressing receptors reactiveto \"non-self antigens\" are spared by this selection procedure, andallowed to migrate to the blood and peripheral organs. Each ofthese mature lymphocytes will express a unique receptor out ofmany, and lymphocytes of a particular specicity will thus be tooinfrequent to mount an effective response on their own. Whenan antigen enters the body, it binds to cells expressing the corre-sponding matching receptors and induces their multiplication. Thisproliferative response following antigen recognition (also knownas \"clonal leads to the overrepresentation of a subset of lymphocytes during and after an immune response thatrepresents a unique biological \"reinforcement learning process\".Immune memory is indeed the consequence of this permanentalteration of the immune repertoire, whereby a fraction of previ-C6 M.

The lightand heavy chains are composed of constant ( C L,CH1,CH2,CH3) and variable ( VL,HL) regions. ously selected lymphocytes is maintained alive during the life of the host, allowing a faster and more vigorous response during asecondary encounter with the same pathogen [29] . Cells induced following a primary immune response thus represent \"memorycells\", able to respond again if challenged by the same pathogen.Moreover, generation of antibody variants through accumulationof somatic mutations leads to the long term survival of B lym-phocytes able to secrete antibodies of very high afnity towardsthe invading pathogen [30] . The ability of memory cells to sur- vive in the host for very long periods has been recently conrmedin human subjects. In particular, a study performed in aged (over90 years old) volunteers that had been exposed to the H1N1 viralstrain in 1918, demonstrated the ability of virus-specic, circu-lating B lymphocytes to survive in the host for over 90 years[31] . Similarly, T cells expressing immune receptors specic for smallpox have been found to subsist for long periods of times,although with a reduced half life (in the order of 10-15 years)when compared to B cells specic for the same antigen and whichappear to survive for the life of the patient following vaccination[32] . 3.4. Effector mechanisms of the adaptive immune response 3.4.1. Antibodies Antibodies can be considered as bifunctional molecules, that can both recognize and eliminate a given antigen or pathogen. Thestructure of an antibody reflects these two functions ( Fig. 2 ). Anti- bodies are roughly Y-shaped, flexible molecules made up of twoheavy chains and two light chains linked together [33] . Both types of chains are composed of constant (C) and variable (V) regions,determining the functional properties of the antibody and con-tributing to the antigen-binding site, respectively. There are twotypes of light chains ( /H9260and/H9261) that can associate with any of the ve different heavy chains ( /H9251,/H9253,/H9254,/H9255and/H9262). The type of heavy chain determines the class, or isotype, of the antibody molecule, i.e. IgA,IgG, IgD, IgE and IgM antibodies. Immunoglobulin class is impor-tant because it determines the capacity of a given antibody to reachthe site of infection and recruit the adequate effector mechanism(Table 2 ).Table 2 Immunoglobulin (Ig) IgA1, IgA2) Major form of antibodies in external secretions IgE Triggers immediate allergic reactions IgM Secreted during primary responseIgD Exact function unknown Antibodies circulate around the body in the blood and fluids. The binding of an antibody to its target is often sufcient to ren-der the antigen harmless. Toxins produced by some bacteria can beneutralized upon recognition by a specic antibody that will blockits ability to bind to specic cellular targets. Similarly, antibodiesto viral particles will impede their interaction with specic cellu-lar receptors, and therefore strongly inhibit their infectivity. Moreoften, however, antigen-antibody complexes are able to recruitadditional effector mechanisms that will lead to pathogen destruc-tion. Binding of antibodies to surface antigens renders for examplethe pathogen more susceptible to phagocytosis by cells of the innateimmune system, a process known as opsonization. Depending ontheir isotype, antibodies can also activate the complement fam-ily of proteins, leading to cell lysis and destruction of the targetpathogen. 3.4.2. Effector T cells T lymphocytes represent secretory cells, able to respond to an antigen-specic stimulation through their TCR by the productionof soluble factors expressing various anti-pathogenic effects. 3.4.2.1. or killer cells, were identied as cells able toinduce the death of infected or otherwise damaged/dysfunctional(e.g. tumour) cells [34] . Upon allows the intracellulardelivery of a series of proteases directly into the cytoplasm of thetarget cell. These proteases (also known as granzymes) are ableto initiate an apoptotic response leading to the rapid cell deathof the antigen-expressing cell [35] . Through this complex, cell death-inducing programme, cytolytic T cells can kill infected cellsexpressing pathogen-derived peptides at the cell surface beforethe pathogen's replication programme is completed, thus stoppingpathogen spread. More recently, CD8-expressing cells have alsobeen shown to inhibit viral replication while preserving theintegrity of target cells, such as neurons. Granzymes delivered intothe cytoplasm of HSV-1-infected neurons by HSV-1-specic CD8 + T cells do not activate apoptosis, but rather degrade an HSV proteinrequired for full viral expression, thus leading to inhibition of viralreplication in live cells [36] . Finally, pathogen-specic T cells also secrete soluble mediators (cytokines) such as TNF or interferons(IFNs, whose name derives from their ability to interfere with viral replication) that bind to infected cells and inhibit intracellularpathogen replication [37] . Collectively these observations demonstrate the ability of CD8-expressing cells to inhibit intracellular pathogen replica-tion through the secretion of soluble mediators able to interferewith pathogen replication and/or to induce the death of infectedcells.M.

CD4-expressing effector T cells (CD4+T cells). CD4+T cells interact with antigen MHC class II complexes that are mostlyexpressed by immune cells. This lymphocyte subset plays a dualrole during an immune response through the secretion of a widecollection of cytokines and displays both effector and regulatoryproperties. As discussed for CD8 +cells, cytokines pro- duced by CD4+T cells at the site of infection can affect pathogen survival (such as shown for TNF, IFNs [37] ). Moreover, several cytokines have been shown to display profound effects (bothenhancing or inhibitory) on the activity of other immune effectorssuch as innate immune cells, B lymphocytes or cytotoxic T cells (seeTable 3 ). The complex regulatory role of CD4-expressing lympho- cytes during an immune response will be analyzed in more detailsin the following paragraphs.4. Mounting and regulating an immune response As previously described, the immune system is characterized by a complex array of effector mechanisms including phagocytes,antibody-producing cells and T lymphocytes. Selection and activa-tion of the adequate effector mechanism is under the control ofcomplex regulatory processes that require cooperation betweendifferent cell types of the immune system. Activation of CD4 + T cells represents an early and important step in the initiationof an immune response. Indeed, although helper-independentresponses have been described (both antibody secretion and gen-eration of cytotoxic CD8-expressing cells can be CD4 +helper T cells [38-40] ), optimal memory responses, displaying an increased efciency upon secondary stim- Fig. 3. Activation of helper T cells and the role of antigen-presenting cells. T cell antigen receptors (TCR) on T cells are able to recognize only processed an tigen which is presented by an MHC/antigen complex.C8 M. Moser, O. Leo / Vaccine 28S (2010) C2-C13 ulation, are strictly dependent on previous activation of helper T cells [40-43] . 4.1. The activation of helper T cells and the role of antigen-presenting cells As for any T cell, helper lymphocytes can only be activated upon recognition of an adequate ligand, i.e. a peptide-MHC class II com-plex. Moreover, although several immune cells expressing MHCclass II molecules are potentially able to generate the requiredpeptide-MHC complex, the ability to activate na\u00efve helper T cellsappears as a specic property of a rare subset of APCs ( ) known as (DCs) [44] . This exclusive property of DCs is best explained by the recently developed \"three signal\" theory.According to this concept, developing lymphocytes exist as bothimmature (or na\u00efve) and mature (expressing fully functional helperand/or effector function) cells. Transition from na\u00efve to mature cellsrequires both antigen recognition (i.e. a peptide/MHC complex, sig-nal 1) and a co-stimulatory signal (signal 2) delivered by a set ofmembrane bound receptors expressed by DCs (including proteinsof the B7 family). Finally, by producing a distinctive set of secretedfactors (cytokines, representing the third signal), DCs influence thedifferentiation fate of activated helper T cells toward a determinedfunctional subset (see Section 4.3). The role of DCs in activating na\u00efve T cells appears to proceed in a stepwise fashion comprising three distinct steps, namely (i)antigen processing, (ii) migration to lymphoid organs and nally(iii) activation of na\u00efve T cells through provision of a antigenic, costimulatory and cytokine-borne signals [45] . (i) DCs and the antigen capture mode . In peripheral tissues where they reside, DCs exhibit potent endocytic activity. Throughthe expression of various receptors antigens, pathogens and dying cells, DCs areable to internalize and degrade a wide range of protein anti-gens present in their environment. This continuous processof \"antigen presentation\" generates a series of MHC-peptidecomplexes that are expressed at the cell surface of tissue resi-dent DCs. (ii) DCs maturation and migration . Upon an infectious event, DCs appear to shift from an antigen-capturing mode to a T cell-sensitizing mode during a process called maturation. DCsmaturation induces multiple alterations in the function andintracellular transport of MHC class II molecules, leading to theaccumulation of high numbers of antigen-loaded, MHC class IImolecules to their plasma membrane. DCs maturation is alsoassociated with a loss of adherence of these cells with the sur-rounding tissues, and their migration to the lymphoid organswhere na\u00efve lymphocytes reside. (iii) Expression of activation of na\u00efve T Mature DCs express high amounts of MHC-antigenic peptide complexes, as well as thecostimulatory molecules required for optimal activation ofT lymphocytes. Upon their migration to a lymphoid organ,these cells can deliver both antigen and costimulatory signals,thereby inducing the differentiation of na\u00efve T lymphocytesinto efcient helper cells. Based on their location and functional properties, DCs are there- fore considered as key elements in the initiation of an immuneresponse. DCs are present in blood and in tissues, such as the skin,representing the potential entry sites for pathogens. These cellshave the unique capacity to leave the infection site and migrateto the lymphoid organs where they present antigenic fragmentsto lymphocytes in a stimulatory mode, thus providing T cells withsignals promoting their amplication, survival and differentiation.Induction of DCs maturation represents therefore a prerequisite for an efcient immune response, and the nature and quality ofsignals inducing DCs maturation are of utmost importance in theinitiation of immune responses. 4.2. Dendritic cell maturation and the recognition of danger signals As members of the innate immune response, DCs express receptors, such as members of the TLR family, able to recognizepathogen-derived molecules or endogenous signals released bydamaged or dying cells [46] . DCs also express receptors to several cytokines (such as TNFs or IFNs), allowing these cells to react to anoccurring innate response in their environment [47] . This collec- tion of receptors enables DCs to directly recognize a wide spectrumof organisms ranging from viruses to parasites, or to sense theconsequences of a local immune response. Noteworthy, signallingthrough these receptors causes DCs maturation thereby function-ally linking DCs response to a local infectious event. DCs maturationand the consequent migration to lymphoid organs and expressionof costimulatory signals represent a \"conrmation\" signal, linkingthe development of an adaptive immune response to the previousrecognition of an infectious event mediated by innate receptors.Delivery of conrmation signals can therefore be considered as botha fail-safe strategy against accidental reaction to self-components,and a mechanism to identify dangerous invaders. 4.3. The diversity of helper T cell responses As previously stated, CD4 +T lymphocytes activated by mature DCs differentiate into antigen-specic and efcient helper cells.These cells play a central role in the immune response by helpingother cells to perform their effector tasks. Helper T cells regulate theactivity of other immune cells through the secretion of a selectedpopulation of soluble factors known as cytokines [48] . Recently, by analyzing the panel of cytokines produced by activated T cells, atleast four different subsets of helper cells have been dened ( Fig. 4 ). (i) Th1 cells appear to secrete mainly IFN- /H9253, a cytokine known to increase expression of MHC molecules and to exert potentanti-viral effects. This cytokine is also able to promote thedifferentiation and activity of CD8-expressing cells and phago-cytes, indicating that it plays an important role against virusesand other intracellular pathogens. The available evidence sug-gests therefore that Th1 helper cells are able to promote animmune response particularly efcient against intracellularpathogens [49,50] . (ii) Production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 is mostly associated with a distinct subset of helper cells known as Th2cells. These cells appear to be particularly apt at activatingcells such as eosinophils and mastocytes often involved in theimmune response to large extracellular parasites [51] . Notably, supra-optimal activation of these cells is responsible for thesecretion of high levels of IgE antibodies causing allergic reac-tions such as asthma. (iii) A subset of cells that is often found in close association with B lymphocytes in selected structures (follicules) of lymphoidorgans has been recently identied. These follicular helper Tcells (fTh) are able to promote high levels of antibody secre-tion from antigen-specic B cells, and are therefore thoughtto play an important role in regulating humoral responses in vivo following vaccination [52,53] . The fTh cells are character- ized by the production of IL-21, a cytokine known to positivelyaffect humoral responses in vivo . Although originally thought to belong to the Th2 subset, the helper cell population ableto promote B cell activation has been shown to express a dis-M. Moser, O.

Th1 cells secrete mainly IFN/H9253and TNF /H9251. Th1 cells promote an immune response pathogens. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and they are involved in immune respons et o large extracellular pathogens as parasites. Follicular or fTh cells are found in the lymph nodes in close association to B cells and are characterized by the secretion of IL-21. The fTh cells stimulate antigen specic B cells to secrete high antibody levels. Th17 cells secrete IL-17 and IL-22, which regulate local immune respo nse to gut and lung pathogens and are involved in autoimmune diseases. Regulatory or Treg cells inhibit immune response and inflammation by blocking the activity of effe ctor, helper and/or antigen presenting cells. tinct set of genes (notably, these cells often fail to produce high levels of the prototypic Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13), and arepresently believed to belong to a separate cell subset, distinctfrom the typical Th2 \"effector\" cell. (iv) Finally, a fourth and recently identied subset has been dened based on its ability to secrete IL-17 and IL-22, cytokines thatappear to play a role in response to selected pathogens includ-ing several bacterial and fungal strains [54,55] . Th17 cells appear to regulate the local immune response to gut and lungpathogens but they also represent the major pathogenic pop-ulation in several models of autoimmune inflammation. Differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 +T cells into selected helper/effector cells (Th1, Th2, fTh or Th17) is under the control of solublemediators (mostly cytokines) produced during the early steps ofantigen-specic stimulation. Several of these cytokines are pro-duced by DCs themselves (previously referred to as the \"third\"signal), stressing the important role that this cell subpopulationplays in the choice of effector cells. In particular, DCs direct thedevelopment of na\u00efve CD4 +cells into Th1 regulatory/effector cells IFN- /H9253-promoting cytokine [56,57] . Similarly, IL-6 appears to play an important role in both fTh and Th17 differentiation [58] , while the precise nature of signals and cytokines able to promote Th2 responses remain tobe rmly established [59] . An interesting, but yet not completely elucidated, feature of these responses is their ability to antagonizeeach other's function. In particular, Th1 and Th2 subsets crossblock each other and to inhibit Th17 development,although the biological signicance of these observations remains to be established [60] . 4.4. The humoral response, a typically helper-regulated immune response Repetitive antigens or antigens able to directly activate B cell proliferation, such as bacterial polysaccharides or TLR ligands,induce B cells to differentiate into antibody secreting cells in a Tcell-independent fashion ( Fig. 5 a). These responses, characterized by the secretion of low-afnity antibodies (mainly IgM), display astereotyped \"innate response\" behaviour, since repetitive encoun-ters with the same antigen fail to induce a secondary, memory-likeresponse. Overall, this type of response is poorly efcient, highlight-ing the important role of T cells in promoting protective humoralimmune responses [61,62] . The typical secondary antibody response observed upon multi- ple exposures to the same antigen is only observed when B cellsare stimulated by antigen in a T cell-dependent fashion [63] . T cell- dependent, humoral responses require the concurrent activation ofboth B and T lymphocytes ( Fig. 5 b). Although B cell receptors (BCRs) can react to a wide spectrum of antigens, T cells can only be acti-vated in response to protein antigens (see Section 3.2). The response elicited following a primary injection of a protein-containing anti-gen is slow and is characterized by the low afnity IgM antibodies.If the same antigen is encountered again, the secondary responsedevelops more rapidly and is mostly composed of IgG antibodies ofhigher afnity [64] . Antigen-specic helper T cells an M. Moser, O. Leo / Vaccine 28S (2010) C2-C13 Fig. 5. (a) T cell independent B cell activation. Repetitive antigens such as bacterial polysaccharides are able to stimulate directly B cell proliferation through the B cell receptor (BCR). The interaction between antigen and BCR induces maturation to a plasma cell, which produces antigen-specic antibodies. (b) T cell dependent B cell activation.

Depending on the nature of the stimulating sig nals, the activated B cells can mature to effector-plasma cells or memory B cells. mental role in providing to B cells the required signals (both soluble and membrane borne) enabling these cells to acquire the capacityto produce increased levels of IgG antibodies of high afnity. A sec-ondary response is characterized by both quantitative (higher andmore sustained antibody titres) and qualitative (class switch andafnity maturation) traits that are under the control of helper Tcells. 4.5. Regulatory T cells Although the existence of cells able to suppress an immune response has been long postulated, their identication and char-acterization have only been recently rmly established [65] . The major function of these lymphocytes (belonging to the CD4 +subset and constitutively expressing the CD25 marker and the Foxp3 tran-scription factor) is to inhibit an immune or inflammatory responseby blocking the activity of effector, helper and APC cells [66] . The importance of these regulatory T cells ( Fig. 4 ), or Treg, is bestillustrated by the severe autoimmune syndrome resulting from a genetic deciency in Treg cells [67] . An autoimmune response can lead to tissues damage, or deregulated hormonal responses. Tregcells thus play an important role in immune tolerance, by block-ing unsuitable immune reactions directed to self-antigens [68] . Although counterintuitive, it has been recently demonstrated thatTreg cells can also inhibit the development of protective immuneresponses against \"non-self antigens\" [69] . It is presently assumed that by limiting these immune responses, Tregs help resolvechronic inflammatory responses that, although directed against\"non-self antigens\", cause extensive tissue damage if uncontrolled.Treg cells appear thus as an evolutionary tool to reduce the debili-tating inflammatory responses elicited by several parasites presentin the environment and that cannot be easily avoided [70] . In mice, natural, constitutively present and antigen-induced Treg cells have been described. Both these subsets appear to beunder the control of TGF- /H9252, a well known immunosuppressive cytokine secreted by numerous cell populations [71] .M. Moser, O. Leo / Vaccine 28S (2010) C2-C13 C11 5. The immune system at work: basic principles of modern vaccination The ability of the immune system to respond to virtually any pathogen, even if of recent evolutionary origin, rests on the genera-tion of a very large set of stochastically generated antigen receptors.The major consequences of this strategy are that (i) self-recognitioncannot be avoided and (ii) that the adequate effector mechanismmust be selected among a large repertoire of mediators (suchas antibodies and cytokines) and cells (such as T lymphocytes,macrophages and neutrophils). Moreover, an inadequate (directedto self-constituent or chronic in nature) immune response repre-sents a potential threat for the organism, explaining therefore whythe immune system appears to be in a state of \"non-response\".Indeed, (i) lymphocytes are sequestered within endothelia andare normally not found in tissues; (ii) soluble antigens are notable to directly activate a lymphocyte; and (iii) naturally occurringTreg cells maintain effector cells largely in a non-responsive state.DCs maturation appears therefore as the critical regulatory stepenabling the initiation of an immune response. These bone-marrowderived cells leave the blood circulation and spontaneously hometo virtually all tissues (mucosal surfaces, skin, etc) that representnatural entry sites for pathogens. Through a process of innate-likepathogen recognition, cell migration and delivery of both anti-genic fragments and a conrmation signals to na\u00efve T lymphocytes,DCs act as a \"lter\", only alerting the immune system in the pres-ence of pathogens, and as a \"lens\", highlighting certain pathogeniccharacteristics (such as the presence of lipopolysaccharide or viralRNA) that will influence the choice of effectors (antibodies versuscytokine-producing T cells or cytotoxic effectors). Non-dangerousantigens are by the andconsidered as \"negligible noise\". How can modern vaccinology be envisioned in such a con- text? As described in a companion paper [2], vaccination rests on the principle of immune memory, whereby a secondary chal-lenge induces an enhanced immune response against a previouslyencountered pathogen. An ideal vaccine should therefore repre-sent a non-virulent, innocuous form of a given pathogen, able toelicit a strong and adequate immune response in vivo . Although classically represented by attenuated or killed microorganisms,modern vaccines more often comprise pathogen-derived subcel-lular components or recombinant proteins [2]. In addition to representing safer and economically relevant antigenic formula-tions, recombinant proteins have also led to the developmentof therapeutic vaccines against self-antigens, such as in cancerimmunotherapy. The challenge for modern vaccinology is therefore to be able to elicit in vivo all the required steps leading to immune activa- tion. Antigen-presentation and the maturation of DCs are presentlythought to represent the limiting step in the development ofefcient vaccines. A series of clinical and experimental obser-vations have clearly illustrated the reduced immunogenicity ofsubcellular or subunit-based vaccines when compared with inac-tivated/killed whole organisms [72] . The weak immunogenicity of soluble proteins appears to be related to their inability to induceDCs maturation both in vivo and in vitro . In other words, soluble pro- teins appear to be considered as \"negligible noise\" by the immunesystem, lacking the inherent danger-signature often associatedwith a pathogen [73] . In support of this contention, addition of microbial compounds able to bind TLRs expressed by DCs stronglyenhances the immune response to otherwise weakly immunogenic,recombinant proteins [74,75] . Recognition of the important role of the innate immune response in regulating the induction of an adaptive response has ledto a reappraisal of the role of adjuvants in vaccinology [78] . Adju- little secret\" [76] ,are generally dened as compounds, or association of compounds, that increase and/or modulate the intrinsic immunogenicity ofan antigen. In some instances adjuvants also permit the use of alower dose of antigen in vaccine preparations without compro-mising the resulting immune response. Although the functionalproperties of most adjuvants were originally thought to be relatedto their ability to retain antigens within tissues (thus increasingtheir exposure to the immune system), recent observations haveclearly indicated that most efcient adjuvants (including the widelyused aluminium-based salts) are able to activate an innate immuneresponse by directly interacting with DCs, or by inducing in vivo the release of cellular constituents able to activate DCs. Aluminiumsalts have been recently shown to activate components of the\"inflammasome\" complex (a member of the NOD-like family ofPRRs), leading to the processing and release of pro-inflammatorycytokines such as IL-1 /H9252and IL-18 [77] . These observations have led to the concept that the ability to activate the innate immune system may represent an obligatoryproperty for any given adjuvant. Greater understanding of the sig-nals regulating innate responses in vivo has thus led to a more rational design of \"immune potentiators\" acting as adjuvants [78] . In particular, a new generation of adjuvants has been developedbased on the ability of TLR-ligands to induce DCs activation andmaturation in vivo . As previously stated, DCs maturation repre- a prerequisite for the delivery of antigen-MHC complexesto na\u00efve T cells in an immunogenic fashion. However, DCs cannot only activate na\u00efve T helper cells, but also direct their dif-ferentiation into functionally distinct helper cell subsets (such asTh1, Th2 and fTh) that will ultimately affect the choice of effec-tor cells (antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, activated macrophages, etc).Aluminium salts, for example, represent potent adjuvants in vivo , leading to the secretion of high levels of antigen-specic antibodies.Although this response appears particularly apt in ghting extra-cellular pathogens, it may prove less effective against viral strainsthat are mostly sensitive to Th1-type cytokines (such as IFN- /H9253)o r CD8-expressing cells. The challenge of modern vaccinology will be to devise new immunological strategies and/or antigen formulations able tocounteract the natural tendency of the immune system to ignorenon-dangerous antigens. These strategies will also have to selec-tively induce the adequate effector mechanism adapted to thepathogen envisioned. Identication of TLRs' natural ligands hasled to and ligands thatcan activate TLR pathways dened, mannerincreasing immunogenicity antigens while minimizing local inflammatory responses. Imidazoquinolines, syntheticcompounds binding to TLR7 and candidate adjuvants [78] . Similarly, detoxied forms of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)have now been licensed as adjuvants for several anti-viral vaccines,based on their safety prole and ability to induce the appropriateTh1-like, cellular response in vivo . Based on these promising results, LPS mimetics (such as aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphate orAGP) are presently being developed for clinical [79,80] . Finally, as described in a companion paper [78] , combinations of classical and newly designed adjuvants that have been shown to cooperateand trigger both humoral and cell-mediated immunity have beenrecently licensed for use in humans. The aim of ongoing studies is toidentify the adjuvant formulations able to both enhance and directan immune response toward a desired choice of effectors [74] . In conclusion, both our increased knowledge of the complex regulatory circuits regulating an immune response and greaterunderstanding of the mode of action of adjuvants should enable thedevelopment of efcient vaccines against cancer and infectious dis-eases (such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) for which no vaccinesare presently available.C12 M.
