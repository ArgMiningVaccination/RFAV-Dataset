The art of acupuncture is incredibly important to our story because it's how Pellegrino Healing Center got its start. Founder and owner Christine Pellegrino, M.S., L.Ac, started the center due to her own private acupuncture practice being in such high demand. To accommodate the growing need of acupuncture and other healing services in the community, she brought on more practitioners and expanded the offerings and amenities. A core service, acupuncture continues to deliver successful and life-changing results to our patients. Unlock your body's healing potential. Your body knows how to heal itself. Sometimes it just needs some guidance to remember how, and that is where acupuncture comes in. Acupuncture is a healing technique that has been utilized for thousands of years, originating in ancient China. Practitioners stimulate specific points in the body through the insertion of needles to alleviate symptoms. Our acupuncturists use a unique Japanese style of acupuncture designed by world-renowned Master, Kiiko Matsumoto, in combination with Traditional Chinese Medicine, 5 Element, Trigger Point Acupuncture, and Electroacupuncture. We go above and beyond... A heated [BioMat](http://pellegrino.biomat.com), (an approved FDA medical device) and a blend of modalities are incorporated such as infratonic therapy, aromatherapy and body work.
