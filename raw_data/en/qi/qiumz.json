Thatwe all need to do better-at the state as well as the federal level-is obvious. In the face of powerful, unpredictable, and enigmatic forces inthe political economy, political and economic sophistication are the conditions of our survival. Dedication IsEssential At first, little change might be noted. But .ultimately doctors would malpractice from ignorance; bridges de\u00ad signed by untutored engineers would collapse; literature and theperforming arts would be held to no standards, and would dissolve into globs of jelly; economics would be\u00ad come a brokenrecordof inutile theories; philosophers wouldplaysloppy word games without rules or rigor; astronomy would collapse into the black holes it has only recently discovered. Above all, society would develop a fatalhardening ofthearteries for lack of informed and sensitive social criticism. Andthere would be no specially protected environment friendly to the restless probings of the human mind. Itis not too much to say that our stature as humans would be reduced by cubits, for we would no longer be standing on tiptoe trying to touch the face of somebeckoning mystery. Keeping your institutions going may seem in these days a somewhat sullen trade. But without your dedicated atten\u00ad tion to the logisticsof education, scholars could not search for new knowledge, studentscould not stretch their minds and hearts, society could not receive the healing, some\u00ad times painful, balm of self-criticism. Ultimately the world could not muster those energies of mind, aesthetic creativ\u00ad ity, and examined moral sentiment thataresurely its only long-range promise.I urge you not to lose heartor commitment.

But I would remind you of Winston Churchill's reply to an old lady who in 1942, in the middle of the Battle of Britain, asked the prime minister why Britainfought. Churchill replied, \"You'dfind out if we stopped.\" Whatifwestopped? Whatif all of our colleges and universities suddenly disappeared? What if they ceased to function altogether? 3Thefourthexternalforce affecting higher education is the most insidious of all. Itis the corrosive impact of pub\u00ad licdisenchantment.

PERMIT four thathave had (or are likely to have)amajorimpact on the fortunes of higher education. The waysin which college and university officials and friends react to these forces can make an enormous difference to the future of higher education. Conforming to NewSocialNorms The\u00b7first force may be labeled \"federal government mandatesto conform to new social norms.\" This refers, of course,tothedozenorsofederallawsplacedonthe booksin the last several years thatattemptto achieve a variety of social ends only marginally relatedto the edu\u00ad cational objectives of colleges and universities: equal employment opportunity, equal pay, affirmative action, elimination of age discrimination, occupational safetyand health, minimum wage and fair laborstandards, unemploy\u00ad mentinsurance, social security, healthmaintenance orga\u00ad nizations, Employment Retirement Income Security Act provisions, wage and salary controls, environmental pro\u00ad tection, privacy laws, etc. Carol Van Alstyne and SharonColdrenof theAmerican Council on Education have been studying the costs to colleges and universities of implementing or conforming to these federally mandated social programs. With the cooperation of sixinstitutions of higher education of vari\u00ad ous types - grantedthe primitive state of the art of ferret\u00ad ing or factoring out such costs -the Council's Policy Analysis Service staff has come up with tentative figures thatare sobering indeed. Ifone canextrapolate from this small sample, most col1egesand universities in the nation havebeenforced to dip into reserves or into othersacred pockets in orderto meet the rapidly escalating costs of federal1y mandated programs. Fellowship funds have been robbed,academic priorities have been skewed, danger\u00ad ously high tuitionshave been increased even further. In one large public institution, theannualcostof implement- \u00a91975NAClJBO, All Rights Reserveding period 1965-75 frolll$438,000 to$I,300,000,ln oneme~ium\u00ad sized private institution, the costs amountof what the Supreme Court inanothercontext has called \"entanglements.\" Affirmative action comes tomind simply because of the recent crisis over Title IXguidelines and regulations, but many of the federalmandates have been accompanied by sheaves of fine print, bales of reportforms, and panoplies of inspec\u00ad tors!Hereareexternalforces with a vengeance. Andthe costsmandated by these external forces are noteasily passed on to the educational consumer - or even to hard-pressed state legislatures. HigherEducation Is NotExempt What 'should be ourresponse totheseuncomfortable mandates? We could, I suppose, lobby for their elimina\u00ad tion - attempting to rolIback the clock to the days ofour more relaxed ancestral prerogatives. But in ourbetter moments weknowthatsuch talk is silly. Among other things, who are we thatwe should be exempt from the inevitable painsofimplementing evolvingnorms of human equity and dignity? We are a partof theAmerican com\u00ad munity-importantandintegral. We have been quite as guilty as othersegments of society in perpetuating evils of casteandclass-especial1y those based on race,sex,and age.Andwehave no more right to blowtipahumanbeing in an unsafe chemistry laboratory thananindustry has that right while making munitions in an unsafe factory. .Wehaveeveryreasonto demand thatthegovernment be fair,thatitfol1owdue process, thatit attempt to keep regulations as simple and as unambiguous as possible, and that it put its own chaoticadministrative house in order. Vol. 7,No.5' August1975Theremay be legitimate ways in which to recapture .from thegovernment (as industry does) some of the more onerous costs of compliance. But we are, I believe, constrained to ask ourselves in all candorwhether, without the painfulprods and ominous threatsof theleviathan state, we would voluntarily press, in ourproximate settings, to right the wrongs thatour democracy has voted to correct. Unless some of us are inconvenienced, unless '.some of us are administratively anguished, it is probable thatthelong-standing evils of artificially imposed inequities and indignities on our cam\u00ad puses will be left undisturbed. Itisregrettable thatfinan\u00ad cialadministrators must absorb so much of the prickly heat. But I am confident thatmost of you share with me Atits best and most reasonable, acconntability is simply the legitimate requirement on thepadof those who money thatitbe .. andeffectively. the sense are undergoing historically imperative pains of penance, and thatthe quicker we internalize\u00ad and energize with .our own initiatives- the cutting-edge norms of social justice which the government is attempting to enforce, the quicker the externalarmies of bureaucratic meddlerswiJLdisappear\u00b7~~.!'lf,.dig:jpli!!e'''.JQ!mJIaLdlleJ: reminds us, \"is the-yokeof free men.\" A second externalforce affectinghigher the name \"accountability.\" Accountability is easily cari\u00ad caturedas the meaningless statistics higher education is forced to accumulate inorderto. quiet some green-eye\u00ad shade types in the state capital. Or to mix some genera\u00ad tional acronyms: FTEXMBO-i-usable square footage =FUBAR. At.its best and most reasonable, accountability is simply the legitimate requirement on thepartof those who supply moneythatit be spent prudently and effectively.The crux of the dilemma, of course, is this: How can legitimate canons of accountability beaccommodated without up\u00ad settingthepriceless fragility of academic self-determina\u00ad tion?Thereare times when accountability typesremind some of us of curators of Chinese potterywho decide to test the quality of theireggshell vases with a tack hammer. In some states, accountability tack hammers have been written into law. While it is important to induce college and university administrators tosharpenpencils in the war against insti\u00ad tutionalwasteandinefficiency, it is equally important to recognize the limits of simplistic quantitative analysis ad\u00ad dressed to partly ineffable academic outputs. JackGetzels at the University of Chicago has come forth with a useful example of the difficultyof factoring cost-benefit ratios in academic communities. He points out thata fewyears ago, aprofessor ofmathematical physics at the University Fire, Chicagocommuted seventyrnilestwice a week in orderto teachagraduate course with only two students init.The cost-benefit ratio, in a superficial sense, was insane: a high\u00ad pricedprofessor commuting 140 miles each week to in\u00ad structtwo students. Inretrospect, the only mitigating ele\u00ad ment was the fact thata few years later bothgraduate studentswon the Nobel Prize. TheAmerican Council's ablesenioreconomist, Carol Van Alstyne, faced with some accountability dilemmasr~,. lated to the definition of academic productivity>, asksthe following: Ifan engineering graduate in1920c,,,.:q)g~yi'\\~ a bridge, but an engineering graduate in 1975 can geta man to the moon, has an increase in educational productiv\u00ad itytakenplace? Theaccountability syndrome will not disappear. State legislatures, federal officials, and responsible philanthro\u00ad poids will continue to pressforprogram audits as lYel,) as fiscal audits of their funds. Somewhere between the preciousness of academic rationalizations of inefficiency on the one handand the unfeeling and ahnostanti-intel\u00ad lectualIine-iteming of academic budgets by bure~ggatic and bookkeepers on theother, thereiS;l~ii~ealm of legitimate autonomy andreasonable surveil1ane~'9ne of the high callings of a college or university-':~:qap.cial administrator is to define thatworld so thatitjS:flgW)f.~ble bothtoacademic colleagues .cialpatrons..Nogl'O.upofp_eopleishelter.sJ1ile<llp,g%,(Q.[I.I.L this ED!'ct.ofthePolitical Economy ....f Athirdexternalforce is, of course,theitlexq]'~~ien~s . of the political economy.

WHATTODOAFTERFILING Theprovisional application automatically becomes abandoned after one year. Theappli\u00ad canthasseveraloptionsbeforethatpoint;the key to taking advantage oftheprovisional system is toknowwhichoptiontochoose.Inmany cases,thebeststrategy is topreserve the maximum scope and duration as must (a) enableapersonof ordinary skilltopractice theinvention, (b) disclose the best mode of the invention, and (c) include drawings necessary tounderstand the invention.\" Thissituation will most commonly arise themin aregularapplication one yearafter the initialfiling.

Thefollowing caveats must be considered in each situation to decidewhether theadvantages of aprovisional application outweigh the disadvantages. Thetotalcosttoobtainapatentmaybe slightly higher, even though significant costs are postponed. In the situation where no new matterisaddedafter the provisional is filed, the cost offiling the provisional application is addedto the cost of filing a regularapplica\u00ad tion. On the other hand, ifaeIPis possible. Thisconsideration isparticularly relevant forinformation technologies, where the first years ofprotection are far more impor\u00ad tant that}the last years. The informality ofthe provisional system may lull an inventor into a false sense of security. The value of an application depends directly on theadequacy ofthedisclosure. ITthe initial disclosure isinadequate, and the applicantpublishes before filing. The applicant needsto beprepared within that time to determine bothwhether to add material to the provisional, and where to file foreign applications. Aprovisional application maynotclaim priority from a foreign application (or a prior U.S.application). Inventorship cannotbedetermined with certainty for a provisional application because claims are not required. Fortunately, inventors can be removed or addedwhen a provisional application is refiled as a regular application, so long as thereis atleastoneinventor in common. Nonetheless, it may be more difficult to obtain inventors' declarations and assign\u00ad mentsoneyearafterfilingtheprovisional application. SUMMARY Although thereis nosingleanswertothe questions ofwhether and when to file a provi\u00ad sionalapplication, some generalizations may be helpful:Whereimminent publication, publicuse, or saleof anembodiment of aninvention is imminent, a provisional application should be filed fordefensive purposes. Whereresearch relatedto theinvention is ongoing, improvements areexpected within oneyear,commercialization is cost delay is appli\u00ad bepreferred. market, wherepatentissuance isdesired promptly, it will still be best to file a regular application. Thisscenario is morelikelyfor electronics andmechanical inventions. The specific strategies will differ for corpora\u00ad tions,research institutions, andindividuals. But theprovisional filingsystemwillnodoubt become an integralpartof anycomprehensive strategy for protecting intellectual property.

Some agencies, including NASA, have broader discretionary authority to reward not only inventors butother employees for scientific or technical contributions.

The Russians have, as far as I know,three of them. The WorldBank and the UnitedNationshaveproduced severalmodels. To refute those coming from the rich countries, sci\u00ad entists inLatin America produced a model oftheir own. The U.S.JointChiefs of Staff commissioned a new version of a global model at a cost of $1.4 million. At a 1981 conference of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IlASA)in Vienna,representatives from 20global-modeling groupsmadepresentations. And no one knows howmanyothermodels exist within governments andcorporations aroundthe world. Notsurprisingly, the initial assumptions of thesevariousglobal modelers are incredibly dif\u00ad ferent. First, they disagree on merhodology: Is it betterto simulate the worldas it exists, or to consrruct a model thar optimizes as ir a first priority? Is it betterto make guessesabout\"soft\"factors such as political sta- .severalco-authors in 1972 to provide a popularaccountof the first global com\u00ad putermodel,createdanuproarthatstill echoes. Muchof theproblemwas and remains public con\u00ad fusionaboutglobal models. The media depicted ourmodel, done by the SystemsDynamics Group atM.I.T.-and the models thatfollowed and sometimes challenged ours-as crystal balls pre\u00ad dicting the future of almost everything and up\u00ad holdingwildly pessimistic or optimistic views of theworld. . In fact, global models are notmeant to predict, donotinclude every possible aspect of the world, and donotsupporteither pure optimism or pure pessimism aboutthe future. They represent marh\u00ad ematically assumptions abouttheinterrelation\u00ad shipsamongglobal concerns as population, industrial output,naturalresources, and pollu\u00ad tion.Globalmodelers investigate whatmighthap\u00ad pen if policies continue alongpresentlines, or if specificchanges are instituted.

What isoursocialresponsibility: to serve a system or to challenge it, to raise questions or toprovideanswers, to redesign social systems or to empower othersto do so? Themethods andphilosophies of global modelers are so diverse thatonewouldhesitateto call the -models a single body of intellectual work,except thatthey are directed towardthe same intertwined problems: population growth, poverty, resource scarcity, environmental derertoration, andinterna\u00ad tionalinstability. Another POint of commonality is thatmanyof the models were made in response\u00ad sometimes heatedresponse-to the ones thatcame before. Especially whenthe discipline first began, a majorpurpose of each model was to discredit the othersandshowhow the wholeexerciseshouldbe done.Thus,collectively the global uncertainty, andopinionabout globalproblems.

Theworldsystem is enforcing itsregularities on the modelers. When the Japanese, the Soviets, the Americans, theEuropeans, and the South Americans step back and attempttointegrate their most trea\u00ad suredassumptions abouttheplanet,they find them\u00ad selves in substantial agreement. Given the different startingpoints,thedebateaboutglobal issuesislead\u00ad ing to asurprising convergence ofopinion. Action and Reaction The first global model was developed at the behest of the Club of Rome, a groupofpolicymakers, ac\u00ad ademics, and managers who met in Bern, Switzer\u00ad land, in 1970 to discuss 66 worldproblems such as hunger,pollution, and crime. The problems seemed interconnected, soCarrollWilson of M.LT.,a mern-------.--... .e y The '95 TECH~OLOGYThe scientific community criticized World2, and World3on several grounds, one being thatthey did notdistinguish amongdifferent regions of the world.

As each nationtries tomaintain its do\u00ad mestic food supplies andprices at desired levels, it dumpsitsshortages or excesses ontotheworldmar\u00ad ket. The result is systematic amplification: a small fluctuation inwheatproduction in Kansas can be\u00ad come amajorwave inconsumption inGhana.Large, richcountries can buffer their interface expense but small, poorcountries cannot,andfluctuations in theworld marketsweep into their domestic markets. As Dutchmodelers say, \"Hewho has the lowestdam gets thewholeflood.\" Hungerin this model results primarily from ine\u00ad quities in income distribution, bothamongfamilies andamongnations.These inequities are exacerbated by theimpersonal workings of theworldmarket. Measures such as food aid can have adverse effects, since they lowerfood prices in countries receiving the aidanddiscourage farming. However, twokinds of policies do help eliminate hunger:changes that givepoorpeople the resources to earn a decentin\u00ad come,andefforts by the rich countries to keep food exportsandimportsconstant so as to keep world pricesstableandrelatively high. WhenPresident CarteraskedGeraldO. Barney at the U.S.CouncilonEnvironmental Qualitytostudy globalprospects the year 2000,Barneygathered existingmodelsandforecasts of various government branches. Theseincluded population projections from the Census Bureau,foodprojections from the Department ofAgriculture, and so forth.

Theseparate forecasts had never be\u00ad fore been coordinated, and their makers often were not even awarethatotherprojections existed. The assumptions andmethods ofthese forecasts were not necessarily consistent. Indeed, the study concluded that\"atpresentthe executive agencies of the United StatesGovernment are notcapableofpresenting the President withinternally consistent projections of 'worldtrendsinpopulation, resources, and the en\u00ad vironment for thenexttwodecades.\" Eventhoughtheseprojections were not internally consistent, they were consistently gloomy.

Allthe models recognize problems connected with population growth,eventhoughsome modelers be, gan with strongreactions againstthe\"anti-natalist bias\"ofWorld2 andWorld3. Agreement on the need to limit physical growth(ofcapitalgoods,infrastruc\u00ad ture, and housing) isless unanimous, chiefly because some models represent theeconomy only as a flow of money ratherthana stock of physical equipment. theydonotaccountfor the fact thatphysical equip\u00ad \u00b7ment, like population, takes up space, requires a constant streamof energy and raw marerials, and continually emits wastes.

DNo reliable, complete information is available aboutthe degree to which the earth's environment canabsorb the wastes createdto meet humanneeds. The global models have mostly tried to quantify en\u00ad vironmental stresses-such as how much carbon mosphere-but they have not studiedthe ecosys\u00ad tem'sreactions to those stresses. And even the effort tomeasure the stresses has shownthatthedataare totallyinadequate. No reliable dataexist on soilero\u00ad sion,groundwater pollution, or ofradio\u00ad active waste.

One hardly needs a com\u00ad putermodel to discovercur\u00ad rent trends thatare far from sustainable. Theworld's use ofnonrenewable resources such as petroleum cannotcontinue indefinitely. The amountofcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere-up 30 percent since preindustrial times-cannot continue increasing withoutdisrupting the global climate.

The rangeof realpossibilitiesincludessomenearly unimaginable outcomes, including on the one hand nuclear winter and the end ofeverything, and on the otheraworldat peace in which everyone's physical needs are met sustainably, Both these futures are, as far as our presentknowledge can tell, very possible, and the difference between them will be determined by the way the world'speopleunderstand their op\u00ad tions and the way they act. The global models have not given us the key to fullunderstanding of our complex world. We will probably never have thatkey.Whatthe global models have done, at least for those of us most closelyinvolved with them, isto be whatStuart Bre\u00ad mer,directorof aglobal-modeling group at Science Center Berlin, calls a \"creative irritant.\" They have forced us tostandback and look at all the com\u00ad plexity, admir it, be humbled by it, and yet continue tokeepconfronting it. When we do, we see fartoo many negative trends tobecomplacent andfartoO many positive trends to be hopeless. We mainlysee a lot ofworkto do. Forexample, several global-modeling teams have tried to find ways to meet the Lima targets developed by the U.N. Conference on TradeandDevelopment, which specify whatshares ofworldindustrial output theThirdWorldshould J.._ provide by the year 2000. However, these targets were statedso vaguely that the teams could not represent themquantitatively without furtherinterpretation. After representing them as best they could, the teams found the targets essentially unmeetable. And when they forced mas\u00ad sive, unrealistic changes on the system so the goals could be met, the modelers found them not even desirable. For example, the Latin American World Model found thatfor Africa to produce the stipu\u00ad latedamountofmanufactured exports, food pro\u00ad duction, education, and housing would have to decline. Ifglobal models had no otheruse, they would be worththe priceofmaking them just toimposeclarity on the terms of international demands and agree\u00ad ments, and to save the troubleof arguing for con\u00ad ditionsthatarepatentlyimpossible to achieve.

Daniel Nyhartof M.LT. de\u00ad veloped a model ofthe costs and miningthatwas used to debunkinitialassumptions thatthis technology wouldyield abonanza. The model enabled the negotiators to agree on interna\u00ad tional licensing and taxing systems. Although something within us knows better, our mental models and those ofour leaders cling des\u00ad perately to the assumption that the future will not beverydifferent from the present. Or that the future will be some smoothextrapolation of the present. Or at least thatthe future is tobe predicred, not to beshapedbyhumandecisions. It is not possible to maintain those assumptions whilecontemplating the long-term trends of the world.

However, domestic and interna\u00ad tionalconditions in the Soviet Union aredifferent from those in Hungary or China. where non-Hungarian or non-Chinese minorities compose :onlya'smallpercentage of the popu\u00ad lation. The Soviet by con\u00ad :trast,is a collection diverse na\u00ad loss of centralcontrol over the Soviet Union's non-Russian people raises risks few Russians are prepared toentertain.

It ismyopinion that such a pic\u00ad ture is greatly distorted. As Ger\u00ad trude Schroeder. U.S. ex\u00ad pertonthe Sovieteconomic system, has remarked: \"After60 years of experience with the socialist econ\u00ad omy run by government agencies . . . nearly everyone seems to have personal benefitits Ihand irra!' es.

The most serious obstacles to radical reform arepolitical. To adjust the prices of goods and services to realistic levels. for example. the enormous statesubsi\u00ad dies of basic food items, apartment rents and transportation willhave to beabolishedor cut drastically. This wouldrequire the imposition of a harsh austerity regimen on the Soviet people long before any major beneficial results ofthe reform were tangible. The lessons of Poland and its free-trade union \"Solidarity\" movement - whicharose when the government triedtoraisepricesof basic goodssuch as food to realistic levels - probably teach the Sovietleadership to be extremely wary of suchchanges, Finally,radicalreform couldaffect the stability of Eastern Europe, Radicalchanges in the Soviet Union would encourage all reformers and liberalstheretopressforgreater (andpolitically more dangerous)changesintheirowncountries. Even if he is determined to do something radical, Gorbachev could only act after painstaking and time\u00ad consuming preparations. Sweeping changes wouldbe more likelyin the 1990s than in the remainder of this decade. Considering all these barriers, a revolutionmay wellbeeasier than a reform - or a radicalreform might become the equivalent of a revolu\u00ad tion.Recognizing this, many in Rus\u00ad sia and the West who are skeptical about the chances that even anew, young and energetic leadership will embark on such a potentially dan\u00ad gerousenterprise. often speak of a \"partial\" radicalreform. But a radical reform cannot be partial; it cannot be successful when' introduced in small, gradual steps. The courage - and the wisdom\u00ad of thepresentChinese leadership is reflected intheir decision notto plan a piecemeal reform' but to opt for comprehensive change of the eco\u00ad nomicsystem as a whole. The magnitude and variety of domestic problems besieging the Soviet Union lead some Westerncommentators faproclaim, ifnot the imminent demise of the Sovietsystem, then at least the growing probability of a revolution\u00ad ary crisis. ButIamdeeplyconvinced that their judgment about the nature of the Soviet domestic crisis is faulty. The Soviet Union is not threat\u00ad ened withcollapse.Soviet survivalis not in doubt; Soviet effectiveness is. Decline can still be slowed or even reversed.

Finally,radical reform could affect thestability Radicalchangesin the Union wouldencourage allreformers and liberalstheretopressforgreater (and politically more dangerous)changesintheirowncountries. Even if he is determined to do something radical, Gorbachev could only act afterpainstaking and time\u00ad consuming preparations. Sweeping changeswould be more likelyin the 1990sthan in the remainder ofthis decade. Considering all thesebarriers, a revolution may well be easierthan a reform - or a radical reformmight become the equivalent ofarevolu\u00ad tion. Recognizing this, many in Rus\u00ad sia and the West who are skeptical about the chancesthat even a new, young and energetic leadership will embarkon such a potentially dan\u00ad gerousenterprise, oftenspeakof a \"partial\" radicalreform, aradicalreform cannot be partial; it cannot be successful wherr\u00ad introduced in small, gradual steps.

Soviet survival is not in doubt: Soviet effectiveness is.. Decline can still be slowed or even reversed. This is a far cry from recapturing a new and lasting Soviet dynamism, but it is also far removed from any dangerofdisintegration.

The shiftis embodiedina5-year, $I-billion packageofresearch projects whichWasapproved by the ministerslargelyat the urgingof the outspoken commissioner for industry and research, Etienne Davignon, who has just reached the end of his 4-yearterm of office. Davignonwas largelyresponsiblefor one ofthe most significantdevelop\u00ad ments in European in recent years, the EEe'sstrategic programininformationtechnology(ESPRIT).Theprogram, whichwillcost $1.3 billion over 5 years, will be jointly financed by the commission and European companiesandisadirect responsetothechallengefromU.S, and Japanese computer industries.

The overall package of $1 billion overa 4- to 5-year period was considerably smallerthan the commissionof the EEC had originallyasked for, largely as a result of pressure from the British and German govern\u00ad ments.
