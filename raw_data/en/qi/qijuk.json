The ablative laser removes thin outer layers of skin and causes the underlying structural collagen of the skin to tighten. This technique can give dramatic improvement in the appearance of winkles, skin discoloration and sun damage that are unrivaled compared to other techniques. Laser resurfacing is performed in an outpatient clinic setting without the need for any sedation or general anesthesia. The treated area will be numbed with local anesthesia which makes undergoing the procedure extremely comfortable. The laser will remove the outer layer of skin (epidermis) as well as heat the layers of skin underneath it (dermis). The collagen in the dermis remodels when heated, resulting in skin tightening when the treated area heals. The improvement in collagen gives a more youthful and consistent skin appearance. There is downtime with ablative resurfacing as the skin heals from the procedure. For the first 1-2 weeks, a mask and/or ointment is applied to skin as it heals form the laser. Patients take medication to help with any discomfort and to prevent infection. As the skin heals, patients can use make up to cover the temporary redness that develops during the healing process. Over the next months the skin gradually improves, resulting in a dramatic and sustained result. - Laser resurfacing is a procedure used to reduce the prominence of wrinkles, photodamage, and age related changes on your skin.

Unlike full field resurfacing which removes the entire surface area of a treatment site, fractional laser ablates narrow-diameter columns into the skin, covering only a fraction of the total treatment area. By doing this, the laser causes collagen tightening and overall skin quality improvement. However, because most of the surrounding skin is unaffected by the laser (only 10-30% of the entire skin surface is treated at a time), the skin heals much more rapidly. Therefore while not providing the same dramatic improvement as traditional full face resurfacing, fractional laser has shorter healing time, less downtime, and far easier to recover from. The fractional laser can be tuned with varying expected results and recovery time. - Much like full ablative resurfacing, fractional laser treatments are done to improve the appearance of wrinkles, photodamage, and age related skin changes.

The medication is injected directly into the muscle which results in the relaxation and smoothing of the overlying skin. In some patients with long standing, deep wrinkles, it may take several addition sessions to achieve maximum results. Botulinum toxin starts having an effect after several days and can take up to a full week to kick in. Results typically last for about 3 months, but can be longer or shorter in individual patient. In addition, botulinum toxin is used for the treatment of severe excessive sweating known as hyperhidrosis. For many patients this condition causes severe impact in their quality of life and with professional/social interactions. For many patients who have failed other options, this is a life changing treatment for their severe sweating. The treatment is relatively painless, and most patients do not require any anesthesia. Anesthetic cream or ice can be applied to the skin prior to treatment, if the desired. Patients can typically resume their regular routines and activities after the treatment. - Botulinum toxin is an FDA approved medication packaged under various brand names (i.e., Botox\u00ae, Dysport\u00ae, and Xeomin\u00ae) that is used to treat wrinkles, frown lines and crow's feet causes by movement of the underlying muscles in these areas.

At the appointment you will discuss the condition you have and what outcome you would like to achieve. The doctor will take a complete medical history to understand what concerns you have and what your goals of treatment are. He/she will then perform a physical exam to evaluate your skin and make a diagnosis. Your doctor will explain your treatment options, how each procedure works, the expected result of each procedure and any potential risks. This allows you to have a personalized treatment plan that is specifically tailored for your skin and concerns. Your consultation will allow your physician to fully answer all of your questions, address all your concerns, and give you a personalized recommendation and treatment plan. In some cases, this can be done in just a few minutes, and in other instances may take longer. Every patient is unique and your doctor can help determine the best treatment options for you. - Chemical Peel - A chemical peel is a resurfacing procedure that helps rejuvenate the skin. This procedure is useful for treating fine lines, wrinkles, and photodamage and discoloration. A chemical solution is applied to the skin which peels away the top layers. Typically chemical peels are performed on the face and neck, but can be used in other locations as well. There are a variety of intensities of chemical peels, which is based on the specific solution used. A light, medium or deep peel can be performed depending on the desired results. Light peels have an easier recovery and shorter downtime as compared to deeper peels, but don't produce the same results. Your doctor can advise you on the different chemical peel options and what is the right treatment for you. Before the peel your doctor will clean your face, and your eyes and hair will be protected. Your doctor will apply a solution to your face, neck or other target area using a gauze or cotton tipped applicator. The solution may cause a light stinging on the treated area for approximately several minutes. A cold compresses can be placed on the treated area after applying the solution. A fan is used to cool the skin during the procedure. The recovery process varies depending on the type and depth of chemical peel performed. Patients generally have mild irritation, peeling, and redness for several days after the procedure. A good moisturizer can be used to help promote healing and maximize the final result. The treated skin should have a rejuvenated appearance. Your skin should be tighter, smoother and have an improved appearance. - A chemical peel is a resurfacing procedure that helps rejuvenate the skin.

The technology is highly effective at permanently reducing the amount of hair present in a treated area. Laser hair removal is performed on both men and women for the treatment of unwanted hair on the face, neck, underarms, back, bikini area, and legs. In addition, patients with folliculitis (or inflammation/irritation of the hair follicle from shaving) can obtain significant relief from their condition with laser treatment. The laser works by targeting the pigment in the hair follicle. As a result, the hair follicle is damaged and does not grow back. Blonde, grey, or white hair does not respond well to laser hair removal since there is no pigment for the laser to target. The treatment is generally tolerated well by patients, but some patients prefer to have a numbing cream applied prior to the treatment. Following the procedure the treated site can temporarily be blotchy, swollen and red. To relieve any discomfort after the procedure, you may apply an icepack to the treated area to reduce the swelling. An over-the-counter pain reliever is advised as well. It is important not to wax or pluck the hair for 6 weeks prior to the laser treatment. If the hair root has been removed, then there is not a target for the laser and the treatments will be less effective. In addition, it is important to avoid having a tan when you come in for a treatment in order to reduce any potential complications. At UCSF, we have multiple lasers that can be safely used to remove hair in patients of all skin colors. - Laser hair reduction is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures performed in the US.

The damaged outer layer of your skin is removed by abrasion using very small crystals. Microdermabrasion reduces the appearance of fine wrinkles, sun damage, and scarring. New skin cells are triggered to grow to replace the old skin cells. Following microdermabrasion the skin has a rejuvenated and more youthful appearance. There is minimal/no downtime associated with microdermabrasion, allowing the patient to quickly return to his/her usual activities. A handheld machine is used to treat the targeted region. The device contains a tube which releases a stream of crystals onto the skin as well as a vacuum. The suction from the vacuum raises a small area for the device to work on, brings impurities to the surface and removes the dead skin from the surface of the skin. In addition, different solutions can be infused during the microdermabrasion to further help rejuvenate your skin. - Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure to enhance the appearance of your skin.

A light-sensitive drug is applied to the skin and is selectively absorbed by damaged cells. A light is directed at the targeted site which activates the drug and destroys the damaged cells. The procedure is performed in two parts: incubation and light activation. A solution containing a photosensitive agent is applied onto the targeted region. The drug needs a brief incubation period before the light activation step can occur. After one-two hours of incubation, the patient sits under a blue light for approximately 15 minutes. The light sensitive agent in the drug reacts with light to create an oxygen molecule. The produced oxygen kills the targeted cells surrounding it. This effectively causes the precancerous lesion to be destroyed. During the light activation, a warm/tingling sensation is sometimes experienced. A fan and cooling mist spray typically relieves any discomfort during the procedure.. Once the light treatment has finished, the treated area is cleaned and a coat of sunscreen is applied on the area. Many patients experience a sunburn and mild dryness on the treatment area. It is critical to avoid any direct sunlight to the treated area for two days after the procedure as further exposure to sunlight can result in an excessive reaction. In many cases additional treatment sessions will be required to get maximum benefits. - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method used to target and destroy pre-cancerous skin lesions (i.e. actinic keratoses).

In many cases, fibrous tissue connects upper layers of skin to subcutaneous tissue and contributes to the depressed appearance of some scars. Subcision helps to release these scars, which results in an improved appearance. The scars are numbed with local anesthesia. A special blade is used to sever the fibrous tissue connecting the upper layers of the skin with subcutaneous tissue. Multiple incisions can be performed in one session. During the healing process, the new tissue elevates the superfical aspect of the skin, resulting in a reduction in the scar's appearance. The procedure is quickly and easily performed in the office and there is often very little downtime or recovery. Patients often need multiple treatments to achieve maximum results. - Subcision is a technique that helps improve the appearance of depressed scars from acne, surgery or trauma.

For many patients, the increasing number of veins on the legs can be both an unsightly as well as uncomfortable condition. Sclerotherapy is performed using an injection of a chemical solution into the vein. The injected chemical solution irritates the walls of the vein which results in the vein swelling. The walls of the varicose or spider veins thus weaken and collapse. The collapsed vein is broken down by your body and reabsorbed by the surrounding tissue. Sclerotherapy does not have any impact on the normal blood flow in the legs and is extremely safe. A slight burning is sometimes felt while the solution is being injected, but no anesthesia or sedation is required. Depending on how large or numerous the veins are, patients often need additional treatment to achieve the desired results. - Sclerotherapy is a treatment to lessen the appearance of spider and varicose veins.

There are a variety of fillers offered at UCSF which are designed to target specific imperfections e.g., Restylane\u00ae, Juvederm\u00ae, Voluma\u00ae, and others. Fillers can be used to plump lips, smooth fine or deep wrinkles, fill hollow cheeks or elevate depressed scars. Many fillers contain anesthesia within them, making the injections very well tolerated. During your consultation your doctor will determine which filler best suits your case. As you age, collagen and hyaluronic acid, two molecules which create a youthful appearance in your skin, are depleted. There are two types of fillers which restore these molecules: fillers that activate collagen production and fillers that contain hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a complex sugar molecule that acts as a sponge in your skin. Its main function is to absorb water molecules. The water-hyaluronic acid network creates volume in the skin. Collagen is the supportive and structural molecule of the skin. When it is injected into the skin, the structural support that was diminished is restored. The increase of collagen allows the skin to create stronger support network which leads to a rejuvenated and younger appearance. Some blemishes require multiple visits to be completely resolved. In addition, fillers are not permanent - they can last from 6 months to up to two years. Occasionally your doctor will advise \"touch-up\" appointments in order to maintain the effect of the filler. Minor swelling, redness and bruising is typical after the procedure. Most patients can return to their normal routines immediately after the procedure. If bruising occurs, it often subsides after several days. Makeup can be used immediately to cover any discoloration and patients can return for a laser treatment to help speed up the resolution of the bruising. - Soft tissue fillers are gel solutions that reduce wrinkles and restore fullness that is lost in the aging process.

The energy from a high intensity laser beam breaks up the pigment in the tattoo ink. Each laser and intensity of the beam targets different colors of pigment, and we have multiple lasers that we canuse to target specific colors. We select lasers that are the most effective in destroying the tattoo ink and the least likely to hurt the surrounding tissue. The shattered pigment gets absorbed by the surrounding tissue. Patients will often have the area numbed prior to laser treatment in order to make the procedure more comfortable. Patients may have temporary blistering, bleeding or inflammation after the procedure. Different color tattoo inks respond differently to the laser and some colors are easier to remove than others. Following each laser treatment session, the tattoo will gradually lighten/fade. Most tattoos require multiple treatments to achieve the desired results. - Laser treatment can be performed to remove undesired tattoos.

The doctors at the UCSF Dermatologic Surgery and Laser Center have extensive experience treating a wide range of conditions with laser. The clinic has a variety of different lasers that can be used to treat vascular lesions. During the consultation, the doctor can choose the best one for your specific condition. The lasers work by specifically targeting the blood vessels in the vascular lesions and birthmarks. All procedures are performed in an outpatient clinic setting. Typically laser treatment is well tolerated by patients. In some instances, patients use a topical anesthetic cream to minimize any discomfort during the procedure. Following treatment, the number of visible lesions can decrease and the overall color can fade. Depending on what condition is being treated, more than one treatment is often required for maximum improvement. Most patients are able to resume normal activity immediately after the treatment. - Many different skin conditions can be treated with laser including broken blood vessels, rosacea, angiomas, port wine stains, and vascular birthmarks.

This allows your doctors to precisely remove fat from the area. Ideal candidates for tumescent liposuction are fit, otherwise healthy patients with a balanced diet, who cannot lose a discrete and \"stubborn\" storage of fat. Tumescent liposuction is a minimally invasive liposuction technique because of the small incisions used. Your doctor will mark the areas needed to be treated while you are standing. You will receive an injection of anesthesia, and small incisions are made for the suction tubes to enter the area. Very thin stainless steel tubes called cannulas are inserted through the small incisions. The fatty tissue is suctioned out of the area through the cannulas. Once the procedure has finished the small incisions are closed with sutures. Swelling is a usual side effect and will subside a few days after the procedure. We advise resuming exercise three to seven days after the procedure. During the healing process we recommend wearing compressive clothing. It takes from a week to a month for the result of the liposuction to show. Most patients continue to see the benefits of the treatment for several months after the procedure. CRYOLIPOLYSIS (also known by the CoolSculpting\u00ae) is a non-invasive procedure that reduces and eliminates stubborn unwanted fat. Fat is more sensitive to temperature than other tissue, and cryolipolysis takes advantage to this during treatment. This is a non-surgical, no downtime procedure performed in the office that uses cooling to safely target and eliminate fat cells. There are no incisions, no injections, and you can get back to your normal routine immediately. An external vacuum applicator is used to target the specific area and bring the tissue into contact with the controlled cooling panels. The device is able to gently cool the underlying fat, while safely keeping the temperature in the surrounding skin at a safe level. This results in the treated fat cells becoming crystalized (frozen) and then dying. The body naturally eliminates these cells over the next several months which contributes to the long term expected results of cryolipolysis. Patients see a gradual improvement over time in the amount of fat and overall body contour in the treated area, with an expected 20-25% improvement. In some cases additional treatments are performed to get the maximum benefit and get even more impressive results. DEOXYCHOLIC ACID (Kybella\u00ae) is an FDA approved injection that kills the fat cells under the chin (also known as double chin). Through series of injections spaced out over multiple sessions, this medication can improve the appearance and profile of the patient. Deoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. When injected into the chin, it permanently destroys the unwanted fat resulting in long term improvement. Dexoxycholic acid injections are performed in the office as a no downtime procedure. The area of fullness is carefully marked and multiple injections of the medicine are placed directly into the fat. The treatment session takes about 15 minutes and you can return to your normal activities right away. Treatments can be repeated after about 1 month, and most patient require 2-4 sessions to get to their desired end result. - TUMESCENT LIPOSUCTION is a procedure which removes excess fat from a centralized location on a body using suction. \"Tumescent\" refers to the use of local anesthesia which swells and firms the targeted tissue.
