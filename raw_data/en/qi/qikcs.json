As a child i suffered through many illnesses and was a regular at the hospital. To say the least, all of the up's and downs of being ill had taken its toll on my mind, body and soul. Being a professional dancer, teacher and choreographer at the time i was prone to feeling very low in energy and it was starting to show in my work... It felt as if i was surrounded by a dark cloud which had no intension of letting light in anytime soon. An amazing opportunity arose and i was to move to Toronto and be a dancer on CTV's hit t.v. show So You Think You Can Dance Canada! Knowing that i was to be putting in 12-14 hour days for upwards of 3-4 months i knew i had to make a change!. One of my best friends whom is currently studying naturopathic medicine at Boucher advised i look into a more natural approach. Best advice i have ever been given! At first i must admit i thought the process was a little voodoo and far out there but after receiving dietary and health advice from Dr. Carol Y. Lin a Naturopathic Physician at Radiant Natural Health Clinic in Vancouver B.C. my life has been nothing but positive and clear. Because of Dr.Lin i am now at the peak of my career and am the healthiest i have ever been. Your health is key in having a great life and i truly believe as dancers we need to be more invested in not only our outsides but also our insides.\" -Danielle Gardner- Please take a read and let us know what you think! We hope you choose to learn more about naturopathic medicine and that it changes your life for the better.- Impact Dance Productions. -A word from Dr. Carol Lin- Naturopathy is a branch of medicine that takes a holistic approach in healing and wellness. Naturopathic medicine strongly favours a drug-free treatment since it is founded on the belief that nutrition, exercise, emotion well being and other natural factors are significant to the origin and cure of the illness. Naturopathic physicians work towards personalizing treatment programs to optimize an individual's health. These programs can help with allergies, skin problems, digestive disorders, hormonal issues and stress, to name a few. The treatments may include exercise, diet and lifestyle changes, herbal medicines, physical therapies or nutritional medicines. There are ways you could adapt in your daily life to optimize your physical, mental and spiritual health. For your digestive tract health, chew your food well and do not drink anything while eating as it will decrease your body's digestive enzymes production. Include at least one serving of steamed or raw greens daily. For your kidneys' health, drink at least the equivalent of one third to one-half your body weight in ounces. An example being a 150 pounds person would drink 50-75 ounces of water daily. For the health of skin and the lymphatic system, do dry skin brushing by using very gentle, light, short frequent strokes toward the heart for 45-60 seconds before going to bed. As for the health of liver and immune system, castor oil packs to the abdomen should be done regularly. Practice deep breathing daily by inhaling through the nose to fill the abdomen and lungs, and slowly exhale through the mouth to promote the health of the lungs. Sleep is important for memory and the balance of the hormonal system, every hour of sleep before midnight is worth two hours of sleep after midnight. Move your muscles daily to aid circulation, walking, yoga, qi gong, cardio exercise, weights and stretching are all great ideas. Always exercise within your own physical limits. Fresh air daily helps clear the mind and get more oxygen into your body. Finally, do something fun daily for laugher is the best medicine for stress management. Dr. Carol Y.
