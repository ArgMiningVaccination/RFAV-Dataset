Developing some side-effects with the coronavirus vaccine shot is considered to be normal. However, there's a small percentage of people who end up developing serious, or allergic reactions to the vaccines and need attention. While beneficiaries are asked to be abreast of common and uncommon vaccination symptoms, developing an allergy to the shot can quickly take a turn for serious, and lead to severe complications. Hence, it's important to know how to spot the signs of trouble and know when to seek help. Having said that, what really happens if you get an allergic reaction after the first shot? Can you still take the second dose? Here's all you need to know about the same if you are lined up to receive your vaccination dose: [readmore](javascript://) 02/7What defines an allergic reaction? How common is it? An allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, or any vaccine occurs when a person who is sensitive to one or the other ingredients present in the vaccine develop an unpleasant reaction that leads to anaphylaxis. While it's not easy to determine who might get it post-vaccination, a person with a prior history (or such as having an egg allergy) have a higher risk of developing unpleasant reactions. Allergic reactions with vaccines, even though serious are considered to be a rare side-effect. Not everybody gets it, and the clinical precedence of the same as well as evaluations have been found to be on the lower side. Since allergic reactions require attention at once, it's crucial that those who have received the vaccine are monitored for their side-effects, and the waiting time period of 30 minutes is maintained. [readmore](javascript://) 03/7Is it different from an adverse reaction? While both the side-effects are of serious nature and require medical help, allergic reactions are a bit different from adverse reactions. An adverse reaction to the vaccine is defined as a serious reactogenic, often life-threatening side-effect when one is administered the vaccine shot. To simplify, what differentiates an adverse reaction from an allergy is the reaction itself. While an allergy is mediated by immediate immune response, a side-effect is 'expected'. Blood clots, or myocarditis, for example, are termed as 'serious' reactions and can be witnessed in a span of 7-20 days post vaccination. Allergic reactions usually are of two types- severe and non-severe. Immediate reactions, which may not always require severe care are categorized as non-severe and can be treated with some interventions. The timing also differs. While allergies usually come up minutes following vaccination, adverse, serious reactions take a while. [readmore](javascript://) 04/7What should a vaccinated person do if they develop an allergy? Since the timing and occurrence of allergic reactions to the vaccination can't really be predicted, it's important that all beneficiaries stay aware of possible symptoms. However, if you do happen to develop some unpleasant reaction minutes after getting vaccinated, alert healthcare providers at once. An immediate allergic reaction can strike as late as 4 hours post-vaccination. So, it's helpful to be alert. As for the reactions themselves, be alert for the type of reaction you get. If you get a rash at the spot where you got the vaccine or COVID arm, tell your provider about the same. Some antihistamines and allergic medications may be taken for the same. If there's a severe reaction, such as anaphylaxis (which can cause you to faint, sweat), healthcare workers may rush you to the nearest hospital, where evaluations may continue to happen for at least several hours. It should be remembered that although concerning, allergic reactions can be well-managed if diagnosed in time.

Some people might be more at risk of developing adverse reactions and serious allergic reactions from vaccines including: -Those who have had a prior anaphylactic reaction -History of asthma and allergies -Sensitive to one or the other ingredients present in vaccines. [readmore](javascript://) 07/7Can you still be eligible for the second shot in time? Developing an allergy may make many hesitant or scared to get the second shot, especially if they get a severe one after the first shot. However, the need or avoidance of the second shot may depend on some factors. If you get a non-serious reaction, you may still be advised to get the shot, with extra precautions in hand. With serious reactions, a second shot may sometimes be refused, depending on the person's history and sensitivity. Anti-allergic medications may also be advised for someone who undergoes an allergic reaction if they are bound to get the scheduled shot. Having said that, a person with a prior history shouldn't stop or pause taking the medicines before the appointment, and keep their doctor in the loop of all that's happening. If there's a specific vaccine that is to blame or the reason behind the reaction, the person may be requested to get a different vaccine. It's important to consult a healthcare provider to seek more details on the same and curb unnecessary hesitancy.
