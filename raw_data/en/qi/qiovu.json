Grab our Skin Care Ultimate Set! - Made with the right oils for your skin type to cleanse, nourish, detoxify, and balance. - A comprehensive skin care with natural ingredients that provides your skin the love and care that it needs. - Never diluted or made with fragrances, parabens, sulfates, or polysorbate 80. Why have you been paying premium prices for beauty products that don't seem to do much for your skin? Its because many skin care companies dilute their products with water to create a thinner product. However, as a result, you get a less effective product that most likely has synthetic emulsifiers, preservatives, and other ingredients \u2014 things that your skin absolutely doesn't need. We Wanted to Provide Better Skin Care When creating our skin care products, Earthley thought there was a better way \u2014 a cleaner, simpler, and more effective way to do skin care. To create products that truly provide the TLC that your skin needs, we studied the properties of the variety of oils that can be used in skin care products. Unlike other companies, we don't assume that coconut oil is right for everyone or that it can provide your skin what it truly needs. Cleanse With Our All- Natural Cleanser We created our cleanser in bar form to avoid using harsh, drying castile, soap, or detergent \u2014 which aren't great for the skin and can overly dry out your skin. In addition to creating a formula that is gentle for facial skin, we superfatted it so as you cleanse your skin, it leaves behind beneficial oils to keep your skin moisturized and healthy. - Charcoal Facial Bar - formulated for oily and acne-prone skin. - 3-In-1 Facial Bar - created for dry, sensitive, or combination skin. Balance With Our Herbal Toner A toner is for not only detoxifying the sky, but it also promotes healthy oil balance \u2014 to combat dryness and overly oily skin. We formulated ours with witch hazel and rose petals which soothes sensitive skin, evens-out skin tone, and promotes healthy oil production. Nourish With Our All-Natural Moisturizer We made our all-natural moisturizer with oils. Why? Because there are good oils, and there are those that are prone to clogging your skin. With both of our formulas we created a product that won't clog your pores, but will deliver the nourishment your skin needs to stay healthy. - Our moisturizer for oily/acne-prone won't clog your pores but will promote oil balance, reduce redness and irritation from breakouts. - Our formula for dry skin is created to deeply moisturize your skin without clogging your skin. You won't find any other company that formulate as carefully as we do \u2014 and that's why ours actually works. Heal & Refine With Our Natural Facial Serum Earthley's serum utilizes the power of high-end oils and essential oils to create an all-natural facial serum that is made to balance out oil production, heal scars, reduce fine lines, and provide more benefits to keep your skin healthy and glowing. We also offer our Deep Healing Skin Serum, which is infused with herbs to smooth skin naturally and promote healing of scars, acne, and more \u2014 get even more benefits, naturally! Clear With Our Exfoliating Skin Cream Our Exfoliating Skin Cream is optional, but we think completely necessary for smooth, healthy, glowing skin. The raspberry seed powder gently clears away dead skin and other residue while our deeply nourishing oils and butters moisturize \u2014 your skin will feel so soft and clean! Fight Breakouts With Our Herbal Acne Treatment Are you tired of fighting acne with treatments that dry out and irritate your skin? We were too. We created our Clear Skin Essential Oil Roller that will fight the bacteria that causes breakouts and will help to clear your acne \u2014 it's a one-two punch to pimples! Detox With Our Green Clay Mask Finally, you can find our green clay mask in our Ultimate Set. French green clay is not only one of the most absorbent clays, but while it draws out the junk that can get caught in our skin, this natural clay mask also brings blood closer to the surface of our skin. All of this promotes smoother, softer skin, and can reduce oiliness and acne. What's more, we added lavender essential oil to provide even greater bacterial-fighting properties and to soothe your skin. You won't find any compromise ingredients in any of Earthley's products! We use only carefully-selected organic and cold-pressed oils, pure essential oils, and organic herbs. The oils in our skin care with natural ingredients are all non-comedogenic and right for individual skin types. We never use: - Synthetic emulsifiers - Preservatives - Colors - Soy - Gluten - Parabens - Phthalates - Animal products - ...anything unnecessary or toxic It's the absolute cleanest, safest, and most effective natural skin care set you'll ever use! And it's completely vegan.
