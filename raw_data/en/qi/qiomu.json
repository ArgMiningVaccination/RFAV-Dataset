Streamline and simplify as much as you can.' Greg McKeown (author of [Essentialism, the Disciplined Pursuit of Less]) How to set up a new habit [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)by James Clear. He recommends that we start with one habit we already have, and build another one onto that. 'You don't have to build the habits that everyone tells you to build. Choose the one that suits you, not the one that's most popular.'James Clear - What time you do it - What you do before/after - How you prepare for it - Where you do it Example 1 - using hand-cream - Treated myself to the [hand-cream](https://uk.nyrorganic.com/shop/tracykarkutlaw/area/shop-online/category/hand-care/product/2419/frankincense-intense-hand-serum-50ml/)I like best. - Put it on a shelf outside the bathroom where it catches my eye. - Tried to use it as part of my bedtime routine, plus other times as well. - Notice how my hands are feeling, and apply hand-cream if they feel dry. Example 2 - drinking 2 litres of water a day - Keep two glass bottles with water in the fridge. - As part of my morning work routine, I take out a glass water bottle and place it next to where I'm working, along with a glass. - When the glass is empty I refill it. - When the bottle is empty I swap it for the other bottle. - I try to drink one bottle before lunchtime, and another in the afternoon. Small things, repeated often, become routines 'To have a great day, have a great morning.'David Hieatt When the clocks changed recently, I decided to set my alarm and wake up earlier so I can have time for myself in the lighter mornings. Plan and strategy - Wake up and drink water. - Do some yoga. - Write my morning pages. - Write three things I'm grateful for. - Meditate. - Not getting up when the alarm goes off. - The floor not being clean. - Not being able to find my yoga mat, pencil, journal etc. - Getting side-tracked by looking at my phone when I open my meditation app. Being aware of all the things on this list of obstacles has helped me set up systems to avoid them. Also, I've tried doing things in every possible order, to help me decide what to do first. Through trial and error I discovered: - When I leave meditation till last, my family might disturb me. - If I write my gratitude first, I get distracted by reviewing my plan for the day. - If I write my pages first, I tend to linger, and not get onto the yoga or meditation. The best order for my calming self-care routine - Wake up and drink water. - Feed my cat and quickly sweep the floor before getting my yoga mat and journal ready. - Meditate. - Do yoga (I choose a simple sequence for the week). - Write my [morning pages](http://homeopathywithtracy.co.uk/blog/this-book-could-change-your-life/)if I have time. - Write three things I'm grateful for. How to create a calming self-care routine - Start with a small new habit you want to do every day. - Write it down. - Write a list of all the things that could prevent you from doing that thing. - Consider what you can do to stop those things from happening. - Try doing it for a few days then consider what you have learned. - When is the best time for you to do it? - Is there something you need to do first? - When you have that one thing happening regularly, see if there is something else you can add on, either before or after. - Review your routine to see if it's working. - Adjust it if you need to. Practice not perfect I'm not suggesting you have a morning routine with the same things as me, or indeed any morning routine at all. But, if you want to include more self-care practice to your life, consider creating a routine around it. Something small that you do daily will have an impact that builds up over time. Self-care should not feel like a luxury. It's not at all selfish and I would argue that it's important, more than ever before. Is homeopathy for you? I can help you: - Balance your hormones - Have nice clear skin - Feel calm and energised - Get a good night's sleep Am I right for you? I know how it feels to have a list of things you want to sort out so you can just get on with life. It's important for you to choose the right person to work with and I know that's a big decision.
