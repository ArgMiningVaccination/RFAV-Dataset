Before even presenting yourself as a candidate at Jacobi, you need to really understand what this surgery is - and isn't. Please have a frank conversation about the following aspects of weight-loss surgery with your primary care doctor or a doctor who is most familiar with your care. sBariatric surgery is not cosmetic surgery. sBariatric surgery does not involve the removal of fat by suction or surgical removal. sThere are benefits and risks to weight-loss surgery. sThe key to success after bariatric surgery is committing to long-term lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. sYou need to be aware that, in rare cases, problems after surgery may require more operations to correct them.WHAT YOUNEED TOKNOW ABOUT BARIATRIC SURGERY 2Your safety is our number one concern. That's why, before accepting you as apatient, our team gives you a series of evaluations with various specialists, to see if weight-loss surgery is the best answer for you. What welearn about you from your evaluations lets uscompare the risks of bariatric surgery with thebenefits for you. The first qualification for being a bariatric surgery candidate at Jacobi is your Body Mass Index (BMI).So let's find out what this important measure means: What is your Body Mass Index (BMI)? sYour BMI measurement shows the relationship between your height and weight and your amount of body fat. sYour BMI is used to determine how much risk you have of developing certain health problems because of your weight. sThe higher your BMI, the higher your risk for developing additional health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol or hypertension. Here are BMI scores for adults and what they mean: You are a candidate for bariatric surgery at Jacobi if your BMI is: s40 or greater - you are approximately 100 pounds or more overweight s35 or greater and you have one or more medical conditions Underweight less than18.5 Healthy 18.5 - 24.9 Overweight 25 - 29.9 Obese more than 30 Class I 30 - 35 Class II Severe Obesity 35 - 39.9 Class IIIMorbid Obesity more than 40 Super Morbid Obesity more than 50AREYOUA C ANDIDATE FOR WEIGHT -LOSSSURGERY ? 3SUCCESS STORIES MARIE N. Sleeve Gastrectomy \"I have two birthdays. One is the day I was born. The other is the day Dr. Chopra did my bariatric surgery and I began tolive again. I had basically stopped living. For three years, I hid in the house. I couldn't fit in chairs, so I stopped going anywhere. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't lay on my back because I'd feellike I was being suffocated. I couldn't clean myself in theshower, so I always felt dirty. I couldn't walk around thecorner without feeling my heart was going to pump out of my chest. Now I feel like someone put a battery in me! I walk everywhere. I had the confidence to go out and find two jobs. The people at Jacobi were beautiful - the nurses, the surgeons, everybody. They gave me so muchencouragement as the weight was coming off.\" \"Now that I have my health back, I'm going to find my happiness. I am in love with life!\" TERRY A. Adjustable Gastric Banding \"I've got my life back! At 353 pounds, I had sleep apnea,high blood pressure was right around the corner, and I wasscheduled for my seventh knee surgery. I loved to travel andfly, but having to ask the stewardess for a seatbelt extensionmade me avoid planes like the plague. I hated callingattention to myself. As my weight kept going up, I wondered, 'Will I ever have another relationship?' Now I have a new life and a new career.\" \"I say to people, 'Do you want to feel good about yourself? There is a way.'\" Before surgery: 384 lbs.15 months after surgery: 179 lbs. Before surgery: 353 lbs.1-1/2 years after surgery: 235 lbs. Will YouBe Our Next Success Story? 4General Information sA band is placed around the stomach, dividing the stomach into two parts, a small upper \"pouch,\" and a larger bottom part sBecause food first goes into the small pouch, you feel full with very little sFood digestion and calorie absorption occurs normally sThe band is made tighter or looser through the port, with a needle, which is surgically placed under your skin. It can be felt to the touch, but not seen, and causes no pain. Advantages sThere is no permanent division of the stomach or intestines sThe band restricts the amount of food that can be consumed at a meal sFood consumed passes through the digestive tract in the usual way, allowing it to be fully absorbed into the body sExpected weight loss after surgery can be 50 percent of excess body weight after two years sThe band can be adjusted to decrease or increase restriction sThe band can be removed surgically - making it a reversible procedure sNo need for overnight stay after surgery Disadvantages sUse of injection with needle to tighten or loosen the band sNeeds close follow-up for best results sLess weight loss than other procedures Possible Complications These possible problems are in addition to the general risks of surgery: sInfection where the port enters the body sNausea and vomiting sBand slipage or leakage sStomach damage due to separation sGaining access to a port that is leaking or twisting may require an additional operation sBand erosion (through the stomach wall) sReflux ADJUSTABLE GASTRIC BANDING 5General Information sNewest procedure sSimpler to perform than gastric bypass sTwo thirds of stomach is removed, the remaining third is stapled closed sThe stomach that remains is shaped like a thin banana, and its capacity is about 3-5 ounces sNot reversible sCan be converted to gastric bypass Advantages sThough stomach size is reduced, it functions normally. So most food can be consumed in small amounts sReduces appetite-stimulating hormone so you feel less hungry sCreates fewer vitamin deficiencies than gastric bypass sThe anatomy is preserved and food progresses through the normal channel sNo foreign body placed in the body, as with the gastric band sExpected weight loss for most patients can be 60-70 percent of their excess body weight over 1-2 years sIdeal for patients who have very high medical risks, high weight or BMI, complex surgical histories, or those who fear potential complications from a gastric bypass sAlso ideal for lower BMI patients who want to avoid a more complex gastric bypass, or have to compensate for vitamin or nutritional deficiencies sGood option for people with anemia, Crohn's disease and numerous other conditions that make them too high- risk for intestinal bypass procedures Disadvantages sHigher BMI patients may need to have a second-stage gastric bypass later to help lose all their excess weight sTwo stages may be safer and more effective than one operation for high BMI patients sNot reversible, but it can be converted to another weight-loss procedure sRisk of acid reflux (heartburn). If reflux doesn't respond to medications, patient may need change to gastric bypass Possible Complications As with any surgery, there can be complications. These may include: Gastric leak Acid reflux Pulmonary embolism SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY Spleen injury Stenosis (narrowing) caused by scar tissue Bleeding 6 Gastric leak Acid reflux Pulmonary embolism PneumoniaGeneral Information sMajor operation. sSmall stomach pouch created sBypass of section of small intestines, limiting the absorption of calories sResults in a fast sensation of fullness, combined with a sense of satisfaction. This reduces the desire to eat. sMost frequently performed bariatric procedure in the United States Advantages sAverage weight loss higher than with other procedures sOne year after surgery, weight loss can average 70-80% of excess body weight. (Weight loss varies with individuals.) Disadvantages The following are in addition to the general risks of surgery: sDecreased absorption of iron and vitamin B12, which may result in anemia sVitamin deficiencies, and decreased calcium absorbsion which can be managed through proper diet and vitamin and mineral supplements sNeed to avoid alcohol sNeed to avoid most anti-inflammatory medications, like Motrin, Advil etc., and smoking, as it increases risk of complications. If you're on an anti-inflammatory for a medical condition, check with your doctor before stopping. sDumping Syndrome sNausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, palpitations, abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating sugary foods like ice-cream, cakes etc. sResult of rapid emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine sThough it can be very unpleasant, not considered a serious health risk sCan be avoided by sticking to an eating plan that includes complex carbohydrates (for example, whole- grain bread) instead of simple sugars (for example, candy) as a part of a balanced diet sOvereating can stretch the pouch over time Possible Complications As with any surgery, there may be immediate and long-term complications. Possible risks can include, but are not limited to: sLeaks from staple lines sPulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) sStenosis from scar tissue (narrowing of a passage) - (less than 5%) sInternal hernias and bowel obstruction (5%) ROUX-EN-Y G than 1%) pouch attaches usually use state-of- the-art minimally invasive (also called,laparoscopic) techniques. Rather than making a large cut to gain access to your organs,the surgeon makes several tiny incisions. Throughthese openings, small instruments are inserted,some with attached cameras, with which thesurgeon performs the procedure. The manybenefits to minimally invasive surgical techniquesinclude less trauma to the body, less scarring, lesspost-operative pain and faster healing. However, for some patients, the laparoscopic approach is not possible. Here are some of thereasons why you may need an open procedure: sPrevious abdominal surgery has caused dense scar tissue sThe surgeon can't see organs without using the open surgery method sBleeding problems during the operation Although it is rare, the decision to perform the open procedure is a judgment call made by your surgeon either before or during the operation and is based on your safety. We only do what is most safe for you.

It is a good idea to call your insurance company to find out what they require. Most will require proof that you've been on a medicallysupervised diet and exercise program for a certain period of time (possibly 6-12 months). This includesdocumented monthly weigh-ins. NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING All patients must see our nutritionist before and after surgery. They will assess your current eating habits, andsuggest dietary changes both before and after surgery. PSYCHOLOGICAL EV ALUATION You will meet with a psychologist at Jacobi Medical Center to make sure you understand the risks and benefits ofbariatric surgery and the lifestyle changes you will have to make after surgery to have the best chance at weight-loss success.

Advance gradually, as instructed. sIf you have a problem with any phase, the best idea is to go back to the previous phase for a day or two and then try again. If you ever vomit, it may be helpful to return to clear liquids or full liquids for 24 to 48 hours. sDrink enough fluid to keep your body hydrated. Try to drink 64 ounces of fluid per day. sSip allowed beverages slowly sWarm beverages may be better accepted sConsume only calorie-free beverages, except milk sEat adequate protein (protein shakes at least 2 times a day). HELPFUL DIETTIPS After surgery, you need to change your eating habits to avoid pain and vomiting, rupture of staple lines and tohelp in weight loss. Immediately after surgery, thetissue around the staples and sutures is very swollenand needs to heal. Swallowing food in chunks mayblock the passage of food and prevent foods frompassing into the intestine. It is CRITICAL that you eat slowly and chew your food well to lower the risk ofgetting anything caught in this area. Phase 1 Clear Liquids0-48 hours after surgery Phase 2 Full Liquids48 hours through first post-op visit (approximately 10 days -2 weeks) Phase 3 Pureed-Mechanical2 weeks through second post-op visit (1 month) Phase 4 Soft Solid Diet1 month - 3 months Phase 5 StabilizationAfter 3 months 13Dos Don'ts Foods need to be thoroughly chewed to prevent obstruction of the stomach opening, about the size of a dime. Explain to friends and family why you must eat slowly so they do not urge you to eat faster.No high-calorie foods, beverages and snacks. Eat only at meal times. 3 small meals per day are sufficient. If you feel hungry in between meals choose a low-fat protein source like yogurt, cheese or milk.Avoid high-calorie beverages such as soda, shakes, alcoholic beverages, fruit drinks, sweetened iced tea or sweetened waters. Set aside 30 to 45 minutes to eat each meal. Aim to chew your food 30 times with each bite until it is the consistency of applesauce while still in your mouth. Slow down - we have a lifelong habit of eating too fast. No between meals snacking or \"grazing\" or small amounts of food throughout the day. This will sabotage your weight loss and result in the inability to lose an adequate amount of weight. Add one \"new\" food at a time. Experiment at home with a new food to make sure it agrees with you.Never drink liquids when eating solid foods. Liquids should be avoided for a period of 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after eating solid food or meals. Take small bites of food and, for a visual aid, you may want to use a saucer in place of a plate to help with portion control . Avoid high calorie sweets such as candy, cake, cookies, ice cream and snack foods such as chips, pretzels, crackers, etc. Sugary foods may cause Dumping Syndrome. Include a protein food at each meal. Eat this item first to help maximize protein intake.Stop eating as soon as you are full. Overeating even one ounce can make you vomit and can lead to stretching your pouch. 14PHASE 1 - C LEAR LIQUID DIET Sugar-Free, Clear Liquids Duration: Approximately 1-2 days Important Considerations sClear liquids may begin on post-op day once water is well tolerated sYou may be on clear liquids for 2-3 days or until tolerated sDrink 1 to 3 ounces (l/8 to 3/8 of a cup) or as tolerated of sugar-free, clear liquids every hour sClear \"solids\" that become liquid at body temperature are also appropriate such as diet Jello\u00ae and sugar-free popsicles sNo carbonated beverages sDrink decaffeinated clear liquids (for at least 3 months) sNo milk or dairy sNo vitamin or mineral supplementation at this time sSugar substitutes can be used (see list of \"Sugar-Substitutes\") Examples Clear or creamer) sPlain decaffeinated coffee, (no milk or creamer) sSugar-free Jello\u00ae sSugar-free popsicles sClear flavored broth (chicken, beef, seafood, Sugar Free Pink Lemonade Mix\u00ae Important Reminders When On Phase I sStop drinking when you feel full sSip slowly, do not gulp sDo not use a straw sAvoid extreme temperatures (extreme hot or cold) sNo carbonated beverages sNo milk, cream or other dairy products sConsume decaffeinated clear liquids for at least 3 months after surgery sRemember to keep increasing physical activity as tolerated Indications Of Fullness sA feeling of pressure or fullness in the center of your abdomen, just below your rib cage sA feeling of nausea, regurgitation or heartburn sA pain in your shoulder area or upper chest 15FULL LIQUID DIET/PHASE 2 Sugar-Free, Liquid, High-Protein Shakes From After 48 Hours to Approximately 2 Weeks Important Considerations sPhase 2 may begin in the hospital if you tolerate Phase 1, or at home upon discharge sRemain on this diet until your follow-up appointment sIt is recommended that you stay on a full liquid diet up until 2 weeks after the surgery to ensure proper tolerance and healing sThe goal is to consume at least 70 grams of protein per day in the form of a liquid, high protein shake sConsume no solid food at this time sDrink 8 ounces of protein shake 2 times per day sDo not skip any meals sStop drinking when you feel full sConsume sugar-free, non-carbonated, decaffeinated clear liquids in between shakes for a total of 64 ounces (8 cups) per day sOnly liquid or chewable vitamin or mineral supplementation at this time Important Considerations About Protein Shakes sChoose a high -protein shake that contains at least 20 grams of protein per serving sChoose a high-protein shake that contains less than 5 grams of sugar sThe source of the protein should preferably be whey protein; however, shakes may be soy- or egg-based or a combination of whey, soy or egg sYou may use skim or 1% milk or water to mix the protein shake if it is powder-based sYou may use lactose-free milk if lactose intolerant sDo not use milk as a substitute for protein shakes since it does not provide enough protein per serving sDo not use milk in between shakes as a choice of fluid sDue to possible sensory changes in taste and smell, choose a variety of flavor or non-flavored protein shakes; always check for tolerance Important Reminders When on Phase II sSip slowly, do not gulp sDo not use a straw sAvoid extreme temperatures (extreme hot or cold) sNo carbonated beverages, no alcoholic beverages sRemember to keep increasing physical activity as tolerated 16PUREE DIET/BARIATRIC PHASE 3 Soft/Pureed High Protein Foods From 2-4 weeks Important Considerations sYour diet will be advanced on your postoperative office visit sPuree diet may begin 2 weeks after surgery if full liquid diet is well tolerated sIt is recommended that you stay on puree diet for 2-4 weeks to ensure proper tolerance of solid, soft foods sFollow the \"30-Minute Rule\" for fluid intake: wait 30 minutes before and after your food to drink fluids sThe goal is to consume at least 60-80 grams of protein per day in the form of soft or pureed high protein foods sInadequate protein intake can lead to fatigue, loss of lean body mass and increase your risk of infection and other illnesses sConsume 3-4 ounces of food 3 times per day (3-4 ounces for breakfast; 3-4 ounces for lunch; 3-4 ounces for dinner) sAs an estimate, 1 ounce of protein is approximately 7 grams (for example, if you consume 3 ounces of chicken, this would equal approximately 21 grams of protein). Important Considerations About Soft or Pureed Proteins sIt is acceptable to add low sodium broths or low fat dressings to prepared protein sources to add moisture sDo not fry or put breading on the protein sProteins should be moist and lean sPlace food in a blender or food processor to create a soft/pureed consistency sAvoid red meat for 6 months sAvoid spicy foods sAvoid dried out, over-cooked meats; many patients find that they cannot tolerate chicken after surgery; always check your tolerance to any food sIntroduce one \"new\" food at a time sUse moist cooking methods such as boiled, baked, saut\u00e9ed, poached, stewed or braised sAvoid frying protein foods sEven though food is soft and pureed, take small bites of food and chew food well (25 times) Nutritional Considerations sYou may continue to use protein shakes as a meal replacement if you find that you cannot consume enough protein sDo not skip meals; have 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) sConsume sugar-free, non-carbonated, decaffeinated clear liquids in between soft/pureed high protein foods for a total of 64 ounces (8 cups) per day sCheck tolerance level sStop eating when you feel the sense of fullness sDuring puree diet, no breads, no dry cereals, no rice, no noodles, no pastas, no crackers, no potatoes (sweet or white), no yams, no corn, no plantain, no yucca, no fruit juices, no carbonation, no caffeine, no alcoholic beverages 17How to Puree Foods sPureed to a smooth consistency, like pudding sFinal consistency smooth and thick sEnough to scoop with a fork or spoon sSimilar to the consistency of mashed potatoes sProper equipment sFood processor sIf not available, heavy duty blender or stick hand mixer Helpful Hints When Pureeing Foods sCut food into small chunks so it can be pureed evenly sDrain canned foods thoroughly and save liquid for use in adjusting the consistency during pureeing sUse hot cooked meats, vegetables, casseroles, and soups when pureeing. Warm cooked food is softer and easier to puree to the proper consistency sPuree with liquid until a smooth consistency or paste is formed sAdd powdered thickener if necessary sMake sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl or container while pureeing. Doing so will help to incorporate all ingredients that may become stuck to the side sOnce food is pureed, reheat or cool as necessary before serving SOFT SOLID DIET/BARIATRIC PHASE 4 1-3 Months During this phase, you will begin eating more solid foods. It is extremely important to follow the correct eating procedures, which by now should be becoming a habit. Important Considerations sChew, chew, chew all food to a pureed consistency sEat protein portion of meal first sTake one small bite of solid food, put your utensil down and chew until mushy consistency. Then slowly begin again sPay attention to taste, enjoying each bite to the fullest sWhen you feel full, stop eating. Don't exceed your stomach capacity sFollow the \"30-Minute Rule\" for fluid intake: wait 30 minutes before and after your food to drink fluids sEach meal should consist of at least 3 items totaling 6-8 oz or one cup; 2 oz protein, \u00bc cup vegetable, \u00bc cup fruit, and \u00bc cup starch sContinue taking your multivitamin (capsule or chewable) 18PHASE 5 - S TABILIZATION DIET After 3 Months During this stage, you will be able to eat foods of regular consistency. However, this does not mean that you should start to go back to your old eating patterns. sDon't exceed one cup or 8 oz of food at meal times sStop eating whenever you feel full and do not eat longer than 30 minutes for each meal sContinue to eat 3 balanced meals a day, which contain nutrient-rich foods such as meat/poultry/fish/beans, dairy products, vegetables, and fruits sThese foods contain the energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals that your body needs sIt is important to continue to take a vitamin and mineral supplement daily for the rest of your life What Can I Do To Create A Sense Of Fullness With Every Meal? sDrink your fluids separately from your meals. Between meals, liquids should be taken at least 30 minutes to one hour after meals. sPlan your meals. Choose foods that will not easily pass through a funnel. Soups, pudding, and drinking with meals make food soft and mushy and they will pass through the funnel leaving you hungry for more. sStop snacking. Are you really hungry or simply eating out of habit, or to relieve boredom, stress or feeling low? Instead, distract yourself, try one of these: sDrink water sTake a walk or go for a bike ride sPhone a friend sRead a book sWork in the garden sPlay with the kids sEstablish a new hobby Foods That May Be Difficult To Tolerate After Bariatric Surgery Continue to avoid large quantities of sweetened foods, high fat foods and high calorie beverages to avoid weight gain and possible digestive problems. Avoid using these foods during Clear Liquid to Soft solid stages. Once youreach the final stage, you may be able to tolerate some of these items. Add items such as meat, starches, fruits and vegetables gradually as tolerated.

Hold the head in this position, and extend your left arm out to the side and slightly downward so that your hand is at waist level. Release and repeat on the left side. Do 2 times for each side. Modification: For a deeper stretch, gently pull the extended arm behind your back. 26Overhead Reach with Side Bends Seated in a chair with good posture, reach your arms up overhead. Hold for 10 seconds. Allow your right arm to relax down by your side (can rest hand on chair seat) while your left arm stays up overhead. Slowly lean tothe right and reach your left arm over your head to the right. Hold for 8 to 10 seconds. Come back up to the center position, pulling both arms overhead again. Repeat by bending to the opposite side, relaxing the left arm to the side this time. Do another set. Rear Leg Extensions Begin by standing behind a chair with the right leg slightly in front of the left, holding onto the back of the chair for balance. Keeping your back straight and leaning slightly forward, lift the left foot a few inches off the floor or as high as you comfortablycan, squeezing the buttocks as you do this. Do not arch your back.Lower the leg back down and repeat the movement 8 to 10 times. Switch sides to work the other leg. Rest briefly. Do another set of 8 to 10 repetitions for each leg. Modification: For an extra challenge, change the count of the movement. Lift the leg and hold for 5 seconds, or do short, quick pulse lifts for 5 seconds. Side Leg Lifts Begin by holding onto the back of a chair as needed, standing withfeet slightly apart. Take 2 to 3 seconds to lift your right leg 6 to 12inches out to the side, keeping the knee and toes pointed forward. Hold the position for 1 second. Take 2 to 3 seconds to lower your leg back to the starting position. Perform 8 to 15 lifts. Switch to the opposite leg. Do another set of 8 to 15 repetitions for each leg. Modification: For a less advanced version, tap the toe out to the side and pull back in, rather than lifting and lowering the leg. For a more advanced version, change the count of the movement by lifting the leg and holding for 5 seconds or lifting and pulsingthe leg and releasing back down.27Good sleeping habits are important for long-term weight maintenance. Lack of sleep causes stress to your body. This stress causes your body to release a hormone (cortisol) that stores abdominal fat. In addition, the hormoneghrelin increases when you lose sleep. Ghrelin increases appetite. You want your body to work for you, notagainst you. You may have to break some old habits in order to get the best result from your surgery. sGo to sleep around the same time each night, even on weekends. Aim to be in bed by 11 PM. Staying up beyond midnight may cause \"second wind syndrome,\" making it hard for you to fall asleep. sGet up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Get up at your usual time, even if you did not get your usual amount of sleep. sA warm bath 1-2 hours before bedtime may help make you sleepy. If desired, lavender oil or another essential oil can be added to the bath water. Showers can be too stimulating. sKeep the bedroom cool at night. sSleep on a good mattress. Make sure the pillow is comfortable for your head, neck, and shoulders. sKeep the bedroom dark, with the exception of a night light, if necessary. sKeep the bedroom quiet. Use earplugs if necessary to block out noise. sUse your bed only for sleep and intimate relations. sKeep televisions, computers, and work materials out of the bedroom. sIf you lie in bed awake for more than 20-30 minutes, get up and go to a different room. Engage in a quiet activity (e.g. watching television, reading), and then return to bed when feeling sleepy. sAvoid getting involved in stimulating activities just before bed. Examples include watching an exciting or disturbing television show or movie, playing a competitive game, and having an important conversation with a loved one. sDo not exercise right before bedtime. sAvoid daytime naps. sAvoid caffeine in the late afternoon and early evening. sDo not go to bed very hungry or too full. sIf you have sleep apnea, continue to use your CPAP machine after surgery. You will be referred back to the pulmonary service 9 to 12 months after surgery. The need for ongoing CPAP will be re-evaluated at that time. A restful night's sleep improves quality of life!TIPSFORBETTER SLEEPING 28TIPSFORSUCCESS AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERY Dos sAlways eat your protein first. sEven after you have progressed through the dietary phases, consume your protein before any other food item. sWhen you feel full stop eating. sAlways follow the \"30-Minute Rule\" for fluid intake. sConsume at least 60-80 grams of protein per day. sTake your vitamin and mineral supplements every day unless otherwise instructed by the doctor or dietitian. sConsume at least 64 ounces (8 cups) of non-carbonated, sugar-free, caffeine-free fluid per day. sKeep your scheduled follow-up appointments. sAvoid sugar. sAvoid fried food and high-fat foods. sHave 3 meals per day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. sSip fluids slowly throughout the day. sTake small bites of food and chew properly (25 times) swallowing. Food should be \"mushy\" before you swallow. sAlways check your tolerance level for foods. If a food doesn't agree with you, stop eating it and try again at another time. If that particular food continues to be intolerable, discontinue eating it altogether. sAlways check with your Primary Care Physician about taking medications and/or over-the-counter medictions. sBe physically active every day. sParticipate in support group meetings. sRemember, bariatric surgery is not the cure for obesity. It is a tool that can assist you with weight-loss management. Don'ts sDo not eat again until the next meal of the day. sDo not overeat. sDo not drink with your meals. You must stop drinking 30 minutes before you eat and wait 20 minutes after you have eaten to resume fluid intake. sDo not wait until you feel thirsty before you drink. sDon't forget to get your blood work done so an assessment of your vitamins and minerals levels can be done. sHave no more than 5 grams of sugar per serving. sDo not skip meals. sDo not gulp. sDo not use a straw. sDo not chew or swallow gum. \"Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them.
