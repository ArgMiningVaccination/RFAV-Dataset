In order to serve you better, please select your Dominion Energy location services. Learn to recognize the distinctive early warning sign of a gas leak. Natural gas is a safe and non-toxic energy source for heating your home, powering your gas range, water heater, fireplace, and more. But it's also both colorless and naturally odorless - so how can you detect when you have a potentially dangerous leak inside your home? We add a harmless ingredient called mercaptan to our natural gas to help you detect leaks. Mercaptan provides the distinctive \"rotten egg\" smell commonly associated with natural gas. If you smell this odor in or near your house, please Contact Us immediately. Not sure what it smells like? We'll be happy to send you a scratch-and-sniff postcard in the mail to help you recognize this awful, but important, smell: Copyright \u00a9 2023 Dominion Energy "}
