This knowledge is passed on throughout generations, many of the tribes learn that by mixing natural plants such as herbs and roots they can make remedies with healing properties. It is believed that being healthy is when people reach a state of harmony not only spiritually, mentally but physically. To be able to overcome the forces that cause illness people must \"operate in the context of relationship to four constructs \u2014namely, spirituality (Creator, Mother Earth, Great Father); community (family, clan, tribe/nation); environment (daily life, nature, balance); and self (inner passions and peace, thoughts, and values)\" (Portman & Garret, 2006, p.453). In this research paper I am going to show evidence of the tremendous influence that Native American medicine and spiritual healing have over modern medicine in the course of healing In order to successfully treat the tribes, historical knowledge should be combined with evidence-based practices, science-based medicine and measurement-based care. The 2016 National Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda states that, \"scientifically rigorous assessment of efficacy and effectiveness must always be respectful and culturally competent - reflecting each tribal communities' and their individual members' concepts of illness and treatment objectives - in order to extend to tribal communities the same entitlement to high-quality, evidence-based practices for which other parts of the United States health system are increasingly held to account.\" The American Psychological Association calls for the integration of cultural beliefs, values and preferences in the treatment process, and is considered a good example for integrated behavioral health Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma: Health Care The Cherokee nation of Oklahoma is one of the many native Indian tribes that place a great emphasis on health care. There are noticeable efforts in improving the health system in the Cherokee nation as well as the health of its individuals. For a long time, the Cherokee nation has engaged in successful health care experiences such as building health centers, launching health programs or even individually engaging in the health field to improve the overall healthcare in the nation. Medicine, to the modern day world, is a way of healing the sick and helping people experience life to their full potential. It is an ingredient of a culture that allows the culture to survive through decades and centuries at a time. But what if the medicine that we know as helpful is actually harmful? When a child cuts their knee the first thing an adult would do is check the scrape and then assess the damage. After assessing the damage, the adult would normally plan a course of treatment to ensure the child would not lose a limb in the near future. After treating the child with a mixture of antibacterial wipes, bandages and ice cream, what if the child is not better, but actually worse? That is what happens when you compare the medical practices of the Hmong to the medical practices of the Americans, both cultures believe that the others will cause more damage than good in respect to healing the soul and body. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma: Health Care The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma (CN) is one of the many Native American tribes that place a great emphasis on health care. There are noticeable efforts and investments in improving the health care system in the Cherokee Nation. Through the building of health care centers, Health promotion can be looked out differently within each ethnic group and can most definitely influence how one manages his/her own health. Within the AI/AN population, a lot of home remedies passed down from generation to generation exist, so seeking out traditional medicine isn't really a main source of healing. The American Indian/Alaska Native resident may have a holistic view in which people community, nature and spirituality are interconnected and interrelated. This perspective views physical, spiritual, mental and emotional health in unity, instead of indiscrete categories. Sickness may be viewed as a result of disharmony between the One of the largest issues facing American Indian's today One of the largest issues facing American Indian's today One of the largest issues facing the American Indian's today is that health care. As tribes and urban Indian health centers struggle along with the rest of the country to address the growing numbers of Elders in their communities. There are key issues and special considerations that must be addressed to ensure American Indian Elders are not forgotten in any proposed reform or redesign proposals that the newly formed Medicaid Commission or Congress put forth. By 2030, it is estimated there will be 430,000 American Indian and Alaska Native Elders, constituting 12.2% of the American Indian population (Day, 1993). While the The cultural values, beliefs, and practices of the AI/AN, influence health care practices within their community. For example, healing is sacred work, the spiritual aspect of the individual needs to be considered to be effective. Contemporary Indians might use \"white man's medicine\" to treat \"white man's disease\" cancer, and gallbladder disease and \"native medicine\" was used to treat \"native problems\" such as pain, family relationship issues, mental illness and alcoholism aka \"sickness of the spirit\" (Alvord, 1997; Hendrix, 1999). Many Western medicines were based on Indian herbal medications. For instance, aspirin is derived from willow bark (Alvord, 1997; Hendrix, Native American Medicine \"Native American medicine is based on widely held beliefs about healthy living, the repercussions of disease-producing behavior, and the spiritual principles that restore balance.\" -Ken \"Bear Hawk\" Cohen (Chrisman 1). The two important focal points that I saw when reading module one and chapter one was that Native Americans have developed an everlasting culture and are long-standing decedents. The Calusa had created techniques based on a very minimalistic knowledge base. Creating items such as the knots that were used in fishing nets and different types of medicine for illnesses. (Becnel, 3) In addition, they knots and plants used in their medicines are still used in modern day medicine which just shows how much we have actually learned from these people. Many medical industries have tried developing, new and improved, medicines when they sometimes fail to realize what we have already in nature. That we don't need all the inserted chemicals which can have For the Native American shaman the world of animals, the world of plants, the world of minerals, and the world of humans are all intertwined (Wolfe 3). Shamans in the Native American culture are viewed as a revered member of society, are often male, and are the sole healers of their people. While anyone can become a shaman in the Native American culture, the attainment of the status is an arduous process, and is considered a feat of great courage. The introduction of self to the spiritual world in such an intimate way has been considered dangerous because of the risk of insanity, as well as the risk of possession by angry spirits (Wolfe 237). From ancient times to modern times, shamans have been considered to be the link between the physical world and the spiritual world. (Wolfe 3). The Native American shamans utilize many sacred objects in their workings, which are considered sacred solely because they come from nature. These include talismans, spirit animals, totem helpers, ritual items, and spirit helpers (Wolfe, 9). Tobacco and other herbs, cornmeal, small shells, stones, and totems are important elements to their healing practices (Wolfe 20). Regardless of the methods that the shamans may use in healing, many Native American shamans believe that no one person heals A majority of Native American tribes have their own traditions about health and illness. These traditions are not based on todays modern sciences. Instead, they derive from the tribe's beliefs on harmony. \"Healing occurs when someone is restored to harmony and connected to universal powers.\" (NLM) To what extent are native cultures entitled to ownership of native medical practices and curatives? Should they be financially reimbursed or are they ethically entitled to refuse to share native knowledge? Today, it is often thought that the western way is the best way. We are constantly pushing our religion, technology, medicine, and entire culture onto others, especially indigenous peoples. Our way of living in seen as \"positive, universal goods, to be obtained at any price,\" (Bodley, p. 107). And this price includes sacrificing indigenous peoples own culture. Bodley later explains that western culture is negatively impacting the indigenous peoples and he specially focuses on the biomedical aspect. Upon being \"blessed\" with western culture, indigenous people are suffering many medical consequences exclusive to our advanced society. Mark Plotkin, also, expands on this topic in his book Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice and argues that biomedicine doesn't compare to ethnobotanical knowledge of indigenous people. Indigenous tribes are decreasing in number because tourists and non-natives are infecting tribe members with diseases and infections new to the tribe. Trying to help these tribes is dangerous because when people from the outside world come into contact with any tribe members, they could infect not only "}
