Her mother, Liz \u2014 at the far right in the photo, taken at a MEDEX graduation ceremony \u2014 wrote back. I'd like to thank all those students and staff who participated in honoring Liza Benson at the graduation of MEDEX Northwest's Seattle Class 45. I was so touched to see the t-shirt, with her name on the sleeve, which was sold to raise funds for a scholarship in her name. Liza was passionate about the program and had made such good friends whom she often mentioned to me. No words can explain why she had to depart at the pinnacle of her life. Thank you, Class 45, for caring so about her. I wish you Godspeed and success in your professional and private lives. You are forever in my heart. \u2014Liz Benson A CORRECTION Gary Beerman, ARNP , PA-C (Seattle Class 15) contacted us after reading last issue's article on Patrick Parenzin, PA-C (Seattle Class 39). In that article, we wrote that Mr. Parenzin was the first PA to serve as a clinical faculty member at the UW School of Nursing. Correction: Mr. Beerman, who graduated in 1982, holds that distinction.

Our ability to transform and grow as an institution is possible thanks to a prevalent ethic of continuous improvement. It is a great pleasure to work with the 25,000 members of the UW Medicine community who demonstrate a strong commitment to improving the health of the public through the excellence of their daily work. If you would like to learn more about that work, you can view my address \u2014 and additional videos shown during the talk \u2014 at uwmedicine.org/about/Pages/annual-address-2014.aspx. One of the research topics I discussed in my address \u2014 precision medicine \u2014 is also one of the features in this issue of UW Medicine . It is a powerful research area based on optimizing individual healthcare treatment through disease-specific molecular drivers. Precision medicine, including genome-based guidance for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, has enormous potential to change the practice of medicine over the coming years. I am very excited about UW Medicine's leadership in this area, focused within the UW Medicine Center for Precision Diagnostics. I urge you to read the articles about precision medicine in this issue and learn about one of the most exciting areas in medicine. In considering UW Medicine's influence, I had the pleasure in my address of talking about the dramatic reach of UW Medicine through our alumni. The alumni relations office developed a map of the United States that portrays the number of graduates of the School of Medicine in each of the 50 states (see page 24). More than 12,000 graduates from our M.D., residency and fellowship training, MEDEX Northwest, Ph.D., M.S. and B.S. programs are located in Washington. Another 1,700+ graduates are located in the other four WWAMI states of Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The impact of the more than 23,000 graduates throughout the United States is profound. Thank you to all of our alumni, located throughout the region, nation and world, for your commitment! Sincerely, Paul G. Ramsey, M.D. CEO, UW MEDICINE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR MEDICAL AFFAIRS AND DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Photo: Clare McLean4 UW MEDICINEMessages > LOOKING TO THE FUTURE Staying Connected to the UW Medicine Community My tenure as president of the alumni association has been a time of learning, listening and looking to the future. We convened an Alumni Relations Task Force, conducted a survey and held a series of focus groups to determine how to strengthen connections among alumni and provide more opportunities for alumni and students to meet. With the insights gained through these efforts, the Alumni Leadership Council voted in November to approve a new mission statement that better reflects the association's work. In addition, the council developed a vision statement and a set of values that will guide future programming and planning. I think they are a great reflection of our community today, and I hope you agree. The UW Medicine community enriches our lives long after our education is complete, and our connection with the School lasts a lifetime. As a case in point, I had the pleasure of attending an admissions information session in February where Carol Teitz, M.D, Res. '80 (orthopaedics), associate dean for admissions, provided an overview of the School's admissions process for alumni and their \"aspiring medical student.\" I enjoyed spending an evening with fellow alumni, and it was a privilege to be part of these prospective students' academic journey. Read more about Dr. Teitz's presentation on page 25. I'd like to remind you of another opportunity to connect: Reunion Weekend on June 6 and 7. There are programs for you even if your class is not celebrating a reunion. The two-day event includes brunch for the 50-Year Association, an open meeting of the UW School of Medicine Alumni Association Board and a \"Learn & Lunch\" featuring a discussion on healthy living. Most of all, I hope you'll join us the evening of June 7 for the All-School reception at Husky Stadium, where we'll also recognize and celebrate the 2014 recipients of the distinguished alumni awards. The weekend is the perfect opportunity to catch up with classmates, renew old friendships and make new connections. I hope to see you in June! Angela J.

This second code contains information that changes how scientists read the instructions contained in DNA and interpret mutations to make sense of health and disease. The genetic code uses a 64-letter alphabet called a codon, and the team discovered that some codons can have two meanings: one related to protein sequence and one re - lated to gene control. In these \"duons,\" the protein-coding language is written on top of the language for gene control, hiding it. The discovery, published in the Dec. 13, 2013 issue of Science , will open new doors in interpreting a patient's genome \u2014 and in disease diagnosis and treatment.

Michael W. Schwartz, M.D., Res. '86 (internal medicine), UW professor of medicine and director of the Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence, is the lead author of the study, published in the Nov. 7, 2013 issue of Nature. The findings may lead to new treatments and approaches to prevent diabetes through a two-system model focused on the pancreas and the brain in blood sugar regulation.Neanderthal DNA and the modern genome In 2010, scientists concluded that Neanderthals interbred with the an - cestors of Homo sapiens. In a study published on Jan. 29, 2014 in Science , Joshua Akey, Ph.D., UW associate professor of genome sciences, and UW graduate student Benjamin Vernot dis - cuss their findings, based on a genome sequenced from a Neanderthal bone in 2012. In sequencing the genomes of 665 Europeans and East Asians, the researchers found that 20 percent of the Neanderthal genome survives in people from those groups. In other findings: Neanderthal DNA sequences are found in regions of the modern-day genome linked to regulation of skin pigmenta - tion; they are conspicuously absent in a segment thought responsible for speech and language.

Abnormal sleep duration increases genetic risk for depression A UW study of 1,788 adult twins is the first to suggest that both too little and too much sleep increase a genetic risk for depression. Among twins with normal sleep duration of seven to 8.9 hours per night, the total heritability of depressive symptoms was 27 per - cent. The genetic influence on depres - sive symptoms increased to 53 percent among twins with a sleep duration of five hours per night and 49 percent among those who reported sleeping 10 hours per night. Principal investigator Nathaniel Watson, M.D., Res. '97, '00 (internal medicine), associate professor in the Department of Neurology and co-director of the UW Medicine Sleep Center, suggests that optimizing sleep might help maximize the effectiveness of psychotherapy and other treatments for depression. Patient Care New UW Medicine Memory & Brain Wellness Center The doors opened October 15, 2013, at a new UW Medicine center focused on diagnosing and treating people suffering from memory loss and dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Patients and their families may access the new UW Medicine Memory & Brain Wellness Center, located at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, through physician referrals. Now bigger and better, and still serving the Eastside In response to the need for increased medical access on the Eastside, the Eastside Specialty Center moved to a larger site with more capacity and high-tech medical services.

Around UW Medicine: News >SPRING 2014 7< Around UW Medicine: News Education New initiative prepares faculty and students for effective teamwork The University of Washington contains six health sciences schools, including medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, public health and social work, and to - gether, these schools are at the forefront of a national movement in healthcare teaching and delivery. With the launch of the Interprofessional Education Initiative: Vision for a Collaborative Future, the UW Board of Health Sciences Deans has laid the foundation for progressive integra - tion of collaborative learning across these six disciplines. Students from the schools are participating in a new \"Foundations of Interprofessional Practice\" curriculum. Nearly 600 students attended the pro - gram's kickoff last fall, and many faculty attended a workshop that explored teaching interprofessional core compe - tencies and helping students navigate challenging interactions as a team. WWAMI International conference held in Big Sky, Mont. More than 230 people from nine countries traveled to Big Sky, Mont., this fall to partici - pate in the 2013 Consortium of Longitudinal Integrated Clerkships (CLIC) Conference. Clerkships, where third- and fourth-year medical students experience hands-on care in multiple clinical settings, expose students to dif - ferent medical disciplines. Longitudinal integrated clerkships are a different learning model: they place a student in one setting over a longer period of time, where the student can contribute to the comprehensive care of patients, develop relationships with mentoring physicians and meet most of their core competen - cies in one place. Conference attendees had the opportunity to learn about technology and community engagement, among other topics, and students \u2014 courtesy of the Montana Family Medicine Residency \u2014 were invited to a wilderness medicine seminar. The conference was hosted by the UW School of Medicine, the Montana WWAMI program and the Montana Area Health Education Center. Notable Three UW Medicine faculty members elected to Institute of Medicine Three faculty members were recently made members of the Institute of Medi - cine, one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine. Janis L. Abkowitz, M.D., Res. '82, Fel. '83 (hematology), the Clement A. Finch Professor of Medicine and head of the Division of Hematology in the UW Department of Medicine, has improved knowledge of how blood production resumes after a bone marrow transplant. She also leads the Hematology Clinic at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Frederick R. Appelbaum, M.D., UW professor of medicine in the Division of Oncology, is an expert in blood cancers. He is deputy director of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and president of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Bruce M. Psaty, M.D., Ph.D., UW professor of medi - cine, epidemiology and health services, co-directs the Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, a joint program of the UW and Group Health Research Institute. He has had major roles as an epidemiolo - gist in multi-center studies funded by the National Institutes of Health. Carlos Pellegrini: the new president of the American College of Surgeons Carlos A. Pellegrini, M.D., chair of the Department of Surgery and Henry N. Harkins Endowed Chair in Surgery, was installed as the 94th president of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) on Oct. 6, 2013. Pellegrini is a pioneer in minimally invasive surgery on the digestive tract. Under his leadership, UW Medicine opened the Center for Videoendoscopic Surgery, the Center for Esophageal and Gastric Surgery and the Institute for Simulation and Interprofes - sional Studies. Pellegrini also has been elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He will be formally admitted on July 8, 2014, in London. Residency program directors receive Courage to Teach Award Angelisa M. Paladin, M.D., Fel. '99 (pediatric radiology), UW assistant professor in radiology, and Sidney M. Gospe, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., UW professor in neurology and pediatrics, are recipients of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's 2014 Parker J. Palmer \"Courage to Teach\" Award. The prestigious national award, given to only 10 people each year, honors program directors who find innovative ways to teach residents while providing quality healthcare. Paladin has been program director for the diagnostic radiology residency program for six years. Gospe, who holds the Herman and Faye Sarkowsky Endowed Chair in Child Neurology, recently retired after more than 11 years as program director for the child neurology residency.

Over millennia, people have sought methods to counter infirmities and boost longevity, mostly with uncertain effect. Recent studies, however, show that aging is not caused only by wear and tear. Rather, it is also a fundamental biological process, influenced by specific functional pathways conserved across at least 600 million years of evolution. These dis - coveries could upend prevailing concepts of aging and longevity \u2014 and the diseases associated with aging, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers like UW Medicine's Matt Kaeber - lein, Ph.D., are at the forefront of this new science, the biology of aging. Their objective? To promote not just a long life, but lifelong well-being. \"Medical science is still so focused on finding treatments to cure diseases of aging after they manifest, that it overlooks the opportunity to intervene in the aging process before people are sick in order to delay disease onset,\" Kaeberlein says. \"The biology of aging has great potential to have a huge positive impact on human health.\"< Exploring Why We Age 10 UW MEDICINEHealthspan vs. lifespan Even without medical intervention, average life expectancy in developed countries has been increasing con - sistently over the past century, due largely to improvements in nutri - tion, sanitation and medical science. Kaeberlein, a UW associate professor in the Department of Pathology points out, however, that there is no evidence that the aging process itself has been slowed. \"The dramatic increase in Alzheim - er's disease and other chronic diseases of aging can be directly attributed to the fact that we have done a good job at making people live longer, on average, without affecting the rate of biological aging,\" he says. \"Maximum human lifespan is probably the same now as it was 2,000 years ago.\" Still, if more people live into their eighties and nineties \u2014 a demographic change already in motion in some societies \u2014 it will have an enormous impact on society. The question is: will people remain healthy at 85 or 95? Or will they still contract diseases asso - ciated with aging, like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease? And how will this affect healthcare costs? These are the issues that concern Kaeberlein, who prefers to emphasize the concept of healthspan, rather than lifespan. \"Healthspan is the length of life spent free from severe age-related dis - ease,\" says Kaeberlein. \"Our goal is to understand the basic biology of aging and what causes an organism to switch from youthful and healthy to aged and infirm. We want to extend a person's healthspan.\" He suspects that slow - ing the aging process and extending healthspan might add another 10 or 15 years to human life expectancy. This paradigm-shifting approach \u2014 addressing the issues of aging and age- related disease in tandem \u2014 impresses Kaeberlein's colleagues. \"Without hyperbole, Matt is one of the world's leaders in unraveling the basic biology of aging,\" says Thomas J. Montine, M.D., Ph.D., UW professor and chair of the Department of Pathol - ogy and the Nancy and Buster Alvord Endowed Chair in Neuropathology. Montine recruited Kaeberlein to join the Alzheimer's Disease Research Cen - ter. \"When the book on Alzheimer's Exploring Why We Age > \"The biology of aging has great potential to have a huge impact on human health.\" \u2014 Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D.disease is finished, there has to be a chapter on why aging is essential to developing the disease.\" Kaeberlein is also inspiring an upcoming generation of medical scientists, like doctoral candidate Melana Yanos. \"So many research scientists remain focused on a narrow area of inquiry,\" Yanos says. \"Matt thoroughly understands every single experiment in the lab, but he is always considering the bigger picture and a study's value and potential impact.\" She especially appreciates the collaborative atmosphere in the lab. \"Matt has an amazing ability to be available to every person on the lab team,\" says Yanos. \"He is a tremendous advocate...I don't know how he does it, but his door is always open.\" Starting with C. elegans Yanos is one of about 50 scientists and students in Kaeberlein's laboratory. They're working on more than 20 distinct projects to identify the genetic and environmental factors that modulate normal aging and longevity. It's difficult to study these processes in humans. Our lives are long, involving a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Just as important, scientists lack reliable biomarkers. Studies can only Photo: Clare McLean SPRING 2014 11 < Exploring Why We Age \"If you want to extend lifespan, you almost always have to do something to affect the aging mechanism itself.\" \u2014 Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D. examine the relationships of specific factors on mortality, which may not be relevant to the basic mechanisms of normal aging. For these reasons, short-lived yeast strains, worms and mice are the models of choice for conducting controlled experiments in most research labs, including Kaeberlein's. \"When I was a postdoctoral fellow in genome sciences at the University of Washington, I started thinking about evolutionary conservation and whether any of the genes or mecha - nisms for aging I was studying in yeast were conserved across time and species,\" Kaeberlein recalls. \"I decided to test the idea in C. elegans, a nema - tode worm with about 1,000 cells. It's about midway in the evolutionary chain between yeast and humans.\" Worms have another advantage: unlike yeast, they show clear signs of aging. \"We tested many different gene mutations and gene knockdowns in both yeast and worms and asked what was similar. We were looking for lifespan extension rather than lifes - pan shortening,\" says Kaeberlein. \"It's easy to break something to shorten an organism's lifespan, but that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with normal aging. If you want to extend lifespan, you almost always have to do something to affect the aging mechanism itself.\" Exploring the aging mechanism with rapamycin One such mechanism is controlled by a substance, called mTOR, that regulates cell growth, metabolism and components of insulin signaling. It also controls the breakdown of damage that accumulates inside cells as they age. The mTOR pathway is a primary determinant of longevity in yeast, fruit flies and C. elegans, and it can be mod - ulated by an FDA-approved immune- suppressant drug called rapamycin. After initial studies showed that mTOR is important for aging in simple organisms, the next step was testing in mice. \"There is now strong evidence that rapamycin inhibits mTOR in mice, that it affects multiple age-associated disease processes and significantly prolongs lifespan,\" Kaeberlein says. Tumor-ridden mice given rapamycin, for instance, maintained cardiovascular health and lived longer than mice not treated with the drug. \"This pathway functions similarly in humans,\" says Kaeberlein, \"and we have good reason to believe that rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors could have similar effects on human aging.\" Getting ready for the \"silver tsunami\" The biology of aging is a small but rapidly growing area of biomedi - cal investigation, gaining recognition in scientific and technology circles. Google has invested in aging-related biotechnology. China recently joined several European programs in develop - ing top-level aging research programs. UW Medicine is in a prime posi - tion to grow to even greater promi - nence in this new field; it is one of just Photo: Clare McLean Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D., sits in front of a monitor showing the tracks C. elegans leave in their food. His lab uses the tiny worms as an experimental model. 12 UW MEDICINE Exploring Why We Age > five sites with a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging; Kaeberlein is the center's co-director, and Peter S. Rabinovitch, M.D. '79, Ph.D., Res. '81, is the director. In addition, the NIH is funding doctoral- and postdoctoral- level aging research at the UW, and Kaeberlein is spearheading an effort to create a longevity institute at the University of Washington. The benefits \u2014 for the planet's rapidly aging \"silver tsunami\" and for the rest of us \u2014 could be profound. And it could come relatively soon. \"We have a lot of work ahead to bridge the research gap between mice and humans, but, for the first time in my career, I see a clear path toward reaching this goal,\" says Kaeberlein. \"With continued support, it's possible that interventions could be available within a decade.\" \"Matt...is always considering the bigger picture and a study's value and potential impact.\" \u2014 Melana Yanos Curing a Childhood Syndrome? While investigating rapamycin's role in aging, Kaeberlein's team also discovered something else. The drug can extend lifespan and alleviate neurological symptoms in a mouse model of mitochondrial disease. Mitochondria are the cells' power generators, and mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to severe pathology in humans, including Leigh syndrome, a usually fatal mitochondrial disease contracted by young children. In work published last December in Science , Kaeberlein's team found that mice treated with rapamycin for mitochondrial disease lived two or three times longer than untreated ones. \"About half the mice showed no behavioral or molecular signs of the disease when they finally died,\" Kaeberlein says. Kaeberlein is excited \u2014 for the potential that this work may have in benefiting children affected by Leigh syndrome and for further aging- related studies. \"Severe mitochondrial diseases are not obviously related to aging, so this finding is taking us in directions we did not expect to go,\" he says.

In all, the lab includes approximately 50 scientists and students working on more than 20 projects on aging and longevity. SPRING 2014 13 < Feature By Delia Ward Peter Byers, M.D., has a message for his fellow physicians: precision medicine is coming. \"It's going to challenge you, it's going to excite you, it's going to bring you into a new world of medicine, and it's going to give you a different under - standing of the families that you work with,\" he says. Byers, a UW professor in the Department of Pathology and the Division of Medical Genetics, is the director of UW Medicine's new Center for Precision Diagnostics. Traditional medical research and care is predicated on testing many people and coming up with a one-size- fits-all treatment. But one size rarely fits all. Precision medicine takes a dif - ferent tack: the more we know about an individual, and the better we un - derstand how a disease or a condition manifests in that individual, the better we can tailor their medical care. What makes the coming wave of precision medicine possible? It's a term used by cancer innovator and UW Medicine faculty Tony Blau: the \"omics.\" Genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics. All tools that allow researchers to under - stand how a patient's body works at a molecular level. Targeted Care Arguably, genomics is in the vanguard; advances in gene sequencing technology made over the past 10 years make a great deal of precision medi - cine work possible. But Bob Waterston, M.D., Ph.D., the William H. Gates III Endowed Chair in Biomedical Sciences and one of the founders of The Human Genome Project, notes that genomics will partner closely with the other omics. \"Transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are all measuring, in one way or another, the output of the ge - nome as it reacts to its environment,\" says Waterston. \"These measures can provide useful readouts of the current status not only of genetic diseases [such as cancer], but other diseases as well, like diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases.\" Byers has high hopes for the Center for Precision Diagnostics, created to usher in this new type of care at UW Medicine. In addition to educat - ing faculty, students, trainees and staff about precision medicine \u2014 and in addition to using exome technology to examine patients' tissue samples \u2014 he intends the center to serve as a trans - formative resource for physicians in Seattle and throughout the region. \"With precision medicine, patients and families and doctors will form a cooperative relationship,\" Byers says. \"The nature of healthcare will change.\" Read about UW Medicine's use of precision medicine technology \u2014 related to breast cancer, eye disease and Alzheimer's disease \u2014 on the next few pages. The \"Omic\" Tool Set Genomics.

'94, director of the UW Medicine Center for Cancer Innovation. Blau knew how tough cancer was to beat, having done an oncology fellowship involving leukemia patients in 1989. \"You threw as much radiation and chemotherapy as you could get away with at a cancer patient, gave them as much as they could possibly take, and then rescued them with someone else's bone marrow,\" Blau says. It was the best care available, and it didn't always work. Although Blau did not pursue cancer research immediately after his training, he grew interested in the topic again about five years ago, when gene-related medical technologies started to improve exponentially. At the same time, he started to attend conferences with his wife, oncologist Sibel Blau, M.D. The huge distance between the technologies available to researchers and the tools available to oncologists left a strong impression on him. \"It struck me that the approach we're taking to cancer needed to be fundamentally restructured,\" says Blau. Restructuring cancer care Blau's plan can be seen at work in the Center for Cancer Innovation's triple-negative breast cancer trial. It sounds simple enough: putting the patient at the core of the experiment. \"The idea is to leave no gap between what a research lab can offer and what's made available to our patients,\" says Blau. The other primary idea: to work with just a few patients \u2014 at least at first \u2014 to gain as much data as possible about the evolution of their tumors. Helping Blau in this initial trial is a group of women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, including Cathleen Olivas, a 57-year-old woman from Auburn, Wash. First diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, Olivas had one breast removed, then the other. Then the cancer came back in March 2013. When Sibel Blau asked Olivas to participate in the trial, her response was immediate, unwavering and posi - tive. \"I didn't even have to think about it,\" says Olivas. After Olivas and other patients have their tumors biopsied, the tissue is turned over to UW Medicine faculty \"The approach we're taking to cancer needed to be fundamentally restructured.\" \u2014 Tony Blau, M.D., Fel. '94THE HEROES of Precision Medicine 14 UW MEDICINEPhoto: Clare McLean Triple-negative breast cancer patient Cathleen Olivas is a hero to cancer researcher Tony Blau, M.D., Fel. '94. Shown here on a visit to Blau's lab, Olivas says that she doesn't feel like a hero. \"I feel very blessed to have found both of them,\" she says, referring to Tony and his wife, oncologist Sibel Blau, M.D. \"I would say that they are the heroes.\"SPRING 2014 15 < Precision Medicine Investing in Precision Medicine A Family Decision Steven Hooper, one of the founders of Ignition Part - ners, makes investments for a living. \"At the end of the day,\" he says, \"you're investing in people.\" And the people he and his wife, Cathy Beth, have chosen to invest in work at the IPCR: the Institute for Prostate Cancer Research, a collaboration of UW Medicine and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The issue is quite close to home: Hooper's father had pros - tate cancer. His uncle had it, two of his brothers have it, and Hooper had it, too. Hooper had a radical prostatectomy, and while he's doing very well, he feels certain that his son or his grandsons will someday be diagnosed with the disease. Hence the Hoopers' commitment to the Act Smart initiative at the IPCR \u2014 an initiative based on precision medicine. Act Smart is the IPCR's multi-million-dollar effort to analyze, understand and target prostate cancer tumors in ways specific to each patient. Hooper is optimistic. \"In the last 14 years, we've learned a lot more about prostate cancer,\" he says. With Act Smart, Hooper knows more advances are coming. \"When Cathy Beth and I made our gift, we hoped other men and their families would have more choices \u2014 that their quality of life would be even better,\" says Hooper. \"We hope our son won't have to go through what I had to go through.\"for whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and the UW-OncoPlex panel, among other tests. Then, when possible, tumor cells are sent to the Quellos High-throughput Screening Core, where Tim Martins, Ph.D. (see page 16) investigates how the patient's tumor responds to roughly 180 compounds. If there's a \"hit\" \u2014 if a compound damages the tumor \u2014 Blau will try to incorporate the compound in the patient's treatment, a process that, for investigational drugs, may involve the FDA and the drug com - pany that produced the substance. This is precision medicine at its most precise and responsive. And if the tumor grows resistant to the drug, the process is repeated: biopsy, sequencing, high-throughput screen - ing, alteration of treatment. All for one, and one for all In describing his project, Blau often uses the phrase \"all for one, and one for all.\" He's referring to bringing the best he and his colleagues can offer to a single patient. He's also referring to the sacrifices that the cancer patients \u2014 between 10 and 20 women for this initial trial \u2014 are making. Time, energy, tissue: patients give all of these to pursue knowledge and therapies not guaranteed to benefit them. \"For me, I honestly don't know if it will accomplish anything,\" says Olivas. \"I'm fine with that. What they're learn - ing is amazing.\" SPRING 2014 15And Blau and his colleagues are certainly going to be learning. They're collecting enormous amounts of data. If this project works as Blau thinks it will, amassing information that helps deepen understanding of tumor evolution and potential therapies, he hopes to conduct a larger clinical trial for patients with any type of advanced cancer.Today, however, he's focusing on recruiting the patients he calls his heroes \u2014 women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. \"Having their individual illnesses inform the world about how cancer works is a huge contribution to humanity,\" Blau says.Photo courtesy of the Hoopers16 UW MEDICINE > Tim Martins, Ph.D. '84, and James Annis work amidst the whirring and clacking of high-tech machines \u2014 machines that are changing medical experimentation at UW Medicine. When Martins was in graduate school in the 1980s, the landscape was quite different. Researchers would con - duct experiments in test tubes; then they moved on 8 x 12 plates \u2014 96 wells in which to manually distribute materials like cells, reagents and com - pounds, and see how they would react with one another. Today, with plates containing 1,536 compartments and automated dispensers capable of filling each compartment with as little as 50 nanolitres, the game has changed. \"We're able to do many experi - ments very, very quickly and repro - ducibly,\" says Martins, director and principal scientist of the research core facility. Testing compounds to fight illnesses Martins and Annis divide the work at the Quellos High-throughput Screening Core. Martins handles the screening: using the 120,000 com - pounds in the core's library to help scientists determine which ones might work to defeat a disease. Some of these substances are FDA-approved drugs; others may be in the testing stage; still others may be future candidates for testing. After diseased cell samples are exposed to the compounds, Martins can determine the compounds' useful - ness in damaging or killing the cells. UW Medicine cancer researcher Pam Becker, M.D., Ph.D., has used the core to test compounds on cells donated by several of her patients, who have acute myeloid leukemia. For her project, Martins used these compounds at various concentrations to determine appropriate potency levels. \"In just about every case, [high-throughput screening] has suggested an alternative treatment that would not have been next in line,\" says Martins. \"And from what I understand, it appears to be working very well.\" (Read more about Becker's work at uwmedmagazine.org.) Following the genetic path to disease James Annis, research scientist, is using the core's equipment to study functional genomics: how genes, mu - tated genes and their products begin a process that can lead to disease \u2014 or to disease resistance. By combining the use of small inhibitory RNA molecules or siRNAs within screening paradigms, Annis can knock out a gene, track what happens afterward, and under - stand the intracellular pathways that are involved in the process. Martins calls this a truly powerful part of genomics. \"Just knowing a gene is knocked out...doesn't link you to how a cell has responded downstream. The mutation may be over here\" \u2014 Martins stretches out his arms to show the hypotheti - cal distance \u2014 \"but way over here is where the cell's response is.\" Keeping discoveries in the region The core, housed at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medi - cine (ISCRM), has been in operation for approximately five years, conduct - ing hundreds of projects and produc - ing volumes of data for UW Medicine researchers and other organizations. The inspiration of ISCRM's director, Randall Moon, M.D., Ph.D., the core was funded by a generous donation from the Quellos Group, LLC, and began offering research services with the addition of Martins, Annis and Collegiality and collaboration are par for the course at the Quellos High-throughput Screening Core at UW Medicine. Tim Martins, Ph.D. '84, left, and James Annis work together to screen drug candidates and study functional genomics, and the results are bearing fruit for the UW Medicine community. THE QUELLOS CORE: Changing the Game 16 UW MEDICINE Photos: Clare McLean SPRING 2014 17 < Precision Medicine When does the gray matter that resides in your skull resemble an aching knee or elbow? When Tom Montine, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the Department of Pathology and the Nancy and Buster Alvord Endowed Chair in Neuropathology, makes an analogy to explain the development of Alzheimer's disease. \"In some respects, Alzheimer's disease is like arthritis of the brain,\" he says. Take a damaged joint; in responding to the injury, the immune system may inflict additional damage that later leads to arthritis. Similarly, Montine thinks the immune system may also speed Alzheimer's disease in some patients. Recent genetic indica - tors point strongly to immune regula - tion in the brain as a key element of Alzheimer's disease. What Montine and his colleagues are working toward, however, is to amass all the genetic drivers for Alzheimer's disease, not just the genes that code for immune response regula - tors. They want a complete picture \u2014 the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease. With genomic technology, he says, this is coming quickly. But just knowing the drivers isn't enough. \"Genetics defines molecular rel - evance,\" he says, \"but it doesn't define molecular mechanisms.\" Montine and his colleagues need better experimen - tal models that allow scientists to track the pathways \u2014 from their genetic origins to their functional effects \u2014 responsible for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson's. Precision medicine tools like genomics (to assess risk) and pro - teomics (to measure biomarkers that indicate the possibility or presence of disease) are helping scientists track the pathways and the drivers in Alzheim - er's disease. And once the pathways and drivers are better understood, Montine says, \"we have a rational approach to therapeutic development.\" A precision medicine approach, one tailored to specific forms of diseases in specific people. Carla Grandori, M.D., Ph.D., from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The Quellos High-throughput Screening Core provides a unique service, says Martins, one usually only available through big pharma. It's also a service that provides important data for projects still in the beginning stages. (See the story on Jennifer Chao, Ph.D., M.D.'s work with eye models on page 18). \"We are applying automation and high-throughput screening techniques to projects very, very early on,\" says Martins. It's a real advantage in testing hypotheses. And, he adds, having high-throughput capacity in the community keeps technological advances close to home. \"Let's dream up ideas here, and let's build them here,\" says Martins.A high-tech dispenser helps automate the process of testing compounds in the Quellos Core.

The ARTHRITIS of the BRAIN SPRING 2014 17and Other Links to Alzheimer's Disease 18 UW MEDICINE Precision Medicine > \"It's sort of like having the sword of Damocles above your head,\" says Jennifer Chao, Ph.D., M.D., UW assistant professor in the Department of Ophthalmology. She's referring to the diagnosis of macular degeneration, a condition that affects the sight of approximately 1.8 million people in the U.S., especially older people. There is no cure. \"You go to the eye doctor, and you try to manage your symptoms, and sometimes there's just nothing you can do,\" Chao says. Through a study being conducted at UW Medicine, however, Chao hopes to take several steps toward a cure, or at least toward understanding the causes of macular degeneration. And she has found a way around her first obstacle. How do you study a live, malfunctioning human eye \u2014 one still very much attached to its owner? The answer is to create a partial model of the eye. To this end, Chao and her colleagues have recruited 12 volunteers. Some have macular degeneration, and some do not, but all of them donated blood. First, Chao and her colleagues manipulated the blood cells to create patient-specific stem cells, which can transform into other types of cells. Then they prodded the stem cells into transforming into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. RPE cells maintain the retinal environment in the eye, and researchers think they're connected to macular degeneration. These clumps of RPE cells, which serve as models of the eye, are then tested at the Quellos High-throughput Screening Core \u2014 a service that enables rapid studies. They are first bombarded with factors thought to cause macular degeneration \u2014 fac - tors that can cause cell death \u2014 and then exposed to nearly 2,000 medical compounds. The object of the experi - ment is twofold: to see if any of the compounds can save the eye models from dying and to better understand how macular degeneration affects the RPE. The work has started, and rapid screening has shown some preliminary \"hits\"\u2014 therapeutic compounds that may work to defeat macular degeneration in one or more of the models. This is precision medicine in action \u2014 at a very early stage in the scientific process. \"It's very exciting,\" says Chao. She pauses when asked about the value of having the Quellos Core at UW Medicine. \"I don't really know where else we would do this,\" she says. \"It's fantastic.\" See the story on the Quellos Core on page 16.Like many faculty at UW Medicine, Jennifer Chao, Ph.D., M.D., a specialist in macular degeneration, sees patients and conducts research. She hopes that precision-medicine approaches will help her learn how to prevent the condition.The SWORD of DAMOCLES 18 UW MEDICINE Photos: Clare McLean More at uwmedmagazine.org \u00bb SPRING 2014 19 < MEDEX Northwest Amy Hoger always knew she wanted to pursue medicine. In fact, she worked her way up from a junior volunteer to become an LPN, but after 12 years as a nurse, Hoger found that she wanted to do more for her patients. \"I like to help people,\" she says. Over the course of her nursing career, Hoger was inspired and encour - aged by several physician assistants. In time, Hoger set her sights on becoming a PA, and she went on a search to dis - cover the best training programs in the country. She chose MEDEX North - west, entering the 26-month program in 2001, graduating in 2003. \"MEDEX prepared me well for my future work,\" she says. In addition to providing more sophis - ticated care to patients, Hoger's other goal was to live in a place she really enjoyed. Originally from St. Cloud, Minn., she spent most of her adult life in Boise, Idaho, with her son and her husband, Kevin. It had been the couple's dream to live in Alaska for some time, and when a PA position became avail - able in Fairbanks in 2010, the family decided to take a chance, pack up their belongings and move north. In Fairbanks, Hoger did two years in urgent care. Then, in November 2012, she accepted a position in Anchorage, some 350 miles south of Fairbanks. In partnership with the Department of Family Medicine's residency program at UW Medicine, Providence Family Medicine Center in Anchorage hired her to provide care for 100 homebound patients \u2014 with the larger goal of expanding access to care in the five-state region of WWAMI: Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. Hoger is expanding access to care in a diverse community: Anchorage's population is anything but homog - enous. More than 100 languages and dialects are spoken there, including Native Alaskan, as well as languages from Europe, Africa and Asia. Hoger's work with homebound patients brings her into daily contact with people from diverse backgrounds. Although she doesn't speak another language herself \u2014 \"I could use about five!\" she says \u2014 Hoger manages quite well, a testament to her cultural competency and to family members who occasion - ally step in to interpret. Like their languages, her patients' conditions vary, too. Focused mainly on the chronically ill or those unable to leave home \u2014 most over 65 years old \u2014 Hoger treats chronic conditions such as COPD, diabetes and heart disease. Hoger's role in Anchorage includes more than patient care. She is one of two MEDEX-educated PAs placed through the residency program, part of a larger effort to integrate PAs into UW Family Medicine Residency practices throughout the WWAMI The Cultural Ambassador Amy Hoger, PA-C (Yakima Class 8) \"I've always believed in the mission to serve.\" \u2014 Amy Hoger, PA-C region. Hoger is on faculty, sometimes teaching in the classroom, working directly with trainees: medical resi - dents and students, along with interns in social work, psychology and phar - macy. Often she must start by explain - ing her role as a physician assistant, and she takes the students on home visits, exposing them to the unique needs of her homebound population. The move to Alaska has turned out brilliantly. Hoger is happy in Anchorage; her colleagues are collaborative, she feels valued, and she's doing important work. \"This is the closest to my dream job as I'm ever going to find,\" she says. \"I've always believed in the mission to serve, and this position allows me to do just that.\" Photo courtesy of Amy Hoger, PA-C (Yakima Class 8) SPRING 2014 1920 UW MEDICINETop Mind > Footwork was key to winning Seattle's MyHeartMap scavenger hunt \u2014 footwork and organization. \"We all work in marketing, and we're pretty adept at spreadsheets,\" says Rebecca Bridge. She is the leader of Team HeartMarket, the group that won the MyHeartMap challenge. MyHeartMap was the brainchild of Graham Nichol, M.D., MPH, UW professor of medicine in general internal medicine and Medic One Foundation Chair for Pre-Hospital Emergency Care at UW Medicine, and Raina Merchant, M.D., of the University of Pennsylvania. Their goal was to enlist the public to find as many automatic external defibril - lators (AEDs) in the city of Seattle as they could over the course of one month. AEDs save lives when people suffer a cardiac arrest; they are often found in public areas and are intended to be used by bystanders. \"We know from previous studies that if a layperson uses an AED to help a person in cardiac arrest before the para - medics arrive, the chances of survival double,\" says Nichol. While Seattle Fire Department staff track AEDs, they did not know where all the devices were located. A scavenger hunt, thought Nichol and Merchant, would bring in more information. At the outset of the MyHeartMap contest, staff knew the whereabouts of 350 AEDs in Seattle. Now, thanks to the efforts of 32 hard-working teams, Nichol's colleagues are verifying the location and condition of approximately 1,000 of the devices. Graham Nichol, M.D., MPH, presents a check to members of Team HeartMarket \u2014 (left to right) Rebecca Bridge, Mike Pantoliano, Lara Petersburg and Ben Estes \u2014 the group that found the most AEDs in a scavenger hunt held in Seattle in November 2013. A BIG-HEARTED SCAVENGER HUNT The next step is to provide this information to the Fire Alarm Center and 9-1-1. Eventually, there may be an app that people can use to pinpoint AEDs in their vicinity. What did it take for Team HeartMarket to win? Ceaseless effort during the lunch hour, after work and on weekends. In all, they found approximately 800 defibrillators. And they're not stopping there; they're using part of the prize money to develop a public service announcement on the value of installing AEDs in tall buildings. Bridge also notes that the team is buying AEDs for two non-profits serving low-income Seattle neighborhoods. Nichol and Merchant count Seattle as a successful experiment, and they are already starting to work with other metropolitan areas, though Nichol isn't revealing which ones. \"I would prefer to maintain the suspense for now,\" he says. As for Bridge, she's no longer hunting for defibrillators. But the instinct remains. \"I still walk around and think, 'maybe there's an AED in there,'\" she says, laughing.

As a medical student, Oliva did a rotation in Nepal, and he saw an international team perform 300 cata - ract surgeries in four days. \"It was the genesis moment for me \u2014 I saw the model and the vision,\" he says. After settling into private practice, Oliva began volunteering with the Himalayan Cataract Project (HCP), which collaborates with clinicians from the developing world to improve eye care and enhance local capacity through training. Often working in temporary clinics set up in schools in remote areas, highly efficient physician-nurse teams provide cataract surgery, restoring sight in about seven focused minutes. Oliva serves on the HCP's board, oversees the organization's work in Ethiopia, trains ophthalmologists overseas and has performed more than 10,000 cataract surgeries in five countries. \"Treating blindness is prob - ably the most cost-effective health intervention with the biggest impact,\" he says.TRANSFORMED He enjoys sharing the moment when the bandages come off and a patient sees a family member's face. \"Many people look old and frail on the surgical table, but the next day they are walking confidently or dancing with joy, and looking 10 years younger,\" says Oliva. \"I love the transformation.\" her own transformative moment: a glimpse of open-heart surgery during a medical- science summer program for disadvan - taged youth. The surgery crystallized 14-year-old Estell Williams' goals. \"When the doctors showed me what was happening,\" says Williams, \"I said, 'I want to do that.'\" One of the first things Williams wanted to do upon entering the UW School of Medicine was to strengthen ties to the local African American community. She and other first-year students held focus groups with community leaders to discuss health needs and ways to address them, as well as to train future physicians to work with culturally diverse groups. \"We wanted to start in our own backyard to help the university fulfill its mission,\" Williams says. One outcome: the creation of an elective course on African American health and health disparities. She also served in other ways.

In rural areas, the problem is even worse, compounded by geographic isolation, lack of insur - ance, shortage of specialists, and reluctance to seek care. \"A depressed person may not seek help,\" says J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer, M.D., MPH, professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and director of the Advancing Integrated Mental Health Solutions (AIMS) Center. \"If we focus only on the patients who come to a mental health specialist's office for care, we won't make a dent in the denominator, the population of people who live with mental health and substance-use problems. An accountable health care organization has to consider the denominator.\" Un\u00fctzer and UW Medicine colleagues spend a lot of time considering this denominator. In fact, they tested, refined and confirmed the effectiveness of a collaborative-care model developed with the leadership of Wayne Katon, M.D., Res. '79, UW professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. This model has since been used to benefit thousands of people around the world. In collaborative care, a team of primary-care physicians and mental health care managers work with a consulting psychiatrist to provide effective mental health care. When a screening reveals depression, the patient meets with a care manager \u2014 usually a nurse, a social worker or a licensed counselor \u2014 to create and initiate a personalized treatment plan. The psychiatrist and care manager regularly review patient progress and recommend treatment adjustments to the primary-care physician as necessary. The psychiatrist also consults directly with patients who need extra help either in person or via a televideo connection. This model makes mental health care more readily available. And, because it's provided in the primary-care setting, it can reduce some of the stigma often associated with seeking mental health care. The AIMS Center has implemented the collaborative care model at several of the UW Neighborhood Clinics and partnered with Community Health Plan of Washington and Public Health of Seattle and King County in a Mental Health Integration Program, an effort that has reached more than 38,000 patients since its initiation in 2008. Last year, the AIMS Center brought the model to rural clinics in the five-state region of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho as part of a federal initiative supported by the John A. Hartford Foundation and the Social Innovation Fund. Partnership Health Center (PHC) in Missoula, Mont., is a Hartford-supported site that serves an urban-rural area with high unemployment and poverty. UW Medicine's model is already making a difference. \"Patients are showing good BRINGING MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO RURAL COMMUNITIES Alumnus John Miller, M.D. '00, is the medical director of the Partnership Health Center in Missoula, Mont., where the collabora - tive care model is already having a big impact on the center's work.Photo: Mary Jane Nealon, R.N.-CCPSPRING 2014 23THE JEWEL ON THE EASTSIDE Larger. More convenient. Access to more specialties. That's UW Medicine's new Eastside Specialty Center (ESC). \"Patients are really going to enjoy the experience in our new clinic,\" says Eugene Yang, M.D., UW clinical associate professor of medicine. Yang is a cardiologist and the ESC's medical director. In February, the ESC moved to its new, 33,000-square-foot home in the Bellevue, Wash., area. Patients can now visit approximately 40 experts in cardiology, orthopaedics, digestive health and other specialties \u2014 15 areas in all \u2014 in addition to having access to comprehensive radiology services and outpatient endoscopy. It's a big step forward for the center, formerly housed in a space less than one-third the size and offering roughly half the scope of services. The center's expansion is a response to the need for medi - cal access on the Eastside. \"We were receiving a lot of feed - back from UW Neighborhood Clinics,\" says Yang. \"People really wanted to stay within the UW Medicine system, but it was inconvenient...to come to Seattle for specialty care.\" Yang notes that the ESC can now handle some minor outpatient surgeries, including treatments that previously would have been referred to sites in Seattle. It's the first loca - tion on the Eastside to use low-dose CT scanners, reducing patients' exposure to radiation during imaging procedures. And in addition to superb care, patients will receive the high level of customer service they've come to expect from a major health provider. \"The center is going to be a jewel for UW Medicine,\" says Yang. < Top of Mind response to collaborative care,\" says Program Director Mary Jane Nealon, R.N.-CPP . \"One patient told me, 'I don't want to go through another generation of trauma and depression in our family.'\" PHC's medical director, John Miller, M.D. '00, MPH, also has a positive report. \"Now we have the staff resources to deliver care more personally, efficiently and cost-effectively. Collaborative care is having a big impact on our work, and everyone benefits,\" Miller says. Local and regional clinics are benefiting; global providers are decidedly interested. \"Clinicians all over the world are asking us how to implement this model,\" Un\u00fctzer says. In response, the AIMS Center is develop - ing a web-based automated program that can create a collaborative care plan and training program tailored for a clinic's needs.

Learn - ing what medicine is truly like \u2014 the pace, the procedures, the patients, the state of healthcare in the U.S. \u2014 helps the candi - date understand and articulate what they want. \"Before you apply, you should know yourself, and you should know what you're getting into,\" says Teitz. \"And it should show in your application.\" Learn more about the admissions process: visit uwmedicine.org/admissions.GETTING INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL \"It's great to catch up on what's happening at the School of Medicine and to hear about faculty we know,\" says Weiya Wysham, M.D. '09. Weiya and her husband, Nick Wysham, M.D. '09, participate in the UW School of Medicine's HOST program: taking in fourth-year students visiting their city \u2014 Durham, N.C. \u2014 for residency interviews. In part, the Wyshams are paying it forward; as a couple who made numer - ous interview trips to seek a match in the same location, they greatly appreciated being hosted by other alumni. \"We still keep in touch with Photos: Karen Orders Drs. Nick and Weiya Wysham, shown above, both members of the Class of 2009, HOSTed students Sarah Baxter and Lacy Irwin last fall.some of our hosts and want to return the favor,\" Wysham says. She and her husband, who grew up in Washing - ton, enjoy the experience. \"We have fond memories of our time in medical school, so it's a good way to stay connected,\" says Wysham. \"Meeting the students is a bit of home away from home.\" Interested in participating in the HOST program?

Together, they must place 134 MEDEX students in nine rotations each across 500 clinical sites \u2014 work that involves 1,000 preceptors. But Hawkins rises to the challenge with the determinedness of someone with strong military training. \"To do this well \u2014 and make sure we meet everybody's needs \u2014 can be a challenge,\" he says. \"But I relish the opportunity, and I know that we manage to meet those needs.\" Darrel L.

'95 Medical service and military service: they're linked for Capt. Peter M. Rhee, M.D., MPH, Fel. '95 (surgical critical care). In fact, he began his surgery fellowship at Harborview Medical Center in 1993 while stationed on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson in Bremerton, Wash. During his 24-year career with the U.S. Navy, Rhee was deployed more times than he can remember. He served as the travelling surgeon for President Clinton, and he was the first surgeon sent to Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001. In addition, Rhee founded a program at LA County Hospital to train thousands of medical personnel on how to treat wounded soldiers in the field. Rhee was also on the front lines of a major news story; in 2011, he was one of two surgeons called to operate on former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, shot during a speaking engagement. \"It's a great privi - lege to be a trauma surgeon and be ready to take care of whoever comes through the door,\" says Rhee. As vice chair of surgery and chief of trauma at the University of Arizona Medical Center, the only Level 1 trauma hospital in southern Arizona, Rhee is committed to all his patients and to medical readiness in the face of disasters. He's also committed to research and to training medical students. \"Being with medical students is a priority for all of us,\" says Rhee. \"It's the reason we work at a Level 1 trauma center.\" 32 UW MEDICINEKaren L. Kwong, M.D., Res.

Ryan Blanck, B.S. '98 (prosthetics and orthotics), developed the Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis (IDEO) while working at the Brooke Army Medical Center with the Center for the Intrepid. He was the head of the upper-extremity prosthetic program and lead prosthetist on various upper-extremity research projects with the Department of Defense. For his de - sign, he received the Meritorious Civilian Service Award, the second-highest award given to civilian employees of the federal government. He now works with Hanger Clinic in Austin, Texas, and is developing a national IDEO program to provide prosthetics to civilians. ClassNotes > Working for Students: Anne Eacker, M.D. '97, Chief Res. '01 An interest in the intersection of mental and physical health: that's what led Anne Eacker, M.D. '97, chief res. '01 (internal medicine), to become a primary-care physician. A UW associate professor of medicine, her research focuses on the health and well-being of medical students. \"Medical students who experience burnout are at a higher risk for depression and dropping out of medical school,\" says Eacker, who is also the associate dean of student affairs. \"All of us who work with students \u2014 clinical faculty, College mentors and everyone in Academic Affairs \u2014 do all we can to keep burnout from occurring.\" Part of that process, she says, is offering opportunities for students to develop strong relationships with each other during their first and second years, and helping them develop the tools they need to sustain them throughout their clinical years. Eacker draws inspiration from her work. \"I have been working with students throughout my time on faculty,\" Eacker says. \"They constantly amaze me with their ability to manage their personal and professional lives.\" Students may be taking a page from Eacker's own book: in addition to her work at UW Medicine, Eacker is an enthusiastic skier, a triathlete and an active member of her church. Eacker, above, is pictured on the slopes with her sons, Alec Denny (left) and Aidan Denny. SPRING 2014 33< ClassNotes Eileen Bulger, M.D., Res. '99 (surgery), Fel.

I also have been involved with the International Medication Surgical Response Team (IMSURT), headquartered in Washington, D.C., since it was established in 2003. The teams respond to major disasters when a local medical system is overwhelmed and establish field hospitals to manage com - plex patient cases and perform surgery.\" 2000s Hilary Bowers, M.D. '00, writes, \"The last decade has been quite a ride! Ten years in private practice in Los Angeles, Culver City and San Diego, which included five housing moves. The birth of Elijah, Miriam, Hannah, Naomi and Rivka. My husband, Peter Bowers, Ph.D., has started two biotech compa - nies and published numerous papers and patents.\" Joanne Stekler, M.D., Res. '00 (internal medicine), Fel. '05 (allergy and infectious diseases), UW associate professor of medicine in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was honored with an HIV/AIDS Service Award at the 10th Annual World AIDS Day Breakfast in December. Drew Garcia, PA-C (Spokane Class 3) (2001), is part of the core faculty group for the new MEDEX Tacoma site, and he is one of the regular lecturers. \"I also see my role more as a guiding one in the first year \u2014 helping to form the students both personally and professionally for their upcoming roles as PAs,\" he says. In 2011, Garcia's life took an interesting turn when he moved to Egypt to care for Westerners and Egyptian nationals working with a U.S. government program; the country's revolution had begun that January. \"It was pretty amazing,\" he says. \"And in my mind, it confirmed that people are people around the world. The Egyptian nationals were looking to better their situation. They were looking to live life the best they could without interference from either internal or external sources. It was really interesting to watch the progression of democracy. Unfortunately, their timetable as a nation was shorter than what true democracy takes.\" Todd Lefkowicz, MOT '01, writes, \"I worked as a rehabilitation engineer for about 10 years and then decided to pursue a degree in occupational therapy. I thought the additional education would help me be more effective in providing assistive technologies. In 1995, I had the chance to work for about three months in Peru. While there, I saw many children who needed special seating systems. I realized that local therapists were not learning the basic principles of seating and positioning. Eleven years after my first trip, a group of us founded Mobility Builders. Our partners in Peru now use our system fairly independently. Our goal is to enable the families to come in for a seating evaluation and leave a few hours later with a complete custom wheelchair and seating system.\" Ashley Marquardt, PA-C (Seattle Class 33) (2001) was named the \"Alaska Physician Assistant of the Year\" by the Alaska Academy of Physician Assistants in 2013. On the MEDEX faculty since the start of the Anchorage site in 2008, Marquardt was recognized by the academy for his dedication to the PA profession and his efforts to gain more visibility for PAs in the Alaska community. Marquardt is the didactic site coordinator for MEDEX Anchorage, responsible for all the classroom instruc - tion. On students, he says, \"Mostly we try to recruit Alaskans, or people who are going to work in Alaska. It helps if they have Alaskan experience. Most impor - tantly, they should demonstrate com - mitment to the MEDEX mission, which is to bring healthcare to underserved populations and communities. It doesn't necessarily mean we want them out in the bush, although that would be very nice. But there are plenty of underserved right here in Anchorage.\" (See a related story on page 19.) Amee Koch, PA-C (Yakima Class 7) (2002), went straight into family practice after graduation. \"I worked with three female physicians in a private practice in Wallingford in Seattle. They all delivered their own babies, so I saw the gamut of patients, from newborn to elderly. I learned so much from them. After three years, I left to work closer to home, in Issaquah. I worked for a combined family practice/urgent care clinic, where I ran the Saturday clinic solo, without an electronic medical record or computers \u2014 all handwritten dicta - tion. After another three years, I grew weary of the rain and headed for the sunshine of Bend, Ore., where I worked for a high-acuity urgent care in town and on Mt. Bachelor. Although it was an incredible job that I enjoyed for five years, I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone, which is how I ended up in New Zealand! I've now been in New Zealand going on six months, and it's been an incredible experience. It's definitely taken me a while to get used to what resources (or lack thereof!) are available to us in the medical field. I no longer have access to immediate imaging or lab results. But malpractice is virtually non-existent here. Which basically means, instead of ordering a massive number of tests to cover all the bases, I have to use my brain to figure out which tests I feel are absolutely necessary. And I sometimes feel like I'm a new graduate again, having to learn new drug names and to explain to every person I meet what it means to be a physician's assistant. So although there are challenges to being a trailblazer here, the Kiwis are so nice, and I have so much support from my fellow PAs. And of course I'm spending every spare moment outside of work exploring the countryside. So much beauty!\" Ashley (Yakima Class 8) (2003), a captain in the U.S. Army, writes, \"After graduation from MEDEX, my first PA position was in an undeserved rural clinic in Umatilla, Ore. Completing the National Health Service Scholarship, I rejoined the Army to serve our nation at war. I was sent to the 82nd Airborne Division, and I found myself in Afghanistan within a few months. My medics were fantastic; most had deployed before, and they taught me so much. Lacking textbooks, I wrote MEDEX, and they responded with medical books. I was so proud of my school and the opportunity to share knowledge with my medics. A short time later, I sent Private First Class (PFC) Brown \u2014 a 19-year-old medic \u2014 on a mission. Her convoy was struck by a roadside bomb and took heavy fire. She saved the lives of fellow soldiers and even shielded the injured with her body, rendering medical care. PFC Brown became the first woman in Afghanistan and only the second woman since World War II to receive the Silver Star, this na - tion's third highest medal for valor. In 2009, we returned to Afghanistan for another 12 months. We lost a soldier from our small outpost and saluted the casket, draped by an American flag. I was awarded the Bronze Star, and I gave it to my daughter, who had been without her dad during her formative high-school years. I returned shortly after her graduation, and now I serve at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Fort Lewis, Wash. This has allowed me to be closer to my daughter, now in her second year of nursing school. I am so proud of her! I am privileged for the opportunities that were made possible thanks to the training I received at MEDEX.\"A.

I wanted to learn how to kite surf, and that continues to be my adrenalin-pumping sport of choice. I took a short-term job in Gresham, Ore., where I was able to com - mute for six months until the opportunity to work in Stevenson, Wash., opened up at a rural family practice. I worked there until I was laid off due to budget cuts in 2012. It was heart-breaking to get laid off from a job that I loved so much, but I used that summer to obtain my yoga teacher's certificate and to kite almost every day on the Columbia River. I was heading up the Deschutes River to fish with friends when I received an email inquiring if I would be interested in [MEDEX's] New Zealand demonstration pilot program. I needed to find another job, and this just felt right \u2014 not to mention that it was an adventure that pushed my comfort zone! So here I am, having some great adventures. I work with an amazing group of providers and have never felt so welcomed and respected by my peers.

When the opportunity arose to travel to New Zealand to help jumpstart the physician assistant profession there, Froehle decided to take a risk and say \"yes.\" He writes, \"The New Zealand Physician Assistant Demonstration Project has been an incredible experience so far. I have been here for five months and have enjoyed it immensely. While it can be difficult to explain what a PA is every day, and to get prescriptions signed, it is also an honor to be one of the first PAs in this country. I think New Zealand is an incredibly attractive country for PAs because, while it is small, the popula- tion is mostly in Auckland, leading to a lot of underserved rural areas. This is where we PAs will be utilized the most. It is truly amazing to put in an eight-hour workday and then still have time to hit a beautiful beach, take an amazing hike, go to Auckland for dinner, etc. Also, the cultural diversity of New Zealand makes each day, clinical or not, incredibly enriching. We have a long road until PAs are a part of the medical system in New Zealand, but it's going to be a beautiful road.\" Aaron Scheidies, DPT '08, recently started working at CRISTA Senior Living in Shoreline, Wash.

We are now gearing up for our fourth annual Feet on the Street clinic, which provides foot care, wound care and footwear to low- and no-income community members. We also run a large dental clinic every year; I rent two dental vans and partner with the dental school at Oregon Health & Science University (and their faculty) to provide restoration and/or extractions. What's unique about Without Strings is that all of our \"street clinics\" are held under the Marion Street Bridge, and the clinics truly are without strings. We don't ask questions, and we offer assistance to any guest visiting our events. I have aspira - tions of obtaining funding to begin a mobile primary-care clinic, and I continue to work on grants with that goal in mind. I remember a question I was asked when I applied to MEDEX: 'Where do you see yourself in five years?'

As an administrator, Dr. Van Citters served from 1968 to 1970 as associate dean for research and gradu - ate programs. In 1970, he was named dean of the UW School of Medicine. Dr. Van Citters oversaw the start of the WWAMI program, the School's regional medical education system. He also oversaw the creation of the Department of Family Medicine and the School's rural medicine program. Theodore J. \"Ted\" Phillips, M.D., founding chair of the Department of Family Medicine and former associate dean of academic affairs, said Dr. Van Citters was a cherished mentor. \"I was one of his first administrative appointments after he became dean. He was my mentor. He got me started in academic medicine. I knew nothing about academic admin - istration when Van hired me. I could not have done it without his attentive and patient mentorship. He was a delightful human being. We became and remained good friends.\" William J. Bremner, M.D., Ph.D., the Robert G. Petersdorf Endowed Chair in Medicine, said Dr. Van Citters was an understated and steady leader whose legacy is evident through - out UW Medicine. \"Van didn't talk a great deal, but he was clear and firm when he did communicate and was greatly respected on any topic, from academics to fishing,\" Bremner said. \"He left an indelible mark on so many facets of the School of Medicine, in particular, but also what is now UW Medicine as a whole.\"Other initiatives started during Dr. Van Citters' 11 years as dean included Harborview Medical Center's burn and trauma services, the Medic One Foundation, the MEDEX North - west physician assistant program, key affiliations between the School of Medicine and Seattle Children's, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the VA Medical Center, Washington's statewide regional residency program, and more. Thomas F . Hornbein, M.D., a former chair of the UW Department of Anesthesiology, wrote, \"He taught me over the years precious lessons in caring leadership. I suspect most of my chair peers had a similar experience. He always made me feel I really mattered. Our periodic meetings together, for example, taught me a principle that has been lastingly precious: when the door to his office closed with the two of us inside, I had his total, undivided, seemingly unhurried attention. He always appeared totally focused on us, regardless of whatever big chaos was simmering in his deanly life.\" In a letter to the faculty, Paul G. Ramsey, M.D., CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the School of Medicine, wrote, \"We have lost a wonderful leader, colleague, role model and friend. His legacy is profound. I and many others will miss his grace, vision and quiet, down-to-earth humor.\" Dr. Van Citters was preceded in death by his wife, Mary.

Dr. Van Citters, known as Van to many, came to the University of Washington in 1958 as a National Institutes of Health special research fellow in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. He joined the faculty of that department in 1963. Dr. Van Citters made numerous contributions to the School of Medicine. He was described by the late Robert G. Petersdorf, M.D., former chair of the Department of Medicine, as \"one of this country's most imagina - tive and productive cardiovascular physiologists\" during the 1960s. He developed instrumentation to measure blood flow through arteries and made major contributions to the study of cardiac function in unanesthetized animals. His studies helped to clarify the relationship of physiological responses in animals to those in humans. In recognition of his many scientific contributions, Dr. Van Citters was elected in 1977 to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.

In his first detour, at Texas A&M University, he \"ran screaming out of chemistry class\" and into agricultural journalism and wildlife biology. Dream deferred. After a first job in Dallas, the great Northwest called to him. A master falconer, he moved to Boise to serve as a research biologist. There, he radio-tracked falcons and observed nests in the Snake River Canyon. He also took up hang gliding. \"It didn't go well,\" See recalls. \"I broke my arm, but after great medical care, I real - ized 'I need to do something like this.' \" Dream rekindled. See earned a paramedic's license and worked as an EMT in Idaho. He also served as a firefighter. Next, his passion for flying \u2014 he's also a licensed fixed-wing and helicopter pilot \u2014 drew him to Missoula and four years as a critical-care flight paramedic. The teams served rural residents needing transport and flew rescue missions into the backcountry, providing the dual enjoyment of saving lives and seeing the magnificent countryside. \"Still, I wasn't satisfied,\" See says. \"I wanted to understand more about what was going on with patients.\" An advanced paramedic course fanned the spark into a flame and spurred him to complete pre-med requirements at the University of Montana in Missoula. Spending his first year in medical school at Montana State University in Bozeman, one of the UW School of Medicine's partner WWAMI sites, was the \"natural choice.\" See says his 13-year EMT career eased his way through clinical rotations, and his experience led to service on the UW School of Medicine's admissions and curriculum renewal committees. \"Both were very rewarding \u2014 a real privilege,\" See says. After graduating this coming June, See will embark on a five-year general surgery residency. He is grateful that scholarship support lowered his debt load so he can eventually practice in Montana. Other goals include teaching in the Montana WWAMI program and becoming involved in trauma prevention efforts. See notes that surgical rotations in Libby, Mont., reinforced his goal to become a general surgeon in a rural community. \"I saw how much difference they make in people's lives, and I love the close connection with a rural community,\" he says. 44 UW MEDICINE The Adventures of Wade SeeBiologist, FireFighter, Pilot, Doctor: CONTACT US UW Medicine Alumni Relations and UW Medicine Advancement Alumni or toll of Physician Medical Education 206.543.1050 UW Medicine Alumni Association, UW School of Medicine UW Medicine To learn more about our programs and events, visit UW Medicine magazine at uwmedmagazine.org .ONE physician can save a life.
