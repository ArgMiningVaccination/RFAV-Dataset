Graeme Bradshaw Naturopath, Homeopath IMI Founding Director B.Sc, Dip. Nutr., Dip. Hom., Dip. Herb., N.D. Graeme Bradshaw Naturopath, Homeopath IMI Founding Director B.Sc, Dip. Nutr., Dip. Hom., Dip. Herb., N.D. Areas of expertise - The gut-brain, gut-immune and gut-skin connection - considering the gut as primary physical cause for chronic symptoms. Testing, not guessing the cause of the gut issues - Individualised diets incorporating food intolerance data; assisting with weight and mood management, liver and skin issues - Immune support for all ages - Correcting underlying factors in skin problems, hair loss and brain health - Deep therapeutic detoxification for mould, heavy metals and pollutants. - Preventive approaches for the proactive client - such as people who are interested in DNA analysis, including epigenetic monitoring of the \"biological age\" and applying anti-aging programs through the use of nutraceuticals, some fasting and oral peptides for anti-aging. \"Where possible I like to get test-based facts then individualise the natural therapies and treatment based on this information. My approach is to find the underlying causes, teach my clients the corrective tools and coach into living the solutions.\" Graeme Bradshaw is IMI's founding director, establishing IMI in 2001. With over 32 years in practice, Graeme is an experienced and respected naturopath, homeopath, medical herbalist and nutritionist. He applies his wealth of clinical experience, knowledge, and extensive post-graduate training in diagnostics and functional medicine to treat the root cause of a vast array of health concerns. Graeme gives seminars to doctors and physicians on the topic of functional medicine testing and how to manage gut issues naturally. Originally from Tasmania, Graeme completed his undergraduate study in the sciences and embarked on a teaching career before turning to natural medicine. In Sydney, he qualified in naturopathy, homeopathy, medical herbalism and nutrition and started practicing in 1985. His post-graduate studies have been in the area of Functional Medicine. He arrived in Hong Kong in 1990 and was the first full-time naturopath to practice here. Graeme treats all ages, with a special interest in the gut connection to many illnesses - identifying digestive disorders and the commonly related mind, mood and immune problems that are often affected by the gut microbiome. Graeme has considerable knowledge in diagnosing bacterial, parasitic and fungal overgrowth and the underlying digestive problems and food intolerances that are associated. Graeme's aim is to remove the underlying and often hidden cause of patients' chronic illness. \"We often start with tackling digestive disorders in the gut and then improve digestive function. We may then have to remove toxins or supplement special nutritional needs. If necessary, we also address stress and sleep issues before we can finally swing chronic problems back towards good health again.\" Another area of his expertise is the use of the Organic Acids Test (OAT) and DNA tests. The OAT is a urine test that gives indication of gut related toxins, and also urinary neurotransmitter levels as well as how the mitochondria in our cells are doing at producing our energy from carbohydrates and oxygen. The OAT test can also indicate any pollution-related toxicity damage as well as some nutritional deficiencies. The DNA testing that Graeme recommends to proactive clients is a simple saliva test. It is a good guide to supplements and foods needed long term, best for those who wish to look more deeply at underlying genetic predispositions. The test is only for factors that can be managed successfully so that prevention strategies can be informatively implemented. DNA testing allows Graeme to tailor the treatment to a patient's individual symptoms and genetic profile. Graeme's personal lifestyle includes gym fitness training, hill-walking, meditation practice, sailing, adventure travel and a healthy non-vegetarian diet - along with a few coffees and a drink or two per week. He is a father of three (38, 36 and 15 years old) and at 65, Graeme is now also grandfather of three.

I have had chronic bloating for many years, seen a lot of doctors and took so much medicines but there was no significant improvement. After I followed your treatment plan and took the prescriptions on time, my bloating conditions have been improved significantly, I'm very grateful for that. My best wishes to your practice and wellness.\" Bing Bing Li, actress \"I first brought my son to see Graeme when he was 5 years old, after he had been experiencing a few months of sudden behavior change and food sensitivities, as well as motor tics and constipation. We had been working with a doctor who had diagnosed PANDAS. Graeme suggested we first examine his gut health. Tests showed my son had problems with dysbiosis, parasites, candida and high levels of gut inflammation, as well as some nutrient imbalances. He gave us a 2-month program of herbals and nutrients which succeeded in resolving most of these issues. My son's behavior and overall health definitely improved after this treatment, however he continued to have lingering food intolerances, tics and digestive issues. He was then tested for SIBO, which was strongly positive, and successfully treated with herbals within 3 months, which substantially improved his digestion and food sensitivities. Due to a serious infection at age 7 caused by injury, my son had to undergo several months of antibiotic treatment, after which I brought him to see Graeme again to evaluate his gut health. Tests showed he had dysbiosis and high gut inflammation, which we have since been treating with good success. My son is now 9 and appears in good health, is able to eat most foods and has almost no tics or other signs of PANDAS. I attribute a great deal of this to working with Graeme, who throughout has been a kind, patient and thoughtful practitioner.\" \"My son was diagnosed with ASD, ADHD, and Tourette Syndrome from the age of 2 and it has been tough, as a mum, to see your child struggle through their young life. We tried many treatments with varying degrees of success, and then last year, in 2017, we met Dr Graeme. Dr Graeme looked closely at my son's diet. First treatment was to detox my son's yeast, followed by his metal. This didn't really help much but then Dr Graeme treated my son's gut. He gave us some natural herbs to detox his gut - and this is where we saw a vast improvement. His social skills and cognitive improved, his logic thinking improved, even his school teacher was amazed at the change in him. My son has less anxiety now, and always voluntarily raises his hand in class during recitation. After so many years seeking the right treatment, I am so happy and grateful that we found Dr Graeme. He is an amazing and understanding doctor.\" Margaret Lui \"After experiencing food poisoning 4 times in the past year I have had ongoing stomach issues. I was experiencing extreme fatigue and terrible nausea. This resulted in the need to rest a lot over the weekend and I had to stop doing sport. I was seeing a GI specialist that my GP recommended and needing to go in for gastroscopy and Ultrasound. The test were clear and I was put on a medication to try to help the nausea. A friend suggested I try IMI to get a more holistic treatment. I have been very pleased with the treatment so far. Diagnostics have been used to better understand my gut health and also to address by migraine problems. I've battled with migraines for over 20 years, and have experienced times where I have had migraines up to 15 days a month. In taking the supplements and following the diet guidance I was able to not only stop my migraines, but start to eat food that previously triggered them. Treatment on my gut issues is ongoing but I no longer experience nausea and I am on the path to better sustainable health. If I had have stayed with the GP/specialist route I would still be on heavy medication without any answers. The time and care taken by Graeme and the IMI team has been excellent. The first consultation really is an hour, to go through your health and lifestyle in detail. This was such a nice experience to have someone listen to you and really understand what you're going through. I feel confident now that I will get better and I will be able to maintain better health.\" Rachel "}
