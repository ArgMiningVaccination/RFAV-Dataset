His previous publications include Struggle and Fulfillment: The Inner Dynamics of Religion and Morality, and Faith, Authenticity, and Morality. Reviews \"This book has been written by a proven author and senior philosopher who knows western thought inside out, yet he sees the need for a larger conception of human nature that is open to the spiritual dimension and treats that dimension as the fundamental reality. In presenting such a view of human nature and spirituality, Evans draws deeply and insightfully from western depth psychology, Eastern meditation psychology, Christian thought, and his own experience. The book is very accessible to both general readers and scholars. \" \u2014 Harold Coward, University of Calgary \"I have recommended this book to a number of people as the best really up-to-date work of spirituality. It integrates insights from ethics, theology, depth psychology, and continental philosophy in a way that is especially the author's own, but which is to me totally convincing. It also throws a flood of light on phenomena associated with the 'new age' movement. \" \u2014 Hugo a. Meynell, University of Calgary \"What distinguishes his writings is a remarkable attempt to integrate those various segments of human existence which our culture has, over the centuries, separated: our mental life and our bodily awareness, our contemplative needs and the moral demands of our time, our secular endeavors and our sense of transcendence, our 'natural' sense of selfhood, and the 'supernatural' systems in which we have expressed its intrinsic dependence, our religious/cultural identity and our openness to other religions and different cultures. This book creatively deals with all of these oppositions. \" \u2014 Louis Dupre, Yale University "}
