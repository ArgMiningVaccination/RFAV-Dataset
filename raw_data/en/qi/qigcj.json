These services are critical for helping triage and manage cases that otherwise may end up in emergency rooms. Chiropractic helps keep healthcare providers, first responders and critical infrastructure in place, including transportation that supports healthcare and food supplies during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Chiropractic clinics share the public health responsibility of slowing the transmission of COVID-19. Practices that attend to urgent cases must employ strict hygienic practices at every point of patient contact and keep up to date with prevention recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We urge everyone to closely monitor state and local health authorities and to comply with any relevant guidance or mandates. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is working to coordinate information and guidance from multiple credible sources and partners for use by doctors of chiropractic and their clinics throughout the country, while also monitoring communications channels and providing the public with reliable information about chiropractic care. We are committed to responding to misinformation that may cause confusion. For example, some claims are being made that spinal adjustments can boost immunity and decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19. While spinal adjustments are effective for a number of conditions, there is no quality evidence to support that they can improve immunity to COVID-19. It is ACA's mission to inspire and empower our members to elevate the health and wellness of their communities. Some ACA members are using telehealth, phone consultations and other technologies to provide health care advice to patients in lieu of in-person visits. We encourage our members to visit MyACA, ACA's online member forum, to share their ideas and experiences. In difficult times such as now, it is powerful to have this community of peers working together to protect and serve our patients, staff, families and our communities in the best and most responsible manner possible. Please continue to visit acatoday.org and HandsDownBetter.org as new information becomes available. Sincerely, ACA Board of Governors Robert C. Jones, DC President Michele Maiers, DC, MPH, PhD Vice President Kathy Boulet, DC Governor Leo J. Bronston, DC Governor Karen Konarski-Hart, DC Governor Hon. Steve C. Roberts, Esq. Governor "}
