Is it right for me? Using the [hierarchy of healing in naturopathic medicine through therapeutic order](https://wholehealthnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/), Naturopathic Doctors assess individual lifestyle and current hormonal balance to determine the best course of action to work towards feeling better. We will look at all treatments available including nutritional needs, herbal formulas, adjusting sleep habits, stress management techniques, and ways to bring joy back into our lives. Exhaustive of all other options, or in addition to, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy could be the next step in gaining a sense of self back. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) is a natural hormonal supplement option that helps bring the body's chemistry into alignment by using identical hormones (bioidentical) to the ones the body once produced including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. BHRT uses hormones derived from natural plant sources to replicate the body's normal hormonal levels. As research becomes available, clinicians are finding BHRT to be a safe alternative to synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which uses ingredients not commonly found in the human body. After receiving BHRT, patients report feeling: - Relief from symptoms of menopause and andropause - Clarity of mind - Less frequent/ severe headaches - Increased energy - Reduced depression and anxiety - Improved sexual performance BHRT can be administered in various ways depending on the individual needs of a patient. We use the patient's symptoms, and labs as a guide to prescribing, making sure to cover all the risks and benefits associated with hormone therapy. One favored form used at Whole Health Naturopathy is a hormone pellet, about the size of a long grain of rice, inserted under the skin, and that can last for 3-6 months. This can be a nice alternative from creams and sublingual compounded formulas, that require up to twice daily use. Pellets are easy, comparable in price to other forms for BHRT, and effective. Once placed under the skin, consistently release small, physiologic doses of hormones that provide optimal therapy. Unlike typical oral and transdermal forms of therapy, which can produce \"roller coaster\" hormone levels, resulting in mood and energy fluctuations for the patient, pellets typically provide consistent and sustained hormone levels throughout the day for up to three to six months.
