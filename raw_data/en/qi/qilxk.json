As you know by now, a strong, robust immune system could be the best solution to combat COVID-19. Therefore, the next query that arises is, how does one boost immunity in a way that does not cause any harm to your body? The answer to that is quite simple! Switch to the highly efficacious and miraculous solutions provided by the ancient science of Ayurveda. Mentioned below are ways to boost your immunity with Ayurveda. Ayurveda and Immune System The science of Ayurveda had stated quite a long time ago that plant extracts could help in strengthening your body. According to this science, the human body can ward off infections only when all the seven layers of the tissues of the body are robust and strong. These seven layers are Rasa, Mamsa, Rakta, Medha, Majja, Asthi and Shukra. When these seven layers are working in tandem together, your immune system will be strong. So, what do the layers require to stay in optimum health? The answer is Ojas, which is a subtle, invisible essence of the tissues of your body that eventually contributes to optimum health. Ayurveda has stated that specific plants and plant products can help in building Ojas so that your immunity is boosted. Mentioned below are some of the immunity-boosting foods Ayurveda that will effectively help your body produce more of Ojas. This will, no doubt, be of great help in the battle against COVID-19. Moringa Moringa is essentially an herb that can help combat a wide array of health complications. Therefore, during this COVID-19 pandemic, this should be your go-to herb for strengthening your immune system. So, what makes Moringa a potent immunity booster? To start with, it contains nearly 7 times more vitamin C than that present in oranges, making it the best Ayurvedic medicine to boost immunity. Vitamin C is the primary nutrient that is needed by your body to build a robust immunity. That is not all because this herb contains several other vital nutrients that help in strengthening your tissues, muscles, and cells. Moreover, moringa is an excellent source of amino acids, calcium, iron, and potassium. Neem Since ancient times, neem has been viewed and extensively used as an Ayurvedic medicine to boost immune system. It is highly effective in keeping the body healthy and safe from the bombardments and attacks of harmful pathogens because it possesses antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Neem can also purify your blood by flushing out toxins, which eventually helps in strengthening immunity. Turmeric Turmeric is a rich source of curcumin: a phytochemical that can eliminate toxins from your body and bolster your immune system so that bacteria and germs are killed. Turmeric can be added to most Indian dishes. You may also consume it by adding it to milk. Tulsi Tulsi or basil is yet another wonder herb of phenomenal uses in the science of Ayurveda. The aromatic leaf of the tulsi plant can serve as the first line of defence against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. What's more, tulsi is a potent germicide. Because of its high content of antioxidants and phytochemicals, it can accurately locate germs, bacteria, and viruses and destroy them. Chewing a few neem leaves in the morning can be a great start to the day. You may also add a few drops of water that is boiled with tulsi leaves in your food. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is an excellent adaptogen, which makes it a great stressbuster. Physical and mental stress is known to lower your immune response, making you more vulnerable to viral infections. Make it a point to consume Ashwagandha during the ongoing pandemic to robustly fight the virus. Triphala The antioxidative properties of 3 fruits ( [Haritaki](https://livayur.com/how-to-use-haritaki-for-increased-efficacy/heal-naturally/), Bibhitaki, and Amliki) are present in Triphala.

Ginger For ages, ginger has been the go-to remedy to combat common cold and flu. In addition, it can be effective against COVID-19. Ginger is an excellent source of gingerol, which is an antioxidant that can bolster the immune system and keep viruses at bay. Moreover, ginger is known to prevent infections of the respiratory tract. You can add ginger to your meals or even consume it in raw form. Garlic Consuming garlic is one of the Ayurvedic ways to boost immunity. Garlic contains allicin, which is a plant compound that plays the role of a germicide. That said, derive the maximum benefits of garlic by consuming it in raw or partially cooked form. Black Cumin Black cumin extract can protect you from a wide range of bacteria and viruses that eventually attack your immunity. Both black cumin seeds as well as oil act as powerful antioxidants that help in flushing out free radicals, which can prove to be a danger to the immune system.
