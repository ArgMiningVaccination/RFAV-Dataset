Saint Louis University's Physician Assistant (PA) Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) is a 27-month, year-round graduate program with a rigorous didactic and clinical curriculum providing a broad medical and surgery foundation. As one of the first universities in the country to offer a PA program, SLU maintains a tradition of academic excellence and has earned a national reputation as a leader in PA education. Educational facilities at SLU provide an exceptional learning environment and include a simulated medical office with eight exam rooms equipped with cameras for recording and reviewing student performance. The mission of SLU's PA program is to educate individuals to become competent, compassionate physician assistants dedicated to excellence in health care and the service of humanity. Traditional pre-PA tracks can be found in many [Doisy College of Health Sciences (DCHS) programs](https://catalog.slu.edu/colleges-schools/health-sciences/). In addition, DCHS proudly offers the direct-entry [PA Scholars option](https://www.slu.edu/doisy/degrees/undergraduate/pre-pa-scholars.php) for eligible incoming freshmen interested in securing a spot in the SLU PA program upon graduation from a specific pre-PA degree program. SLU also offers the [M.M.S./M.P.H. dual-degree](/colleges-schools/public-health-social-justice/graduate-programs/physician-assistant-mms-mph-dua-degree/) option for students who are passionate about pursuing both PA and public health interests. Graduates of SLU's PA program are eligible to sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE). [Annual NCCPA PANCE Exam Performance Summary](https://www.slu.edu/doisy/degrees/program-pdfs/pance-report-0318.pdf) [SLU PA Program Attrition Rates](https://www.slu.edu/doisy/degrees/program-pdfs/pa-attrition-rate.pdf) Despite potential reasons for leaving the program, most fees are non-refundable. Tuition refunds usually cannot be granted due to the timing and sequencing of our curriculum. If, however, a tuition refund is applicable, the student will be guided through this process. Information on withdrawal and tuition and fee refunds may be found at [Student Financial Aid Services](/academic-policies/student-financial-services/). Curriculum Overview SLU's PA curriculum offers a broad foundation in the medical and surgical disciplines. The principal faculty members of the PA program offer a breadth of background and experience in health care and education. In addition, area physicians, PAs, other health professionals, and experts contribute to the PA program curriculum, along with science faculty within the University. Clinical and Research Opportunities Clinical education is an essential component of SLU's PA program. Students begin their clinical education after completing four semesters of didactic education. Through clinical rotations in the major disciplines of medicine and surgery, PA students at SLU learn to integrate clinical knowledge and skills with active patient care. Saint Louis University is clinically affiliated with numerous hospitals, clinics and medical and surgical practices. PA students will be assigned to complete St. Louis metro area rotations plus a maximum of three out-of-town rotations each year. These are at least 60 miles outside of St. Louis but are regional, typically within a five-hour drive of campus. Students may request clinical placements in locations where they have housing available, but this is not guaranteed. They are responsible for transportation and housing. In the clinical year, all clinical rotations are assigned. This means that the program assigns sites and preceptors for Phase II and students are not responsible for developing their own clinical sites or finding their own clinical preceptors. However, after discussion with the director of clinical education, students may be allowed to initiate contact with potential new preceptors to establish new clinical rotation sites. Clinical Practice Experiences Saint Louis University is a member of the National Council for State Authorization and Reciprocity Act (NC-SARA), which allows students to complete a portion of their education in a different state. PA students work with clinical preceptors and actively participate in patient care in six six-week and three four-week supervised clinical experiences in the following disciplines: - Clinical Elective: This is a student-choice rotation in terms of medical or surgical specialty/subspecialty. Specific clinical disciplines may be chosen based on student interests or what students believe would best augment their clinical knowledge and skills. - Emergency Medicine: This clinical experience explores patient assessment and management in an emergency department setting. It includes patient care for acute and emergent encounters, emphasizing focused patient assessment, precise diagnosis and emergent treatment. - Evidence-Based Medicine Clerkship: Though evidence-based practice is important throughout the curriculum, this is a student-choice rotation in terms of the medical or surgical specialty/subspecialty. The application of evidence-based medicine in clinical practice is presented and documented. - Family Medicine: This clinical experience allows students to gain outpatient/ambulatory primary care experience in a community setting. It includes the daily care of patients presenting for chronic, acute and preventative visits across various age groups. - Surgery: Students actively participate in a surgical practice that exposes them to concepts and principles that characterize the operating room and surgical patient care. They will participate in pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative care during this rotation. - Internal Medicine: During this clinical rotation, students participate in direct patient care in inpatient and hospital-based adult medicine. The rotation expands on the understanding of the complexities and interrelationships of disease processes with diagnostic and therapeutic collaboration, as well as patient assessment, plan, oral patient presentation and clinical documentation. - Pediatrics: This four-week clinical rotation provides practical clinical experience in recognizing and managing common pediatric problems and health maintenance. The clerkship includes assessing and treating infants, children and adolescents with attention to acute care visits, well-baby and well-child care, preventative pediatrics and parental counseling. - Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine: This four-week clinical rotation provides experience working with patients across the spectrum of mental health in a psychiatric and/or behavioral medicine setting. - Women's Health: This four-week clinical experience encompasses the fundamentals of obstetrics/gynecology/women's health including pre-pregnancy, prenatal, postpartum and general gynecologic care. Certification and Licensure PAs are certified nationally and licensed by the state. After graduation from an ARC-PA accredited program, PAs can sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE). The PANCE is administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA), the nationally recognized certification organization for PAs. The NCCPA assures high standards in the profession and provides the patient/consumer with safeguards and the employer with evidence of competency. Saint Louis University PA program graduates have consistently performed above the national average on the PANCE. National certification via the NCCPA is required for clinical practice as a PA. Certified PAs are also required to demonstrate continued competency via mandatory continuing education and successfully complete the national PA recertification exam every 10 years. State licensure is also required for clinical practice as a PA. Specific requirements for licensure vary by state. Depending on state-specific requirements, the agreement between the PA and the collaborating physician (MD or DO) may be maintained with the state licensure documents. Note: Many state regulatory and governing organizations will not grant a license, registration or other professional practice documents if one has been convicted of a felony, or in some cases, a misdemeanor. Prospective applicants are encouraged to consult the state licensing organization for more detailed information before applying. Careers PAs are employed in every medical and surgical specialty and subspecialty in which M.D.s and D.O.s are employed. PAs work in hospitals, clinics, offices and other settings. PAs obtain histories, perform physical exams, order diagnostic tests and imaging, interpret the results, diagnose and treat illnesses, counsel and educate patients, assist in surgery and prescribe medications. Some PAs work in primary care, such as family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics and women's health, while others work in various medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. SLU's PA graduates can be found in hospitals, clinics, private offices, community health centers and many other settings. Admission Requirements Baccalaureate Degree Applicants to SLU's PA program should possess or be on track to a baccalaureate degree earned by the May prior to matriculation. An exception may be considered if students will earn an August degree, have completed all prerequisites and have three credits or fewer to complete during the summer. Sufficient GPA Applicants must have a science GPA of least 3.00 and an overall GPA of at least 3.00. These are considered minimum GPAs, not competitive GPAs. Average GPAs are typically greater than 3.50. Prerequisite coursework includes: - Medical terminology (1-3 credits) - Statistics (3 credits) *science-based statistics is preferred - College chemistry I and II (8 credits) - Organic chemistry I and II (6-8 credits) - Microbiology (3-4 credits) - Vertebrate or human anatomy (3-4 credits) - Vertebrate or human physiology (3-4 credits) - A combined Anatomy and Physiology I and II (6-8 credits) will be accepted in place of separate anatomy and physiology courses. - Genetics (3-4 credits) Students cannot transfer into the PA program. No advanced placement is allowed for any coursework, degree or experience. All prerequisite coursework must be completed by the May prior to matriculation. All science prerequisite courses must be those for science majors. If offered, accompanying laboratories are highly recommended. Only grades of C or better are acceptable for science and math prerequisite courses; grades of C- or below are not accepted and grades of B or better are preferred. Prerequisite coursework should be completed within seven years of application. Community college and online courses are typically accepted but not considered competitive (except medical terminology). Coursework at a four-year college or university is recommended. The GRE general test is not required. However, if submitting scores, the SLU PA program GRE code is 4475. (Do not use the Saint Louis University code; a specific SLU PA program code must be used with the CASPA applications.) Patient Care Experience Applicants must have acquired the minimum hours of health care experience in order to advance for application review. PA program applicants must have acquired a minimum of 500 hours of patient care experience by the time the CASPA application is submitted. Hours earned after this, regardless of when the file is reviewed by the PA admissions committee, are not considered. This experience varies and can be acquired on a full-or part-time basis. The program critically assesses the complexity of the position held and ranks applicants accordingly. Direct patient care experience requiring specialized training and/or certification and providing monetary compensation is most competitive, and emergent or inpatient experience is typically ranked more highly than outpatient work or long-term care work, although successful candidates may have experience in any category. For example, a background as an RN or physical therapist would be ranked more highly than a scribe. Examples of typical work experience include CNA, EMT, scribe, or patient care technician, but vary widely. The average applicant has at least 2,000 hours. Unless you are already closely working with a PA, shadowing a PA is important and can enhance your application but is not considered health care experience. Only 100 student clinical hours (obtained while fulfilling the required components of an educational program or course) can count toward the 500 hours of health care experience needed. Volunteer hours are not considered competitive health care experience and often cannot be counted towards the 500-hour minimum. If volunteer hours are accepted, only a maximum of 250 hours may count. Background Check Students in this program are required to obtain a criminal background check and undergo drug testing. A positive background check or drug screen could have significant consequences for the student, including forfeiture of any or all clinical rotations and/or inability to complete the program. The potential to sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE) may also be impacted. Additionally, many state regulatory and governing organizations will not grant a license, registration or other similar professional practice documents if there is a positive criminal background check or drug screen. Application Process Apply through the [Central Application Service for Physician Assistants](https://caspa.liaisoncas.com/applicant-ux/#/login) (CASPA) between mid-April and Nov. 1. The PA supplemental application, found in the CASPA Program Materials section, must also be completed during the same time frame. CASPA will not send your application materials without the completion of this section. Payment for the supplemental application processing is made by going to [SLU Marketplace](https://billpay.slu.edu/C20197_ustores/web/classic/index.jsp?MOBILE_REDIRECT=false). CASPA applications and PA supplemental applications are reviewed beginning June 1. It is recommended to submit all application materials by Aug. 1. CASPA verification may take two weeks so applications submitted after October 15 may not make the deadline. Letters of reference submitted to CASPA should be from people who know applicants well, either professionally or academically, such as a job supervisor, professor or academic adviser. Please note: The PA program requires three letters of reference, even though CASPA completes an application with only two. Applications completed and verified by CASPA will not be reviewed without the supplemental fee or appropriate fee waiver. A limited number of processing fee waivers will be available for applicants experiencing severe financial hardship. To be considered for a fee waiver, applicants must email a request to [pasupplemental@slu.edu](mailto:pasupplemental@slu.edu). The request should outline the reasons for the request and the nature of the financial hardship. Requests must be emailed by July 31 to be considered. Application Deadline Applications for this program close Nov. 1, meaning that applications must be completely verified by CASPA by Nov. 1. Due to this verification process, it is recommended that applications are submitted to CASPA by Oct. 15 to meet the Nov. 1 deadline. Applicants who have met all requirements are encouraged to apply early, between June and August. Completed applications are reviewed in the order applications are received. PA Scholars Program Saint Louis University also offers the PA Scholars program, which is a competitive freshman direct-entry program into the PA program after completing a specified undergraduate degree from the Doisy College of Health Sciences and adhering to specified program criteria. Requirements for International Degree Holders Graduates of an international college or university, with the exception of Canadian institutions, must meet all prerequisites and must have a minimum of 30 credits, or 10 courses, of college coursework from an accredited US university or college. Full-time enrollment in a four-year institution is recommended, but community college coursework is accepted. In-person course work is preferred. The US coursework must include: Organic Chemistry I and II, Human Anatomy and Physiology (or A&P I and A&P II), and a minimum of three social/behavioral courses to include Psychology (with other options such as Sociology, Anthropology, History, etc.). International medical graduates with 500 hours of health care experience outside of the United States must also acquire at least 250 hours of patient care experience in the United States by the time of application. Applicants whose native language is other than English are required to take the TOEFL\u00ae Internet-based Test by Nov. 1. A combined minimum score of 100 is required, along with minimum component scores of 22-Reading, 22-Listening, 26-Speaking and 24-Writing. Scores should be submitted to CASPA and to the PA Program. The school code is R6629. The department code for health science is 0601. Interview Process Personal interviews occur between September and February. Four to five interview dates are scheduled with 20 to 24 applicants each date. Highly qualified applicants may be invited to interview (via Zoom or in-person, depending on anticipated restrictions) not more than 3-4 weeks prior to a scheduled interview date. It is not unusual for applicants to be invited much closer to the interview date. Selection Factors Each of the following factors is weighted based on the relative strength of an applicant in that area. For example, preference is given to applicants who possess a higher total/overall GPA; higher science, pre-requisite, and BCP GPAs; higher number of healthcare hours, as well as higher quality of healthcare hours; and so on. This is true for all selection factors under points 1-5 below. 1.

Program Competencies Students matriculating in the Saint Louis University PA program undertake a difficult, rewarding and life-changing journey. The SLU PA program competencies help prepare students for this responsibility and correlate with entry-level PA practice expectations. Students work toward attaining the program competencies as they progress through the curriculum. A summative evaluation of each student occurs in the last few months of the program. It is an assessment that determines whether each student has attained competence (met all the program competencies) and is ready for graduation and the transition from PA student to practicing PA-C. The competencies are interwoven with and complementary to our mission, goals, learning outcomes and instructional objectives and are fundamental to our program's curricular and operational framework. Effectiveness in Meeting Program Goals The SLU PA program has a long and rich history of excellence in didactic and clinical PA education. The program goals interact within the context of the program mission and broadly capture many of the details and components that come together to create our program's curricular and operational framework. Program competencies, learning outcomes and instructional objectives are interwoven as part of the support for this framework. Information about our SLU PA program goals and success in meeting them is outlined here: [Outline of SLU PA Program Effectiveness in Meeting (PDF). |Code||Title||Credits| |ANAT |Total Credits||98| Performance Standards During the entirety of the PA program, students are expected to adhere to specific academic and professional standards, which are outlined in the student handbook and policy manual. As health care professionals, PAs must be sensitive to the value of human dignity. This value is manifested in behaviors and attitudes demonstrating inclusion, sensitivity to the well-being of others and honesty in all endeavors. PA students, therefore, are held to standards of professional behavior in areas including overall conduct, academics, health information, daily interactions with others, clinical compliance, patient encounters, title identification, attire and attendance. In addition to expectations for professional behavior, PA students must also meet academic standards. The academic expectation is that all PA students maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and perform at or above 70 percent on exams and other graded components. The complex nature of medicine and the condensed educational time frame of the PA program combine to create a curriculum that is very rewarding, yet also rigorous, time-consuming and intense. Whether engaged in classroom and lab activity, reading and studying, or clinical rotation obligations, students should plan to be involved in program requirements all day, every weekday and some weekends for the duration of the program. It is recommended that students do not work during the 27 months they are enrolled in the program. Additionally, students may not work for the PA program nor serve as instructional faculty or clinical/administrative staff. Technical Standards Additional Requirements - In keeping with our Jesuit values and program mission, SLU PA students are required to complete community service hours during their time in the program. Required service hours do not have to be related to health care. - In addition to a physical examination and health attestation, admitted PA students must meet SLU health regulations plus program health, immunization and related requirements prior to program matriculation and throughout the program. - Students are required, at the least, to obtain a criminal background check and undergo drug testing before matriculation and again before clinical rotations begin. A positive background check or drug screen could have serious consequences for a student including forfeiture of any or all clinical rotations and/or inability to complete the program. The potential to sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE) may also be impacted. Additionally, many state regulatory and governing organizations will not grant a license, registration or other similar professional practice document if there is a positive criminal background check or drug screen. Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Policies Withdrawal from any course or modification of the curricular sequence of the PA program is not permitted except as part of an approved leave of absence. If, for any reason a student needs to request a leave of absence, the student should schedule a meeting with the PA program director or a principal faculty member. The student will be guided through the University process for leave of absence and [course withdrawal](https://www.slu.edu/financial-aid/paying-your-bill/refunds.php) with help from program faculty and staff. Despite potential reasons for leaving the program, most fees are non-refundable. Tuition refunds usually cannot be granted due to the timing and sequencing of our curriculum. If, however, a tuition refund is applicable, the student will be guided through this process as well. Information on withdrawal and tuition and fee refunds may be found at [Student Financial Aid Services](/academic-policies/student-financial-services/). Roadmaps are recommended semester-by-semester plans of study for programs and assume full-time enrollment unless otherwise noted. Courses and milestones designated as critical (marked with !) must be completed in the semester listed to ensure a timely graduation. Transfer credit may change the roadmap. This roadmap should not be used in the place of regular academic advising appointments. All students are encouraged to meet with their advisor/mentor each semester. Requirements, course availability and sequencing are subject to change. |Year I The didactic phase of the PA program consists of pre-clinical lectures, small group discussions, laboratory sessions and demonstrations. The student studies the basic medical sciences like anatomy and physiology, as well as applied behavioral sciences and clinical medicine. Educational material is presented through organ system-based courses and population/discipline-based courses that support integrating complex disease processes with diagnosis and treatment. Rather than discrete courses in pathophysiology and physical examination, the curriculum integrates these components within the courses. Among other things, phase I coursework incorporates patient assessment, clinical documentation, risk assessment, interpretation of labs, diagnostics and imaging/studies and patient plan/management/treatment. Phase II The clinical phase of the PA program includes rotations in internal medicine, general surgery, pediatrics, emergency medicine, women's health, family medicine, psychiatry/behavioral medicine and two rotations in clinical specialties of each student's choice -- clinical elective and EBM clerkship. The PA program assigns sites and preceptors for phase II. Students are not responsible for developing their own clinical sites or finding their own clinical preceptors. While working under the supervision of a clinical preceptor, students actively participate in the daily care of patients and will interact with patients of all ages, backgrounds and medical conditions. Students are paired with a clinical preceptor and function as an integral member of the medical or surgical team. They may also serve one-on-one with a preceptor, depending on the rotation. Students complete rotations in many different settings and sites for broad clinical exposure. This includes experiences in medically underserved, rural, urban, suburban and VA settings and in sites providing emergency, in-patient, outpatient and operating room experience.
