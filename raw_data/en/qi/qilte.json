REAGENTS : Equivalent reagents may be substituted. HPLC-Grade Acetone Standard, PS lot 19038NF, 92% Standard, FAME 19288NF, 94.6% 7. PROCEDURE: 7.1. Standard Preparation 7.1.1. Stock Solutions (These solutions are used for area calibration.) 7.1.1.1. For each of the three standards: 7.1.1.1.1. Dilute 100mg of standard with 80g of acetone. 7.1.1.1.2. Record all weights to the nearest 0.1 mg. 7.1.1.2. FAME and PS require further dilution. 7.1.1.3. Take ~8.0g aliquot of the stock solution and dilute with ~50.0g of acetone. 7.2. Area Calibration 7.2.1. Place ~1ml of each stock solution in a 1.5ml septa cap vial. 7.2.2. Inject 25, 50, and 75\u00b5l of each stock solution in duplicate volume using an auto injector. 7.3. Integration 7.3.1. Manually integrate each peak for the calibration and samples. 7.4. Sample Preparation 7.4.1. Dilute 100mg of sample with 80g of acetone. 7.4.2. Record all weights to the nearest 0.1 mg. 7.5. System Suitability 7.5.1. Chromatographic performance shall be evaluated on the basis of consistent area count per mg of contained PS (slope) for the standard solution. Determination of the slope for multiple injections has shown the relative standard deviation (RSD) of slope to be = 2.0%. 7.5.2. Prior to running any sample analysis, run a system suitability check. 7.5.2.1. Inject an acetone blank to ensure the column is clean. 7.5.2.2. Inject a reference standard. 7.5.2.3. Calculate the dividend of area vs. contained FAME, PS, and PSE.277.5.2.3.1. If the slope is = 2.0% from the average slope for the previous 10 standard analyses, the system is not suitable for sample analysis, and the cause must be found and repaired. 7.5.2.4. Repeat the standard analysis after every 5-10 sample analysis to ensure that the calibration is still valid. 7.6.
