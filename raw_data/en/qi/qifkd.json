We don't rely on one specific chiropractic treatment to ease your asthma and sciatica, to eliminate headaches and migraines, or to provide muscle and joint pain relief. Our chiropractors employ a holistic and integrated approach to healing your body and thus rely on a number of chiropractic treatment options. Chiropractic Treatments Employed by Elite Sports Medicine Chiropractic Adjustments Chiropractic adjustments are also referred to as spinal manipulations. We, as trained chiropractors, move a joint beyond its current physiologic range of motion, but not beyond the anatomically correct range of motion. Oftentimes, when the joint is moved you will hear a popping or cracking noise medically known as cavitations. The objective of the chiropractic adjustment is to relieve pain, restore normal physiologic range of motion, reduce swelling and muscle spasm, and improve neurologic function. Physiotherapy Physiotherapy involves the use of hot/cold packs and electrical muscle stimulation used to expedite recovery. Therapeutic Massage Therapy Therapeutic massage therapy is a complement to chiropractic treatments offered at Elite Sports Medicine. Therapeutic massage helps our patients to relax, realign and rejuvenate. Massage therapy can also treat allergies, depression and anxiety, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma and bronchitis, circulatory problems, insomnia, sports injuries, [temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ)](/tmj-pain-relief-woodland-hills/), fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, musculo-skeletal disorders, and many more conditions. Therapeutic professional massage at Elite Sports Medicine in Woodland Hills is designed to provide exceptional care to each client in the form of effective customized massage treatments that address individual needs. Muscle Relaxation Technique (MRT) Muscle relaxation technique or MRT is a chiropractic treatment targeted at the soft tissue that treats dysfunction within the muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and nerves of the body. MRT is used as an in-depth palpation/examination of the soft tissues as well as a chiropractic treatment. The chiropractor uses his or her hands to palpate the texture, hypertonicity, swelling, and range of motion of the affected body part. Affected tissues are treated by combining specifically directed tension with very specific patient movements either passively performed by the chiropractor or actively performed by the patient. Myo-bar Another chiropractic treatment employed by Elite Sports Medicine is the use of the myo-bar. The myo-bar is a stainless steel tool designed to resolve scar tissue and muscle trigger points while improving the pliability of the fascia. It is effective in chiropractic treatments of myofascial syndromes such as those found in tennis elbow, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and in sport injuries such as IT Band Syndrome, runner's knee and shin splints. Clinical nutrition Clinical nutrition is the relationship between food and a healthy body. More distinctively, clinical nutrition addresses how the body digests, absorbs, transports, metabolizes, stores, and eliminates the foods we eat. Moreover, we identify what vitamins, minerals, or nutrient are deficient from the diet and then follow up with a discussion on and plan for the appropriate supplementation via nutraceuticals. Spinal Decompression Spinal decompression is a chiropractic treatment designed to provide [back pain relief](https://www.elitesportsdc.com/low-back-pain-relief-woodland-hills/) that stems from physiological problems related to [herniated discs](/slipped-disc-pain-relief-woodland-hills/) sciatica. \"Spinal stenosis\" is defined as a space-occupying lesion that narrows the channels of the spinal column, accumulates pressure, and causes the vertebrae to compress downward thus decreasing the space between the vertebrae. This type of spinal compression leads to the damage that causes [back problems](/low-back-pain-relief-woodland-hills/), i.e., bulging discs. Spinal decompression therapy is used to reverse the effects and take stress off of the spine and is extremely beneficial because it treats problem locations, not just the symptoms. Spinal decompression is achieved by using a specific therapeutic table in which our patients are painlessly and very gently buckled. Our [Lancaster](/lancaster-chiropractic-office/), [Montebello](/montebello-chiropractic-office/), and [West LA](/west-la-chiropractic-office/) provide force and pressure to specific areas of the spine, thus providing low back pain relief. Functional Rehabilitation and Exercise Functional rehabilitation, used as a chiropractic treatment in each of our chiropractic clinics, is an extension of physical therapy. However, the underlying purpose of functional rehabilitation is to return the patient to highly complex movement patterns such as those required in athletics. Along with the traditional elements of physical therapy, functional rehabilitation programs incorporate agility and proprioceptive/kinesthetic training activities that concurrently reduce the risk of recurrent injury.
