Masks Required at All Times Naturopathic Medicine is an alternative medical support system that integrates traditional and natural therapies with modern medical diagnostic science. At Lifestyle Physicians, this also means that we maintain a standard of care found established in traditional medical offices. Naturopathic medicine concentrates on whole-patient wellness, holistic wellness, and attempts to find the source of a patient's condition rather than solely treating symptoms. The emphasis is on prevention, self-care, and optimal health through the use of integrative medicine and therapeutic methods that encourage a self-healing process. Because the human body is treated as a whole, naturopathic medicine utilizes the most natural, least invasive, and least toxic therapies to treat illness and promote health. [Naturopathic doctors](https://www.lifestylephysicians.com/providers/) cooperate with all other branches of medicine, referring patients to other practitioners and specialists for diagnosis and treatment as appropriate. Lifestyle Physicians provides a medical board certified partner to oversee your naturopathic experience which makes their clinics ideal to treat health conditions such as: (column of listed issues) The healing power of nature is your body's innate ability to restore its health. A Naturopathic doctor aims to restore and support your healing process by using therapies that are designed to work in harmony with your body's natural processes. Your body needs essential tools, time, and the natural course of things to properly restore health and vitality. Naturopathic doctors seek the cause of illness rather that treat or suppress the symptoms. A complete recovery and restoration of the body to its whole is not possible without knowing and understanding the underlying cause of disease. A naturopathic doctor's first goal is to use treatments that are highly effective but minimally aggressive, least invasive, and least toxic while supporting the patient's health care needs. The goal is to get the patient to optimal health while minimizing the risk of side effects. Methods designed to suppress symptoms without addressing the underlying cause of illness is considered a harmful approach. Health and disease result from a complex matrix of factors: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, genetic, environmental, and social. Disease and symptoms occur when these systems are stressed beyond capacity. A naturopathic doctor must treat the whole person by addressing all these factors. A doctor's duty is to encourage each patient to take responsibility for their own health, and empower them to make healthy decisions that help them achieve optimal health. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" said Benjamin Franklin. He understood that a healthy lifestyle was vital to preventing illness and disease. Naturopathy emphasizes preventive care through nutrition, exercise, and self-care that includes cleanliness and rest. Your naturopathic doctor will assess risk factors and hereditary susceptibilities to disease and help you create a wellness plan that proactively addresses those factors before your body's resources are depleted.
