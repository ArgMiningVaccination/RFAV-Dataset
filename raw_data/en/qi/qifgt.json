The concept PCMH was first described in 1967 by The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). It has been widely implemented in many different patient populations over the last two decades. The PCMH benefits patients by allowing greater access to services, better quality of care, and greater focus on prevention and early management of health problems among. In 2007, The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the American Osteopathic Association published \"The Joint Principles of the Patient Centered Medical Home\" to create a standardization of the PCMH. While evaluating the role of PCMH, it is important to define the roles of family medicine in the medical home and the role of PCMH in the Health system. It is also important to evaluate the data behind the success of PCMH. The data does not show that PCMH has made large transformative changes, but smaller successes in specific patient populations and disease processes. Finally, in order to better understand the role of PCMH, it important to understand the accreditation processes that were involved in its creation. The PCMH has provided primary care practices a model to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of patient care by redesigning their practice. To streamline this process, several entities began offering medical home recognition or accreditation for PCMH's. The AAFP, AAP, ACP, and AOA developed the \"Guidelines for Patient -centered Medical Home Recognition and Accreditation Programs\" [23] to help create a standard for accreditation.Introduction Methods The results indicate that the PCMH role is helpful but difficult to implement. The practices with the most success require support over years to complete the necessary structural and cultural changes. Studies have also shown that a shift in reimbursement may be necessary to provide team and non-visit based care While PCMH was originally introduced by the AAP, the AAFP and AACP have since developed their own models for improving patient care. The medical home's focus is the patient, and it is important not to lose sight of this among all the metrics. The most important aspect of primary care is the patient -physician relationship. It is important to keep in mind that, while the medical home is valued for its focus on this aspect, physicians should remind themselves of the importance of keeping that concept at the forefront of their minds. ResultsA literature review of studies and articles related to PCMH, accreditation bodies, health systems, public health, and health outcomes was conducted. The search was limited to articles and studies conducted in the last 5 years and in the United States of America. The PCMH has been around for 2 decades but still requires more involvement from the community in order for PCMH interventions to be successful. Additionally, it is important to focus on the patient -physician relationship in the medical home and not lose sight of this among all the metrics.

ReferencesAdventHealth Family Medicine at Winter ParkFunding Support As the United States grapples with the state of its health care system, the concept of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) has taken center stage. In an era of keeping costs low and providing the most value for the smallest price tag, the PCMH has shown itself to be a possible solution to many of our looming problems. How will one of the most advanced nations in the world provide evidence based, affordable medicine to millions of patients without losing billions in the process? The patient centered medical home model has been widely implemented in many different patient populations over the last two decades. The cumulative available data offers a mixed picture that suggests a broad failure to deliver large transformative changes, but smaller successes in specific patient populations and disease processes. The confusing state of the PCMH literature underlies the importance of carefully reviewing the methodology of each paper, and subdividing based on differences between studying \"characteristics\" vs \"interventions\" . [3]Methods: Literature search and review of PCMH, primary care, health systems and health outcomes in relation to low -income populations, noncommunicable diseases and patient satisfaction on PubMed. This search was limited to articles published in the US in the last 5 years. Conclusion: Overall, the accumulation of disappointing or modest findings highlights the difficulty of implementing PCMH. Practices with greater success at transformation may require support over years to complete necessary structural and cultural changes. Providing team and non -visit based care is also difficult in fee for service models, and at least one study has suggested it may require a shift in reimbursement practices to higher levels of capitation payments [7].Discussing evidence for PCMH should start with studies on \"PCMH characteristics.\" Research findings have shown that health care systems with greater \"PCMH characteristics\" tend to have a more positive impact on utilization, costs, quality of patient care, patient satisfaction and patient access. For example, a large VA study looked at a pool of 1,650,976 patients who were seen at their PCMH clinics and found that they had fewer ED visits [2]. Another study showed that for patients with diabetes who received care from a practice with more PCMH characteristics had 19% greater odds of having well controlled HbA1c values [1]. The same study also found African Americans had less benefit from efforts to improve blood pressure and HbA1C control, suggesting a persistence in social disparities that needs to consider community factors when implementing PCMH [1]. Unfortunately, despite the positive association between \"PCMH characteristics\" and healthcare outcomes, the studies on \"PCMH interventions\" have been much less successful. A prospective cohort study in 2016 with 438 primary care providers and 136,480 patients compared PCMH to non -PCMH practices over a 5 -year period. Overall, they found patterns of quality were similar across groups, with some modest changes in utilization [4]. The Maryland Multipayor Patient- centered Medical Home Program involved 52 PCMH practices had mixed results, with lower costs among Medicaid beneficiaries, but no sustained lower costs in Privately Insured beneficiaries, no change in provider or patient satisfaction, and higher administrative burden [5]. The strongest null evidence comes from an RCT on Healthcare Hotspotting . This study on 800 hospitalized patients with very high use of healthcare services found 6 -month interventions with intensive case management and coordination of outpatient care did not reduce emergency or hospital utilization. The study questions one key hypothesis of the PCMH model (practice changes can reduce healthcare utilization and costs), and suggests that if PCMH interventions are to be successful, they may require monitoring over a long period of time and with greater community involvement [6].

Uniquely the term hypertension describes both the finding (high blood pressure) and the diagnosis (Primary Hypertension, Secondary Hypertension, etc). The most common cause of high blood pressure is Primary Hypertension, also called benign hypertension. Generally, the diagnosis does not require further investigation, beyond evaluation for end -organ harms and determining goals of care. Despite the ubiquitous occurrence of primary hypertension, about 10% of high blood pressure is due to secondary hypertension. Epidemiologically, this is a classification of a group of disparate diagnosis that result in high blood pressure as a secondary phenomenon. As the etiology of secondary hypertension often carry harmful sequalae, it is important to recognize and investigate sources when they occur. Persistent hypokalemia is one such red flag that should trigger further inquiry. Introduction The patient is a 58 year old male with a past medical history of difficult to control hypertension despite treatment with three or four agents, who presented to the hospital with chest tightness, weakness, and dizziness. The patient was found to have severe hypokalemia with a value of 2.4 mmol/L. Chart review revealed patient had a history of prior admissions for similar symptoms and hypokalemic episodes in the past. Prior workup was started which revealed plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) of 12.7 ng/dL, and plasma renin activity (PRA) of 0.3 ng/mL, giving a PAC/PRA ratio of 42.33. As levels >20 are suspicious for primary aldosteronism, we decided to perform a CT abdomen with and without contrast, which revealed a 6mm fat -containing low -density lesion in an adrenal adenoma. CT image of adenoma is shown below. The patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism secondary to adrenal adenoma, and general surgery was consulted for assessment of adrenalectomy. At the time of writing patient has been lost to follow -up during the COVID19 pandemic, despite many attempts at communication. Case Report -Initial : Rule out interfering drugs, esp. mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, etc), but also ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors -Lab testing : Morning (8am) paired random PAC (aldosterone) and PRA (renin). PAC/PRA ratio >20 is considered suspicious for primary aldosteronism. Rule out other causes of HTN/ hypoK combination cortisol, plasma : Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade spironolactone or eplerenone, dietary sodium restriction <100 mEq /day, ideal adenoma only: adrenalectomyDiscussion MD; George L Bakris , Diagnosis of primary aldosterosim .

Acquired hemophilia is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by bleeding that occurs in patients with a personal or family history negative for hemorrhages. In acquired hemophilia, the body produces antibodies that attack clotting factors, most commonly factor VIII, which results in a prolonged PTT in the absence of other lab abnormalities. The incidence of acquired hemophilia A is about 0.2 to 1.48 cases per 1 million individuals per year. It has been associated with several clinical conditions, including pregnancy, autoimmune or collagen vascular disorders, malignancies, drugs, respiratory disorders and infections. Symptomatic patients often present with large hematomas, extensive ecchymoses, or severe mucosal bleeding, including epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding and gross hematuria. Interestingly, although spontaneous hemarthroses are common in congenital hemophilia A, they rarely occur in the acquired condition. The diagnosis of AH is confirmed by aPTT mixing studies, where a sample of blood is taken and mixed with blood from a control subject. In individuals with a factor deficiency, the control plasma restores the test value to normal; in individuals with a factor inhibitor, it does not. Factor VIII inhibitor is a cause of acquired factor VIII deficiency resulting in Hemophilia A that can result in significant internal bleeding and bruising. Many times there is no identifiable cause, but treatment can be successful in reversing and binding the factor VIII inhibitor. Given our patient's history of malignancy, it was imperative to rule out recurrence as a possible cause of her acquired Hemophilia A, but workup was largely negative. The most common treatment regimen includes glucocorticoids +/ -cyclophosphamide and +/ -rituximab. An adequate response to therapy is a complete absence of the Factor VIII inhibitor and cessation of clinically significant bleeding. Our patient responded well to treatment with rituximab, IVIG, anti inhibitor coagulant and a prolonged steroid taper. 57-year old female with a past medical history of ER Positive, PR negative, Her2Neu positive breast cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemotherapy (PTCH x6), bilateral mastectomy, Herceptin x1 year, hypothyroidism and essential hypertension presented to clinic with excessive bruising, swelling and fatigue for three months duration. Patient had no known personal or family history of bleeding or clotting disorders but had heavy menses as a child with frequent nosebleeds. Physical exam revealed scattered ecchymosis in various stages of healing throughout upper and lower extremities. She had 3+ pitting edema bilaterally and suspected hemarthrosis of the right elbow. Vital signs were stable and patient was in no acute distress. Initial lab work revealed hemoglobin of 9.6, platelets of 265, Pt 12.8, INR 0.97, APTT 79.8. Further labs revealed a Factor VIII level of <1 and a Factor VIII inhibitor level of 18.9. Von Willebrand Factor activity was 165. Autoimmune workup including ANA, dsDNA, Smith Ab, CCP Ab, and rheumatoid factor were all negative. Hepatitis panel and cancer markers were negative. CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for metastatic disease although there was interval increase of a 1.2cm right axillary lymph node as well as marginal increase in size of a 5mm right lower lobe nodule. She was treated with IV solumedrol, weekly rituximab, and seven doses of IVIG. Feiba and cytoxan were added to her regimen while inpatient. She was discharged on a prolonged steroid taper as well as cytoxan with improvement in her factor VIII levels and frequent monitoring by hematology.

County Mask Ordinances, Restaurant Dining and Bars: Effects upon Orlando Metropolitan Area COVID -19 Case Rates Eli Friedman, MD and Raj Mehta, MD Advent Health Winter Park Family Medicine Residency Program Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2). Since the first case was discovered in Wuhan, China in early December 2019, the virus has spread worldwide and created the current ongoing pandemic. The response to COVID -19 in the United States began on January 31, 2020 when a public health emergency was declared, with the first COVID -19 deaths in the United States occurring in February 2020. On March 13, 2020 a national emergency was declared in the United States, and by the middle of April 2020, cases had been confirmed in all fifty states. COVID -19 is most commonly spread from close contact between people, with small droplets and aerosols from an infected person's nose and mouth spreading the virus. Symptoms of COVID -19 are highly variable but include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, so in order to prevent the spread of the virus from asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals the World Health Organization and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the wearing of face masks to limit the volume and travel distance of respiratory droplets.For the purposes of this study, the Orlando Metropolitan Area is defined as Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties. Lake County did not pass a mask ordinance in response to COVID -19. Although some Florida cities passed mask ordinances in response to COVID -19, none elected to do so in the counties studied here. While mask ordinances vary in scope, they all generally require a person's mouth and nose to be covered while in public, and most make exceptions for patrons actively dining in restaurants and bars, exercising and sports participation, and children under two years of age. While mask ordinances in Florida were passed only at the city or county level, restaurant and bar closures were largely addressed at the state level, the Governor Ron DeSantis On September 25, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order suspending COVID -19 related fines and penalties for individuals.Background Case Positivity Rates and Mask Ordinances in Orlando Area Counties Based upon the trends seen in the chart at the left, individual county mask ordinances likely have a small effect upon new case numbers in individual counties. In summer 2020, there appears to be a much stronger correlation between new case numbers and the open or closed status of restaurants and bars. By fall 2020, restaurants and bar reopenings had significantly smaller effects. This could be attributed to prior immunity of restaurant and bar patrons from earlier exposures, but it could also be a product of changed individual or society - wide behaviors such as avoidance of \"superspreader \" events. In addition, mask ordinances should be distinguished from mask efficacy, an area of high variability which could also have a considerable impact upon new case outcomes. Mask ordinances alone are unlikely to have a significant impact upon new COVID -19 cases, but they may help to reinforce the importance of mask wearing to the general public. In -restaurant dining and bar openings, however, may be associated with a significant increase in new case numbers and warrant further study in this pandemic, as well as possible future pandemics. Conclusions Observations Among the four counties in the Orlando metropolitan area, Osceola County passed the first mask ordinance effective April 13, 2020. At that time the initial \"lockdown\" was being widely observed and testing was not widespread. Restaurants were closed except for carry out; bars were closed. Although the number of new cases reported in Osceola County continued to drop following the beginning of the mask ordinance, case numbers in most of the other Orlando metropolitan area counties also continued declining. The relatively flat number of cases through early June 2020 in Lake, Osceola and Seminole counties may be related to the effectiveness of the \"lockdown' and the relative unavailability of testing. In Orange County, home to multiple large hospital systems, there was likely superior access to testing early in the pandemic. By June 20, 2020, when the Orange County mask ordinance became effective, new cases numbers had already begun to rise again. At the end of June, approximately ten days after the mask ordinance went in to effect, case numbers finally stopped rising and leveled out at over 500 cases a day. Around the same time, however, the other three counties also saw a leveling off of their new case counts. Seminole County's mask ordinance became effective on July 1, 2020, and showed a steady number of cases followed by a gradual decline in new cases that began several weeks later. During this time the other three counties' followed a similar pattern to that of Seminole County, with falling new case rates. In-restaurant dining and bar openings have an observational correlation with new cases numbers much more easily seen than the correlation with mask ordinances on the above graph. Following the opening on June 5 of restaurants and bars at 50% capacity, case numbers began to rise in all four counties studied. Case numbers did not begin to level out until shortly after June 26, when bars were again temporarily closed. On September 5, when bars were again allowed to reopen, new case numbers increased slightly.

Raj Mehta, MD . To discuss the epidemiology, symptoms, objectivity, treatment, and follow up of hematologic malignancies from a primary care perspective. To explore the nature of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and leukemia, and the signs and symptoms that may lead the family physician to consider a hematological malignancy in one's differential. Introduction There are certain tell- tale signs that fall under the malignancies reviewed. While multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and leukemia are different from one another, commonalities include malaise, fatigue, anemia, weight loss, infections and CBC abnormalities. If the ailment is discovered early in its disease course, the patient could be asymptomatic . Further evaluation for each of these disorders would include a peripheral blood smear and consulting with a hematologist/oncologist. Treatment varies for each of these disorders, but include hematopoietic stem cell transplant or chem otherapy, with specific recommendations made on an individual basis. Monitoring of labs and imaging for the rest of the patient's life is prudent to evaluate for the effects of treatment, the risk of relapse, or a secondary malignanc y. ResultsThe characteristics between hematologic malignancies vary in nature with certain defining symptomatic similarities, and treatment and follow up is based on an individualized approach. It is in the family physician's best interest to have a good working knowledge and baseline understanding of hematologic malignancies since he/she is more often than not the initial provider to observe symptoms of a hematologic malignancy in a patient, review their initial labwork , and order further work 407- 646- 7070 A Case Against Early Prognostication Morgan Nichols, MD AdventHealth Allopathic Family Medicine Residency, PGY3 Presently 72 hours is the gold standard window of time to allow to lapse prior to prognostication in comatose patients after successful resuscitation efforts occur following cardiac arrest. In most scenarios, this is more than ample time to accurately diagnose Hypoxic -Ischemic brain injury (HIBI). This condition is hallmarked by loss of brainstem reflexes, abnormal activity on EEG, swelling or loss of grey -white differentiation on brain imaging to name a few. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that failure to regain brainstem reflex or withdraw to pain after 72 hours are reliable in predicting unfavorable outcomes. Notable exceptions include sedatives, paralytics, hypothermia, severe electrolyte abnormalities, and so forth and must be eliminated when at all possible. Overall, the goal is to prevent withdrawal of care discussions and decrease clinician pessimistic bias.Background Figure 1 - Current Prognostication Algorithm, Components of High -quality TTM Anoxic brain injury is a well documented, well- known complication that often accompanies cardiac arrest. Initial physical exam, imaging, EEG as well as subsequent evaluation and repeat diagnostic procedures at 24 hour intervals can be relatively reliable at predicting poor outcomes, even from the first initial follow -up exam. That being said, patients who have undergone V fib arrest and had ROSC achieved, who then subsequently underwent therapeutic hypothermia were noted to follow a different paradigm that was consistent and led to a different set of criteria. One of the most notable difference is that absent motor responses to stimuli on day 3 after ROSC is generally considered synonymous with poor outcomes, but are unreliable in hypothermic patients, requiring more delayed prognostication. The learned objective here is that post - hypothermic ROSC patients often require closer to 120 hours of observation prior to attempted prognoses being made. This case highlighted that all physicians should strive to uphold standards as well as preventing general biases from interfering with patient centered care. In a world where evidence based medicine is constantly evolving, this case equally highlighted the importance to be constantly aware of minute differences between cases that can drastically change clinical outcomes and objectives. Discussion Introduction A patient was brought to the ICU after suffering cardiac arrest. Patient received immediate CPR and ROSC was obtained swiftly upon EMS arrival, however initial imaging and physical exam findings suggested devastating cerebral damage. Standard of care is that prognostication in claiming brain death cannot be performed prior to 72 hours, with ideal window for diagnosis between 72-120 hours. This case reiterates the need to adhere to evidence based standards of care to avoid coercion and bias from influencing family members/healthcare surrogates from making rushed decisions, specifically regarding the post cardiac arrest patients treated with hypothermia.

PMID: 26237132.ReferencesCase Description A young female adult arrives to ICU floor status -post cardiac arrest, with ROSC achieved after an estimated down time of 20-25 minutes. Patient was found down at home by family and had immediate CPR performed prior to emergency services arrival. Initial rhythm found by paramedics was documented as Ventricular Fibrillation, with ROSC achieved after 2 defibrillations. Early imaging suggested extensive and irreparable cerebral edema, including but not limited to, bilateral uncal herniation. Initial physical exam included absent cough, gag and corneal reflexes, decerebrate posturing and the patient was actively seizing upon arrival to ICU. All initial evaluation and imaging, including EEG, pointed towards a grim prognosis. Patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia for V. Fib cardiac arrest. Approximately 48 hours after admission, patient's brain stem reflexes returned, and at 72 hours, patient was lucid, alert and following commands. Ultimately patient was extubated on Day 5 of her ICU admission. Neurologic imaging obtained after 5 days revealed several small strokes but no cerebral edema or herniation. Patient was officially discharged 11 days after her hospitalization, and after subsequent AICD placement. Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed anti -inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs to treat a wide range of diseases most with the common side effect being hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia has been shown to negatively affect hospital outcomes, even in those without diabetes with a 16% in -hospital mortality rate for those patients with new hyperglycemia compared with an in- hospital mortality rate of only 1.7% for those with normal glycemic control. (P < 0.001)\u00b9 Currently there is little guidance offered by the ADA or other authoritative bodies with respect to glucocorticoid therapy and glycemic management. The lack of official direction appears to stem from the lack of RCT trials investigating this topic. One could postulate that the frequency of those with T2DM concurrently requiring steroid therapy was previously a low occurrence. However with the emergence of COVID19 the need for understanding prospective glycemic control is paramount.Introduction Literature Review Proposed Prospective Treatment Algorithm Study Reviews A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed (2000 to March 2021) was conducted using the search terms steroid, glucocorticoid, corticosteroid, hyperglycemia, and diabetes as well via review of literature citations. Pharmacodynamic Properties of Insulins and Synthetic Cortisol Derivatives GCs are drugs that have been widely used in a variety of medical conditions. Despite their medical efficacy, steroid induced hyperglycemia remains as a common harmful problem that must be considered when initiating GCT. Despite its frequency in occurrence, delayed wound healing, increased infection and higher mortality rates.\u00b9 it remains surprisingly undervalued by most healthcare professional. A proper understanding of the mechanisms involved in steroid hyperglycemia has never been more important, emphasized by the emergence of COVID where GCT is a mainstay in treatment. Appropriate prospective RCTs guidelines that establish the recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of steroid diabetes are needed in order to prevent complication and poor future outcomes.Conclusion Diagnostic Criteria Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold 180 mg/dL. Once insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140- 180 mg/dL is recommended A More stringent goals, such as 110 -140 mg/dL, may be appropriate for selected patients, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia. C Basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill An insulin regimen with basal, prandial, and correction components is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with good nutritional intake. A Sole use of sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting is strongly discouraged. A Diagnosis of steroid induced hyperglycemia is hyperglycemia at any time, 200mg/dL, or BG > 200mg/dL 2 hours status post prandial intake after initiation of GCT.

Ophthalmology, 123(4), 917- Meningitis in Healthy Pediatric Patient Misty Coello, MD Ricardo J. Hernandez, MD Amanda Roycik , MD Cryptococcus is usually seen as a systemic opportunistic mycosis. Primarily occurring among adult patients with significant immunologic impairment. It is rarely seen in the pediatric population and even less in immunocompetent pediatric patients. Most of the data has been recorded from cases and studies also mostly reported outside of the United States. There has not been that many cases reported in the United States of cryptococcus meningitis in a healthy immunocompetent Introduction Laboratory and Imaging CSF Analysis During his presentation, a broad range of differential diagnoses and testing was considered and performed for the child. Physicians in the emergency department are used to keep a broad differential diagnosis to have higher sensitivity to catch disease. However, even taking that into consideration, their first thought is not cryptococcus meningitis. The reason lies in cryptococcus being an opportunistic fungus targeting those who are immunocompromised. In addition, data that has been seen in immunocompetent individuals has not been broadly in the United States. These studies have been mostly done in Brazil, Colombia, and China. Discussion CBC, CMP, Ammonia levels, Acetaminophen, Salicylate, Ethanol, Urine toxicology, and CT where unremarkable DispositionWe must create awareness and alert general pediatricians, family and emergency physicians to consider cryptococcus infections as a possible cause of meningitis; especially in healthy pediatric patients with no explanation of AMS who resides in the United StatesConclusionPresentation HPI: 10-year-old male with no PMH and vaccines up to date presents to the ED for altered mental status and headache. On the day of presentation, patient woke up with worsening headache with episodes of nausea and emesis.. Patient was incoherent and confused. Emergency medical services reports on route patient became more irritable and aggressive. In the ED he was confused, responding to internal stimuli. He was able to be reoriented but required constant reorientation VS: Within normal limits, except for tachycardia PE: No nystagmus, able to follow simple commands, but unable to follow complex commands. Good strength, and normal sensation on all extremities and face. No nuchal rigidity. Confused, responding to active hallucinations. Plan: Discussed with mother to obtain laboratory, imaging, lumbar puncture and admission due to acute changes in neuro status. Patient was admitted to the pediatric unit and was subsequently started on Amphotericin B, Rocephin, and flucytosine for treatment for cryptococcus . During his stay, several other testing were performed. Further Test during Admission: COVID- 19 PCR , TSH, anti -TPO antibody, ammonia UDS, Rheumatoid Factor, ANA, SSA antibody, SSB antibody, NMDA EBV, Mycoplasma which all were unremarkable. Patient was also evaluated and rule out for acute psychosis. Patient stayed in the hospital for 10 days and at the time of discharge was back to his cognitive baseline and with no neurological deficits.

Emergency medicine equips them with a great variety of patients from many different walks in their lives. If you talk to an emergency medicine resident about why they chose emergency medicine as a field, you might hear them talk about the challenge of managing multiple patients or the excitement of not knowing what is coming through the door next. One of the challenges that come with the specialty is the intense multitasking as well as countless interruptions. However, many medical students and residents claim these are strengths to their certain ADHD personality traits. Which has led to be postulated by attendings that ED residents have some degree of ADHD and that it may explain why we all ended up in emergency medicine rather than other fields. However, there has not been any documented studies whether these traits significantly exist in emergency medicine physicians. Introduction Subject Characteristics Table It was found that residents who are in the field of emergency medicine will have a higher rate/degree of ADHD symptoms than residents in other specialties. It had a significant effect on JG score (>=70 vs <70) with p-value 0.0053 and Odds Ratio 2.598(1.328,5.081) with sex held at constant. Also, it has significant effect on ASRS score (>=70 vs <70) with p -value 0.005 and Odds Ratio 1.438(1.116,1.852) with sex held at constant. Results Multiple Logistic Regression TablesThe claim that residents in emergency medicine have more ADHD that other specialties in general, holds some validity.Conclusion Methods A prospective non -randomized research study was performed by administering an e- mail linked survey constructed using two adult self -reporting ADHD exams. The validated Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale (ASRS- v1.1) and the scalable Jasper/Goldberg (JG) Adult ADD Test. Surveys were sent to all accredited residency training programs for 16 different specialties. In total there were 4300 responses.

In our institution, Family Medicine residents (FM) have Emergency Medicine (EM) rotation as part of their curriculum prior to graduation. This requirement is difficult to achieve without guidance and support. For FM residents, the Emergency Department (ED) can be an unfamiliar setting as it relates to the physical layout, electronic medical record (EMR) and ED processes. In a pre -curriculum survey, FM residents responded that a structured and comprehensive orientation could be helpful for the efficiency of FM residents during their clinical rotation and their learning experience in their EM rotation.

We hypothesized that the residents' experience, comfort level in the ED, and proficiency with EMR will improve after the online orientation.Introduction/ Intent There are two Family Medicine residencies that rotate at our ED. Both residencies have assigned their PGY 1 residents to the EM rotation. An EM rotation consists of a 4 -week block with approximately 10 -12 shifts. A total of 20 FM residents will rotate through EM during the 2020 -2021 academic year. Preliminary data was chosen and FM residents that rotated through the EM rotation from July 27, 2020 to February 8, 2021 were included. Thirteen FM residents rotated during this time period. Only 2 residents did not register for the online orientation. Over 75% of FM residents completed the resident survey. The majority of respondents were either \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" with how the online orientation prepared them to use the EMR (Graph 1) and to see patients in the ED (Graph 2). Eight out of ten were either \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" with the EM orientation as a whole .

ReferencesNo funding support was used for this projectFunding Support The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires that residencies must provide evaluation and feedback from multiple evaluators such as faculty, fellow residents, medical students, patients and ancillary staff.1 These are called Multisource feedback (MSF) or 360 -degree assessments. 2 Direct observation of resident's patient encounters and their individual performance is an essential aspect of competency -based education. 3 Recognizing the value of MSF, our program sought ways to increase the frequency, thus we created the direct observation teaching shifts (DOTS). DOTS are scheduled shifts in which paired faculty/residents were assigned a chief complaint -based patient encounter in which faculty can provide individualized learning and the 360 -degree assessment was used as the evaluation tool. The purpose of this study was to examine how the implementation of DOTS directly impacted EM resident's perception and number of timely completed 360 - evaluations, over a 12 -week period. We hypothesize that the implementation of DOTS will increase the number of 360 - degree evaluations completed by EM residents and improve their perceptions about completing MSF assessments during the 2019 -2020 academic year. Introduction Methods After completing the 12 -week period, we saw over a 3 -fold increase in the number of 360 evaluations completed. At least, half (3) of the PGY 1, five out of six PGY2 and all the PGY3 had at least 2 DOTS. Most of the residents felt that they received individualized learning (83%) from the attending physician during their DOTS and benefited from the learning experience. The majority (75%) of the EM residents responded that they would like to continue to be scheduled DOTS. Results In conclusion, the implementation of DOTS was well received by EM residents and it tripled the number of completed 360 evaluations and provided direct observation periods with feedback from multiple sources.ConclusionDuring the 2019 -2020 academic year, emergency medicine residents that were scheduled to the EM rotation, over a 12 -week period (November 18, 2019 -February 9, 2020), were assigned DOTS paired with a designated faculty member. Specific lower volume shifts were chosen to maximize educational opportunities. All 18 residents had the opportunity to have at least 1 DOTS. At the completion of the 12 -week period, the EM residents were surveyed on their perception of the learning experience. Surveys were sent using Microsoft Forms and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.

Methods Introduction The majority of the participants were PGY1 and PGY2 residents in the pre curriculum design survey. Most residents have completed 1 -2 rotations in Emergency Medicine before answering the survey. Also, most participants did not read the EM/PEM curriculum assigned with 30% stating they did not receive orientation material. Most participants were neutral/uncomfortable in seeing patients (Graph 1), placing orders, and unprepared for their rotation after completing part of the orientation. Multiple freeform responses stated wanting an enhanced orientation, primarily concerned about how to navigate the EMR efficiently. Results 1.Carter, A. J., & McCauley, W. A. (2003).

The addition of a structured and comprehensive orientation can help foster off service residents in becoming more efficient in the ED.Emergency Medicine rotation is a requirement for residents from other specialties. In our institution, Family Medicine residents (FM) and Pediatric residents (Ped) have Emergency Medicine (EM) and Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) rotations as part of their curriculum prior to graduation. These requirements are difficult to achieve without guidance and support. In addition, the emergency department physical layout and process are different from the inpatient setting. These factors will affect the efficiency of off service rotators during their clinical rotation. The purpose of this study is to assess off service residents' perceptions of their preparedness in the Emergency Department (ED). We hypothesized that the residents' experience, comfort level in the ED, and proficiency with EMR are consistent with residents feeling uncomfortable and having limited proficiency.
