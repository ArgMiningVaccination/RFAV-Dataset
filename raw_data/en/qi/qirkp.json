Plans for different scenarios require consideration of unique needs. Vaccinations can occur at [hospitals](https://www.stericycle.com/en-us/industries/enterprise-healthcare/hospital-waste-management-and-disposal) - both on-site and off-site (tents, pop-ups, annex building and other temporary locations) - as well as [retail pharmacies](https://www.stericycle.com/en-us/industries/pharmacy-labs-and-research/retail-pharmacies), clinics and [long-term care facilities](https://www.stericycle.com/en-us/industries/practices-and-care-providers/nursing-facilities). While considerations are similar for these situations, they are key for developing your plan for disposing of vaccination waste. It's necessary to evaluate where the administration will happen, where to source sharps containers, where they should be located, how many vaccinations and patients are expected, and whether there are enough sharps containers to accommodate the waste generated. On-site Vaccine Administration For on-site vaccination administration within your facility, Stericycle recommends increasing inventory of reusable sharps containers to accommodate increased volume of waste and not displace containers from other patient care areas. Off-site Vaccine Administration For off-site administration, purchase additional disposable sharps containers to manage waste at the location. How to Dispose of Expired Vaccines Manufacturers also recommend that fully discharged vaccine vials are discarded in sharps containers, which should be taken into account when planning container quantity. Vial trays should also be discarded as medical waste; refer to your vaccine manufacturer's instructions for packaging waste.
