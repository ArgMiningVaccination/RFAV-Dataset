Full wire-speed unicast, multicast and broadcast mapping options further simplify cabling dilemmas. Cable break simulation with programmable start/stop and duration simplify real-life network scenarios. Sustain continuous testing operations Remote access and test execution Small-scale deployments Small footprint, low cost-of-entry The 2-slot, ColdFusion chassis has a 4 RU footprint for smaller labs or labs with limited rack space. The small footprint allows the switch to be strategically placed throughout the lab allowing for: Distributed architecture - place smaller chassis where needed throughout the lab. Edge deployment - small form factor suitable for edge applications. Ease of clustering - use the 8-slot chassis as the hub with 2-slot chassis as spokes. Low cost of entry - cost effective for smaller scale labs. Portability - for increased mobility, can be easily moved throughout the lab as needed. Lower power consumption - a key consideration in lab deployment. Quieter fans - reduced lab noise. Manual cabling presents many challenges and inhibits automation Infrastructure automation Remote access to test sets, network simulation equipment, and DUTs is nullified by having to locally configure the physical layer. Simulation of certain network failure conditions and cable breaks are imprecise or impossible. Integrate with existing automation systems Realize full potential of test automation platforms "}
