How do we move forward? Phillip Baker (presenting Alessandro Introduction: United Nations member states recently proclaimed 2016 -2025 as the Decade of Action on Nutrition. The challenge now is to convert this high- level commitment into a sustained mobilization of supranational, national and sub - national political sy stems, institutions and policy processes for improved nutrition. This study aims to understand what factors might generate or impede political priority for nutrition at these levels over the coming decade. Methods: We conducted a realist systematic review of empirical studies published since 1990 that have investigated political priority for nutrition. Studies were identified through a search of academic databases and websites of relevant international organizations. Findings were extracted and summarized by qualitative synthesis. Results: A diversity of interacting factors shape political priority for nutrition in context dependent ways. For example, priority to address undernutrition in some developing countries has been hampered by inter alia the low po wer of nutrition actors, limited institutional capacities, low consensus about the problems causes and solutions, and the limited visibility and complexity of the issue. Studies in high- income countries suggest that actions to tackle obesity have been cons trained by, among other factors, the complexity of the issue, the potential for confrontations with powerful industries, and institutional environments unsupportive of regulatory interventions. Conclusions: A diversity of interacting factors generate political priority for nutrition in ways that are contingent and context dependent. A more complete understanding of these factors can inform more strategic actions by nutrition advocates and policy decision -makers.

This is due to the region's recognized agriculture potential to supply most of Ghana's staple foods such as maize, yam, cocoyam, cassava, plantain, rice and others. However, farmers in the region are increasingly s hifting towards cash crops production such as cashew, mango, citrus and teak. These new engagements involve the conversion of existing food cropland into cash crop plantations, and are being driven by several processes across different scales. This paper w ill critically analyze these multi- scalar processes and will outline some of the outcomes associated with the current commodification of agriculture in Wenchi and Kintampo municipalities of the Brong Ahafo Region. Adopting qualitative methods including in -depth face -to-face interviews, focus group discussions, oral history interviews and farm- based observations and situated within the analytical lens of political ecology, the study brings into current global agrarian and food discourses the drivers and impacts of the increasing commodification of local agriculture in Ghana. Findings indicate that shifting towards the production of agriculture commodities in the Brong Ahafo Region is reducing food production and supply in Ghana. In order to avoid these impacts, the paper concludes by arguing for the need for government with development partners to increase support to food crop farmers in other parts of Ghana to scale -up food production.

S Booth (presenting author), 1 C Pollard,2 C Silic, J Jancey, B Mackintosh, A Mukhtar, A Begley, J Lewis, M Caraher, J Wright, D Kerr Background: Increasing individuals and families seek food relief in Western Australia with emergency relief services unable to meet demand. There are 10000 homeless in WA and 300 in inner city Perth. Little is known about how the charitable food sector (CFS) meets their users' food needs. Methods: In January 2016, 101 direct service recipients were recruited through adult homeless drop in centers and soup kitchens. Flyers delivered by staff or volunteers invited participation in a 38 item self -administere d food survey. If needed, recipients were given food/drink as well as a $10 cash payment for their time. Descriptive statistics are reported. Results/findings: Nine years was the average length of using CFS. Seventy -six percent were food insecure with hunger, 16% without hunger and 8% were food secure. Almost monthly over the last year 36% did not eat for a whole day because they could not afford food. Most were male (79%), 20% female and one transgender, aged 22 to 79 years, 20% were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, 70% were born in Australia/NZ. Half had completed high school and 14% University. Half had diagnosed health conditions, 35% had diagnosed mental health issues. Healthy food (90%), cooked meals (81%), water (79%), cutlery (75%) and food at the correct temperature were important for CFS to provide. Respondents were grateful and wanted access to a laundry, shower, toiletries and clean clothes. Conclu sions: The current CFS system does not meet the needs of its recipients. A system -wide respon se is required to the determinants and outcomes of food insecurity.

Food production is labor intensive, and the location of the work, and the type of work required to produce most kinds of foods mean that food industries often find it hard to attract sufficient and suitably qualified workers. In this paper we explain some recent labor supply issu es in the Australian vegetable industry, including the visa pathways for migrant workers, the practices of labor hire companies, and the challenges of regulating employment practices. This paper considers how marketization and legislative and policy regim es impede access to a sustainable food supply. We will present results from a recent survey we have conducted for Horticulture Innovation Australia in relation to horticultural growers experiences of employing workers to pick, pack and grade vegetables. From the results of the survey, we highlight key issues related to the sustainability of horticultural food production. We also consider ethical considerations in the use of migrant labor , and the relationship between labor supply and the viability of regional communities in Australia.

Even a brief consideration of the UN Sustainable Development Goals reveals the interconnectedness of food and nutrition security (SDG 2) with the other 16 SDGs. Food and agriculture contribute more to our environmental footprint than transport or energy, and food insecurity and malnutrition are the leading cause of non-communicable disease epidemics. Poverty reduction, gender equity and sustainable consumption all depend to a large extent on food and nutrition security. The governance of food s ystems is growing more complex, less transparent, and vulnerable to power concentrations. The first paradigm shift is one away from reductionist thinking and towards system thinking. This shift includes a focus on outcomes rather than disciplines, working across sectors, and new modes of research partnerships. Future food and nutrition security will not be achieved simply by increasing production of food. Producers, processors, retailers, and importantly consumers, will play a more active role in reducing environmental impacts, improving health outcomes, and modifying demand for food. Consumer concerns over health, sustainability and the ethics of food systems will challenge traditional drivers of food purchasing behavior such as price, convenience, and tas te. Governments, industry and regulators will need to keep pace with more informed food citizens. The second paradigm shift is the rise of the consumer in shaping future food systems. Responsible consumption will be central to future sustainable and just f ood systems.

Nutritional quali ty of fish varies according to species, size, their food sources, and the environments in which they are produced. A global shift away from diverse capture species, towards consumption of a select few farmed species has implications for nutrition, which are yet to be explored. We conduct temporal analyses, using nationally representative household income and expenditure surveys corresponding to this transition in Bangladesh (1991 -2010); of fish consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture, and associa ted nutrient intakes from fish. We find that people are consuming more fish in total, with a declining proportion from capture fisheries, and a growing proportion from aquaculture. Whilst total fish consumption has increased by 30%, intakes of iron and calcium from fish have significantly declined (by 15% and 14% respectively, P<0.01), and intakes of zinc, vitamin A and vitamin B12 have remained unchanged. The only likely explanation for this lower overall nutritional quality of fish consumed over time, is the growing proportional contribution of farmed fish species, which have been shown to be lower in micronutrients. Our results highlight unintended negative consequences of policy decisions which are narrowly focused on maximizing production and productivi ty of food systems. Indicators used in the monitoring and evaluation of agricultural interventions must go beyond these measures, to also consider nutritional quality. As aquaculture becomes an increasingly important food source for many, it must embrace a nutrition- sensitive approach, and promote diverse production systems.

Whether the world's growing demand for food can be satisfied has been the subject of much discussion. Alongside this debate about food security, is of course the discussion about how to safeguard food safety and food sustainability. In this context, agricultural innovation and technology are particularly critical. But do Australia's in tellectual property laws provide an appropriate framework for incentivizing investment in research and development, without stifling innovation and collaboration? The timeliness of this issue is highlighted by the Productivity Commission's ongoing inquiry into Australia's intellectual property laws. In its draft report on 29 April 2016, the Productivity Commission recommended extensive changes to Australia's intellectual property laws. This session will consider in particular Australia's patent laws and sui generis plant breeder's rights scheme, examining the protections and challenges under these regimes and analyzing the effects these have had on investor confidence and ease (or lack of ease) in commercialization by drawing on practical examples, particula rly in the context of GMOs, bioprospecting and AgriTech developments.

Objective: To investigate recent trends in intake of total sugars, added sugars and SSB in Australia using recent multiple , independent datasets. Design: A comparison of relevant data published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Australian government, academia and industry. Results: FAOStat food balance sheets for Australia show per capita cons umption of sugars and sweeteners fell 16% from 152 g/capita/day in 1980 to 127 g/capita/day in 2011 (p for trend = 0.001). In national dietary surveys in 1995 and 2011 -12, added sugars intake declined by 18% in adult males (from 72 to 59 g/day) and by 3% in females (from 44 to 42 g/day, NS). As a proportion of total energy, added sugars fell by 8% in adult males (from 10.0 to 9.2%) but non -significantly in adult females (~9.0%). The proportion of energy from SSB (including juice) declined by 10% in adult males and 21% in females. Similar changes were observed in children 2 -18 y. National grocery sales data showed that added sugars derived from carbonated soft drinks fell 22% between 1997 and 2011, from 23 g/capita/day to 17 g/capita/day. Conclusion: In Aus tralia, 3 independent datasets confirm a decline in the availability and intake of added sugars including those contributed by SSB.

Unfortunately, however, most of these were not implemented. In the years that followed, several jurisdictions developed Aboriginal n utrition policies and strategies, most notably, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nutrition Strategy and Action Plan 2000 -2010 (NATSINSAP). The objective of this research was to examine the extent to which food and nutrition issues have be en prioritized in national Aboriginal health policies and strategies published since 2000. Australian Government websites were searched for Aboriginal- specific health policy documents. A combination of quantitative content analysis and qualitative framing analysis were used to examine the trends in prioritization of Aboriginal nutrition over time. We observed increased and more comprehensive inclusion of food and nutrition issues in Aboriginal health policy during the first half of the period examined, with much emphasis placed on the structural barriers to healthy eating. In later years, however, nutrition appears to have been reframed as a \"lifestyle\" risk factor and is predominantly addressed through health information and education strategies. Nutrition was almost completely absent from the COAG Closing the Gap agenda which, instead, devoted resources to 'Tackling Smoking'. We propose that the contribution of poor nutrition to burden of disease has been inconsistently reflected in national Aboriginal health policy. Whether action to improve nutrition will be renewed through the implementation of the new National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan remains to be seen.

Analysis of the policy processes for developing new standards governing food labels provides a window into the capacity for government, industry and values -based NGOs to s hape the choices available to consumer- citizens via the information on labels, and thus to influence the shape of the food system itself. This paper analyses the development of the proposal for Australia's new national information standard for free range e gg labeling. It uses publicly available policy documents and consultation submissions to make visible the contestation and conflict between key stakeholders as they engaged in a battle for the meaning of free range between industrial scale and smaller scale free range systems. The new information standard is to be made under the Australian Consumer Law and was initially framed as addressing consumer concerns about misleading labeling of free range eggs by some egg producers. However, the egg industry was ab le to reframe the policy problem from a problem of \"consumer uncertainty\" to a problem of \"industry uncertainty\", arguing that the problem had been created by the consumer regulator's attempts to define free range. The proposed new labelling standard will define free range eggs in terms of existing industrial scale free range production systems, and the paper discusses the implications of the new information standard for animal welfare and consumer choice, raising questions about the extent to which Australian consumers are able to 'vote' with their shopping dollar for higher animal welfare.

The case for South Africa Karen Charlton (presenting author) ,1 Lisa Ware,2 Jeanine Baumg artner,3 NCD reduction recommend consumption of <5g salt/day. In 2016, South Africa was the first country to introduce legislation for maximum salt levels in processed foods, estimated to red uce salt intake by 0.85g/person/day, preventing an estimated 11700 CVD events/yr. South Africa's universal salt iodization (USI) fortification progr am has successfully eradicated iodine deficiency. The need to simultaneously monitor both sodium reduction a nd iodine status is required to ensure compatibility of the two strategies. Methods: Using a nested cohort design within WHO's 2015 Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE), randomly selected adults (n=1200) provided 24 -hour and spot urine samples for sodium and iodine (UIC) analysis, respectively. Median UIC and 24hr iodine excretion were by salt intakes within desirable 5g salt/day), 37% had high values (5 -9g MUIC was 116 \u00b5g/L (IQR=57- (100 \u00b5g/L). Both UIC and 24hr iodine excretion differed ac ross urinary Na categories and were positively correlated with urinary of 5- 9g/d and >9g/d, respectively (P<0.001) sodium and iodine within a nationally representative cohort study allows simultaneous assessment of compatibility of salt reduction strategies and USI Presenting author bio: Associate Professor Charlton is a nutritional epidemiologist and accredited practicing dietitian who teaches community and public health nutrition at the University of Wollongong.

This study sought to advance obe sity prevention policy research and practice by applying theories of the policy process to study decision -making within the Healthy Together Victoria (HTV) context. Through analysis of documents, interviews with policy makers and direct observations, this qualitative study aimed to gain a better understanding of the influences on policy decision -making for various HTV policies including: the Achievement Program quality improvement framework and associated benchmarks; the LiveLighter social marketing campaig n; and Jamie's Ministry of Food cooking skills program. Multiple theories of the policy process were used to elucidate a comprehensive understanding of the influences on the policy system influences. The findings identified a number of key influences on HTV policy decision -making including key stakeholder or interest groups, technical feasibility of policy options, issue and solution framing, timing and broader socio - political factors. The results also demonstrated how these influences interacted to enable or prohibit the identified obesity prevention policies being adopted. The qualitative findings were also used to develop causal loop diagrams of the policy systems as a way to provide a conceptual framework of obesity prevention policy processes to help id entify potential ways to intervene to influence policy decision- making. Hence, the results can inform public health policy makers and practitioner s advocacy efforts for improving obesity prevention policy.

Increasingly, researchers and policymakers are turning their attention to how we might more effect ively govern the food system to manage the 'double burden'. In this paper I argue that we must begin with the lived experience of injustice within the food system if our policies are to meet their public health potential. To that end, I present a synthesis of Miranda Fricker's (2007) account of epistemic injustice and understandings of injustice as capability deprivation (Wolff and de -Shalit 2007). I argue that a failure to recognize , listen to, and make space for lived experience in food systems policy and practice severely limits our ability to affect positive change in the lives of the disadvantaged. And, in certain circumstances, our failure to listen may inadvertently reproduce the inequalities we seek to address. To finish, I suggest some strategies th at can help us embed practices of listening to lived experience in food systems research and practice.

This paper explores this question using examples of physical harms associated with under -controlled aspects of food manufacturing and sale. Drawing on examples from USP Food Fraud database, the paper examines risks and harms connected with false description of geographical origin; production methods; presence or absence of ingredients or substances; species or variety; and functionality, novelty or purity. Australia's food safety regulatory syste m controls risks of physical harm from the 'contamination' of food by targeting known hazards injurious to health. The production of 'safe' and 'suitable' food is the aim of risk management methodology such as hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) . Food manufacturing processes deemed medium to high -risk must implement and comply with HACCP against specific criteria. The criteria reflect the risk of microbial growth and impact of physical harm from 'contamination' with microbiological, chemical or p hysical 'hazards'. The targeting of known 'contaminants' is not, however, a panacea for a safe food supply. Misrepresentation of the 'nature or substance' of foodstuffs also present risks of physical harm. This paper argues the HACCP dominated regulatory p aradigm is inadequate to prevent these risks, because its risk assessment criteria fail to address intentional contamination and/or false description of foodstuffs by persons motivated to cause harm or economic gain. In addition to HACCP, measures for food defense and to avoid food fraud are necessary. Current legal definitions constrain the full implementation of systematic controls that reduce the risk and impact of harm in the globalized , complex food supply maze of the 21st century.

Conflicting interests are one of the main barriers to sustainably improving food security. The role of governments to protect consumers, for example from aggressive marketing not only of breastmilk substitutes but also other foods high in salt, sugar and fat , is becoming increasingly critical. Protecting children from such mark eting is in line with the Convention of the Rights of the Child. Global, regional and national action plans to protect and promote optimal infant and young child feeding practices, to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases (NCD) and to reduce the double burden of malnutrition, include recommendations for countries to safeguard public health interests from improper influence by any form of real, perceived or potential conflict of interest . This presentation will outline regional activities to support countries in identifying and managing conflict of interest in food policy development and implementation to enable countries to promote, protect and support healthy diets.

Wide variation in salt content across countries identifies a need for better regulation of the food industry to reduce salt in processed foods Clare Farrand (presenting author), 1 Karen Charlton (co-presenter),2 Jacqui Webster (co-presenter)3 Reducing salt intake is one of the most cost- effective public health interventions to reduce global burden of noncommunicable disease (NCDs); by lowering blood pressure, thereby reducing the risk of stroke and heart disease deaths. Processed foods contribute ~80% of salt to diet in developed countries, and are increasingly becoming a major source of salt in developing countries, as they becomes more widely available. Consumption of instant noodles is particularly high in cou ntries in the Asia Pacific region, due to widespread availability, high convenience and low cost, and thus a significant contributor to salt intake. The aim of this study was to compare the salt content of instant noodles sold worldwide to identify potenti al for reformulation, as a means to reduce population level salt consumption. Data collected for 765 instant noodle products from 10 countries identified high and varied salt levels, both within and between countries. China had the highest mean salt content (4.86g/100g; range = 2- 8g/100g) while New Zealand had the lowest (2g/100g; range = 0.6- 5.9gg/100g). Average pack size ranged from 57g in Costa Rica to 98g in China. The average packet of noodles contribute between 35% (New Zealand) and 95% (China) of WHO recommended daily salt intake, <5g. 33% of products met the Pacific Island Salt Reduction Targets, and 20% met the UK 2017 Salt targets. This study emphasizes the need for rigorous reformulation efforts, and better regulation of the salt content of common ly consumed processed foods as a means to reduce population level salt consumption. Whether regulation should be voluntary or legislated merits further discussion.

Megan Ferguson Brimblecombe5 Background: Store food policy aimed at improving health outcome s has an important role in remote Indigenous communities. Policy analysis can help underpin efforts to improve health through the food supply and inform broader policy development. Methods: Retailers, nutritionists and other professionals identified using a snowball sampling methodology, participated in semi -structured interviews to identify policy development processes in relation to food pricing strategies to improve health outcomes. Interviews were audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim. Relevant docum ents were sourced or provided by participants. Thematic analysis was conducted by two authors. Results: 44 participants in the Northern Territory and Queensland participated in 2015- 16. Single policy ideas were generally considered rather than a suite of potential options. Policies were primarily developed by retailers, at times with nutrition expertise; Indigenous leaders were primarily the approver. There was often a reasoned approach to policy development and review; largely informed by a broad strategy or intent to improve health, and forms of retail evidence in addition to benchmarking against other remote stores. Gaps in evidence were reported to be, drivers of purchasing including household expenditure and income capacity, and evidence of impact. The criteria used in policy development described by participants were: feasible, sustainable, acceptable, important and effective; unintended consequences were not considered or thought to be too challenging to incorporate into decision -making. Conclusion: Store policy development processes are likely to be strengthened through engaging a range of stakeholders, applying policy development criteria and addressing evidence gaps.

Carers of this vulnerable group of people play an important role in the provision of food. Many people with ID have significant co -morbidities, are at risk of overweight and obesity and malnutrition. There has been little Australian research of the dietary intake of people with ID living in group homes and no studies about the carers ' understanding of food provision. Aims: To assess the food and nutrition intake of people with ID living in group homes in an urban area of Australia, and explore decisions of carers related to food provision. Method: The diets of 33 adults with ID living in group homes were investigated. Carers were interviewed about food provision practices (n=17). Dietary data was analyzed and interviews explored for key themes. Results: Diets of participants were generally poor, with more than 40% consuming diets less than Estim ated Average Requirements for key micronutrients. There was low consumption of core foods including vegetables, fruit, and dairy foods. Most carers (76%) had high school or TAFE/trade qualifications, and whilst possessing an appreciation about the importance of good nutrition, carers were limited in their understanding about how to implement the provision of healthy food in practice. Conclusion: There is an immediate need to develop improved organizational protocols and other strategies for provision of h ealthier foods in group homes, and to support staff. People with ID and their families should guide such developments.

The objective of the study was to examine the potential for multi -sectoral action to suppo rt consumer adoption of H&S food behaviors through three themes: 1) Multi -sectoral understandings of H&S food behaviors ; 2) Roles and responsibility for multi -sectoral action on H&S behaviors ; and 3) Barriers and enablers to multi- sectoral action. We undertook 29 semi -structured interviews with representatives of key government, food industry and non -government organizations (NGOs) actors in food -related health and environment sectors in Australia. There was consensus on the need for multi -sectoral action but diverse views on how such action should be achieved. Enablers were considered to be individual champions and organizational leadership; early and sustained multi -sectoral engagement; agreements on common objectives with concrete deliverables; a nd sector specific levers for action. The different actors outlined various modes of governance that could help develop multi -sectoral action to support H&S food behaviors . These included: co -regulation between public -private actors; self - regulation (such as voluntary codes); statutory measures (e.g. fiscal regulation or mandatory labelling); incentive based structures (e.g. market incentives) and network governance. There is a disconnect between the urgent calls for a shift to H&S food behaviors by many international agencies and researchers, and the benign responses by many Australian food system actors. The findings identify opportunities to move beyond the prevailing consumer demand driven approach and develop multi -sectoral action to support adoption of H&S food behaviors .

These changes affect population diets, and raise concerns about undernutrition, obesity and non- communicable diseases, by altering the local availability, nutritional quality, price and desirability of foods. Underpinning these changes has been the growing capacity of multinationals to influence global regulatory standard -setting processes as well as limits on fiscal support for primary production in ways that meet their goals of market access. Some scholars have argued that the control over the production of food has shifted from the farmers to big agri- food businesses and transnational manufacturing and retail companies, removing power from local producers, consumers and policy -makers. Drawing on an analysis of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement and interviews with Australian government, public interest NGOs, and businesses, this paper will explore two questions 'what does nutritious trade and inves tment policy look like?' and 'what are the arrangement s necessary to make it happen?'

As the debate on the most appropriate and desirable governance model continues, there have been calls for the esta blishment of a global fund for NCDs along the lines of the Global Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as for a convention on NCDs modelled on the much hailed Framework Convention for Tobacco Control . These calls refer to examples of two high ly contrasting models of global health governance that we define as the Global Health Initiative Model and the Convention/Strategy Model. Each has a different strategy at its core and represents a different response to key normative challenges that are said to plague global governance - participation, scope of action, balancing power, legitimacy and effectiveness. In this paper we review these rival models and argue that, even as the current structure of the Global Coordinating Mechanism for NCDs within the WHO becomes entrenched, without addressing these normative challenges a risk of discontent and subsequent poli cy ineffectiveness can remain. We propose that by asking five basic questions of governance models as they emerge and are established, potential benefits and pitfalls can be identified: 1) Who makes decisions? 2) What, do they make decisions about? 3) How are decisions made? 4) How is this process legitimized? 5) How can this contribute to sustained political priority for NCDs?

Most stakeholders agree that the governance arrangements for food and agriculture need to be improved if humanity is going to overcome the persistent and emerging challenges facing world food security. Currently, disparate norms, regulations and institutional frameworks intersect with agriculture and influence the contributions agriculture makes to food security. This presentation provides a systematic analysis of the regulato ry instruments that intersect with agriculture from land, soil, water through to external in -puts and trade. To conduct this analysis, a rights -based approach to food security is employed and developed as a vehicle for operationalizing the values that should ground global food and agricultural governance.

Unprecedented availability of processed foods is a key driver of obesity and diet - related conditions. Front -of-pack interpretive nutrition labelling (INL) is recommended by WHO to promote healthier diets. Initiatives are proliferating globally, but there remain significant differences in approaches taken. Objective: To develop a typology of IN L policies of utility to policymakers exploring similar measures to promote healthy diets. Methodology: A systematic review of published and grey literature was supplemented by targeted questionnaires sent to policy leaders. Core characteristics of each policy were extracted and categorised according to a pre -defined framework. Results: Two thirds of the eighteen schemes identified were initiated by national governments. Guiding consumer choice was the most common explicit objective, though at least one third also identified product reformulation as a goal. Common features include use of colour (n=9), symbols (12), words (12) and numerals (9). Thirteen included an evaluative component: five displayed scores on a spectrum, whereas eight were binary. Among binary schemes, six conveyed a positive endorsement (e.g. 'healthier choice'), whereas two were negative (e.g. warning label). Fourteen of the schemes were voluntary, whereas five had at least some mandatory component. The first initiative (Swedish keyhole ) was implemented in 1989, with the majority of policies implemented 2011 -16. Discussion: Policymakers have several options in implementing INL to promote healthier diets. If an international standard is developed, it should look beyond evidence of consum er use to which kind of label best initiates a food systems response.

However, over the last decade a third purpose has emerged. Around the world, se veral jurisdictions have introduced food regulations that aim to prevent diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by imposing mandatory nutrient limits in processed foods. Governments in more than 30 countries have now regulated to limit saturated fats , trans -fats (TFAs) and sodium in certain foods. These regulations represent a radical shift in prevention strategies for diet -related NCDs, as they seek to change the food supply rather than dietary behaviors . In theory, this is an effective strategy fo r improving population diets, as it operates upstream in the food supply, and so can minimize the unevenly distributed social and behavioral determinants of unhealthy diets. However, mandatory nutrient limits have not previously been examined as a group, o r their possible future applications mapped. This paper firstly presents findings on the prevalence, distribution and features of mandatory nutrient limits around the world. Through the case study of sodium regulation in South Africa, it then examines th e logistics of introducing such regulations. By presenting empirical research on the effectiveness and acceptability of mandatory nutrient limits, this paper seeks to move beyond the usual debates about paternalism in nutrition regulation.

This structural power enables the beverage industry to position itself as part of the solution to health concerns about their products. This paper examines how the Australian soft drink industry has made material and structural changes to their beverage portfolios in response to a range of consumer and public health co ncerns. We identify two key reformulation strategies to address health concerns about soft drinks: e nergy reduction aims to reduce the kilojoule and sugar content of beverages; in contrast, naturalization aims to make beverages more \"natural\" through the s ubstitution of natural for artificial ingredients. While historically these concerns have been addressed separately, this analysis finds that the Australian beverage industry is now attempting to simultaneously respond to consumer concerns about kilojoule s and artificial sweeteners though the use of the natural sweetener stevia. This paper argues that both strategies promote the neoliberal value of personal responsibility while legitimizing the inclusion of the beverage industry as a stakeholder in solutio ns to public health problems. Presenting author bio: Jennifer's research examines the effects of soft drink companies' activity in research, product reformulation, advertising and policy development on public health.

Food regulatory systems (FRS) will play a significant role in shaping the environment within which the supply of and demand for food will takes place over this coming decade. This research aimed to assess the quality of the FRS in terms of protecting and promoting public health and critically analyze how and why this assessment occurs. The Donabedian model for defining and improving health service quality was applied to assess the performance of the structural, procedural and outcomes of the Australian and New Zealand FRS and identify explanations for this per formance. The investigation found that opportunities for the system to protect and promote public health are not being sufficiently realized . Multiple causes for this system failure were identified. Structurally, the FRS suffers from conflicting representa tion on decision- making committees and the separation of science and policy -making arms. From a process perspective, these structural problems manifest in diminished transparency and public engagement. Outcomes include policies and standards that are readi ly exploitable by food manufacturers to construct and then market ultra -processed food products revealing that perversely the FRS is itself contributing to the propagation of a food supply environment inconsistent with dietary guideline recommendations. Paradoxically, these same policies and standards provide less opportunity for primary food producers to innovate and promote nutritious whole foods. The embedding of FRS within microeconomic reform agendas provides a powerful explanation for these findings. Presenting author bio: Mark is Professor of Public Health Nutrition at Deakin University.

Supporting Indigenous Australians living in remote communities to consume more fruit and vegetables is an important measure to achieve population health gains. Fiscal policies, in the form of incentivized healthy food subsidies, have been demonstrated internationally to be a cost -effective means to achieve population health gains in low income groups, by increasing healthy and decreasing unhealthy food purchasing. This feasibility study investigated use of a direct- to-consumer subsidy in a remote Australian Aboriginal community, in the form of a $10 monetary -incentive fo r fruit and vegetable purchases. A pre -post point- of-sale analysis measuring population purchasing patterns and a thematic analysis measuring customer satisfaction were conducted. Voucher redemption rates averaged 30% and peaked when fresh produce was wel l merchandised, suggesting potential benefits in employing retail merchandising techniques as a key strategy for store -based fruit and vegetable promotion initiatives. At a population level, no effect on purchasing of fruit and vegetables was evident, howe ver community member feedback suggested the offer only effectively reached certain segments of the population, such as women with children. These results suggest potential benefits in tailoring healthy food promotion strategies towards distinct consumer gr oups, just as big business target marketing efforts toward identified groups. The cost -benefit of tailoring fiscal measures to promote equitable access to nutritious foods towards identified priority target groups should be a focus of future research.

However relevant systematic reviews are lacking. We searched 19 bibliographic databases and organization's websites systematically (2002 -2013) to identify content and evaluation of national nutrition policies in OECD countries. Quality was assessed; data were extracted and synthesized. Of 34 nations, 30 nutrition policies and 26 policy evaluation s (including 4 economic evaluations) were identified for 21 countries. Nutrition policy actions focused on \"education\" promoting healthy eating; <40% included contemporary social marketing; none incorporated 'eat less' messaging other than for salt. 26% in cluded voluntary, self- regulatory controls on marketing to children; only 3 were mandatory. 35% included voluntary food labelling and <30% product reformulation. 83% covered food supply in school and/or health settings; <25% targeted unhealthy food. <15% m entioned environmental sustainability. Only 18% addressed food environments more broadly. Those targeting vulnerable groups included children (78%), breastfeeding/infants (57%), pregnant/lactating women (48%), low socioeconomic groups (44%) the elderly (9%). Most fiscal interventions were formative; <16% employed differential taxation or subsidies. Only 35% contained measurable targets. Most intended to monitor dietary intake and health outcomes; none included monitoring food environments. Regulatory an d legislative reforms such as fiscal measures, mandatory advertising restrictions and nutrition labelling were identified as the most cost - effective approaches, but were included rarely. The cost effective approaches identified have clear implications for Australian nutrition policy.

Amanda Lee (presenting author), 1 Sarah Kane,2 Meron Lewis3 Fiscal policies may help improve population diets bu t standardized food pricing methods to inform decisions are lacking. We developed and validated methods consistent with those proposed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non -communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS). We asse ssed the price, relative price and affordability of current and healthy (recommended) diets in Australia. 'Current diets' were constructed using data from the recent Australian Health Survey and 'healthy diets' from Australian Dietary Guidelines models. Fo od prices were collected in all stores in randomly selected areas of SEIFA quintiles in two capital cities. Diet costs under potential policy scenarios were compared with household incomes. Results show that households spent the majority (58%) of their cur rent food budget on unhealthy, energy -dense choices, including take -away foods (14%) and sugar sweetened beverages (4%) as confirmed by ABS analysis of household consumption data. Healthy diets cost 15% less than current diets and 31% of the disposable inc ome of low socioeconomic households. These would become unaffordable under proposed changes to expand 10% goods and services tax (GST) to include basic healthy foods. However, retaining exemptions and increasing GST rate may help improve food security. Res ults suggest that healthy diets can be more affordable than current diets, but other factors may be as important as price in determining food choice. Expanding the base of the GST is not a good idea for food security or health.

This study examined impact of efforts to improve nutrition and food supply on Anangu Pitj antjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in Central Australia from 1986. Multiple methods were employed including systematic document searches. Dietary intake of the five APY communities that have a Mai Wiru (good food) store was quantified by the store -turnover method. The price of a basket of basic foods, implementation of nutrition policy requirements and healthy food checklists were assessed in all APY communities at intervals from 2012. Results were compared with previous available data. Concerted effo rts resulted in marked achievements including decreased intake of sugar, increased availability and affordability of healthy foods (particularly fruit and vegetables) and consequent improvement in some nutrient intakes. Yet, the overall effect has been a d ecrease in total diet quality since 1986, characterised by increased supply of unhealthy products high in saturated fat, added sugar and salt, particularly sugar sweetened beverages, convenience meals and take -away foods. Improvements confirm that residing in remote communities can help Aboriginal residents exert control over key aspects of the food system. However, the overall findings reflect broader changes to the broader Australian food supply and reinforce the notion that, in the absence of supportive regulation and market intervention, adequate and sustained resources are required to improve nutrition, prevent and manage diet -related disease on the APY Lands. The study also provides insights into food systems affecting other remote communities, wider Australia and global communities.

Olstad IJ Nykiforuk,6 Kylie Ball7 This systematic review examined the impact of universal policies on socioeconomic inequities in obesity, dietary and physical activity behaviors amongst adults and children. PRISMA- Equity guidelines were followed. Database searches spanned 2004 to August, 2015. Eligible studie s assessed the impact of universal policies on anthropometric, dietary or physical activity -related outcomes in adults or children according to socioeconomic position . Thirty -six studies were included. Policies were classified as agentic, agento -structural or structural, and their impact on inequities was rated as positive, neutral, negative, or mixed according to the dominant associations observed. Most policies had neutral impacts on obesity -related inequities regardless of whether they were agentic (60% neutral), agento -structural (68% neutral), or structural (67% neutral). The proportion of positive impacts was similar across policy types (10% agentic, 18% agento -structural, 11% agentic, 14% ag ento -structural, 22% structural). The majority of associations remained neutral when stratified by participant population, implementation level, socioeconomic position measures, and by anthropometric and behavioral outcomes. Fiscal measures had consisten tly neutral or positive impacts on inequities. Findings suggest an important role for policy in addressing obesity in an equitable manner and strengthen the case for implementing a broad complement of policies spanning the agency -structure continuum.

Last year there were 81 food recalls, almost double the level of 2013 (mainly due to a hike in undeclared allergens). In Australia there is a well - established Food Industry Protocol for managing recalls. Companies are expected to have a Recall Plan in place and are also expected to test their Recall Plans on an annual basis. Unfortunately mock recalls are often limited to traceability exercises. This is an important element of the investigation stage but skips many of the more complex ch allenges of a real recall. This presentation will describe a more effective and comprehensive process for recall simulations, as well as discussing some of the challenges regarding the process of export recalls, which can be especially problematic due to a lack of published information on recall protocols.

Global consensus is clear that policy and environmental supports in retail food environments are essential to promote healthier diets and reduce the burden of noncommunicable diseases and obesit y. In this paper, we explore entrepreneurialism as social changemaking for health promotion in retail food environments, focusing on small food businesses. Small businesses face structural barriers within food systems. However, conceptual work in multiple disciplines and evidence from promising health interventions tested in small stores suggests that these retail places may have a dual role in health promotion: settings to strengthen regional economies and social networks, and consumer environments to support healthier diets. We will discuss empirical examples of entrepreneurialism based on two sets of in - depth interviews we conducted with public health intervention champions in Toronto, Canada, and food entrepreneurs and city -region policy actors in St. John's, Canada. We will explore the practices, qualities, and enablers of entrepreneurialism, and examine the implications for population health and policy. We contend that entrepreneurialism is important to understand on its own, and also as a dimensio n of population health intervention context. A growing social scientific literature offers a multifaceted lens through which we might consider entrepreneurialism for public and population health. We will look at how entrepreneurs as agents with formal and informal authority convey normative frameworks as well as act practically within change processes, shaping conditions for health -promoting environmental shifts.

Prior to joining FSANZ, Glen was with the New Zeala nd Ministry for Primary, and it s previous incarnations for nearly 15 years , where he held a range of food and biosecurity regulatory management roles. Glen started his career as a Health Protection Officer in South Auckland w here he focus ed on food compliance issues including foodborne illness outbreaks. Prior to starting with government he did a two year consultancy stint assisting a New Zealand supermarket chain with implement ing their in -store food safety system. 1 General Manager Food Standards, Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Food s afety r egulation in Southeast Asia under national and international law: Integrating consumer regulators in proliferating standardization projects Luke Nottage1 This paper explores food safety law in the ASEAN Economic Community, established over 2007- 15 with harmonization of agri- food standards as one priority action item. Private law and market mechanisms remain less pervasive than public regulation, includes ge neral food legislation in all ASEAN Member States. Yet enforcement is problematic. Independent food agencies are being created, especially for risk assessment functions, but other regulators are also increasingly involved. Ministries of commerce or trade g et involved because treaties now require science -based, proportionate regulation of import safety, preferably based on internationally agreed standards . Yet there is scope for consumer affairs regulators to become (more) involved, even though they may cons titute smaller and more recently created public authorities, because: They often have or share responsibility for enforcing food standards set by other departments; Consumer regulators may also be given a coordinating role, or \"back -up\" powers to regulate if a harmful food product falls outside the jurisdiction of other agencies; Consumer regulators may have powers to bring representative actions or order compensation on behalf of consumers harmed by non- compliant foods. Consumer regulators also develop helpful expertise in consumer behavior and risk communication more generally, which is valuable for law -making related also to food nutrition (i.e. \"healthy eating\") - a broader contemporary policy concern, including in Southeast Asia, than food safety (i. e. avoiding food -borne illnesses). Consumer regulators may also assist other authorities to develop effective oversight of \"food safety auditing\" by private inspectors in regional supply chains.

Christine Parker (presenting author),1 Rachel Carey,2 Gyorgy Scrinis3 \"Free -range\" labelling is the latest attempt to address concerns with intense, industrial -scale animal food production. This paper uses the example of meat chickens to critically examine the degree to which the market - and specifi cally \"free range\" and other higher animal welfare label claims - can be relied upon to govern animal welfare. We argue that Australia's two major supermarkets working together with RSPCA Assured have likely made some modest improvement in the baseline welfare of many (barn -based) broilers beyond the (fairly low) standards enforced by government primary industries departments. The potential for further improvement through \"free range\" labeling is however extremely limited. This is because the massive growth in the production and consumption of relatively cheap chicken meat in Australia and around the world is largely inconsistent with meaningful \"free range\" farming practices. Indeed governance via consumer choice is unable to effectively and legitimately re solve the multiplicative interacting challenges of animal justice, ecological impact, industrial justice and food safety posed by unprecedented growth in industrial scale, intensive farming of chickens. (In Australia production and consumption of chicken m eat has grown tenfold per capita since 1950, more than any other meat.) Massive changes to both farming practices and business models for food production will be needed and this can only be achieved if we can work out how to govern in a way that adequately recognizes the interconnected ecology of animals, eaters, producers and environments.

This presentation contends that much of the new disc ourse advocating the concept of food sovereignty dismisses the notion of food security too hastily. There is a tendency for food sovereignty advocates to equate 'food security' all too readily to ' big agriculture' solutions, which are presented in opposition to an alleged rights -based and locally -grounded notion of food sovereignty. However, 'food and nutrition security' has a much richer theoretical foundation than sometimes afforded in shorthand s ketches within the food sovereignty literature. In particular, it is intricately connected to rights -based concepts derived from the capabilities literatures of Amartya Sen, and from these perspectives, speak to broad conceptions of how food is positioned within human security. The presentation concludes with the observation that discourses of food sovereignty provide an effective means to alert researchers to control of the food system by large corporations, and the possibilities of alternative food system arrangements, but are nevertheless encumbered by an aspirational politics of food that diverts attention from the wider situational politics of peoples' lives.

Claire Pulker (presenting author), 1 Denise Chew Ching Li,2 Jane Scott,3 Christina Pollard4 Background: The Australian foo d regulatory system sets standards to protect public health and safety and government encourages voluntary measures to prevent inappropriate marketing. Food companies therefore have the potential to positively influence healthy food choices via corporate s ocial responsibility (CSR) initiatives. This research aimed to determine who parents believed was responsible for assisting them to select healthy family foods. Methods: Parents of children aged 2 -8 years were recruited from a consumer research panel. 90 -minute focus group discussions were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Discussions were audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed inductively to identify overall key themes. Themes relating to responsibility were also reported. Results: Five discussion groups (n=37) were conducted in 2015. Three main themes identified were: confusion over describing and identifying healthy foods, making compromises to meet the family's food needs, and contradiction over trust and control. Parents lacked trust in health messages from food manufacturers, media, and paid- for health schemes (e.g. Heart Foundation Tick). They believed government should assist them to identify healthy foods by setting clearer rules for food labelling across all foods. P arents felt supermarkets should assist them to find healthy foods when shopping, using strategies such as shelf labelling, but believed commercial constraints would prevent this from happening. Conclusions: Parents had difficulty describing and identifyi ng healthy packaged foods and regarded food industry CSR with skepticism. There were higher levels of trust in government and supermarkets which suggest these actors could do more to assist parents.

This has prompted calls for tighter restrictions on junk food marketing to young people, given the rising burden of childhood obesity and overweight globally. Most governments h ave responded by encouraging industry self -regulation, but national responses are marked by an increasing diversity of regulatory forms. This raises crucial questions about the effective design of regulatory controls, and the mechanisms by which the actors involved in regulation are held accountable for their performance in improving the food marketing environment. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the key forms of food marketing regulation in six jurisdictions, including the UK, US, Canada, Queb ec, and Australia. We developed a theoretical framework for effective food advertising regulation, drawing upon literature from the disciplines of publi c health and regulatory studies, and focusing on regulation's transparency and accountability. We used this framework to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each regime, and to explain why no current regime has been completely effective in reducing children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing. Our analysis f ound significant loopholes in the substantive terms of both public and private regulatory instruments, as well as limitations in the processes of monitoring, review, and enforcement that are established by each form of regulation. We conclude by arguing t hat the success of regulation may be more closely related to the design of regulatory rules and regulatory processes, than it is to the particular regulatory model used to restrict unhealthy food marketing to children.

To explore the dynamics of food security in economically developed countries, this paper considers domestic food security governance via responses to poverty, welfare entitlements and food relief. By comparing Norway's social democratic approach with Australia's light touch, neoliberal form of food security governance, the efficacy of two forms of welfare capitalism are evaluated. Whilst Norway's political agenda of agricultural support, food pricing regulation and universal social security support offers a robust, although indirect, safety net in ensuring entitlements to food, Australia's neoliberal trajectory means that approaches to food security are ad hoc and rely on a combination of self- help, charitable and market responses. Despite its extensive food production and food export, Australia appears less capable of ensuring food security for all its inhabitants compared to the highly import -dependent Norway.

Preliminary research demonstrates that fish consumption contributes largely to protein intake in the diet and fishing is necessary for subsistence and cash income. This study reviewed existing literature to assess whether increased availability of, and access to, fish improved household food security for Pacific Islanders. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken following the PRISMA guidelines. Three online academic databases were searched using a combination of keywords and limited to articles published between December 2004 and December 2014. Results: A total of nine studies were reviewed. The degree to which Pacific Islanders depended on fishing for household income and livelihood varied between and within PICTs. For more economi cally developed PICTs, such as Fiji, household income was derived increasingly from salaried work, where dependency on fishing has been declining. There was an overall lack of studies assessing strategies, such as fish aggregating devices (FADs), which may potentially improve fish availability and access. Conclusion: The review confirmed assumptions that fishing remains a major contributor to food security in PICTs through subsistence production and income generation. However, more research is needed to e xamine factors which affect availability of, and access to, fish. A coordinated approach is also needed amongst fisheries and health ministries to develop integrated policies to improve household food security through coastal fisheries management.

Some governments have used voluntary targets, new labelling schemes and taxes to achieve reformulation; and corporations have set their own nutrient standards and developed their own nutrient profiling systems. This paper will examine the limitations of these reformulation policies, particul arly in terms of their narrow definitions of food quality, the focus on particular food components, and the indirect strategies used to achieve reformulation.

This duty is more stringent for products that are consumed or ingested. However, to date in Canada, a duty has not been imposed on food manufacturers to warn consumers about the dangers of diet - related chronic diseases, such as obesity, associated with use of their products. A recent class -action in the province of Quebec, which held tobacco comp anies liable for failing to warn consumer of the dangers with cigarettes, is instructive for identifying the obligations that exist for food manufacturers. This presentation will begin with an overview of product liability law and the duty to warn in Canada. This will include a discussion of when warnings are required, what is considered an adequate warning, and what differentiates a warning from other information, such as nutrition panels. It will then reflect on how the judgment in Quebec influences what is expected of manufacturers who distribute products that are harmful to public health. It will argue that the Canadian jurisprudence makes it clear that manufacturers are not permitted to ignore, minimize, or counteract the risks others identify with thei r products, or work to neutralize or negate the public's understanding about the dangers in their products. It concludes with a discussion about the future of obesity litigation in Canada, and what this might mean for public health and the food system, both within Canada and globally.

It calls for a ban on all marketing of food and beverages to children age 16 and younger. Following his election in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his Minister of Health Mandate Letter, identified \"introducing new restrictions on the commercial marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children, similar to those now in place in Quebec\" as a top priority for protecting public health. In Quebec, the Consumer Protection Act prohibits, with some exceptions, all commercial advertising to children under thirteen years of age, although it does not explicitly contemplate unhealthy foods or beverages. In 1989, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the Quebec ban in the seminal case of Irwin Toy v Quebec , finding that the restriction was a constitutionally valid limitation on the freedom of expression, protected by section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This presentation examines w hether or not an advertising ban to children in Canada can overcome constitutional scrutiny. It begins with an overview of some of the recommended approaches, including the Ottawa Principles. It then examines the federal government's ability to restrict ad vertising. This is followed by an overview of the jurisprudence concerning the freedom of expression, including the decision in Irwin Toy. With this backdrop, it concludes that the Canadian government can legitimately restrict food and beverage advertising , and weighs the pros and cons associated with different approaches (e.g., the Ottawa Principles).

In the 19th century, land was allocated to working families in substitution for welfare and to ensure that constant rural - urban migration did not result in the los s of farming skills. Germany has a strong tradition of urban farming in kleingarten, the 'little gardens' that are woven into the fabric of German urban life. The UK has a similar history, with allotments being protected by legislation since the early 20th century, (Miller 2015). In both Germany and the UK, traditional urban farming has now dovetailed with contemporary community and 'guerrilla' gardening, (Follman and Viehoff 2015). Australia has no tradition of allotments. This is not a result of disinter est in private food production. On the contrary, we have a strong tradition in this regard, (Gaynor 2006), but as a result of our small population and plentiful space, we were able to produce food in our own private backyard 'allotments'. With consistent s tate policies of urban consolidation (Sherry 2013), the quarter acre block is becoming a distant memory, and now millions of Australians - apartment dwellers - have no private garden. In diametric opposition to decreasing growing space, people's motivation to grow their own food is increasing, raising the question of how we can satisfy people's desire for private food production in increasingly dense cities. Rather than reinvent the wheel, Australia could learn from the European tradition of urban farming in relation to two crucial issues. First, food production requires secure access and/or title to land. How do we secure that access or title, particularly in the face of alternative, extremely high value land -use such as high density development? Second, o nce land is secured, how can it be harmoniously and productively shared? Are there legal structures, such as unincorporated associations or even strata law that can assist people to regulate collectively -owned growing space? This paper will explore lessons that can be gleaned from German kleingarten and UK allotments. Presenting author bio: Cathy Sherry is a leading Australian expert on strata and community title, and high density cities. Cathy's research focuses on the social implications of property law, as well as optimal planning for children. Cathy has a special interest in urban farming and the challenges of providing growing space in high density cities. 1 Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales Food system governance for the common good: A research agenda to better understand current foo d system governance in Australia and its relationship to key 'common good' outcomes Kiah Smith (presenting author), 1 Greg Oliver,4 Henry Xu,5 Bill Bellotti,6 Grace Muriuki7 Transforming food governance has been identified as one of the most pressing challenges facing Australia's food system. Laws, policies, regulatory arrangements and multi -stakeholder relationships are complex, and tensions around public and private responsibilities, civic participation and policy (in)cohe rence are high. We cannot afford to govern food system activities (production, processing, packaging, distribution, retail and consumption) in isolation from food system outcomes (food and nutrition security, public health, environmental wellbeing, social wellbeing and ethics). From this perspective, governance is seen as both a challenge and a solution to improving Australia's future food system. This paper outlines an interdisciplinary research agenda focusing on food system governance for nutrition sec urity, public health, environmental wellbeing, social wellbeing and ethics. We ask: what is the relationship between current food system governance in Australia and these key 'common good' outcomes; and, what are the governance levers we could target to be tter facilitate these outcomes? To answer this question, two research themes are proposed, with corresponding sub- questions. First, what role does the current food governance system (i.e. the policies, institutions and processes by which governments, priva te actors and civic actors engage) play in shaping 'common good' outcomes? Second, the paper suggests how we might use participatory methodologies to identify more progressive spaces for 'good' food governance.

Law and policy which s eeks, as a public health intervention, to regulate food consumption invites normative objections including the claim that such laws and policies are paternalistic. In this paper I consider the paternalism critique, as it applies to US food welfare programs as a form of public health governance. Public health laws by definition have a 'population orientation', that is they are directed to the wellbeing of groups of people rather than to individuals. Individual people and households within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations can achieve healthy diets despite adversity; however in- kind food welfare measures are directed at the population level rather than at the level of the individual. Taking US food welfare law as a case study in this paper I consider how the 'trade -off' between public or collective good, and private rights or individual liberties, is managed when food welfare is delivered in -kind rather than delivered as cash. I argue that public health laws can be viewed as an imposition on individual consumer freedom to make self -harming choices, but also, importantly, as an imposition on the freedom of business practices to harm people.

Regulatory measures use d by governments offer a potentially effective response to this issue. Fearing public criticism, governments are often reluctant to use such measures. In the HealthyLaws study we undertook a comprehensive assessment of regulatory interventions to prevent c hildhood obesity which we presented to a descriptively representative and informed group of Australians. Methods: A citizens' jury, held in South Australia in April 2015, was asked to consider the question: What laws, if any, should we have in Australia to address childhood obesity? The jury was provided with systematically collected evidence of effectiveness of potential interventions, ethical and legal issues and community views (South Australian survey and focus groups). Results: The jury agreed that prevention of obesity was complex and required multifaceted government interventions. Recommendations fell into the areas of health promotion and education (n=4), regulation of food marketing (n=3), taxation/subsidies (n=2) and a parliamentary inquiry. Sc hool -based nutrition education and health promotion and mandatory front -of-pack interpretive labelling of food and drink were ranked 1 and 2 with taxation of high fat, high sugar food and drink third. Conclusion: The recommendations were similar to findings from other citizens' juries held in Australia suggesting that the reticence of decision makers in Australia, and potentially elsewhere, to use legislative and fiscal measures to address childhood obesity is misguided. Supporting relevant informed publi c discussion could facilitate a politically acceptable legislative approach.

However, regulation of nutrition labelling falls under the remit of not just the health sector but also trade . Methods: This paper presents an analysis of Specific Trade Concerns have been raised the World Trade Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee regarding interpretive nutrition labelling initiatives by Thailand, Chile, Indonesia, Peru a nd Ecuador, with reference to articles of the TBT Agreement. Results: Although nutrition labelling was identified as a legitimate policy objective, queries were raised regarding the justification of the specific labelling measures proposed, and the scien tific evidence for effectiveness of such measures. Concerns were also raised regarding the consistency of the measures with international standards. Drawing on policy learning theory, we identified four lessons for public health policy makers that arise fr om this analysis of discussions in the TBT Committee, including: strategic framing of policy objectives for interpretive nutrition labelling; pro -active policy engagement between trade and health to identify potential trade issues; minimize potential trade restrictiveness related to 'practical' concerns (e.g. size and costs of country -specific labelling requirements); and engagement with the Codex Alimentarius Commission to develop international guidance on interpretative labelling. Conclusion: Although there is potential for trade sector concerns to stifle innovation in nutrition labelling policy, care in how interpretive nutrition labelling measures are crafted in light of trade commitments can minimize such a risk and help Presenting author bio: Dr Anne Marie Thow is Senior Lecturer in Health Policy at the University of Sydney.

However, policy makers in low and middle income countries may perceive a conflict between food supply polici es to combat persistent undernutrition, and more recent recommendations for policies addressing rising rates of diet -related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This paper explores the potential to use policy space analysis to identify food supply policy oppo rtunities for addressing both undernutrition and diet- related NCDs, to support improved policy coherence. Methods: We conducted an exploratory policy space analysis to identify opportunities and constraints for integrated nutrition policy with respect to the food supply in India, where a dual burden of malnutrition has been well documented. We conducted a review of food supply policies, and 27 key informant interviews (16 nutrition policy stakeholders, 11 with policy makers and experts in food supply policy). Results: The analysis suggests several opportunities for an integrated food supply policy agenda, including targeting common foods of concern (such as highly processed foods) and foods that present common benefits (such as fruits and vegetables), and scaling up existing small- scale policy initiatives that support the availability of nutrient -rich foods. Challenges include policy inertia and competing priorities within the economic sector. Conclusions: This scoping study indicates that the policy spac e analysis framework used here can help to identify specific, contextually appropriate policy options and strategies for strengthening public health nutrition policy within sectors responsible for food supply policy.

In 2013, all World Health Organization countries committed to achieving a 30% relative reduction in mean population salt intake by 2025. This study aims to review the legislative and regulatory interventions adopted to reduce salt intake. Methods: Salt reduction initiatives were identified from a systematic search of published and grey literature, supplemented by a questionnaire completed by country program lead ers working in the relevant fields. Results: Of the 75 countries that had a national salt reduction strategy in 2014, 33 countries had reported one or more legislative or regulatory interventions that aimed to reduce salt intake. Nine countries have mand atory salt content limits for foods. Eight countries have mandated front- of-pack labelling schemes that aim to reduce salt intake. 23 countries have salt standards for foods procured in public institution settings and three countries have taxation related to high salt foods. Most mandatory initiatives have been recently implemented and therefore their effectiveness on lowering salt consumption and subsequently blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases is not yet known. Conclusion: There has been an increa se in countries adopting mandatory interventions to reduce population salt intake. It is too early to determine whether these are more effective than voluntary interventions. Transparent and rigorous evaluation of mandatory initiatives is crucial to determine their effectiveness and inform future implementation of salt reduction policies.

Countries differ widely in terms of the prevalence of overweight and obesity but a rapid increase is observed in all countries. This is contributing to an increasing burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, musculoskeletal conditions and other chronic diseases. There is strong evidence that sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) intake is causally related to increased body mass. Studies have consistently shown that higher SSB prices are associated with reduced consumption of SSBs. We used established multi- state life table modelling methods and publicly available data to estimate the potential impact of SSB taxes on health in four countries. We explicitly modelled expected burdens of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Data sources included the Global Bu rden of Disease, food consumption surveys, and Euromonitor's Passport database. The results show that over the lifetime of the current population, a $0.30 per litre SSB tax would result in a gain of 3.3 (2.4 - 4.2) million health -adjusted life years in China, 3.1 (2.6 - 3.8) million in Indonesia, 760,000 (540,000 - 1,010,000) in the Philippines, and 24,000 (13,000 - 19,000) in Fiji. Annual revenues over the first years of the tax are expected to be approximately $12.5 billion in China, $920 million in Indonesia, $1.1 billion in the Philippines and $8 million in Fiji. SSB taxes are a simple and effective way in which governments can seek to reduce the burden of obesity , while also generating revenue for health programs.

The current state of food marketing to children in Australia Wendy Watson (presenting author),1 Lyndal Wellard,2 Clare Hughes3 Introductio n: Reducing children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing has been recognized by the World Health Organization as an important strategy for the prevention of obesity -related chronic diseas e. In 2009 the Australian food industry introduced two voluntary self- regulatory initiatives on food marketing to children. In 2010 the government committed to monitoring the impact of the self- regulatory initiatives, in response to the Australian National Preventative Health Taskforce recommendation to phase out the marketing of energy -dense nutrient- poor foods on television before 9pm. However, no formal government monitoring has been conducted. This presentation will provide an update on the self- regulat ion of food marketing to children. Methods: The presentation provides a critique of the major loopholes in the self - regulatory initiatives, illustrated by examples of advertising and unsuccessful complaints lodged through the industry framework. It also presents a summary of recent evidence of the extent of advertising in Australia. Results: Minor changes have been made since the regulations were introduced in 2009. The determination of complaints is limited by the loopholes within the current self-regul atory initiatives. Children's exposure to the marketing of energy -dense nutrient -poor foods has not reduced and concerning new media such as websites and Facebook have emerged. Conclusions: Self-regulation of food advertising in Australia is ineffective. Regulatory changes are needed to reduce children's exposure to advertising of unhealthy foods and the influence this has on their diets.

A 3 -year program to evaluate a salt reduction strategy was implemented in Samoa (2012 -15). Quantitative salt consumption data was collected to measure impac t. A parallel process evaluation aimed to explain the results. The objective was to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to assess intervention fidelity, dose, reach and context. Routine monitoring data including implementation plans, annual expenditur e reports and activity reports, was collated and supplemented through semi -structured interviews with 31 stakeholders including government ministries, food industry, media and community organizations . An emerging theme was the impact of staff and governanc e changes on program delivery and the need for more time to fully implement the program. Consumer awareness had been raised but not yet translated into behavior changes. Likewise standards for salt levels in foods had been integrated into new food regulati ons but were yet to take effect. Whilst there has been no reduction in measured salt intake in Samoa to date, the process evaluation suggests the intervention is working. Salt is now mainstreamed into government policy including through salt standards in t he food regulations and salt education as part of the national NCD program. The finance minister has announced proposals to introduce a tax on high salt (and sugar) foods which some people felt was a result of the project. The intervention needs to be sustained as there is an opportunity to measure salt intake through the WHO STEPS survey planned for 2018.

They are often used by consumers to evaluate produc ts' healthiness without viewing the nutrition information panel. Since January 2016, these food -health relationships must be pre -approved by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) or substantiated by food companies using a systematic review. Companie s notify FSANZ of the self -substantiated food -health relationship and provide a dossier of supportive evidence on request. The quality of these industry reviews is unknown as they are not reviewed by FSANZ prior to a claim being made. This project aimed to monitor the notification and substantiation process. Process: Relationships notified to FSANZ from 2013 -2016 were investigated. Where evidence was questionable, a letter was sent to the relevant state agency. If the agency would not investigate or found the relationship to be sufficiently substantiated, a systematic literature review was conducted. Analysis: During the project, FSANZ received 41 relationship notifications from Australian companies; of these, 20 had substantial evidence and were excluded . Three claims were found to be unsubstantiated by state agencies. The remaining 18 have been submitted to state agencies for investigation, and the results of these will be shared in this presentation. Outcomes: The current self -substantiation process is difficult for all parties to implement. Enforcement agencies require time and expertise to assess systematic literature reviews. Thus unsubstantiated claims may be present on food labels. FSANZ should implement pre -market approval to ensure unsubstantiate d claims are not appearing on food labels.

In more recent years, governments in many countries have identified the role that legislation and regulation can play in addressing the physical, social and economic factors that contribute to the obesogenic food environment. This paper aims to canvas s academic literature concerning Chile's bold and innovative anti -obesity policies. The Chilean government's battle against obesity is unique in that it encompasses three key regulatory initiatives - taxation on sugary drinks; restrictions on marketing, ad vertising and sales of unhealthy foods to children; and pioneering front of pack food labelling which seeks to inform consumers by identifying products that are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and sugar. This paper will include a detailed analysis o f each initiative, with commentary concerning the legislative instruments used, the potential effectiveness and limitations, and the tactics used by the Chilean food and drink industries in opposing regulation. Juxtaposition with comparable regulation in A ustralia will seek to highlight how the Chilean experience might assist us to advocate for law reform.
