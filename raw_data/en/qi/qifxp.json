Title 7-Agriculture SUBTITLE A-OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE PART I-ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS Rules of Practice Governing Formal Ad- judicatory Administrative Proceedings Instituted By the Secretary - The following new Subpart H of Part 1, Subtitle A, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, establishes uniform rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory administrative proceedings instituted by the Department or any agency thereof under the statutes and regulations desig- nated in the Subpart. On June 16, 1976, there was publishea in the FEDERAL REGISTER a notice that the Department was considering the promul- gation of uniform rules of practice gov- erning formal adjudicatory proceedings which would replace the separate rules governing such proceedings under the various statutes and regulations involved. Although the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply to the promulga- tion of rules of procedure orpractice, in- terested persons were given an opportu- nity to submit comments on the proposed uniform rules set forth in the notice.in the FEDERAL REGISTER. All comments re- ceived.pursuant to the FEDERAL REGISTER notice and all other available informa- tion and suggestions were carefully con- sidered in developing the final uniform rules. As a result, a number of changes have been made in the proposed uniform rules as published in the IFDRaA REGIS- TER.The rules have been made applicable to adjudicatory administrative proceed- ings under the United States Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 51b and 53) and section 506 of the Federal Land Policyand Management Act of 1976 (section 506, Public Law 94-579 enacted October 21, 1976), in addition to proceedings un- der the statutes designated in the pro- posed rules. The ex parte communication provisions set forth in the proposed uni-form rules have been amended in accord- ance with Section 4 of Public Law 94- 409, enacted September 13, 1976. A pro- vision has been included with respect tothe place of hearings in proceedings un- der the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended by Public Law 94-410 enacted September 13, 1976. Other changes were made in the proposed uni-form rules for clarity of the proivsions and for efciency and expedition in the proceedings in the interests of effective- ness in carrying out the objectives and policies of the underlying statutes, com- mensurate with fair and impartial pro- ceedings.The uniform rules of practice promul- gated in the new Subpart H set forth be- low shall supersede all rules of practice now in existence governing the proceed- ings covered by the new rules which are in conflict with the new rules. The Ad- ministrators of the agencies administer- ing the programs involved will publish documents specifically revoking any rules superseded by the new rules and promulgating any additional supplemen- tal rules relating to particular circum- stances arising in connection with pro- ceedings under the statutes and regula- tions administered by them. Effective date: The uniform rules of practice contained in the new Subpart H set forth below shall become effective 1 February 1977 with respect to all pro- ceedings covered thereby instituted on and after said date. Proceedings Insti- tuted prior to said date shall continue under the applicable rules of practice In effect when the proceedings were agree that the proceeding shall be governed on and after 1 February 1977 by the new uniform rules set forth ni the new Sub- part H.

(1) Upon mo- tion of a party or upon the Judge's own motion, the Judge may direct the parties or their counsel to attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or during the course of the hearing, when the Judge finds that the proceeding would be ex- pedited by a prehearing conference.

(d) Order. Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be reduced to a writ- ten appropriate order, unless the Judge ;concludes that a stenographic report shall suffice, or, if the conference takesplace within 7 days of the beginning ofthe hearing, the Judge elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.

To eliminate needless test- ing, to make a conforming change In a test procedure, and to correct paragraph designations. o Statement of considerations. The in- troductory paragraph for 9 CFR 113.52 states that all cell lines used to prepare biological products shall be tested by all tests described In the Section. Some cell lines are used to prepare viral antigens which are to be used only in laboratory tests (in vitro) and not in animals. It has been determined by the Deputy Adminis- trator that such cell lines need not be tested for oncogenicity, tumorigenlclty, and karyology. These amendments ex- empt such cell lines from these tests, Cells from two sources (primary colls and cell lines) are used In the production of viral vaccines. Test requirements for these cells are prescribed In \u00a7 113.51 and \u00a7 113.52, respectively. A test for myco- plasma contamination provided in \u00a7 113.28 is a requirement of these cells. The regulations presently provide that to satisfy the mycoplasma contamina- tion test requirements for primary cells, either final container samples of com- pleted product or samples of the final pool of harvested material may be tested. However, to satisfy the present myco- plasma contamination test requirementsfor a cell line, either samples from each subculture of cells or the final pool of harvested material have to be tested. Testing of final container samples of completed product Is not sufficent under the present regulations to satisfy the mycoplasma contamination test require- ments for a cell line. However, no suffi- cient reason appears to be present for not permitting testing of samples of final containers for a cell line. Therefore, these amendments permit the licensee to test samples of final containers, regardless of the type of cells used. Cell identity test requirements for the Master Cell Stock in \u00a7 113.52 were in- advertently codified In paragraphs and subparagraphs designated (g) (5), (g) (5) (i), (g) (5) (ii), and (g) (5) (iII). These amendments correct these designations to read (h), (h) (1), (h) (2), and (h) (3), respectively. No substantive changes are made.

Sim- ilar limitations on business in the United States are imposed upon (a) Edge Corporations under the tenth para- graph of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 616); (b) foreign banks, the stock of which is held by a member bank under the third paragraph of Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 601); and (c) companies, the shares of which are owned or controlled by a bank holding company under Sec- tion 4(c) (13) of the Bank Holding Com- pany Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c) (13)). In a request for an interpretation filed with the Board by a member bank and its parent bank holding company, the issue arose whether It would be a permissible activity forz an existin- foreign subsidi- ary corporation, subject to the provisions of either Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act or Section 4(c) (13) of the Bank Holding Company Act, to sell long- term debt obligations in foreig markets and to transfer the proceeds to its United States parent(s) for domestic purposes. These debt obligations would have initial maturities in excess of seven years and may or may not be supported by the guaranty of the United States parent organzation(s). In the Board's judgment, It appears that the transfer by a foreign subsidiary corporation to its United States parent of proceeds received from the foreign subsidiary's sale of long-term debt obli- gations in foreign markets would not be an impermissible activity under the above discussed statutory provisions re- lating to the conduct of Incidental busi- ness activities In the United States. This interpretation also applies to a foreign subsidiary bank held directly by % member bank under the third Para- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS graph of Section 25 of the Federal Re- serve Act. i2 CFR Parts 211, 213, and 225 are amended by adding new \u00a7\u00a7 211.112, 213.106, 225.136 to read as follows: PART 211-CORPORATIONS ENGAGED IN FOREIGN BANKING AND FINANC- ING UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT \u00a7 211.112 Utilization of Foreign Sub- sidiaries to Sell Long-Term Debt Obligations in Foreign Markets and to Transfer the Proceeds to Their United States Parent(s) for Domes- tic Purposes. (a) In a request for an interpretation filed with the Board by a member bank and its parent bank holding company, the Issue, arose whether it would be a permissible activity for one of their ex- isting foreign subsidiary corporations, subject to the provisions of either Sec- tions 25 or 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act or. Section 4(c) (13) of the Bank Holding Company Act, to sell long-term debt obligations in foreign markets and to transfer the proceeds of these obliga- tions to its United States parent(s) for domestic purposes. (b) Under the specific proposal put forward, a foreign subsidiary of the parent bank holding company would sell debt obligations in foreign markets, which obligations would have initial ma- turities in excess of seven years and may or may not be supported by the guaranty of its parent bank holding company. The foreign subsidiary in question would have substantial other international or foreign business and would be perform- ing an activity that its parent bank holding company could perform directly, i.e., raising capital funds through the sale of long-term debt obligations. (c) Under the eighth paragraph of Section 25(a) of the Federc1 Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 615), an Edge Corporation may, with the prior consent of the Board, purchase and hold stock of a corporation that is \"not engaged in the general busi- ness of buying or selling goods, wares, merchandise or commodities in the United States, and not transacting any business In the United States except such as in the Judgment of the Board ... may be incidental to its international or foreign business.\" Similarly, under the tenth paragraph of the same section, an Edge Corporation shall not \"carry on any part of its business in the United Stal-s except such as in the judgment of the Board ...' may be incidental to itsinternational or foreign business.\" Pur- suant to the third paragraph of Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, a national banking associationI may acquire and hold, directly or indirectly, stock or other evidences of ownership in a foreign bank as long as such foreign bank- is \"not engaged, directly or indirectly, in any activity in the United States except as, in the judgment of the Board... shall Paragraph 20 of Section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 335) makes the pro-visions of Section 25 applicable to State mem- ber banks.be incidental to the international or for- eign business of .such foreign bank.\" Finally, Section 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act exempts from the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the Act \"shares of, or activities con- ducted by, any company which does no business in the United States except as an incident to its international or foreign business.\" (d),In the Board's judgment, the slight wording differences between the quoted portions of the above statutes were not intended by Congress to bear any mean- ingful significance. Accordingly, the Board has interjreted these provisions in the past as being synonymous 2 and this interpretation 'applies to each of the above statutory provisions. (e) To the extent that the foreign subsidiary in question is involved in tie issuance of long-term debt obligations in foreign markets, there is no legal iss--e raised since that subsidiary would clearly be engaging in permissible foreign activ- ities. However, an issue is raised whether the transfer of the proceeds of 'hcze obligations to its parent institution causes such foreign subsidiary to be \"doing\" or \"transacting\" business within the United States in violation of the statutory provisions set forth above. (f) The Board has determined that the foreign subsidiary in question Is not \"transacting\" or \"doing\" business in the United States by the mere transfer of proceedes of its long-term foreign debt obligations to its parent corporation. In the Board's judgment, the foreign sub- sidiary is essentially providing a service to its parent'in that it is serving as its parent's alter ego for the limited purpose of obtaining long-term funds that the parent could otherwise obtain directly.3 The transfer of borrowing proceeds be- tween a United States parent and its foreign subsidiary in this situation can thus be viewed as not more-than an intra- organizatioial transaction , for the parent's benefit. In the Board's view, such a transaction I- distinguishable from a commercial loan to a third-party United States resident by a foreign subsidiary, which loan would bring a foreign sub-sidiary into direct lending competition with domestic banking organizations. (g) In the Board's judgment, this interpretation applies only to a situa- tion where a foreign subsidiary, acting strictly on behalf of its parent organiza- tion, issues debt obligations abroad for the sole and-express purpose of supplying See \u00a7 225.4(f) (1) of Regulation Y, whereinthe Board has by regulation applied to for- eign subsidiaries of domestic bank holdingcompanies the Edge Act limitations on activ- ities in the 'United States. 3 While such a foreign subsidiary may be viewed as providing a service to its parent bank holding company, the Board neverthe- less believes that any bank holding companythat plans to acquire shares of a foreign cor-poration to engage solely in the activities de-scribed herein will have to file an application under section 4(c) (13) of the Bank Holding Company Act and \u00a7 225.4(f) of Regulation Y. (See in this regard the Board's prior ruling on foreign operations subsidiaries at 12 CFR 250.143.)funds to its parent organization. To meet this test, the Board believes three con- ditions must be satisfied: (1) the foreign subsidiary should be wholly-owned (ex- cept for directors' qualifying shares, Iff any) by Its United States parent organi- zation(s) ; (2) the proceeds repatriated should be no greater in amount than the amount of debt issued abroad; and (3) the proceeds should be repatriated on approximately the same terms and con- ditions as the obligations issued by the foreign subsidiary.

In order to provide a sufficient period for the collection and analysis of comments on the proposed rule for Specialists' credit and to avoid the necessity for costly reprogramming of computer sys- tems until such time as the Board acts' upon the proposed amendment to \u00a7 220.4 (g), the Board has determined to permit option Specialists to continue using the existing provisions of \u00a7 220.3(d) (5) after January 1, 1977, instead of the new gen- eral account provision which takes effect on that date. The effect of this action is to permit, in calculating the adjusted debit balance of a Specialist's account, the use of the amount of any margin cus- tomarily required by the creditor-in con- nection with the issuance of the option, rather than the amount specified by the Board. To implement this, the Board hereby temporarily suspends the application of \u00a7 220.3(d) (5) and (I) as such sections would apply after January 1, 1977 to transactions in options in a Specialist's account -withi the scope of \u00a7 220.4A(g) of Regulation T. The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 wIth respect to notice, public participation and deferred effective date were not fol- lowed in-connection with this suspension since it temporarily relieves a restriction and the Board found that to follow, the requirements of section 553, would be impractical and contrary to the public interest inasmuch as it might involve needless expense for option Specialists and possible market disruption. Effective date: This suspension is ef- fective on January 1, 1977. By order of the Board of Governors, December 29, 1976. THEODORE B. ALLISON, Secretary of the Board. [FR Fair Credit Billing; Open End Credit;, Discounts for Cash; Correction In FR Doc. 75-24962 appearing at page 43200 in the FEDERAL REGISTER of Septem- ber 19, 1975, paragraph (x) of \u00a7 226.2 ap- pearing on page 43202 is corrected in the fifteenth line by adding \"226.4(i) ;\" after the section symbols (\u00a7\u00a7) and immedi- ately prior to \"226.7(a) (6) \". Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 533, the Board finds that prior notice of this rulemaking is unnecessary and that public participa- tion is impractical since, in its view, the change is in the nature of a technical correction clearly mandated by the Truth in Lending Act. \u00a7 226.4(i) was inadvert- ently not included in the enumeration of sections in \u00a7 226.2(x) for which \"open end credit\" shall mean \"consumer credit extended on an account by use of a credit card * * -\" when the final Fair CreditBilling amendments to Regulation Z were published on September 19. It Is es- sential that \u00a7 226.4(i) be included In this enumeration in order for the Regulaton to fully Implement section 167 of the Truth In Lending Act which provides that discounts of up to five percent for payment In cash in lieu of by credit card do not constitute finance charges.

No. 94-29 CJune 4, 1975)] relating to stock appreciation rights and certain other matters. Among other things, the amendments adopted today will provide a \"safe harbor\" from sections 16(a) and 16(b) of the Ex- change Act for certain transactions in- volving cash settlements of stock ap- preciation rights. In addition, theamendments will clarify the conditions for the availability of Rule 16b-3 and refine certain terminology and defini- tions used in the rule. Notice of the proposed amendments was published on April 23, 1976 in Se- curities Exchange Act Release No. 34- 12374 [41 FR 19983]. helpful com-ments were the public re- garding the proposed amendments, andthe Commission has given careful con-sideration to those comments In formu- lating the final revisions. SECTION 16 AND RELATED RULES Section 16 of the Exchange Act andcorresponding provisions of the PublicUtility Holding Company Act of 1935 [15 U.S.C. 79a et seq., as of as amended by Pub.L. No. 94-29 (June 4, 1975)] are de- signed to provide other security holdersand investors generally with information on insider securities transactions andholdings and to prevent insiders fromunfairly utilizing confidential informa- tion to profit from short-term tradingtransactions in an issuer's securities., Section 16(a) requires every personwho beneficially owns, directly or in-directly, more than 10 percent of anyclass of equity security which is regis-tered under section 12 of the Act, or whois a director or an officer of the issuer Of any such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing theamount of all equity securities of the issuer of which he is the beneficial ownerand changes in such ownership.Section 16(b) states in general that any profit realized by such officer, di-rector or 10-percent holder realized fromany purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of suchissuer within any period of less than sixmonths shall inurie to and-be recoverable by the issuer.Rule 16b-3 exempts from other\"things, acquisitions of nontransferable options- pur-suant to certain employee benefit plans.This exemptive rule reflects the Com- mission's recognition that under manysuch plans which provide for acquisitionsat least every twelve months any sale would necessarily be within six monthsof one of the acquisition transactions. Thus, if the acquisitions were not exemptfrom section 16(b), the legitimate use of such plans as a method of executivecompensation would be largely frus-trated. Farther, since the amount ofbenefits and the persons eligible to re-celvo them must, In order to qualify for the exemption, be determined by iper- sons not eligible to participate, the oP- portunity for abuse Is slight. Rule 16a-6(c) provides that a state-ment pursuant to Section 16(a) need not be filed with respect to the acquisi- tion, expiration or cancellation of any non-transferable qualified, restricted or other stock option granted by the Issuer of the securities to which the option re- lates, pursuant to a plan provided for the benefit of its employees and em- ployees of Its affiliates, if the plan meets the conditions specified in Rule lob-3. Stocic APPaEcIATinO Ricars The principal purpose of the amend- ments adopted today is to provide an ex- emption from sections 16(a) and 16(b) of the Exchange Act for certain trans- actions in stock appreciation rights (SARs). Generally, a stock appreciation right entitles a person to receive an amount (payable In cash, securities or and combination thereof) equal to the change over a specified period of time of any one or more measures of apprecia- tion or increase In the value of the equity security to which such right re- lates. Some of the standards used in de- termining the amount to which a person is entitled under a stock appreciation right are market value, book value, net earnings, net worth, dividends or similar factors. It has become apparent to the Com- mission that there Is a great deal of con- cern. and uncertainty in the business community with respect to the status of stock appreciation rights under section 16 of the Exchange Act. The concern in this area apparently is based on the pos- sibility that the settlement of a stock appreciation right for cash may be deemed to involve a purchase of stock which is simultaneously sold to the Issuer in a cash sale. Under such a theory, anyprofit on the transaction realized by thedirector or officer would be recoverable by the issuer under the provisions of section 16(b).z Accordingly, absent an exemption from section 16(b), stock ap- preciation' rights which are payable Incash would, under this theory, essentially be worthless as a means of executive compensation. In view of the foregoing, and consider- ing that \"[t]he risk of speculative abuse IIt should be noted, however, that two re- cent court decisions suggeat that Section 16(b) is not applicable to the Oxercielo of astock appreciation right, at least under thecircumstances described In those case3. See '1R0en Sec. L. Pep. 195,748 (October 21, 1970) and\"Freedman v. Barrow et al.\". -P. Supp. -. 75 CLv. 4737-CLB (S.D.N.Y.), COH Fed. Sec. L. Rep 9 95,704 (November 4. 1976). Inthe 'Freedman\" case, It was specificallystated on page 45 of the Blip opinion that the exercise of a stock appreciation rightdoes not involve the safe of an equity secu-rity by the offlcer-dircetor, and thus there isno Inherent or per so violation of Section 16(b) in the exercise of an SAR, as a resultor/tho simultaneous receipt of shnre3 there-tnder. (emphasis Included) .is no greater with SARs than the risk associated with the exercise of a typical stock option,\"2 the Commission has de- termined to amend Rules 16b-3 and 16a- 6(c) so that stock appreciation rights willbe treated in the same way that stock options are treated under those rules. This has been done pursuant to the Com-mission's authority In section 16(b) to exempt by rule any transaction not com-prehended within the purpose of that section. Specifically, the Commission be- lieves that the conditions which it hasestablished In revised Rule 16b-3 relatingto cash settlements of stock appreciation rights are such that transactions satis- fying those conditions are not compre- hended within the purpose of section 16(b). The Commison's action in revising Rule 16b-3 In order to provide a \"safeharbor\" for certain transactions in stockappreciation rights should not be con-strued as a statement by It that SAR transactions which do not satisfy the conditions of the rule necessarily are subject to section 16(b). In this regard,the Commission wishes to emphasizethat because of the unsettled legal status of stock appreciation rights under sec-tion 16, It is expressing no view as to the applicability of that section to trans-actions In stock appreciation rights thatare outside the scope of Rule 16b-3, andno inference in TnirsAcTions CovExRED wr T Exoa~rroq In creating a limited exemption for stock appreciation rights, the Commis-sion has added a new paragraph (e) to Rule 16b-3 dealing solely with trans-actions in such rights. The paragraph exempts from section 16(b) Any tranzaction involving the exeri se andcancellation of a stock appreciation right issued pursuant to a plan (whether or not the tran-action also nvolves the related su-render and cancellation of a stock option).and the receipt of cash in complete or partial settlement of that right ' * The exemption, however, will be avail-able only if all of the conditions speci- fied in the paragraph and in the otherparts of the rule are satisfied. In response to the public commentary,the amended rule has been broadened tocover many more types of transactions involving stock appreciation rights than would have been covered under the ruleas proposed in Release No. 34-12374. Inthe proposed version, the exemption would have been limited only to thosetransactions involving a stock apprecia-tion right granted In tandem with a stockoption. Many of the commentators pointed out, however, that by so restrict- ing the exemption the Commission would effectively freeze out the many plansthat involve a simple award of cash insettlement of a stock appreciation right without reference to any stock options. Since there appears to be no valid rea- son for discriminating against theseother types of plans, the Commission 2'Ptecdman r. Barro7,\" note I supra, 46. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS has revised paragraph (e) so that it will apply to almost all transactions involv- Ing the settlement of stock appreciation rights, assuming the other conditions of the rule are satisfied.' The conditions in the amended rulethat are specifically applicable to trafis- actions In stock appreciation rights are designed to prevent the unfair use 'of in- side Information In connection with such transactions. Each of these conditions is\" discussed below in the order in-which it appears In the rule. (1) Information About the Issuer. Under subparagraph (e) (1) of the re- vised rule, the Issuer of the stock appre- ciation rights will be required to have filed all reports required under section 13 of the Exchange Act for at least one year immediately prior to the settlement of the SAR. In addition, the issuer mustregularly release on a quarterly and an- nual basis summary statements of sales and earnings. These two conditions areintended to provide some degree of as- surance that the amount of inside infor- mation about the Issuer will be kept to a minimum through the regular release of information-to the public. The condition concerning the regular publication of summary financial data will be deemed satisfied, according to the rule, if the financial data appears: (a) on a wire service, (b) in a financial news service, (c) in a newspaper of general circulation, or (d) is otherwise made pub- licly available. Item (d) was inserted in the rule in recognition of the fact thatan Issuer has no control over whethera wire service, financial news service, or newspaper of general circulation pub- lishes the financial data released to it. Therefore, in the event the financial data Is not published by any of the entities mentioned above, the condition as topublication will be considered satisfied if the data is simply made publicly avail- able. In complying with the requirement that summary financial information be released on a regular basis, it will benecessary for an issuer to publish sum- mary statements of sales and earningsfor each of the first three quarters of its fiscal year, and an annual statement of sales and earnings on a summary basisafter the close of the fourth quarter. The form and content of these summary statements will be left to the discretion of each issuer. (2) Limitation on the right and any re- lated option, In Release No. 34-12374, the Commission proposed the adoption of four separate limitations on both the stock appreclation rights covered.by therule and any related stock options. These limitations would have restricted the price of any stock options relating to ex- empt stock appreciation rights, the exer- cise date and transferability of such op- tions and rights, and the date upon which the value of the stock appreciation rights could be determine. The majority of those who commented on the four proposed limitations ques- tioned their relevance to the, objectives of section 16(b) and recommended that some or all of them be deleted from theamended rule. After reconsidering the various limitations in light of the public comments, the Commission has deter-. mined to delete two of them from the re- vised rule. The two deleted items, vhich related to the price of any stock option granted in tandem with a stock apprecia- tion right and the date for determining the value of the stock appreciation right. would appear to have a minimal preven- tive effect on the speculative abuse of in- side information. Accordingly, they' arenot deemed necessary for inclusioi in the amended rule. In addition to the two items referred to above, a third limitation, which would have restricted the transferability of stock'appreciation rights and any related stock options, also has been deleted from subparagraph (e) (2) on the ground It is essentially duplicative of a similar pro- vision in subparagraph (d) (1) (i) of the revised rule, which relates to all plans covered by the rule. The sole limitation of those originally proposed that has been retained in sub- paragraph (e) (2) of the amended rule is one which will limit the date of exer- cise of any stock appreciation right or related stock option that is subject to the rule. The Commission had proposed in Release No. 34-12374 that such options or rights not be exercisable during the' first year of their term. In response to the comments, which indicated that a one-year limit on exercisability was ex- cessively restrictive, and in light of the fact that section 16(b) prohibits match-ing purchases and sales for only a'six-month period, the limitation on the date of exercise has been reduced to six months. In addition, the provision re-lating to this limitation has been revisedto state that it will not be applicable in the event the officer or director to whom the stock appreciation right was granted dies or becomes disabled prior to the ex- piration of the six-month period. (3) Administration of the plan. Sub- paragraph (e) (3) of the amended rule contains certain conditions that must be complied with in connection with the ad- ministration of the plan under which the stock appreciation rights are issued. The first of these conditions requires that the, plan be administered by either the Board of Directors, a majority of which must be disinterested persons and'a majority of the directors acting on plan matters must be disinterested persons, or by a committee of three or more persons, all of whom must be disinterested persons. This condition parallels a similar con- dition in paragraph (b) that is gener-ally applicable to all other plans under the rule. In its adopted form. the above require- ment is somewhat different from the one originally proposed in Release No. 34- 12374. As proposed, the condition would have required that the SAP. plan be ad- ministered only by a committee of the Board of Directors designated for the purpose. The comments indicated thatthere were two major problems withthis provision. First, relatively few-plans are administered by a committee of the Board, with the result that many exist-ing plans would have to be amended to comply with this condition. Second, theproposed condition did not require thatthe administrators of the plan be disin-terested' persons, thereby omitting animportant safeguard that Is applicable to other plans covered by the rule, Inlight of these comments, the Commils- sion has revised the provision relating to the administrators of the plan in themanner indicated in the precedingparagraph. Subparagraph (e) (3) also requiresthat the Board or committee which ad-ministers the plan must have sole discre-tion either (a) to determine the formin which payment of the right will bemade (i.e., cash, securities, or any com-bination thereof), or (b) to consent toor disapprove the election of any planparticipant (assuming he has the right to make such an election) to receive cash in full or partial settlement of theright. This condition Is intended to assurethat the disinterested administrators willhave final control over the form Inwhich payment of the stock appreciationright will be made. With respect to the election by theparticipant concerning the form of pay-ment of the stock appreciation right, the provision also has been revised to requirethat such election be made during theperiod beginning on the third businessday and ending on the twelfth business day following the date of release of thesummary financial data disseminated on a quarterly basis by the issuer pursuantto subparagraph (e) (1) In effect, thiscondition provides a 10-day \"window\"period each quarter for the participantto make his election. The window period Is tied to the release of financial data tothe public in order to assure that theparticipant's election will be made duringa period when there is a minimal amountof inside information, about the issuer'soperating results that Is unavailable tothe public. While the election of the participatingdirector or officer concerning the formof payment of his BAR must be madeduring the window period mentioned above, the determination of the admin-istrators of the plan to either consent toor disapprove the participant's election may be given at any time after such elec- tion is made. Thus, it will not be neces-sary for the administrators to Issue their consent or disapproval during the 10- day window period. It also should be understood that the rule does not contemplate that the ad- ministrators of the plan will give advance consents, or conditional advance con- sents, to the election by;participants con- cerning the form of payment of the stockappreciation right. The review of theparticipant's election by disinterested administrators Is one of the principal protective features of the rule, and the giving, of advance consents would limitthe effectiveness of this feature. Accord- sFor purposes of Rule 16b-3, the term \"business days\" shall mean all calendar days except- Saturdays, Sundays and nationalholidays. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 ingly, such consents will not satisfy therequirements of subparagraph (e) (3) of the rule. (4) Compliance with other conditionSof Rule 16b-3. Subparagraph (e) (4) ofthe revised rule states simply that the plan under which the stock appreciation rights and any related stock options are granted must satisfy all of the conditions of Rule 16b-3, including those specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the rule. This provision basically is un- changed from the form in which it was proposed for comment. (5) Limit of the exemption. In Release No. 34-12374, the Commission had pro- posed to insert a Note after the leadin segment of paragraph (e) stating essen- tialy that nothing in the paragraph pro- vides an exemption from section 16(b)for the acquisition of stock upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or a stock option. The proposed Note was intended to codify dertain views previ- ously expressed by the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance con- cerning stock appreciation rights. Al- though the Note itself has been deleted from the rule, its substance has been retained In a new subparagraph (e) (5) of the rule. Therefore, the new subpara- graph makes it clear that the acquisition of stock upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option is not exempt from the provisions of section 16(b). CLARICATION OF TH RUm'S APPLICABIITY The comments from the public indi- cated that there was some confusion over the Commission's proposal to amend the introductory paragraph of the rule con- cerning the types of plans cofered by the rule. In this regard, the Commission had proposed to amend the paragraph to state that the rule covered any \"profit- sharing, retirement, incentive, thrift, or savings plan, or a plan as defined in sub- paragraph (d) W).\" In subparagraph (d) (1), the Commission proposed to de- fine the term \"plan\" to mean \"an option, bonus, appreciation, or similar plan\" which meets certain specified conditions. The confusion on the public's part con- cerning the proposed changes apparently was due to uncertainty over whether the minimum conditions specified in sub- paragraph (d) (1) would be applicable to all plans covered by the rule, or to only the plans specifically enumerated in that subparagraph. To eliminate the uncertainty described above, the Commission has revised the introductory paragraph of Rule 16b-3 to state that the rule applies only to those plans that fall within the definition of a ,plan\" set forth in subparagraph (d) (1). Subparagraph (d) (1), as revised, defines the term \"plan\" to mean an \"option, bonus, appreciation, profit sharing, re- tirement, incentive, thrift, saving or similar plan\" which meets the conditions specified in that subparagraph. The conditions which each plan that Is subject to Rule 16b-3 henceforth must satisfy are two-fold:RULES AND REGULATIONS (a) The plan must be set forth In a writ- ten document describing the means or bas for determining the eligibility of Individuals to participate and either the price at which the securities may be offered or the method by which the price or the amount of the award is to be determined; and (b) The plan must provide with respect to any option or similar right (including a ctock appreciation right) offered pursuant to the plan that such option or right is not trans- ferable other than by will or the lawv of descent and distribution and that It Is exer- cisable during the employee's lifetime only by him or by his guardian or legal repre enta- tive. The above conditions are similar \"to those which were proposed for comment in Release No. 34-12374. The Commis- sion, however, has determined that they should be applied to all plans under the rule, rather than only some such plans, since it knows of no compelling reason for treating some plans differently from others under the rule. Further, the Com- mission does not believe that the above conditions are excessively burdensome or onerous, since they are basically designed to assure only that certain material pro- visions of plans covered by the rule are outlined in written form for all Interested persons. It should be noted that in response to the public comments the Commi.ion re- vised the proposed requirement that each plan specify the \"employees or class of employees eligible to participate.' In lieu of the foregoing the amended rule will require that the plan describe the \"means or basis for determining the eligibility of- individuals to participate.\" This change will make it clear that a plan covered by the rule may include non-employees such as directors who do not work for the is- suer. This change seems appropriate since the introductory language to Rule 16b-3 states thit the rule applies to transactions by a director or officer with- out requiring that the director be an em- ployee. Further there appear to be ade- quate safeguards against abuse in this area in that all such plans generally are subject to shareholder approval and must be administered by disinterested per- sons. AMENDLIENTS TO XMS G PUZIS For many years, there has been uncer- tainty as to, which amendments, if any. to existing plans covered by Rule 16b-3 must be submitted to security holders for their approval. Paragraph (a). which deals generally with the requirement of shareholder approval of plans subject to the rule, heretofore has been silent on this point. The Commission attempted to deal with this issue on a peripheral basis in Release No. 34-12374 by proposing to amend subparagraph (d) (1) to require that amendments to certain plans (but not profit sharing, retirement, incentive, thrift or savings plans) be submitted to shareholders for their approval If the amendments would materially alter the plans in certain specified ways. The Commission now has determined to resolve the issue of which amend- ments to existing plans will require shareholder approval on an \"across-the-board\" basis. That Is, it has decided to add a provision at the end of paragraph (a) which states that any amendment to an existing plan covered by Rule 16b-3 must be submitted to shareholders for their approval if the amendment would: (a) materially increase the benefits accru- ing to partclpant3 under the plan;(b) materally increase the number of securltles which may be L-ued und the plan; or (c) materially modify the requirements asto eligibility for participation In the plan. The types of amendments that will be subject to shareholder approval are basi- cally the same as those which were pro- posed for comment in Release No. 34- 12374. The only significant alteration is in item (a) above, which, as proposed. would have applied only to an amend- ment that would \"materially reduce the price at which the security may be of- fered.\" In this regard, the Commission has determined to broaden the coverage of that Item so that it will be applicable not only to material reductions in the price at which securities may be offered under the plan, but also any other changes that would materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the plan. This change is in accord with the basic premise of paragraph (a) that shareholders should be provided the opportunity to pass judgment on plans that will confer significant benefits upon officers and directors. , REIoNS In TZ2iNOLOGY Prior to the amendments adopted today, Rule 16b-3 had contained various terms and references that have their origin in the Internal Revenue Code C\"IRC\"). The Commission does not be- lieve there is any valid reason for main- taining these terms and references, since the provisions of the IRC do not have any meaningful relation to the obJec- tives of section 16(b). Accordingly, all such terms and references have been deleted from the revised rule. The Commission also has deleted cer- tain terminology modeled after the revi- sions to Form S-8 that were proposed in prior Commission releases. Again, the Commirsion is taking this action because there does not appear to be any meaning- ful connectionbetween Form S-8 and the objectives of section 16(b). ConmEcTioN or Pon O ,mssoz For many years, Rule 16b-3 has failed to include a provision that was omitted therefrom through an apparent over- slghat. Specifically, paragraph (b) of the rule states that if the selection, of par- ticipants or the granting of securities under a plan is subject to the discretion of any person, then such discretion shall be exercised only in accordance with the provisions of the paragraph. The para- graph then discusses separately the pro- visions applicable to transactions involv- ing officers and transactions involving directors. These separate discussions, however, parallel one another for the most part, with the exception that sub- section (b) (2), which deals with trans- actions involving officers, does not discuss FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS those situations in which the administra- tors of the plan njeed not act on a trans- action because the matter is specifically covered by the terms of the plan itself. Subsection (b) (1), which deals with transactions involving directors, does contain such a discussion, and it seems apparent that a similar discussion was inadvertently omitted from subsection (b) (2). In fact, the Commission's staff on at least three occasions has stated in its interpretative letters that such a dis- cussion should be \"read into\" subsection (b) (2). Accordingly, the Commission has corrected this oversight today by insert- ing in the rule a new subsection (b) (2) (iiI) which corresponds to subsection (b)(1) (iii). AXMENDMENT OF RULE 16a-6(c) The Commission also has amended Rule 16a-6 (c) under the Exchange, Act to exempt any person from the filing re- quirements of section 16(a) of the Act with respect to the acquisition, expira- tion, surrender or cancellation 6f a stock appreciation right pursuant to a plan which meets the conditions speci- fied in Rule 16b-3. In this regard, it should be noted that, notwithstanding the exemption from the above filing re- quirements, there still would be certain disclosures of the exempt transactions ift the issuer's proxy or information statement which- is sent to stockholders. OPERATION OF THE AmENDMENTS Rules 16b-3 and 16a-6(c), as amended, will become effective on June 30, 1977, except that f an issuer is in compliance with the requirements of the amended rules prior to that date it may rely on the rules at the time of compliance. The effective date has been deferred .until June 30th because the Commission rec- ognizes that the changes to the above- mentioned rules are extensive in nature, and that many issuers will therefore re- quire some time to amend their plans in order to comply with the new requirements. Because the changes outlined in this release generally represent a relaxation of the amendments proposed in Release No. 34-12374, the Commission believes that none of these modifications need to be republished for comment pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. AurHonrry. The Commission has adopted the amendments to Rule 16b-3 and nule 16a- 6(c) discussed herein pursuant to the Se- curities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly sections 16(a), 16(b) and 23(a) thereof; the Public Utilty Rolding 1935, particularly sections 17(a), 17(b) and 20(a) thereof; and the Investment Com- pany Act of 1940, particularly sections 30(f) and 38 thereof. Text of revised Rule 16b-3. Rule 16b-3 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 240.16b-3 Exemption from section 16(b) of acquisitions of shares of stock and stock options and stock ap- preciation rights under certain stock incentive, stock option- or similar plans. Any -acquisition of shares of stock (other than stock acquired upon theexercise of an option, warrant or right) pursuant to a plan as defined- In sub- paragraph (d) (1) hereof, or any acqui- sition, expiration, cancellation or sur- render to the issuer of a stock option or stock appreciation right pursuant to such a plan by a director or officer of the issuer shall be exempt from the operation of section 16(b) of the Act if the plan meets the following conditions: (a) Approval by security holders. The plan has been approved,. directly or in- directly, (1) by the afflrmative votes of the holders of a majority of the securi- ties of the issuer present, or represented, and entitled to vote at a meeting duly held in accordance with the applicable laws of the state or other jurisdiction in which the issuer was incorporated, or (2) by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the securities of the issuer entitled to vote: Provided, how- ever, That if such vote or written con- sent was not solicited substantially in accordance with the rules aiid\" regula- tions, if any, in effect under section 14 (a) of the Act at the time of such vote or written consent, the issuer shall furnish in writing to the holders of record of the securities entitled to vote for the plan substantially the same information concerning the plan which would be re- quired by the rules and regulations in effect under section 14(a) of the Act at the time such information is furnished, if proxies to be voted with respect to the approval or disapproval of the plan were then being solicited, on or prior to the date of the first annual meeting of se- curity holders held subsequent to the later of (i) the first registration of an equity security under section 12 of the Act or (ii) the acquisition of an equity security for which exemption is claimed. Such written information may be fur- nished by mail to the last known address of the security holders of record within 30 days prior to the date of mailing. Four copies of such written information shall be filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission not later than the date on which it is first sent or given to se- curity holders of the issuer. For the pur- poses of this paragraph, the term \"Issuer\" includes a predecessor corpora- tion if the plan or obligttions to par- ticipate thereunder were assumed by the issuer in connection with the succession. In addition, any amendment to the plan shall be similarly approyed if the amend- ment would: (A) Materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the plan; (B) Materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under the plan; or (C) Materially modify the require- ments as to eligibility for participation in the plan.

The affectedcomponents of the program consist ofthe Commission's interpretations withrespect to application of \u00a7\u00a7 and 240.17a-11 to brokersand dealers effecting transactions solelyin municipal securities. RECORDKEEPING AND PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS Section 17(a) (1)1 of the Securities Ex- change Act of 1934 (the \"Act\") requires registered brokers and dealers, interalia, to make and keep such records forsuch periods of time as the Commission by rule prescribes as necessary or appro-priate in the public interest or for theprotection of inyestors. Among the rules adopted pursuant to this rulemaking authority are \u00a7\u00a7 240.17a-3, 240.17a-4 and 240.17a-11. Section 240.17a-3 essen-tially requires brokers and dealers regis-tered pursuant to Section 15 of the Actto make and keep current specified books and records relating to their busi-ness. Section 240.17a-4 requires thepreservation for prescribde lengths oftime of the books and records main-tained pursuant to \u00a7 240.17a-3, as well as other documents enumerated in\u00a7 240.17a-4(b), (c) and (d).

In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11854 (Nov. 20, 1975) [40 FR 57786(Dec. 12, 1975)] (\"Release No. 11854\"),the Commission adopted a, financial re-sponsibility and reporting program per-taining to transactions in municipalsecurities, including interpretations of\u00a7\u00a7 240.17a-3, 240.17c-4 and 240.17a-ll(c). In Release No. 11854, the Commis-sion concluded that It was necessary and-appropriate to provide a transitional pe-riod during which brokers and dealerseffecting transactions solely in munici-pal securities could familiarize them-selves with \u00a7 240.17a-3 and make to their reeordkeeping the rule's provisions.2 The Commission accordingly interpreted-\u00a7 240Q.17a-3 to require brokers and deal-ers effecting transactions solely in mu-nicipal securities to make and keep cur-rent books and records sufficient to demonstrate their financial condition, to reflect the receipt and delivery of all funds and securities, and to reflect all customer activity.3 A companion inter-pretation of \u00a7 240.17a-4 Provided, That brokers and dealers effecting transac- ISecurities Act Amendments of 1975, Pub.

In addition, the Commis- sion interpreted \u00a7 240.17a-11(c) apply only to violations of \u00a7 240.17a-3 as in-terpreted.4 The Commission stated its intention to consult and coordinate withthe Municipal Securities Rulenaking Board (the \"Board\") concerning appro- priate books and records requirementsfor brokers and dealers effecting trans-actions solely in municipal securities,and invited public comment concerning numerous questions pertaining to ap-propriate financial responsibility andreporting requirements for these brokersand dealers.5 The interpretations to \u00a7\u00a7 240.17a-3,240.17a-4 and 240.17a-11(c) discussed above originally were scheduled to ex-pire on January 15, 1976. However, priorto that date, certain interested membersof the public and- the Board requestedthat these interpretations be extended.The Commission responded by extendingthe interpretations until March 31, 1976.0On February 3, 1976, the Board madeavailable to interested members of thepublic an exposure draft of Board RulesG-8, G-9 and G-10 which proposed toestablish recordkeeping and preserva-tion requirements for municipal securi-ties brokers and municipal securities,dealers. The Board considered publiccomments and 'the Commission staff'spreliminary comments on the exposuredraft at its regularly scheduled meetingon March 25-26, 1976. As the Board's re-vised schedule would not allow comple-tion of the public procedures required bySection 19(b) prior to the expiration ofthe 240.17a-3, 240.-17a-4 and 240.17a-11(c), the Commis-sion again deferred the expiration dateof these interpretations until June 1,1976. Thereafter, the Board formally filedits proposed recordkeeping and preserva-tion requirements which, pursuant toSection 19(b) of the Act, were publishedfor public comment on April 30, 1976.P Infiling the proposed rules, the Bohrd con-sented to an extension of the statutorydeadline for CommissloA action thereonimposed by Section 19(b) of the Act fromthirty-five days after their publicationto ninety days after their filing (July 7,1976), five weeks after the scheduledexpiration of the Commission's interpre-tations of its reeordkeeping and preser-vation 4d. 24-25, FR at 23, 26-27, 40 FR at 57794.'Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12021 (Jan. 15, 1976), 41 FR 3469 (Jan. 23, 1976).7 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12288(March 31, 1976), 41 PR 15842 (April 15,1976). , 8 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12362(April 23, 1976), 41 F. 18175 (April 30, 1976).'

On that date, the Commission transmitted to the Board a letter sug- gesting that the Board employ a more generic and flexible drafting pattern inits proposed rules. The Commission notedthat such an approach would be less likely to require signiflcant adjustments and a continuing interpretive effort inorder to avoid imposing all undue burdenupon brokers and dealers engaged in diverse types of business. That same day,the Board extended until September 15, 1976 the deadline for Commission actionwith respect to propose. Board Rules G-8, G-9 and G-10. On September 14, 1976, the Board, observing that further discussion concerning its proposed rulesand the Commission's position thereonmight be necessary, consented to an-other deferral of the statutory deadlineuntil October 27, 1976 and noted that \"apfurther extension may prove necessary.\" As a result of these circumstances, theCommission granted Its most recent ex-tension of these interpretations whichis now scheduled to expire on Janu-ary 1, 1977. Subsequently, the Commission issuedan order on October 13, 1970 Institutinga proceeding pursuant to Section 10(b)of the Act to determine whether the pro-posed Board Rules C-8, G-9 and a-10should be approved or dsapproved.\" -The Commission instituted the afore-mentioned proceeding because of its be-lief that it was necessary to considerwhether, in light of the importance ofuniform and adequate recordkeepingand preservation systems to the overallregulatory structure, the Board's pro-posed rules were consistent with the re-quirements of the Act and the rules andregulations thereunder applicable to theBoard. Prior to the commencement of hear-ings with respect to the aforementionedproceeding, representatives of the Boardand the Commission met and announcedthat the Commission and the Board hadreached an \"understanding respectingthe recordkeeping requirements of mu-nicipal securities brokers and municipalsecurities dealers which will eliminatethe need to comply with more than oneset of recordkeeping rules.

The Commissioner, in the FEDERAL 'REGISTER of March 14,1973 (38 FR 6964), issued a final regulation under \u00a7 102.5 (21 CFR 102.5) establishing a common or usual name for seafood cocktails, that provides that the name-of the food, as declared on the label, shall include a prominent statement.of the percentage by weight of the seafood ingredient in the product (e.g., \"shrimp cocktail, con- tains 30 percent shrimp\"). The Commissioner, in the FEDERAL REGISTER of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20742), issued a final regulation under \u00a7 102.11 (21 CFR 102.11) establishing a common or usual -name for frozen \"heat and serve\" dinners that provides, inter alia, that the name of the food, as declared on -the label, shall include a prominent declaration of the three or more dish components of the dinner in their order of descending predominance by weight (e.g., \"ham dinner, contains ham, mashed potatoes, and peas\"). Both documents provided that all la- beling ordered after December 31, 1973 and all labeling used on products shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1974 must comply. The Commissioner, in the FEDERAL REGISTER of November 14, 1974 (39 FR 40184), postponed the De- cember 31, 1974 effective date for these and certain other regulations until June 30,1975. On February 27, 1974, the American Frozen Food Institute (A=') filed anaction in the United States District Courtfor the District of Columbia seeking to have the regulations establishing com- mon or usual names for seafood cock- tails and frozen \"heat and Serve\" din- ners declared invalid (American Frozen Food Institute v. Weinberger, Civil Ac- tion No. 74-354). Thereafter, AFFI peti- tioned the Commissioner to stay the con- tested regulations pending the outcome of the litigation. The Commissioner, In the FEDERAL REGIs ER of June 23, 1975 (40 FR 26267), announced that he was staying the effectvie date of the two reg- ulations \"until further notice.\" On March 30, 1976, United States Dis- trlct Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr., is- sued a decision which upholds the chal- lenged regulations in all respects (413 F. Supp. 548 (D.D.C. 1976)). A copy of this decision Is on file in the office of the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Admini- tration, Rat 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane. Rockviile, MD 20857, and may be seen between the hours of 9 am. and 4 pm. Monday throbgh Friday. In view of Judge Robinson's decision, the Commissioner has concluded that thb stay of the two regulations should be revoked and a new effective date established. The Commissioner is aware that AFF is pursuing an appeal of the decision by Judge Robinson. However, the Commis- sioner does not believe that the stay of the effective date of the regulations should be continued pending further judicial review. Such a practice would encourage frivolous appeals and petitions for certorarl in actions for review of FDA regulations; unsuccessful plaintiffs might appeal adverse decisions simply to secure further postponement of regula- -tions. The new effective date of January '1,1978, imposed by this order is the \"uni- form effective date\" currently being Im- posed by the Commissioner for all new food labeling regulations; it provides ample \"lead time\" for the ordering and implementation of new labeling. The challenged regulations have been thor- oughly reviewed by the United States District Court and have been sustained. The Commissioner concludes that fur- ther postponement of the effective date of these regulations, which do not ban any product but simply require more in- formative labeling for the consumer, would not be in the public interest. The Commissioner notes that even under the January 1, 1978, date, the Industry has secured a 3-year postponement of these regulations. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(n), 403(a) and (1) (1), 701(a) ; 52 Stat. 1047 as amended, 1055 (21 U.S.C. 343(a) and (1) (1), 371(a)) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner (21 CFR 5.1) (re- codification published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of June 15, 1976 (41 FR 24262)). the stay of \u00a7\u00a7 102.5 and 102.11, published in the FEDERAL REGISTER Of June 23. 1975, is hereby revoked.

Notice was given on September 2, 2. Section 203.556 is amended to read: 1976, at 41 FR 37226, that the Depart- ment was proposing to amend Parts 207, \u00a7203.556 Return df partial payments. 213, 221 and 231 of Chapter Ii of Title (a) For the purpose of this section, a 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations partial payment is a payment of any to reflect a change in policy with respect FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO-2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 to the disbursement of mortgage pro- ceeds for construction items under a construction contract where there is no identity of interest between the mort- gagor and the contractor. The proposed amendments to the regulations provided a procedure whereby the contractor's 10 percent holdback would be retained by th'-mortgagee to be paid into an escrow account, minus certain amounts, when the project has been substantially com- pleted, as determined by HUD. The pro- posed amendments to those parts noted above, as well as amendments to Parts .205, 232; 241. 242 and 244, also provided a procedure- whereby subcontractors vould receive information concerning the contractor's cost breakdown and notification of all advances made under the building loan agreement; HUD has received 30 responses to its invitation for public comment- on the proposed amendments, all of which have been reviewed and carefully considered. These comments are discussed below, along with the Department's actions on those comments and changes in the pro- posed rules. SPE C C COaM NrS AND CHANCES ON HOLDBACK PROVISIONS 1. General comments. Several general comments on the proposed rule were re- ceived. The majority of these comments addressed the equities of the retainage system in its entirety. HUD does not at this time consider it prudent to elim- inate a proven inducement to comple- tion of construction by the original con- tractor. Given the current availability and cost of surety bonds in the multi- fanily construction industry, a concern -which varies regionally, the Depart- ment sees no basis for the conclusion that performance and payment bonds ubstantially eliminate the- need for a holdback on the contractor's draws. However, the Department does believe that a contractor who has completed construction in conformance with its construction.contract should receive the holdback regardless of the mortgagor's status with the project. These amend- -ments are therefore limited to eliminat- ing the possibility of loss of retainage following completion of construction, thereby reducing the potential for in- equity to both contractors and subcon- tractors. Comments presenting alter- natives to the current retainage proce- dures, such as, line item retainage with release upon line item completion, do not adequately consider the processing delays that, could result from monitor- ing and approving several retainages for each project. 2. Prohibition against identity of inter- est. E.g., \u00a7 207.26a. Several comments were received requesting that the pro-posed amendments be expanded to cover a contractor and a mortgagor sharing an identity of interest. The final regulations have not been extended to such situa- tions. TheDepartment considers the con- tractor's identity of interest with the mortgagor to offer significant advantages to the contractor In negotiating for re-RULES AND REGULATIONS 763 lease of the holdback under the present occur until actual deposit In escrow.

February 11, 1976 (41 FE 6073) amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CPR Part 1) under sec- tion 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 were proposed in order to provide a definition of the term \"Integrated aux- iliary of a church\". After consideration of all such relevant matter as was pre- sented by Interested persons regarding the rules proposed, certain changes were made, and the proposed amendments of the regulations subject to the changes In- dicated below, are adopted by this docu- ment. The proposed regultions required thatin order to be qualified as an integrated auxiliary, an organization's primary pur- pose must be to carry out the tenets, functions and principles of faith of the organization and the organization's ac- tivities must directly promote religious activity among the members of the church. The requirements of the pro- posed regulations will not be applied. In- stead, under the new rules, an organiza- tion affiliated with a church will be con- sidered an integrated auxiliary if the principal activity of the organization is exclusively religious; that is, if It applied for exemption on its own, itwould qualify for exemption as a religious organiation.

The orphanage is dedicated to the service of the entire community in which it is located. The principal activity of the orphanago is to provide children with housing, medical care, guidance, and similar services and facilitle3 on a non-sectarian basis. Since this activity could servo as the basis for Orphanage C's exemption under section 501(c) (3) if it were not affiliated with a church, Orphanag0 0 is not an integrated auxiliary of a church with- in the meaning of paragraph (g) (5) of \u00a7 1.6033-2.

It is affiliated (within the meaning of paragraph (g) (5) (I1) of \u00a7 1.6033-2) with a church which is also exempt from Income tax as an organization described in section 501(o) (3). The home provides services exclusively to the elderly members of the church's de- nomination. The principal activity of the home is to provide the residents with hous- ing, limited nursing care, and similar serv- ices and facilities.

Although it offers courses in re- ligion, it does not provide religious training in-the sense that a seminary offers such train- ing. The principal activity of the university is to provide college and graduate level edu- cation of a general academic nature. Since this activity could servo as the basis for Uni- versity E's exemption under station 501(o) (3) if it were not affiliated with a church, t is not an Integrated auxiliary of a church within the meaning of paragraph (g) (5) of this section. In addition, because E is a college level institution, paragraph (g) (1) (vii) of this section does not apply and V is required to file a return under section 6033. Example (6). Orphanage F performs func- tions similar to those of Orphanage 0 de- scribed In example (3). However, Orphanage F does not have a legal identity separate from that of the church. Thus Orphanage F is not itself exempt from tax as an organization described In section 501(c) (3), and is not an Integrated auxiliary of a church. The excep- tion from filing a return under section 6033 accorded to the church of which Orphanage F is a part also applies to Orphanage F Itself, Accordingly, Orphanage F is not required to file a return under section 6033.

Federal agency heads, including the Secretary of L bor, are authorized by that Act to award, compromise, or settle claims not in excess of $25,000. The Secretary of Labor is also granted discretionary au- thority under-section 416(b) of the Com- prehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to settle claims in amounts up to $500 for personal injury or prop- erty damage which arise out of the oper- ation of the Job Corps but are not cog- nizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In addition, the MJitary Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act au- thorizes the settlement of claims made by employees for damage to or the loss of personal property incident to Govern- ment service; the maximum recovery allowable on any claim is $15,000. The Secretary of Labor has delegated the authority and responsibility for awarding, compromising or settling such claims as may, be filed with the Depart- ment of Labor to the Solicitor of Labor. Included within the delegation is the authority for issuing regulations and es- tablishing procedures for the processing and adjudication of claims. The proce- dures governing the filing, processing, and adjudication of claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act and designating the Deputy Solicitor as Claims Officer are currently set forth in section 2.5 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as supplemented by Chapter 5-600, Sec- tion 2 of the Department of Labor Man- ual of Administration. The Department of Labor is reissuing as a new Part 15 the regulations which establish procedures for the filing, proc- essing and adjudication of claims filed under the aforementioned statutes to re- flect decentralization within the Office of the Solicitor for handling various claims against the Department under the Federal Tort Claims Act and related statutes. This function was previously handled entirely by the Deputy Solicitor of- Labor. The Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors listed in section 15.4 (b) of this part are being au- thorized to award, compromise or settle claims filed with the Department except thatclaims which exceed $2,500 or which involve a new precedent or novel point of law or question of policy are expressly reserved to the Deputy Solicitor. Claims filed under section 416(b) of the Com- prehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 will be processed exclusively by the appropriate Regional Solicitor or Associate Regional Solicitor.

[FR Doc.'77- Filed 1-3-77;8:45 am] Title 32-National Defense CHAPTER I-OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PART 256-AIR INSTALLATIONS COMPATIBLE USE ZONES Under authority of the National Secu- rity Act of 1947 as amended, 61 Stat. 495 and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 a notice of proposed rule making on Department of Defense policy on Air Installations Com- patible Use Zones was published at 41 FR 36030 August 26, 1976. Public comment was invited during the period ending September 30,1976. Two commentors questioned the use of Ldn 65. 70, 75 and 80 contours, one sug- gesting the addition of Ldn 60. The Ldn 65 and 75 contours were selected for plot- ting as they will most nearly approximate the previously used CNR Zone 2 and 3 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL '42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS contours. The Ldn 70 and 80 contours have been added since data to permit their plotting Is usually obtainable with little additional effort when data to plot Ldn 65 and 75 is being obtained and since knowledge of the location .of these contours should provide information of value to the planner. No Department of Defense studies have indicated that the Ldn 65 contour significantly affect areas surrounding air installations. Thus to plot lower contours could have the ad- verse affect of possibly indicating a prob- lem whiere none exists. Another comment received suggested the immediate adoption of \"C\" weighted noise levels for the description of inter- mittent impulse noises. The notice of pro- posed rule making has stated that use of \"C\" weighting was being considered and, since it appears that \"C\" weighting most closely approximates the response of the human ear to such noises, it is adopted in \u00a7 256.10(h). Several comments regarding the ex- tent of local involvement in the prepara- tion of Air Installations Compatible Use Zone studies were received. Among these were: (a) That federal acquisition of real estate literests be subject to local authorization and public hearings (b) That no real estate interests be ac- quired until local officials have exhausted all possibilities of compatible use zoning. (c) That funding of local, regional and state planning agencies be provided. (d) That all parts of Air Installations Com- patible Use Zone plans be made public. Acquisition of real estate interests by the Department of Defense must be au- thorized by the Congress in all except minor acquisitions. The requirements of OMB Circular A-95, the National Envi- ronmental Policy Act, and the Air In- stallations Compatible Use Zone policy all are intended to assure (1) maximum fea- sible participation by local authorities (2) that complete information is avail- able to such activities and (3) that thdir opinions and comments ar6 fully consid- ered. However, authoriation by local Governments as a prerequisite to Federal action Is considered inappropriate since the authorizing function should properly remain with the Congress. The requirement that all recourse to local government action be exhausted prior to acquisition outside the clear zone is Intended to assure that local officials be given every opportunity to enact com- patible zoning. Indeed this is the pre- ferred means of achieving compatible use. The comment may have been occa- sioned by a misprint in the 5th and 6th line of proposed \u00a7 256.4(b) (2) (ii) (B) which referred to \"compatible use con- trol\" when it should have read \"compat- ible use-zoning.\" The Department of 'Defense has no funds authorized for the purpose of as- sisting local governments in AICUZ planning efforts. However, such funds may be available in programs adminis- tered by other departments. It is intended that all parts of the Air Installations Compatible Use Zone plans be made public. Indeed as statedabove, except in very minor Instances,the Department of Defense cannot ac- quire interest in land without the author- ization of Congress, preparation of en- vfronmental impact analyses, and the coordination process of OMB Circular A-95. It was also suggested that more em- phasis be given to the ieduction of un- necessary flying activities. It is the posi- tion of the Department of Defense that only necessary flying is taking place or is anticipated. The Air Installations Compatible Use Zone policy is designed to assure that necessary flying activities can continue. A commenter suggested that \"Reason- able planning areas and land use guide- lines\" \u00a7 256.4(b) (ill) was imprecise in that \"reasonable\" planning areas could be construed to include entire takeoff and descent areas. The comment is cor- rect. The intent was that \"reasonable\" modify \"Guidelinis\" not \"planning areas\" and the rule has been changed to reflect this. A very interesting comment suggested that Environmental Impact Statements and Economic Studies be performed to determine the impact of an Air Installa- tions Compatible Use Zone study, pre- sumably prior to releasing the study. The suggestion is that the very existence of an Air Installations Compatible Use Zone study can have an economic and envi-, ronmental Impact on an area. It, is as much to alleviate this exact problem as for any' other reason that the Air In- stallations Compatible Use Zone policy requires close cooperation with local offi- cdals throughout its development. This will assure that any economic effects are minimized or optimized. Compatible zon- ing, for instance, can often increase the value of land when commercial or resi- dential uses are found to be desirable. With respect to the Environmental Im- pact Statement process, a statement was filed prior to adoption of the original Air Installations Compatible Use Zone policy and it is the opinion of the Department of Defense that the overall effect of the program, as well as the effect of individ- ual studies will be such as to enhance the quality of the environment. This, too, was the opinion of most commenters re- sponding to the draft Environmental Im- pact Statement. Therefore, while it is considered correct to prepare environ- mental impact analysis and economic assessments on actions taken as a result of -an Air Installations Compatible Use study, the requirement-for their prepara- tion prior to making the study would be inappropriate and in many ways redun- dant to the study itself. One commenter suggested that actual noise surveys should be mandatory, not done only \"if necessary\". The reason that noise surveys are not a mandatory requirement of this policy is that com- puter programs have been developed that provide good accuracy and which must often be relied upon as in a case where it is planned to assign an aircraft to an area in the future but where noise sur- veys cannot be made because the air- craft is not yet assigned. Prudence wouldrequire that such predictions be checkedwhen feasible and it is intended that such checking be accomplished. In addition to the above changes, some minor typographical and spelling errors have been'corrected and a reference to ,the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations and Logisties In \u00a7 250.5(h) has been corrected to read the \"Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for In- stallations and Housing\".

This Part: (a) sets forth Department of Defense policy on achieving compati- ble use of public and private lands in the vicinity of military airfields' (b) doinem (1) required restrictions on the uses and heights of natural and man-made ob- jects In the vicinity of air Installations to provide for safety of flight and to assuro that people and facilities are not con- centrated in areas susceptible to aircraft accidents; and (2) desirable restrictions on land use to assure Its compatibility with the characteristics, including noise, of air installations operations; (c) de- scribes the procedures by which Air In- stallations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) may be defined: aid (d) pro- vides policy on the extent of Govern- ment interest In real property within these zones which may be retained or acquired to protect the operational ca- pability of active military airfields (sub- ject in each case to the availability of required authorizations and appropria- tions). \u00a7 256.2 Applicability. This Part applies to air installations of the Military Departments located within the United States, Its territories, trusts, and possessions. \u00a7 256.3 Criteria. (a) General. The Air Installations Compatible Use Zone for each military air installation shall consist of (1) land areas upon which certain uses may ob- struct the airspace or otherwise be haz- ardous to aircraft operations, and (2) land areas which are exposed to the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS health, safety or welfare hazards of air- craft operations. -(b) Height of Obstructions. The land area and height standards defined In AFM 86-8,2 NavFac P-272 and P-80,2 and TM 5-803-4 2 will be used for purposes of height restriction criteria. 1c) Accident Potential. (1) General. (i) Areas immediately beyond the ends of runways and, along primary flight paths aie subject to more aircraft acci- dents than other areas. For this reason, these areas should remain undeveloped, or if developed should be only sparsely developed in order to limit, as much as possible, the adverse effects of a possible aircraft accident. (i) DoD fixed wing runways are sepa- rated into two types for the purpose of defining accident potential areas. Class A runways are those restricted to light air- craft (See \u00a7 256.6) and which do not have the potential for development for heavy or higlh performance aircraft use or for which no foreseeable requirement for such use exists. Typically these runways have less than 10% of their operations involving Class B aircraft (\u00a7 256.6) and are ress than 8000 feet long. Class B run- ways are all other fixed wing runways. (ili) The following descriptions of Ac- cident Potential Zones are guidelines only. Their strict application would re- sult in increasing -the safety of the gen- eral public but would not provide com- plete protection against the effects of aircraft accidents. Such a degree of pro- tection is probably impossible to achieve. Local situations may differ significantly from the assumptions and data upon which these guidelines are based and re- quire individual study. Where it is de- sirable to restrict the density of develop- ment of an-area, it is not usually possible to state that one density is safe and another is not. Safety is a relative termand the objective should be the realiza- tion of the greatest degree of safety that can bereasonably attained. (2) Accident potential azzd clear zones (See \u00a7 256.7). (i) The area immediately beyond the end of a runway is the \"Clear Zone\", an area which possesses a high potential for accidents, and has tradi- tionally been acquired by the Govern- ment in fee and kept clear of obstruc- tions to flight.(ii) Accident Potential Zone I (APZ I) is the area beyond the clear zone which possesses a significant potential for ac- cidents. (iii) Accident Potential Zone II (APZ I) is an area beyond APZ I having ameasurable potential for accidents. (iv) Modifications to APZs I and II will be considered if: (A) The runway is infrequently used. -(B) The prevailing wind conditions are such that a large percentage (i.e., over 80 percent) of the operations are in one direction. I (C) Most aircraft do not overfly the APZs as defined herein during normal \" 2Filed as Part of original.

DECEUIBER INTERIOR [Circular No. 2415] PART '4110-GRAZING ADMINISTRA- TION (INSIDE GRAZING DISTRICTS) (THE FEDERAL RANGE CODE FOR GRAZING DISTRICTS) PART 4120-GRAZING- ADMINISTRATION (OUTSIDE GRAZING DISTRICTS AND EXCLUSIVE OF ALASKA); GENERAL Records and Administrative Procedures; Grazing Fees As directed by the 'tFederal Land Pol- icy and Management Act of 1976\" (80 Stat, 2743, 43 USC 1701), notice is here-by given that grazing fees for domestic livestock grazing on public lands ad- ministered by the Bureau'of Land Man-agement for the fee year starting March 1, 1977, will be held at the 197b levels aspublished in the January 2, 1976 FED- ERAL REGISTER (41 FR 13). Public landssubject to this notice include all landsadmtnitered by the Bureau except theMcGregor Military Reservation in New Mexico and the Fort Mead Military Res-ervation in South Dakota where fees forgrazing use are'established through com- petitive bidding for the forage resourceunder the Material Sales Act.The Federal Land Policy and Manage- ment Act amends Sec. 3 of the TaylorGrazing Act by deleting the two-part grazing fee consisting of a range use and a range-improvement fee. The Act alsodirects that 50 percent of the grazing fee receipts for grazing domestic livestock onthe public lands (other than ceded In-dian lands) administered under the Tay-lor Grazing Act be credited to a separate account in the United States Treasury for the range betterment program.- Eventhough section 401(b) (1) of the Act pro- vides that grazing receipts from the o & C lands are subject to the same percent- age distribution as receipts from landsadministered under the Taylor Grazing Act, section 701(b) of the 1976 Act ne- gates that provision keeping the distribu-tion of 0 & C land grazing receipts underthe Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C.1181(d)). Section 4115.2-1(k)(1) (i) and (iv) of 43 CFR is amended to reflect these provisions. The postponement of a grazing fee in- crease for 1977 requires an adjustment inthe annual Increment schedule to attainfair market value of range forage at the beginning of the 1980 fee year. This rule- making amends \u00a7 4115.2-1(k) (1) (i) toprovide for three equal annual incre-ments beginning March 1, 1978, to at-tain that value on March 1, 1980. In thepast, the fees have been adjusted tomaintain comparability between publicand private grazing charges. The adjust-ment establishes the rate of Increase Or decrease of the fees based on privateland lease rates for similar types ofrangeland. The Federal Land Policy and Manage-ment Act of 1976 requires that the graz-ing fee for the grazing fee year beginningon March 1, 1977, be the same as thatfor the grazing fee year that began onMarch 1, 1976. Since the grazing fee forthe grazing year 1077 has been set bystatute, publication of proposed rulemak-ing and delay of effective date for 30days are unnecessary. These actions are -in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(1)(B) and 553(d)(2). Therefore, this rulemaking Is published as a final rulemaking and shall becomeeffective January 4, 1977. The Department of the Interior hasdetermined that this document does notcontain a major proposal requiringpreparation of an Inflation ImpactStatement under Executive Order 11821and OMB Circular A-107. To carry out the action as described herein, 43 CMF 4115.2-1(k) (1) and4125.1-1(m) are amended as follows: 1. Section 4115.2-1(k) (1) is amended by revising subparagraphs (i), (i) and(iv) to read as follows: \u00a7 4115.2-1 License and pc-rnut nrocedures, requirements and conditioni,. * * * $ (k) Fees, payments and relund.-(1)Fees. (1) Fees will be charged for the grazing of all livestock on pu~blic lands at a rateper 'animal unit month, except that nofee will be charged for a free-use license,Fees for any fee year will be published asa notice in the FEDERAL RE(ISTER. (ii) Fees will be established by theSecretary ir equal annual increments ef- fective with the fee year beginnin\"March 1, 1978, to attain fair marketvalue of range forage beginning Marh 1 of the 1980 fee year. Fair market value is that value established by the Western Livestock Grazing Survey of 1966 or asdetermined by any study which may beconducted to update the fee based. An-nual adjustments will also be made forany of the 1978-80 fee years and there-after to reflect changes in the currentmarket value as determined by an ade-qftate index(es). (iv) Fifty percent of the grazing fees collected for grazing domestic livestockon public lands (other than ceded Indian FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS lands) under the Taylor Grazing Act shall be deposited In a separate account in the United States Treasury for the range betterment program. 3.

No. 1021 FOOD STAMP PROGRAM Proposed Rulemaking/ Pursuant to the authority contained in the Food Stamp Act of 1964, as amended (78 Stat. 703, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 2011- 2026), notice is hereby given that the Food and Nutrition Service, Department of Agriculture, proposes to amend Part 272 of its regulations governing the oper- ation of the Food Stamp Program, 7 CFR 272. The proposed amendment isfor the purpose of allowing the Food andNutrition Service (FNS) to immediately withdraw the authorization of a partici-pating firm which NS finds no longer helps to further the purposes of the pro-gram, subject to the right to request ad- ministrative review. The regulations cur-rently call for FNS to require a firm to submit a new application for authbriza- tion whenever FNS has reason to believethat the firm no longer qualifies for authorization, and then make the deter-mination on whether to deny reauthori- zation. The Department intends to delete the provision requiring a new application since that step in the process is unneces- sary. Interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions, or objections re- garding the proposed amendment toNancy Snyder, Director, Food Stamp Di- vision, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250. In order to be sure of con- sideration, all submissions must be re- ceived not later than February 3, 1977. All comments, suggestions, or objec- tions received by this date will be consid- ered before the final regulations are Is-sued. Comments, suggestions, or objec-tions will be open to public inspection pursuant to 7 CFU 1.27(b) at the Office of the Director during regular businesshours (8:30 am to 5:00 pm) at 500 12th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C., Room 650. It is proposed to amend \u00a7 272.1 by de- leting paragraph (g), relettering para- graph (h) as paragraph (g), and adding a new paragraph (h). The new para- graph (h) would read as follows: PART 272-PARTICIPATION OF RETAIL FOOD STORES, WHOLESALE FOODCONCERNS, MEAL SERVICES AND BANKS \u00a7 272.1 Approval of retail food stores, wholesale food concerns, and meal services. (h) FNS shall periodically review thenature and scope of participating firms'business. If FNS receives new or addi- tional information about a firn involv- ing any of the criteria set forth in para- graphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, FNS shall make a determination as to whether the firm's continued participa- tion serves to further the purposes of the program.

A notice that the Secretary was pre- paring to make a preliminary determina-tion was published in the FEDERAL REGIS- TER November 26, 1976 (41 FR 52060, 52061) in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553. Data, views and recom-mendations were submitted pursuant to such notice and 'consideration giventhereto to the extent permitted by law. Fifty-one responses were received. Seventeen favored a return to the oldprogram of acreage allotments and marketing quotas, 3 requested no govern- ment programs, and, of those comment- ing with regard to setaside, 18 were infavor of no set-aside while 13 were in favor of set-aside. After consideration ofall responses along with other informa-tion available to the Department, the Secretary has preliminarily determinedthat a set-aside of cropland shall not bein effect for the 1977 crop of rice.(Sec. 101, 63 Sta 1051, as amended (U.S.C, 1441)). Under a market oriented approach to farm programs without fear of loss of allotment farmers are totally free to plant other crops in greater market de- mand than rice. The acreage available for the production of rice Is three to four times the allotment. Therefore, it Is be- lieved a required set-aside program would be ineffective and also interfere with a market oriented program. Notice is hereby given that the Secre- tary has preliminarily determined thata set-aside of cropland shall not be In effect for the 1977 crop of rice. As pre- scribed by the Act, a final determination will be made not later than April 1, 1977. Effective Date: This preliminary deter- mination is effective December 29, 1976.

Z; Docket No. R-00721 TRUTH IN LENDING Discounts for Payment in Cash Pursuant to the authority contained in the Truth In Lending Act (15 USC 1604), the Board of Governors proposes to amend Part 226 (Regulation Z) to im- plement changes and clarifications made by Public Law 94-222 which wyas signed into law on February 27, 1976. One ofthe purposes of the law was to clarify the fact that section 167 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 USC 1666f) was In-tended by Congress to exempt discounts of up to five per cent for payment In cash instead of by credit card from dis- closure as finance charges but was not intended to provide a similar exemption from disclosure for surcharges of up to five per cent on the use of credit cards. Public Law 94-222 not only providedthat surcharges do not qualify for the section 167 exemption from disclosurebut also prohibited the Imposition of surcharges on the use of credit cards for three years. The clarifying statutory amendments also-provided that any dis- count qualifying under section 167 shall not be considered a charge for credit FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES under State usury, disclosure, and other credit laws. The proposed amendments to Regula- tion Z to implement the discount-sur- charge provisions of Public Law 94-222 add three new definuitions to \u00a7 226.2, amend paragraphs (1) (ill and (4) of \u00a7 226.4(i) and add a new paragraph (5) to \u00a7 226.4(i). The definitions added are those of-\"discount,\" 'surcharge,\" and \"regular price.\" When read in conjunc- tion with these definitions, \u00a7 226.4() provides that only discounts and not sur- charges qualify for the exemption con- tained'in section 167. The definition of \"discount\" read to- gether with that of \"regular price\" is intended to clarify that the price differ- ential resulting from a pricing system In which the merchant tags or posts both a credit card price and a cash price is a discount and qualifies for nondisclosure under section 167. Under these defini- tions, the following examples of pricing situations would involve \"discounts\" that would not have to be disclosed if offered in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 226.4(i): 1. Merchant posts or tags goods with a single price which is charged for credit purchases and offers up to a 5 percent discount off this price to cash purchas- ers. 2. Merchant posts or tags goods with both a credit price and a cash price which is up to 5 percent lower than the credit price. 3. Merchant does not tag or post -prices, but offers cash purchasers a price which is up to 5 percent lower than that offered to credit purchasers. Any pricing system in which the only price tagged or posted is a cash price which is not available to someone pur- chasing with a credit card would involve a \"surcharge\" and would, therdfore, be illegal until February 27, 1979. The proposed amendment to para- graph (1) -(iii) of \u00a7 226.4(i), would prevent consumers from being misled by a low advertised price when there is an addi- tional charge for credit card purchases. Advertisements promoting goods or serv- ices for which a discount for cash is of- fered would not have to state any price, but if the lower cash price were disclosed,the credit price would also have to be disclosed. The proposed revision of paragraph (4) of \u00a7 226.4(i) makes it clear that it is against the law for merchants to impose .surcharges, on the use of credit cards until February 27, 1979, even if the amount of the surcharge is disclosed as a finance charge. .The proposed paragraph (5) of \u00a7 226.4 (i) implements the provision of Public Law 94-222 which states that a discount for payment in: cash instead of by credit card which qualifies for the exemption under section 167 shall not be considered a charge for credit for purposes of State laws on usary, credit cost disclosure, and permissible credit charges. This provi- sion was necessary because the fact that such discounts are not considered finance charges for purposes of Truth In Lend- ing- has no effect on their treatmentunder State law. This provision assuresthat the offering of a discount for cash in accordance with \u00a7 226A() will not inadvertently place the merchant or the card issuer in violation of State law.

(tt) The term \"regular price\" meansthe tag or posted price charged for property or a service if a single price is tagged or posted. If two prices for the property or service are tagged or posted, one price which is charged for cash pur- chases and one which is charged for credit card purchases, or If no price for the property or, service Is tagged or posted, the \"regular price\" is the price charged for credit card purchases of the property or service. (uu). The term \"discount.\" as used in \u00a7 226.4(1), means a reduction made from the \"regular price,\" as defined n \u00a7 2262 (tt). (vv) The term \"surcharge,\" as used in \u00a7 226.4(1), means an additional charge added to the \"regular price,\" as defined in \u00a7 226.2(tt), to arrive at the selling price of property or services for credit card purchases. \u00a7 226.4 [Amendedl 2. To Implement sections 11(a) and 3(c) of Pub.

This paragraph shal cease to be effective on February 27.1979. (c) new paragraph (5) is added as fol- lows: (5) Notwithstanding any other provi- slons of this Part, any discount for cash which. pursuant to paragraph (1), is not a finance charge forpurposes of this Part shall not be considered a finance charge or other charge for credit under the laws of any State relating to: (D usury; or (ii) disclosure of information in con- nection with credit extensions; or (i11) the types, amounts, or rates of charges, or the element or elements of charges Permissible In connection with the extension oruse of credit.

The Commission also an- nounced the the and Form herein are pri- marily of a minor, technical nature and are designed to facilitate the application of a streamlined system of financial and operational reporting, and to achieve a further reduction In the quantity and frequency of reports which must be filed by brokers and dealers. INTRODUCTION In Mak 1974 the Commission an- nounced the membership of the Report Coordinating Group (\"Group\"), a fed- eral advisory committee established to advise the Commission on the consolida- tion and reduction of reporting require- ments and to assist the Commission in the development of a key regulatory re- port At its first meeting on June 3, 1974 the Group determined to give the high- -est priority to developing recommenda- tions regarding a uniform financial and operational reportV On August 9, 1974 the* Commission is- sued guidelines for a uniform financial and operational report. In accordance with these guidelines the Group reviewed the reports, forms and similar material required of brokers and dealers by the -Commission, the self-r'egulatory organi- zations and others. The Group, with the the banking community, and the legal and accounting professions, developed a FOCUS-Report Discussion Paper which 'The Report Coordinating Group was es- tablished in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. Appendix 1. c The Group also concentrated Its efforts on the development of uniform registration and record retention forms. Uniform regis- tration forms for brokers and dealers were adopted by the Commirslou on May 16, 1975 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11424). Subsequent to the submission of the Re- port Coordinating Group's First Annual Re- port, a Trading Forms Task Force deliberated for several months and recommended the elimination or consolidation of the 104 trad- ing forms described in the First Annual Re- port. The Task Force proposed simplified and consolidated forms as a replacement. The affected exchanges have agreed almost unl- formly to implement the proposed simplified trading forms as soon as supplies of current forms are exhausted, and not later than De- cember 31, 1976. An Assessment Forms Task Force working during the same period has made additional proposals for the further simplification of assessment procedures. The Group resolu- tions im favor- of simplification and automa- tion oft assessment procedures have been transmitted to the Securities Investor Pro- tection Corporation and the National Market Advisory 1osrd. For backgr6und and prior status of these. two projects, see First Annual Report of the Report Coordinating Group, June-16, 1975. and Second Annual Report of the- Report- Coordinating Group, April 26, L1976 -.dedicated assistance of a staff work- group comprised of members of the self- regulatory community, brokerage firms, was distributed on October 15, 1974, and submitted its final report on this subJect on June 16, 1975.? The Commission, after considering the recommendations of the Report Coordi- nating Group and the comments thereon, believed that the adoption of a reporting system based upon and including the FOCUS Report, with some modifications to the program recommended, would pro- vide an opportunity for ,uniform indus- try-wide regulation and would substan- tially reduce the reporting burdens on the securities industry without compro- mising the interests of the public and the regulators. In an effort to achieve that goal, the Commission released the FOCUS Report for public comment on October 16, 1975.' As a result of the implementation of amended \u00a7 240.15c3-1 on January 1,1976. the existing financial and operational re- ports and the surveillance systems of the Commission and the self-regulatory organizations were destined to become obsolete as of that date. In order to avoid an amendment to existing forms which would be followed by a restructuring of a substantial portion of the reporting sys- tem, the Commission expedited Its con- sideration of the FOCUS Report and re- lated rule changes and announced the adoption of the uniform reporting sys- tem on December 17, 1975, to become ef- fective January 1,1976.? In the adopting release, the Commi- sion noted that that \" * I while the reporting system is eflIclent in theory, and the form satisfactory In substance, certain modifications may subsequently be necessary in order to achieve a smoother practical application.\" The Commission expressed the view that those areas which may require addi- tional refinement would become ap- parent after several months' experience with the FOCUS reporting structure, and stated its intention to periodically re- 3 Comments suggesting further simplLfica- tion and changes In the items of the FOCUS Report were conslidered In the drafUtng of the FOCUS Report Revised Discurmion Paper released on December 10, 1974 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11140, Decem- ber 16, 1974). The FOCUS Report Revised Discussion Paper set forth a thrce-part re- porting format of financial and operational data to be completed by certain flrrrs at spec- ified Intervals. Subsequent to the release of the FOCUS Report Revised Dlscus'lon Paper, the Group held additional public meetings to further simplify the FOCUS Report and at the snme time improve Its effectivenes as a survel- lance tool for the Commislon and the relf- regulators. The Group released Its final rec- ommendation for a FOCUS Report In it1 First Annual Report on June 10. 1975 (Secu- rities Exchange Act Release N~o. 11499. June 16, 1975; 40 FR 27989, July 2, 1975).

Pnoposm Awmiourz or \u00a7 240.17a-4 Paragraph (b) (8) is proposed to be amended to clarify that the schedules required to be retained need only be in support of the information reported as of the annual audit date. Paragraph (b) (9) is proposed to be added so as to require the retention for three years of the records describing a broker's or dealer's procedures for ob- taining possession or control of custom- er' fully paid and excess margin se- curities in with the monthly and quarterlY reports. Subparagraph (a) (2) is pro- posed to be amended in order to clarify that subparagraphs (a) (2) (1) and (a) (2) (f1) apply to brokers and dealers which clear any transactions, whether such transactions are customer or non- customer. Similarly, subparagraph (a) (2) (1i) as proposed to be amendad would Apply only to those brokers and dealers which neither clear transactions (customer or non-customer) nor carry customer accounts. Subparagraph (a) (3) is proposed to be amended to provide that allmonthlY and quarterly reports received pursuant to paragraph (a) are deemed to be confi- dential.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES zation other than its designated exam- ining authority may request relief from the filing requirements specified in para- graph (b). The information which must be included in such request is specified in 'proposed subparagraphs (b) (6) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). It should be noted that the proposed exemption provided for in this subparagraph is in -addition to the Commission's existing general exemptive aithority in subparagraph (1) (3). Subparagraph (b) (1) as proposed to be amended would permit those brokers and dealers which regularly file a re- port on Part IIA in accordance with paragraph (a) to file a report on Part IIA In satisfaction of the requirements of paragraph (b). (C) Customer statements. Paragraph (c) is proposed to be amended to require that audited statements be furnished within 105 days after the date of such sbatements and unaudited statements furnished within 45 days after the date of such statements. This amendment would provide a fixed, determinable date as of which the statements must be furnished. (D) Nature and form of reports. Para- graph (e) is proposed to be amended to revise and update the procedures which the auditor must utilize in com- paring amounts reported on Form SIPC-7 and amounts reported on the an- nual report of financial statements. In addition, a statement requiring dis- closure as to a broker's or dealer's pro- prietary interest Is proposed to be added to subparagraph (e) (2). (E) Qualifications, designation and re- placement of accountants. Paragraph (f) is proposed to be amended to re- quire those brokers and dealers which are exempted from the certification re- quiremenits of \u00a7 240.17a-5 to nevertheless notify the Commission, by December 10 of each year,. of the date as of which the unaudited report will be prepared. In addition, newly-registered brokers and dealers would be required to file the notice pursuant to subparagraph (f) (2) within 30 days after the effective date of registration. These proposed amend- ments would revise the designation of accountant file so as to provide the Com- mission and the self-regulatory organi- zations with a comprehensive schedule of proposed auditors and report dates for each year. (F) Audit objectives. Subparagraph (g) (1) (iv) as proposed to be amended would require the independent public accountant to review, as part of the an- nual audit, those procedures described by the broker or dealer in section 240.15c3-3 (d) (4) with respect to the pos- session or control of fully paid and ex- cess margin securities. This ieview would ensure the adequacy of the proce- dures upon which the broker or dealer bases its quarterly representation in Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) .0 10 This review is one aspect of a proposed re- vised system for ensuring brokers' and deal- ers' compliance with the requirement to maintain physical possession' or control of fully paid and excess margin securities in ac-.(G) Filing Period with Respect to Part I.of Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617). The time period specified in \u00a7 240.17a-5 (a) (2) (i) for the filing of a report in Part I of Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) is ten busi- ness days after the end of each month. Under the provisions of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") plan filed pursuant to \u00a7 240.17a-5 (a) (4) and ap- proved by the Commission on December 17, 1975 brokers and dealers for which the NYSE is the designated examining authority have been permitted tern-, porarily to file a report on Part I with- in seventeen business days. This longer filing period was deemed to be necessary, at least for an initial phase-in period, because it appeared that the substantial size and complexity of business of the NYSE firms would result-in a more dif- ficult transition to a new reporting system. Brokers and dealers have been subject to the new reporting system for a full year, and several firms, as well as the NYSE itself, have indicated that based on experience to *date, compliance with a filing period shorter than the current seventeen business days may not be pos- -sible for a significant number of large firms. Part I is intended to be utilized pri- marily as an early warning and surveil- lance report of key financial and opera- tional data. In order to accomplish this purpose effectively, the report must be received as quickly as possible after the close of each month. While there may be a number of registrants who will re- quire a period longer than the specified ten business days within which to file, such extensions should be granted on an individual basis pursuant to the Commis- sion's authority under \u00a7 240.17a-5(1) (3). Accordingly, the Commission has deter- mined that, commencing with the report fildd on Part I for the month of April, 1977, all brokers and dealers, other than those specifically granted extensions of time pursuant to \u00a7 240.17a-5 (1) (3), shall file such report within ten business days, after the end of the month. Brokers and dealers wishing to re- questan extension are urged to submit written requests to the Commission promptly, and, in any event, no later than January 31, 1977. The extension of the time period for filing of Part I by NYSE members heretofore approved is cordance with the provisions of \u00a7 240.15c3-3. The other components of this system are the maintenance by the broker or dealer of a detailed description of the procedures used to obtain possession or control; a quarterly representation on Part II of Form X-17A-5 stating that the procedures have been tested and are functioning in a manner adequate to fulfill the requirements of 9 240.15c3-3; a quarterly report, on Part Xi of Form X-17A-5, of the market valuation and number of items which are not In the registrant's possession or control as of the report date, for whichthe required action -was not taken within the time frames specified in \u00a7 240.15c3-3; and a report, as of the audit date, of the market valuatioh and number of items for which, under the provisions of \u00a7 240.15c3-3, instruc- tions to reduce to possession or controlshould have been issued and were not.extended to reports due to be filed for periods ending up to and Including March 31, 1977. (H) Proposed Amendment of Form X- 17A-5 (Q 249.617) .\" Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) would be amended, beginning with the report filed as of the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1977, to incor- porate certain data now obtained from reports filed on Form X-17A-10 (Q 249.- 618) and Form X-17A-20 (Q 249.636). This consolidation eliminates the need for the latter forms and substantially decreases the reporting requirements of brokers and dealers by abolishing ah an- nual report on Form X-17A-10 (Q 249.- 618) and four quarterly reports on Form X-17A-20 (Q 249.636). The present State- ment of Income (Loss) contained In Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249617) would be modified to include certain Items now re- quired by \u00a7 240.17a-10. Three supplemen- tary schedules would be added to Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) and would be filed by certain brokers and dealers for the calendar quarter ending December 31 of each year. PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF \u00a7 240.17a-10 AND RELATED FoRM X-17A-lO (Q 249.618) Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would replace the present para- graph (a). The proposed paragraph (a) defines the new filing requirements of \u00a7 240.17a-10. 'Form X-17A-10 (\u00a7 249.- 618), the Commission's main source of economic data Information. would be eliminated and the data' contained therein would be obtained from the ex- isting balance sheet -from Form X-17A-5 (Q 249.617), a modified Statement of In- come (Loss) from Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) and three supplementary schedules thereto: schedule of Firm Identification Information, a schedule of consolidated Revenue Information, and a* schedule of Additional Revenue Infor- mation to be filed on an annual basis only by firms with $10 million or more In gross revenues. The proposed amend-ments would be consistent with the FOCUS concept of a layered approach to reporting: 1. Firms exempt from the filing require-ments of \u00a7 240.17a-5 (a) would, on an an- nual basis, file the Facing Page, Statement of Income (Loss), and balance shoot from Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 249.017) andthe supplementary schedules of Firm Iden-tification Information and consolidated Revenue Information (Schedules I 11). 2. All firms subject to the filing require-ments of \u00a7 240.17a-5(a) would, on an annual basis, file the Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 24D.017) sup- plementary Schedule I and Sohedulo II with their submission of Form X-17A-5 (\u00a7 240. 617) for the calendar quarter ending De- cember 31 of each -year. 3. All firms subject to the filing roquiro-ments of \u00a7 240.17a-5(a) which have gross revenues for the calendar year of $10 mil- lion dollars or more would file, on an annual basis, the proposed supplementary Sched- ules I and II and the Schedule III of Addl- \"The text of proposed amended Form X- 17A-5 (\u00a7 249.617) and the text of the pro- posed supplementary schedules are attached hereto as Appendix A.

PROPOSED A uND=.z OF \u00a7 240.17a-ll Paragraph (a), as proposed to be amended, would require a broker or dealer whose total outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory subordination agreements exceeds the maximum al- lowable for a period in excess of 90 days. in accordance with the \"provlsiofis of section 240.15c3-1(d), to give telegraphic notice as set forth in paragraph (f) and, within 24 hours thereafter, file a report on Part I or Part IIA of Form X-17A--5. (\u00a7 249.617).- A new subparagraph (4) is proposed to be added to paragraph (b), requiring those brokers and dealers subject to various provisions of \u00a7240.15c3-1 to give notice of certain events as specified in such provisions. PROPOSED AmENDLmTT OF \u00a7 240.17a-13 Paragraph (b) (5) as proposed to be amended would eliminate the provision which states that the quarterly security examination, count and verification re- quired to be made.pursuant to \u00a7 240.17a- 13 need not be carried out by the broker or dealer for the calendar quarter dur- ing which the audit date occurs. The se-curity examination, count and verifica-tion performed in the course of the audit may not meet the comprehensive standards required by \u00a7 240.17a-13 andtherefore should not be utilized as an alternative means of complying with that section. PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF \u00a7 240.17a-18 Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would expand the coverage of \u00a7 240.17a-18 from national securities ex- changes and registered national securi-ties associations to include registered clearing agencies and the Municipal Se- curities Rulemaking Board to the extentthat the latter entity promulgates forms applicable to registered brokers and dealers. The scope of \u00a7 240.17a-18 is pro- posed to be expanded in recognition ofthe changing nature of the industry andthe oversight responsibilities mandated to the Commission by the 1975 Amend- ments. Paragraph (a) is also proposed to be amended to require those entities seeking emergency adoption of a proposed new-form to request Commission approval. Paragraph (c) as proposed would cohm-pletely replace the present paragraph (c). The proposed paragraph (c) deline- ates the Commission's authority to ap- prove or disapprove proposed forms andthe procedures-by which such approvalor disapproval would be accomplished. PROPOSED ASXENDmENT or \u00a7 240.17a-19 A new paragraph (a) is proposed which would require a national securi-ties, exchange or a registered national securities association which is the desig- nated examining authority for a broker or dealer to give 24 hour telegraphic notice to the Commission's principaloffice, the Commission's Regional Officefor the region in which the member has its principal office, and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in each instance where a resignation by such broker or dealer from the designated examining authority is contemplated. The present text of \u00a7 240.17a-19 Is pro- posed to become new paragraph (b) and to be amended to require the filing of Form X-17A-19 within 5 business days of the occurrence of the change in mem- bership interest rather than \"promptly\" as is currently required. In addition, paragraph (b) is proposed to be amended to require the filing of Form X-17A-19 with the Regional Office of the Commis- sion for the region in which the member has its principal office. Finally, it is pro- posed that every national securities ex- change and registered national securities association, upon learning of a change in membership interest, be required to ad- vise such member of the member's re- sponsibilities under \u00a7 240.17a-5 Cb) to re-port certain information to the Commis- sion. These proposed amendmEnts are de- signed to eliminate aVmbigulties with re- spect to the timing of Form X-17A-19filings and to allow the Commission to respond more promptly and effectively to problems which may arise. PROPOSED A Armw NTr or \u00a7 240.17a-20 X- 17A-20 C\u00a7 249.636) Paragraph (a) (1) as proposed would replace paragraphs (a)C1) and (2) of \u00a7 240.17a-20. Proposed paragraph (a) (1) provides that a broker or dealer submitrevenue and expense information on Form X-17A-5, thereby eliminating the need for a report of revenue and expense information on Form X-17A-20. In addi- tion, certain technical modifications are proposed for present paragraphs (a) (3) and (e) which would substitute cross ref- erences from \u00a7 249.636 (Form X-17A-20) to \u00a7 249.617 (Form X-17A-5). Finally. paragraphs (a) (3) and (a) (4) would be renumbered to become paragraphs (a) (2) and (a) (3) respectively and para- braph (c) would become paragraph (b). As proposed, the present paragraph (b) would be eliminated because of the comprehensive and substantially similar requirements in \u00a7 240.17a-5(b) and \u00a7 240.17a-19 as proposed to be amended. The proposed revocation of Form X- 17A-20 \u00a7 249.636) would be effective for the calendar quarter ending March 31. 1977. PROPOSED AzmmMENT OF \u00a7 240.15c3-3 Paragraph (d) as proposed to be amended would incorporate a new sub- paragraph (4) to require those brokers and dealers subject to the provisions of \u00a7 240.15c3-3 with respect to physical pos- session or control of fully paid and ex- cess margin securities to maintain a cur-rent and detailed description of the pro- cedures which it utilizes to obtain such possession or control.

Da and b-Theso items are to be completed by only carrying firma required to ile Part IX of Form X-17A-5. Report total number of public customer accounts, regardless of the method by which those accounts are cleared. The term \"public customer\" ahall mean any person from whom or on whose behalf a broker or dealer has received or acquired or holds funds or securities for the account of such person, but shall not include a broker or dealer, or a general, special or limited partner or director or officer of the broker or dealer, or any person to the extent that such person has a claim for property or funds which by contract, agreement or under- standing. or by operation of law, is part of the capital of the broker or dealer or is sub- ordinated to the claims of creditor. of the broker or dealer.

Re- port the total number of public customer transactions executed on a national securl- ties exchange. If basis of count is an actual count place an \"1\" 1n \"actual\" box If sta- tistical method is used place an \"1\" in \"esti- mate\" box. A transaction is defined as an executed trade which results in a customer trado con- firmation. Therefore, the count of transac- tions should be taken from the customer aide and should not include confirmation correc- tions. For count purposes, several execu- tions at the same price which result in one confirmation should be counted as one trans- action. In the case where a firm uses a statement- type confIrination, each item or 'llne\" should be considered as a confirmation for purpos of cou ting transactions. For those exc-hange transactions in which the respondent acts as prncipal. beth street and customer sides arecounted as separate transactions. For non- inventory principal trna-ctions in an over- the-counter security. both the purchase for inventory and the sale to the customer shall be counted as separate transactions. Com- modity. bond, option, and other transactions ar to be reported in Item 17e. For investment company securities trans- actions in which cash or cecurities are han- died by respondent (exclude tran-satons by others such as voluntary or periodic payment plans), a count of trade confirmations should be used to obtain the transaction count. Thestreet and customer side are counted as one transaction. For underwriting transactions the takedown should be counted as one trans-action and the ultimate sale to customers Should be counted based on customers- con- firmantlons (eg. an underwriting of 2,000 shares is ultimately sold to five customer- takedown of 2,000 shares countz as one trade and the sale to five customers counts as five trades). For commodity transactions pur- chase or sale of contracts are to be counted as one trnsaction and each subsequentclo ut k4 to be counted as one transaction [e.[, five contracts of a commodity purchased in one trade (came price and on the sane day) is one transaction, subsequent sale as five separate contracts (different day or price for each) is five additional transactions). Do not include clearing house side in count. For option transactions the purchase of an option contrAct represents a transaction. For commercial paper transactions bhth the purchasse and sale should be counted as separate transactions. Count may be taken from confirmation or acknowledgement tick- ets. Items which are not strictly principal trades such as private placement rales should be Included. Repurchase agreement sales and returns should also be included in count. Corrections shall be excluded from thetran-Sction count. However, an error tran- action. that i, a transction where the vron, security was purchased and the correct se- curlty must later be purchased. Is not con- sldered a correction. For error transaction3. the original transaction and the buy and cell from the error account are to be counted as scoarate transactions. Filrm carrying public customer accountsfor other broker-dealers on a fully disclozed basis are to include trarniactionms from those accounts in their number count. Firms in- troducing accounts on a fully disclosed basis will report \"zero\" for these items. Although an actual count of transactions 13 preferred. an estimated count may be gen- erated using the following methodology: 1. Select the speciflc days for which trans- actions will be counted: (a) Randomly selecting one of the first 15 working days in the year as the starting date. (b) Selecting each 8th working date there- after throughout the entire year, (c) Listing these dates in chronological Or- der. This sould result in a ilt of exactly 30 dates. (If more than this number have been, selected. randomly discard dates throughopt the year until only 30 remain.) 2. Count and record the transactions for each of the above 30 dates la each of the cate-ories requested, 3. Estimate the annual number of trans- actions in each category by 'multiplylng the agregate of the 30 dates test count in each category by 8.3333 to annualize the transac- tion count.

D.C. 20430. All comments received on or before February 3,1977 will be considered. Com- ments received after publication of this proposal will be available for public in- spection during normal working hours at the Office of the Secretary, U.S. In- ternational Trade Commission.Final regulations, modified as the Com- mission deems appropriate after consid- eration of comments, will be adopted as soon as practicable after such considera- tion. The Commission currently intends to make the final regulations effective 30 days after their publication in the FEm- ElAL REGISTER. The basis of this proposal is as follows: 1. Section 337(b) (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, provides: Whcnever, In the ooure of an inve\"sgation under this cection, the CommLs-lon ha- rea- son to believe, based on Information before It, that tho matter may come within the purvier of cection 303 or of the Antidump- Ing Act, 1921, it abaf promptly notify the Secretary of the Treaury so that such action FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES may be taken as Is otherwise authorized by such section and such Act. 2. A similar provision appears in sew- tion 201(b) (6) of the Trade Act of 1974: In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factors which In its judgment may be contributing to Increased Imports of the article under investigation; and, whenever in the course of its investigation the Commis- sion has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circum- stances which come within the purview of the Antidumping Act, 1921, section 303 or 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, or other remedi- al provisions of law, the Commission shall promptly notify the appropriate agency so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such provisions of law. In the past, the Commission has pro- vided such noti6e on an ad hoc basis. In order to handle such matters ex- peditiously, as is required by law, with- out disturbing existing investigations, the Commission proposes to amend part 201 of its Rules of Practice and Proce- dure to allow for informal, nonadjudi- cative consideration of such matters. The proposed amendment is as follows: Add, following section 201.4(c) of said rules, the following: \u00a7 201.4 (Performance of functions. (d) Suggestion' that matters may come withUin the purview of other laws. When- ever, in the course of an investigation under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, or under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (Pub- lic Law 93-618), any party or per- son, including the Commission or its staff, has reason to believe that the sub- ject matter of such investigation may come within the purview of a remedial provision of law not the basis of such investigation, including, but not limited to, the Antidumping Act, 1921, or sections 303 or 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, then the party or person may file a suggestion of notification with the Commission that the appropriate agency be notified of such matters, together with such information as the party or person can make available. The Commission Secretary shall promptly thereafter pub- lish notice of the filing of such sugges- tion and information, and make them available for inspection and copying to the extent permitted by law. Any person may comment on the suggestion withil 10 days after the publication of said no- tice. Thereafter, the Commission shall determine whether notification is appro- priate under law and, if so, shall notify the appropriate agency. By order of the Commission: RENNETH R. MASON, Secretary. [FR Doc.77-289 Filed 1-3-77;8:45 am]DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE Food and Drug Administration [21 CFR Part 11 ] [Docket No. 76N-0236] BOTTLED WATER Proposed Amendment to Quality Standard The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the quality standard for bottled water. These amendments are being proposed in re- sponse to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 9, 1976 (41 FR 28402) of national interim primary drinking water regulations for radioactivity. Interested persons have until March 7. 1977 to sub- mit comments. Published elsewhere in this issue of the FEDERAL REGISTER are proposed amendments to the current good manufacturing practice regulations for the processing and bottling of bottled water under Part 128d (21 CFR Part 128d). In the FEDERAL REGISTER of June 21, 1976 (41 FR 24896), FDA issued a pro- posal to amend the quality standard for bottled water in response to EPA publica- tion of national interim primary drink- ing water regulations in the FEDERAL REGISTER of December 24; 1975 (40 FR 59566). On July 9, 1976, EPA published supplemental drinking water regulations concerning radioactivity in di'inking water. The publication of national in- terim drinking water regulations for ra- dioactivity is one of -the latest steps taken by EPA to implement the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93- 523). In the proposal published by FDA on June 21, 1976, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs announced that when EPA promulgated specific regulations dealing with radionuclides, the quality standardfor bottled water would again be re- viewed. The CommisSioner also pointed out that under section 410 of the Fed- eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 349) FDA is required, whenever EPA \"prescribes interim or revised na- tional primary drinking water regula- tions under section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act,\" to consult with EPA and within 180 days after EPA promul- gates the drinking water regulations to \"either promulgate amendments to reg- ulations under this chapter applicable to bottled h-inking water or publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER * * * reasons for not making such amendments.\" This proposal and the proposed-amend- ments to the current good manufactur- ing practice regulations for the process- ing and bottling of bottled drinking water are issued pursuant to FDA's statu-tory obligation under section 410 of the act.The Commissloner, after considera- tion of all comments received on this proposal, will publish a final regulation in the FEDERAL REISTM. He proposes that the final regulation become effective on December 31, 1977..The Environmental Protection Agency has established the following maximum contaminant levels for radioactivity in public drinking water: 1. Combined radium-226 and radium- 228 activity not to exceed 5 plcocurles (pCi) per liter of water. 2. Gross alpha particle activity (incluct- ing radium-226, but excluding radon and uranium) not to exceed 15 pC1 per liter of water. 3. The average annual concentration of -beta particle and photon radioactivity from nianmade radionuclides in drinking water shall not produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body or to anyinternal organ greater that 4 millirenis per year. If two or more radlonuclides are present, the sum of their annual dose equivalent to the total body or to any organ shall not exceed 4 millirems per year. To determine compliance with the maximum contaminant level set for beta particle and photon radioactivity from manmade radionuclides, the EPA has established a method for calculating the concentration of manmade radio nuclides causing a total body or organ doe equiv- alent of 4 millirems. In the case of trit- ium and strontium-e0, EPA has estab- lished specifiV levels 2x101 8 pCi/liter, respectively. Water con- taining these radionuclides at these levels may be assumed to result in an annual dose equivalent of 4 millirems when only the named radionuclide is being con- sidered. In addition, EPA has stated that compliance with the 4-millirem limit can be assumed, provided that the average annual concentration of gross beta par- ticle activity is less than 50 pCi per liter and the average annual concentration of tritium and strontium-Do combined donot result In a dose equivalent to the whole body or any organ of more than 4 millirems. The Environmental Protection Agency defines manmade beta particles andphoton emitters as all radionuclides emit- ting beta particles and/or photons listedin Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentra- tions of Radionuclides in Air or Water for Occupational Exposure, NBS Hand- book 69, except for the daughter products of thorium 232, uranium-235, and ura. nium-238. Radiological terms used In this proposal are as deilned in the EPA in- terim primary drinking water regulations for radionuclides published in the FED- ERAL REGISTER of July 9, 1976. To maintain uniformity with the na- tional interim primary drinking water regulations, the Commissioner proposes FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2.-ZTUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977-806 PROPOSED RULES to amend \u00a7 ll,7(e) (21 CFR 11.7(e)) to require that the radiological quality of bottled-water be consistent with the ra- diological limits set forth by EPA for public drinking water.The Commissioner is proposing to amend \u00a7 11.7(e) to require that (1) the bottled water not contain a combined radium-226 and radium-228 activity Inexcess of 5 pCi per liter of water, (2) -the bottled water not contain a gross al- pha particle activity (including radium- 226, but excluding radon and uranium) in excess of 15 pCi per liter of water, (3) the bottled water not contain beta par- ticle and photon radioactivity from manmade radionuclides in excess of that which would produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body or any in- ternal organ of 4 millirems per year, calculated on the basis of an intake of 2 liters of the water per day. If two or more beta or-photon-emitting radionu- clides are present, the sum of their an- nual dose equivalent to the total body or to any internal organ shall not exceed 4 Tillirem per year. The Environmental Protection Agency has also established specific limits for tritium. and. strontium-0 in drinking water. Testing for manmade radionu- clides, however, is only required -for drinking water systems using surface water sources and serving more than 100,000 persons. The .proposed amend- nient to the quality standard for bottled water, does. not establish separate re- quirements for tritium and strontium- 90. M~anufacturers must analyze the sample to identify the major radioactive constituents present and calculate what the dose equivalent would be for the combined radionuclides present. This would include any contribution made by strontium-90. The additional monitor- ing required by EPA foi large public water systems is part of a Federal-State regulatory policy designed to give added surveillance where appropriate. Tritium and strontium-90 can also be used as In- -dicators of man's influence on environ- mental radiation. The Commissioner is of the opinion that such surveillance is appropriate for public water supplies but does not consider it necessary as a separate criterion for bottled water. The Commissioner has considered the environmental effects of the Issuance or amendment of food standards and has concluded in \u00a7 6.1(d) (4) (21 CM 6.1(d) (4)) that food standards are not major agency actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. -Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required for this amendment.

These amend- ments are being proposed in response to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication in the FnEnn Rra- rsrxn of July 9. 1976 (41 FR 28402) of national interim primary drinking water regulations concerning radionuclides. In- terested persons have until MBarch 7, 1977 to submit comments. Published elsewhere In this issue of the FznRaaL Roxs-za is a proposal to amend the qual- Ity standard for bottled water under Part 11 (21 CFR Part 11). After consideration of all comments received on. this proposal, a final reg-u- lation will be published In the FzDm\"AL Rzoxrz. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs proposes that the final reg-u- lation become effective on'December 31, 1977. The Environmental Protection Agency has established monitoring frequencies for radioactivity in community water systems. Analysis of community water systems for radium-225 and radium-223 Is required once every 4 years. Analysis for gross alpha particle activity and gross beta particle activity I- also required ev- ery 4 years. However, in the case of gross beta particle activity, analysis is only required by community water systems serving more than 100,000 persons and using surface water sources. Tritium and strontium-9 analys. are also required every 4 years for systems using surface water sources and serving more than 100,000 persons. In each case, more fre- quent and more thorough monitoring of community water systems can be re- quired by the individual States. For ex- ample, In accordance with 40 CPR 141.- 26(b) (1) (i1) of the EPA regulations, suppliers of water using only ground wa- ters may be required to monitor for man- made radioactivity; In accordance with 40 CFR 141.26(b) (4), the suppliers of community water systems designated by a State as utilizing waters contami- nated by eilluents from nuclear facilities shall initiate quarterly monitoring for gros beta particle and iodine-131 radio- activity and annual monitoring for strontium-90 and tritium. The monitoring schedules established by EPA were designed to give maximum flexibility to a combined State-EPA reg- ulatory effort. The Environmental Pro- tection Agency has provided for increased survellnnce of municipal water systems whenever radioactivity levels or physical circumstances of the water system war- rant additional monitoring. In the case FMERAL REGISTER VOL 42, 1O. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES of bottled water, however, FDA is re- quired to adopt a uniform policy that ap- plies to all bottled-water manufacturers. These differences in the regulatory aD- proach were discussed in the preamble to the proposed amendments to the cur- rent good manufacturing practice regu- lations published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of June 21, 1976 (41 FR 24897). The current good manufacturing prac- tice regulations for bottled water require that manufacturers analyze water sam- ples for radiological contaminants on a yearly basis. This requirement is a result of a partial stay published In the FEDERAL REGISTER of November 4, 1975 (40 FR 51194), which reduced the semiannual testing requirements to one test per year. Currently, these tests are to be made both on the source water and the final product water. The Commissioner proposes that man- ufacturers test the final product water annually for radiological contaminants and the source water once every 4 years in order to assure that the source water meets the requirements of applicable law and regulations of the government agen- cy or agencies that have jurisdiction. The quadrennial testing of source water for radiological contaminants shall be in ad- dition to testing performed by govern- ment agencies. The Commissioner proposes to retain annual testing requirements for the final bottled-water product for several reasons. Less frequent testing of the final product water cannot be considered good manu- facturing practice. Manufacturers are currently testing product water on an annual basis, and retention of this provi- sion will provide no additional cost bur- den to the manufacturer. Manufactur- ers of bottled water are directly responsi- ble for the safety of. the product water and have already demonstrated an abil- ity to institute quality control procedures based on an annual sampling schedule for radioactive contaminants. The Commissioner has carefully con- sidered the environmentpl effects of the propoed regulation and, because the proposed action will not significantly af- fect the quality of the human environ- ment, has concluded that an environ- mental impact statement is not required. A copy of the environmental impact as- sessment is on file with the 'Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration.

[FR Doc.77-124 Filed 1-4-77;8:45 am]DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration E 29 CFR Part 1910] [Docket No, U-004] PROPOSED STANDARD FOR EXPOSURE TO LEAD Informal Public Hearing; Availability of Preliminary Technological/ Feasibility and Inflationary Impact Study; and Re-ceipt of Additional Studies * Purpose. The purposes of this notice are to schedule a hearing date for re- ceipt of oral testimony on all relevant issues concerning the lead proposal; to explicitly raise certain additional Issues; to set forth a list of additional studies concerning exposure to lead; to announce the availability of a preliminary techno- logical feasibility, cost of compliance and Inflationary impact study of the proposed lead standard; and to permit further comment on the proposal.. ' Background: On October 3, 1975, no- tice of a proposed standard for occupa- tional exposure to lead was published by the Occupational Safety and Health Ad- ministration (OSHA) In the FEDERAL REGISTER (40 FR 45934) pursuant to the auithority in sections 6(b) and 8(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1593, 1599; 29'U.S.C. 655, 657) and Title 29, Code of Federal Regu- lations (CFR) Part 1911. Interested persons were given until De- cember 2, 1975 to submit written data, views and arguments on the proposal and to file objections and request a hearing thereon. At the request of several com- menting parties, this period was subse- quently extended until January 16, 1976 (40 FR 55866). Over 100 written com- ments have been received Including ap- proximately 40 requests that a public rulemaking hearing be held. issues: The preamble to the proposed standard listed 10 major Issues as likely to be of significance In the rulemaking proceeding (40 FR 45934). They are as follows: 1. Whether the proposed permissible exposure 'limit to lead should be 100 ug/m 1; and whether this level Incorpo- rates an appropriate margin of safety: 2. Whether subclinical effects of ex- posure should be considered In estab- lishing a standard for occupational ex- posure to any substance, in this case lead; 3. Whether compliance with the pro- posal is technologically and economi- cally feasible; 4. Whether, as provided In the pro- posal, employers in certain specific In- dustries should be required to conduct initial monitoring of the exposures of some employees or whether Initial deter- minations without monitoring are suffi- cient for all industries; 5. Whether biological sampling and analysis should be required as a supple- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL...42, NO..2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 'PROPOSED RULES ment to air monitoring to determine em- ployee absorption of lead; 6. Whether the provisions for methods of compliance, medical surveillance, pro- tective equipment and clothing, hygiene facilities, and recordkeeping are appro- priate; 7. Whether warning signs and labels should be required; 8. To what eftent are there groups with increased susceptibility to lead in the working population, such as women of -childbearing age; and should such In- creased susceptibility, if it exists, be con- sidered in establishing a standard for occupational exposure to any substance, in this case lead; and 9. What are the environmental and in- flationary impacts of this proposal. 10. Whether compliance with the pro- prosal would be technologically and eco- nomically feasible for all affected in- dustries, and particularly or employers engaging small numbers of employees. Comments. and -information were sought on these and any other issues raised by the proposal. Since publication of the proposal, issues not specifically covered by the 10 listed above or discussed at any length- in the preamble have been raised. OSHA considers these new Issues to be of such importance and controversy that com- ments,- information and data are now sought on them, both'in writing and at the rulemaking hearing. Therefore, to promote the fullest possible analysis of these issues during the rulemaking pro- ceeding, they are briefly discussed below. Ciwlating Agents. Essentially, chelates are chemical purgatives administered to .remove metals from the body. They are often administered in emergency situa- tions to remove lead from children who have ingested large amdunts and are ex- hibiting symptoms of acute are highly -toxic and place a strain on certain organs, such as the kidney, when used repeatedly. Further- more, once administered, they remove not only lead but may remove most other metals from the syttem as well. OSHA recognized the possibly inap- propriate use of chelates to reduce em- *loye& blood levels in the proposed standard when it recommended that: \"Chelating agents shall not be routinely administered to employees, and shall not be administered at all except by, and at the discretion of, a licensed physician.\" (40 FR 45945) In a written comment 'submitted on the proposal, it was sug- gested that OSHA prohibit the adminis- tration of all oral chelating agents and limit the administration of intravenous chelating agents to emergency situations only (comment #112, p. 2). InFebruary 1976, a study performed by the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine's Environment- ai Sciences Laboratory in New York re- vealed routine chelation therapy at two Indianapolis, Indiana secondary lead smelters. In March, hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Manpower, Compensation-.and Health and Safety of the full Committee on Education and La-bor of the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate occupational exposure to -lead and use of chelatingagents, The Di- rector of the National Institute, for Oc- cupational Safety and Health, Dr. John Finklea, testified at the hearing that:':They (chelating agents) should only beadministered under proper medical su- pervision and not by anyone untrained in medicine. '* = Physicians should not chelate workers and send them back to Work where there Is a likelihood that they would have continued overexposure to lead.\" Anemia and evidence of neuro- logical damage have been found n work- ers treated In this manner. Dr. Hector BleJer, appearing on his own behalf, tes- tified concerning his observations of the the use of chelating agents during his service with the State of California. He noted that some experts recommend that chelates or any other chelation therapy should not be administered at all to -treat overexposed adult workers. Instead, they recommend immediate removal of the employe from exposue and treat- ment of the symptoms of intoxication. This is referred to as natural \"delead- Ing.\" In July 1976, the Food and Drug Ad- ministration warned against the \"pro- phylactic\" use-of chelation In Its Juno-. July Drug Bulletin, adding that \"their chronic use to combat continued exposure to lead has not been shon to be effec- tive and can harm the subject.\" 'Pro- phylactic\" chelation has been discussed in the literature to include the routine use of chelation or similarly acting drugs to prevent elevated blood lead levels in workers who are occupationally exposed to lead or the use of these drugs to rou- tinely lower blood lead levels to predes- Ignated concentrations. The issue of chelation thus concerns Its proper use in an occupational setting to the extent that an employer Is involved with its administration. More specfical- ly, under what circumstances, if any, should chelation therapy be relied on to treat employees exhibiting symptoms of acute lead intoxication? Would compli- ance with the proposal's requirement concerning It be adequately protective of Worker health? What are the long-term and short-term health effects of chela- tion? Adeqacj of Blood Lead Detmnina- tions. Blood determinations are the primary bioldgical monitoring tech- nique required in the proposals medical surveillance provisions. The preamble to the proposal acknowledged that this method provides the most useful and relatively accurate method of arrivingat an employee's current lead absorption. The preamble also stated that, of the various biological monitoring tests avail- able, determinations of blood lead levels correlated best with the appearance of symptoms.of lead Intoxication and with concentrations of airborne lead. There are, however, some significant limitations inherent In blood lead level determina- tions. For example, a blood lead level re- flects the amount of active or mobile lead in the body at a particular time which may be as little as 10 percent ofthe total body burden. Also, blood lead determinations are susceptable to depres- sion from a variety of sources other than reduced lead absorption, such as from anemia or chelation treatment. In addi- tion, a procedure frequently employed by laboratories that perform blood lead determinations is to also- assess hema- tocr)jt or hemoglobin levels in order to more accurately indicate the amount of lead present in the body. Recently, blologIcal monitoring meth- ods other than blood lead determinations have received Increased attention. The 1976 M t. Sinai study of workers in 2 lead smelters in Indiana revealed that, of the laboratory findings studied Including blood lead levels, determinations of zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP). an Indicator of hemesynthess, correlated well with the clinical symptoms observed. Other recent studies suggest that both during and after long-term stable lead exposures measurement of erythrocyte proto- porphyrin (EP), a similar indicator to ZPP, gives a better reflection of hema- tologIcally active lead than other avail- able parameters. It should be noted that EP determinations are already being em- ployed in conjunction with blood lead determinations in screening tests for lead toxication in children. The studies have al-o found a positive correlation at blood lead levels below 70ug/100ml betw'een EP and subjective symptoms related to lead toxicity. These and other studies were discussed by the Subcommittee on Per- missible iamits of the Permanent Com- mission and International Association on Occupational Health which met in Am- sterdam, The Netherlands, In September 1976. The Subcommlttee's published re- port on occupational exposure to lead, in- cluding a discussion of ZPP cetermina- tIons, is still pending. ZPP determinations may offer substantial promise as a prac- tical, sensitive and economic monitor- ing test suitable for routine use. One manufacturer indicated In Its comment on the proposed standard that a portable hematofluorometer, now commercially available, permits the determination of the ZPP level In a drop of unprocessed blood deposited on a disposable glass slide (comment #79, addendum). In light of 'these recent studies, OSHA seeks comments on the potential utility o\u00a3'ZPP determinations as an alterna- tive method to be used In the Initial screening for lead ntoxicatioi. Are the equipment and technique necessary for this determination reliable, available and relatively inexpensive? Should blood lead determinations be supplemented with assessments of hematocrit and hemo- globin levels? Effects of Lead on Reproductive Func-: tions. For years, lead has been known to affect reproductive functions. Observa- tions among human populations indicate that lead Is associated with sterility, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, birth defects, increased infant mortality, In- creased prematurity and increase in chromosomal abnormalities. Additional- lyi, animal test systems have Indicated that lead may be associated with im- potency and mutagenesis. However, FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES beyond ,acknowledging that fetal dam- age, particularly to the nervous system, can occur at levels usually considered safe for adults, 'there is little scientific agreement as to the precise levels of ex- posure that correlate with onset of these effects. In 1972, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that a clinical state approaching that of frank lead poison- Ing is necessary before the fertility of men or women is affected. More recently, however, a 1975 study of male workersat a Rumanian storage battery plant re- vealed effects on spermatogenesis which may be of clinical significance at rela- tively low blood lead levels. This suggests a new concern about effects of lead on male reproductive functions at relatively low levels of exposure. During the last several years, studies have been completed that indicate fe- male workers, even wben not pregnant, may also be slightly more susceptible to adverse effects of lead than their male counterparts. A 1974 study by Sep-palainen found that females exhibited decreased motor nerve conduction veloc-ity at lower blood lead levels than mgles. A 1976 study by Alessio showed that after EDTA provocation tests FEP levels in women were higher than in men at spec- ified urine lead levels. This latter study can be viewed as suggestive of greater susceptibility in adult women to effects of lead on the blood forming process. Finally, a number of comments re- ceived on the proposal discussed proper protection for female lead workers of childbearing age. A point made by both industry and health groups was that the permissible exposure limit of 100 tig/me of lead in air, Assuming a correlation to a maximum blood lead level of 60 ug/ 100g, is actually inadequate to protect a developing fetus. The issues regarding effects of lead on human reproduction are complex and multiple, with relatively little scientific attention paid to this subject until re- cent times. Nevertheless, at least several questions can be posed. Does the permis- sible exposure limit and other related provisions within the proposal provide adequate protection to women of child-bearing age and to the hunian reproduc- tive system. Are there any other studies,information or data bearing on the ef- fects of lead on male reproductive func- tions at low blood lead levels? Interested persons are invited to submit comments on all issues regarding effects of lead on worker health, Including reproductive functions. Additional Studies: Since publication of the proposed standard, OSHA has ob-tained copies of additional studies and reports. Most 'of these have been pub- lished recently and concern various health effects arising from exposure tolead. The findings of some are likely to be discussed at the public hearing and may have some bearing on requirements contained in the final standard.

Preliminary Study of Technological Feasibility, Cost of Compliance and In- flationaryd Impact: John Short and Associates, Inc., has prepared for OSHA a preliminary study entitled \"Technological Ftasibility, Cost of Compliance and Inflationary Impact Study of the Proposed OSHA Standard for Lead.\" The study includes assess- ment of the technological feasibility of compliance, an initial estimate of com- pliance, an initial estimate of compli- ance costs and the potential economic implications for those Industries affected by the proposed standard. The effects on other variables, such ms employment. prices, productivit, market structure, eports and imports, and the consump- tion of energy and critical materials, are also considered.Notice Is being given of the availabil- ity of this preliminary study to afford Interested parties the eaziest possible opportunity to contribute comments, In- formation and data. The final study, which will be made available at least 4 weeks prior to the public hearing, wil be based on the results of an ongoing sup- plemental data collection effort by D. B. Associates of Salt Lake City, Utah, on behalf of OSHA. The final study will in- clude a discussion of the anticipated ben- efits to be derived from implementation of the proposal, and a more in-depth evauation of the various economic im- pacts.

Ac- cordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions, or objec- tions regarding the proposed additions to the Director, National Park Service, Washington, D.C. 20240, -on or before February 3,1977. The National Park Service has deter- mined that this document does not con- tain a major proposal requiring prepara- tion of an Inflation Impact Statement under Executive Order 11821 and OMB Circular A-i07. It is therefore proposed to amend Title 36 of-the Code of Federal Regulations by establishing new Parts 16 and 17 as fol- lows: PART 16-RETAINED RIGHTS OF USE AND OCCUPANCY OF SINGLE FAMILY NONCOMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL PROP- ERTY Definitions.

Compliance. \"Termination. \u00a7 16.1 Definition& (a) The term \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of-the Interior or his duly au- thorized representative. (b) The term \"Director\" means the Director of the National Park Service and the Deputy Director, Asiociate\" Di- rectors, and' Assistant Directors of the National Park Service. (c) The term \"Reservor\" means a person or persons who convey real property to the United States for an area of the National Park System and reserves occupancy for noncommercial single family residential purpose for a particular period of time. (d) The term \"right of use and oc- cupancy for single family residential purposes\" -means a reserved estate whereby an owner whose land is being acquired by the United States for an area of the National Park System retains use and possession of his former prop- erty, -or a portion thereof, for strictly single family residential purposes for a particular period of time. During the pe- riod of the retention the Reservor has all the rights, privileges, and obligations of ownership except as they may be re- stricted by the instrument creating the estate or by the regulations in this Part. Use and occupancy for residential pur-poses includes use of the premise for residential purposes by an individual: by a family comprised of two or more persons related by blood, adoption, mar- riage, or legal guardianship who live together as a family unit; and by two or more individuals living together as a family unit though not meeting the criteria of the preceding phrage. Use of the premises by a club or similar group not residing on the premises as a family unit shall not be considered as noncom- mercial residential purposes. Occupa- tion of the premises for residential pur- poses by an individual or family unit holding legal title to the reserved in- terest or under a tenancy or lpase ar- r3ngement for 30 days or more shall be considered as use and occupancy for noncommercial residential purposw, but occupation by transients staying less than 30 days shall not be so considered. \u00a7 16.2 Basis and purpose. The land acquistion program of the National Park Service is often best served when in suitable situations owners of land acquired for the National Park System are permitted to reserve rights of use and occupancy for noncom- mercial single family residential pur- poses for the life of the owner and spouse or for a period of up to 25 years. A few Acts provide for longer periods. Such as long been thd policy of the Na- tional Park Service, as well as a require- ment of the Congress in many of the Acts authorizing areas of the National Park System. This reduces the impact of land acquisition on owners and on the com- munity, while benefiting the Govern- ment by reducing the incidence of con- demnation and. by lowering the overall price paid for the property. b 16.3 Criteria for the granting of rights of use and occupancy. Owners of property to be acquired by the United States for an area of the Na- tional Park System may qualify for aright to the retention of use and occu- pancy for single family residential pur- poses under one of the following three provisions: (a) A Statutory right may be granted by the legislation establishing a partic- ular park area which permits the land- owner to determine, in his discretion, whether or not to retain use and occu- pancy. The maxJmum term of such re- tention which the landowner may select is set by the legislation. This right may not be defeated by the government. (b) A limited statutory right may be granted by the legislation establishing a particular park area. This right Is lim- ited in that the National Park ServIce is required to grant at the landowner's request a retention of use and occupancy unless the National Park Service can establish that the retention of the prop- erty adversely affects the management and administration of or public access to the park area. The statutory standard for denial of a right of retained use and occupancy is set forth In the legislation creating the park. See, for example, the legislation establishing Sleeping' Bear813 Dunes National Lakehore, 16 USC 460xet seq., Delaware Gap National Recreation Area. 16 USC 460o et seq., and Gulf Islands; National Seashore, 16 USC 459h et seq. The maximum term of the retained use and occupency which the landownar may select 13 also set b3 the lecilation. (c) If there I- no statutory right of re- tention contained in the legislation es- tablishing a particular National Park Service area, the park Superintendent may, in his discretion, permit a right or retained use and cccupancy for single family residential purposes. The Super- intendent will permit this retention upon his determination that It will not unduly interfere with the use and development of the park area. Factors that will be considered in making this determination may include, but are not limited to, the park general management plan, the ad- ministrative, recreational, and transpor- tation needs of the park, the protection of the park's resources, potential devel- opment of park facilities, and public ac- ces requirements. The term of any re- tention permitted under this provision i3 determined solely by the Superintendent,at his discretion. Rights of use and occupancy at pres- ently authorized areas where a statutoryright does not exist such as in inholding areas shall be confined to Improvements the construction of which had com- menced prior to July 1. 1975. \u00a7 16.4 Creation of right of use and oc- cupancy for noncommercial residen- tial purpose Rights of use and oscup3ncy for sin- gle family noncommercial residential purposes retained by-owners conveying land to the United States for an area of the National Park System will be re- served in the Offer to Sell Agreement and the Grantor's deed to the United States. where the land is being acquired through judicial proceedings, Deparhnent of Jus- tice will be requested to have this right included in any stipulation and/or the Judgment. Every instrument creating a right of use and occupancy for single family noncommercial residential pur- pase shall incorporate these reulations. as existing at the time the instrument i- executed, into the instrument by refer- ence. Each Recervor shall be given a. copy of these regulations at the time the instrument is executed. An owner of property which the United States has been authorized to acquire for' inclusion in the National Park System will be notified in the letter of Just com- pensation whether or not any right of use and occupancy for single family resi- dential purposes may be retained by him upon acquislton of his property by the Secretary in accordance with the criteria of section 163. This letter of just com- pensation is presented to the owner at the time of the first oiclal contact by the National Park Service, Initiating the negot ation proce33. \u00a7 16.5 Usm of reserved area. The reserved area shall be used only for single family noncommercial resi-dentl purposes by an Individual, by a FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY.

Use by a club or similar group will not qualify. Occupa- tion by an individual or family unit un- der a tenancy or lease arrangenient for 30 days or longer will qualify as noncom- mercial residential use, but by transients staying less than 30 days will not. No dis- tinction shall be made between owners of full-time residences or single family ten- ant occupied full-time residences or own- ers of part-time seasonal residences un- less the Act of Congress providing forthe right limits it to owners who are per- manent or full-time residents. \u00a7 16.6 Acreage to he reserved. Most legislation allows the owner to reserve a maximum of 3 acres. In the absence of same in any park legislationthe same maximum acreage may be per- mitted. However, in no event shall the owner be permitted to reserve unusual configurations of land unless there arejustifiable reasons for permitting same. Care should be exercised in not permit- ting lake frontage, river frontage or ocean frontage, or other areas required by park management unless approved by park management. \u00a7 16.7 Rights of the public. Members of the public have no right o enter upon any premises subject to a right of use and occupancy for single family noncommercial residential pur- poses or to use it for any purpose with- out the permission of the Reservor. \u00a7 16.8 Waiver of benefits. Prior to electing to retain a right of use and occupancy for noncommercial residential purposes, owners will be ad- vised in writing of the following provision found in section 405(b) of the Act of October 26, 1974, Public Law 93-477, 88 Stat, 1445: \"Whenever an owner of property elects to retain a right of use and occupancy pursu-ant to any statute authorizing the acquisi- tion of property for purposes of a unit of the National Park System, such owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits un- der sections 203, 204, 205, and 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and RealProperty Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1894), and for the purposes of those sections such owner shall not be considereda displaced person as defined in section 101 (0) of that Act.\" \u00a7 16.9. Valuation of rights of use and occupancy. The amount paid owners of land ac- quired subject to rights of -use and occu- pancy for single family noncommercial residential purposes is reduced by the amount of the fair market value of theright retained. The Secretary has deter-mined'that the fair market value of aright of use and occupancy for residen- tial purposes is the deduction of ------percent (to be determined before publi- cation of final regulations) of the pur-chase price of the entire property for each year the right of use occupancy Is reserved. In the ease of retention for life, the term will be calculated on the longest life expectancy of any of the persons granted the right of use and occupancy,as shown by Life Table Issued by the Public Health Service of the U.S. De- partment of Health, Education and Wel- fare. \u00a7 16.10 Purchase of reserved rights by the United States. The United States shall be under no obligatioir to purchase retention rights from Reservors and no provision to this effect shall be included in any instrument creating any right of use and occupancy. \u00a7 16.11 Transfer of reserved estate. The estate may be conveyed, assigned or otherwise transferred to another party for single family noncommercial resi- dental purposes unless prohibited by an Act creating a park; the successor there- upon acquires all the rights and obliga-\" tions of the 6rlginal Reservor. \u00a7 16.12 Use of the reserved premises. The Reservor and the members of his household may reside upon the reserved premises and not be disturbed by the United States in the normal and usual possession and use of the premises for single family noncommercial residential purposes during the term of the reserved estate. The Reservor shall be bound by all laws and ordinances in force in the jurisdiction in which the reserved prem- ises are located. The Reservor shall take reasonable care to avoid damage to Federal lands or property through the spread of fire originating on the reserved premises, through the spread of sewage or other polluting substances originat- ing on the-reserved area, or by any other activities representing a nuisance orhazard to adjacent or nearby Federal lands or property. The Reservor shallnot add to or materially alter the char- acter of existing improvements or struc- tures or perform any new construction or change the topography of the land without first having obtained the per- mission in writing of the Secretary. Commercial, industrial, mining or uses other than residence by a single family unit is prohibited. \u00a7 16.13 Taxes. The Reservor is responsible for the. payment of any State or local taxes levied against the reserved interest. \u00a7 16.14 Maintenance of the premises. The sole responsibility for maintain- ing the premises and all structures thereon In proper repair and sanitation is that of the Reservor, and the United States shall have no responsibility in connection therewith except to the ex-tent that it may voluntarily in coopera- tion with the owner undertake preserva- tion work on improvements or structuresthe Director has determined to be needed by the United States after the termination of the period of use and occupancy. The Reservor shall not per- mit the accumulation. on the reserved Premises of any trash or foreign mate- rial which is unsightly or obnoxious. \u00a7 16.15 Insurance. \" The Reservor ahall be counseled to procure insurance to protect his nvest-ment in the improvements on the re- served premises. The United States will not assume the responsibility of insuring the reserved premises, nor the responsibility to re-pair or 'rebuild such premises should they be damaged or destroyed, regard- less of cause. \u00a7 16.16 Compliance. A Reservor violating the terms of the Instrument creating the right of useand occupancy shall be warned by theSecretary in writing and given 30 days to correct the violation. If the Resorvor refuses or neglects to correct the viola- tion, then the Secretary may request a court of competent jurisdiction to Issuean Injunction to enforce the terms ofthe instrument creating the right of useand occupancy. \u00a7 16.17 Termination. The right of use and occupancy shall terminate upon expiration of the period named in the instrument creating the interest or also upon voluntary relin- quishment by quitclaim deed to the Na- tional Park Service to the Secretary by the Reservor. The Reservor shall re- move all personal property from -the premises within 90 days of the termina- tion of the right of use and occupancy. Any personal property not removed within such period shall be considered as abandoned and shall become theproperty of the United States unless the Reservor shall seek and be granted an extension of time because of unusual and Justifiable circumstances. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be con-strued to abrogate any rights the re- servor may have for reimbursement under sections 202 and 303 of Public Law 91-646.

New Brunswick NJ 08903, has submitted a pesticide petition (PP 6E1833) to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on behalf on the IR-4 Technical Com- mittee and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Arkansas, Kansas, MLssis- sippi, MIssouri, and Texas. This petition requests that the Administrator, pur- suant to section 408(e) of the Federal FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1977 PROPOSED RULES Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose that 40 CFR 180.1020 be amended by the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for resi; dues of the pesticide chemical sodium chlorate in or on the raw agricultural commodity soybeans when it is used in accordance with good agricultural prac- tice as a desiccant in soybean production. The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material having been evaluated, It has been concluded that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance established by amending 40 CFR 180.1020 will protect the public health. The Agency has waived the re- quirement for chronic studies on sodium chlorate based on the fact that its resi- dues will be reduced to sodium chloride within a short time. There is no reason- able expectation of residues n eggs, milk, meat, or poultry as delineated in 40 CFR 180.6(a) (3). The EPA proposes, therefore, that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or sub- mitted an application for-the registra- tion of a pesticide under the Federal In- secticide, Fungicide, and Rodentielde Act which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request, on or before February 3, 1977, that this proposal be referred to an advisory committee pur- suant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic-Act. Interested persons are Invited to sub- mit written comments on the:proposed regulation to the FEDERAL REGISTER Sec- tion, Technical Services Division (WH- 569), Office of Pesticide Programs, En- vironmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. SW., East Tower, Rm. 401, Wash- ington, DC 20460. Three of the comments should be submitted to facilitate the work of the Agency and of others in- terested in inspecting them. The com- ments must be received on or before February 3, 1977, and should bear a no- tation indicating both the subject and the petition/document control number \"PP6F]1833/P40'. All written comments filed in response to this notice will be available for public inspection in the office of the Federal Register Section from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.

[FADoc.77-178 Filed 1-3-77;8:45 am] FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 16; Docket No. 76-661 EXTRANEOUS AND' EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS Proposed Miscellaneous Changes The Commission's rules of practice and procedure presently prohibit the making of ex parte communications and the filing of documents not conforming to the rules and further provide for dispo- sition of such documents and communi- cations. (See Rule 10(dd), 46 CFR 502.170). Section 4 of the \"Government in the Sunshine Act\" (Pub. L. 94-409, September 13, 1976) amends the Admin- istrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.)- in the area of ex parte communica- tions. These amendments necessitate corresponding amendments to the Com- mission's rules. Essentially, the \"Sunshine Act\" amendments enlarge upon the present prohibitions contained in the Commis- sions rules by establishing specific pro- hibitions against \"interested person(s] outside the agency,\" as well as agency members, administrative law judges, and employees involved in the decisional process and by providing for sanctions against parties to proceedings who make or knowingly cause ex parte communica- tions to be made. Other provisions of the Act such as those requiring ex parte com- munications to be placed on the public record and .exempting procedural re- quests from the prohibitions appear to be consistent with the Commission's present rules and previous law on the subject. The Act's definition of ex parte com- munications, to wit, a communication \"not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given\" (5 U.S.C. 551 (14)) * although varying slightly from the defi- nition contained in the Commission's present rules (46 CFR 502.170(b) (2)), does not, in the opinion of the Commis- sion, constitute a substantive change. The Commission is therefore proposing to retain authority in the Secretary totake appropriate action in addition to placing such communications in the public record and to specify that the Commission or the presiding officer may have similar additional authority. The Commission believes that such flexibility is desirable in case matters raised by ex parte communications warrant further inquiry and consideration by the parties. The proposed rules would add to the -present category of parties prohibited from engaging in ex parte communica- tions namely, parties to proceedings or their agents, interested persons outside 'the Conifiiisslon, as required by the Act, and moreover, persons who directly par-ticipate in such proceedings, for example, by appearing as witnesses or assistants to parties or their counsel. In this way. the Commission believes that the pro- posed rules will encompass both the pre- - vious law on the subJect as well as the amendments contained in the \"Sunshine Act.\" Finally, the Commission Is propos- ing to amend its rule regarding general waiver authority (Rule 1(j), 46 CFR 502.10) to make clear that the prohi- bitions against ex parte communications cannot be waived. Therefore, pursuant to section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 5531, sections 22 and 43 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. 821,'841a) and sec- tion 4 of in the Sun- shine Act\" [Pub. L. 94-409] Part 502 of Title 45. Code of Federal Regulations, is proposed to be amended as set forth below. t 502.10 [Aniended] 1. Section 502.10 is proposed to be amended by inserting the following lan- guage between the words \"except\" and \"\u00a7 502.153\": \u00a7 Rule 1 (k) and 2. A new \u00a7 502.11 is proposed to be added as follows: \u00a7 502.11 Disposition of imnproperly filed documents and ex pare coin-miiiicationis. (a) Documents not conformning to rules. Any pleading, document, writing or other paper submitted for filing which is rejected because It does not conform to the rules in this part shall be returned to the sender; (b) Ex parte communications. (1) No person who Is a party to or an agent of a party to any proceeding as defined in \u00a7 502.61 (Rule 5(a) ) or who directly par- ticipates in any such proceeding and no interested person outside the Commis- sion shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any Commission member, administrative Law Judge, or Commis- sion employee who Is or may reasonably expected to be involved in the decisional process of any such proceeding an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding: (2) No Commission member, adminis- trative law judge, or Commission em- ployee who is or reasonably may be ex- pected to be involved in the decisional process of any agency proceeding, shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the Com- mission or to any party to the proceeding or his agent or to any direct participant in a proceeding an ex parts communica- tion relevant to the merits of the pro- ceeding. This prohibition shall not be construed to prevent any action author- ized by paragraphs (b) (5), (6), and (7) of this section; (3) Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but it shall not Include xe- quests for status reports or communica- tions regarding purely procedural mat- ters or matters which the Commission or member thereof, administrative law judge, or Commission employee is au-thorIzed by law or these rules to dispose of on an ex parte basis; (4) Any Commission member, admin- Istrative law judge, or Commission em- ployee who is or reasonably may be ex- Pected to be involved in the decisional process of any proceeding who receives, or who makes or knowingly causes to be made, an ex parte communication shall promptly transmit to the Secretary of the Commission: (1) All such written communications;(i Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and (ill) All written responses and memo- randa stating the substance of all oral responses to the materials described in paragraphs (b) (4) (1 and (ii) of this section; (5) The Secretary shall place the mate- rials described in the precedinJ subpar- agraph in the correspondence part of the public docket of the proceeding and may take such other action as may be appro- priate under the circumstances; (6) Upon receipt of an ex parte com- munication knowingly made or know- ingly caused to be made by a party to a proceeding, the Commission or the pre- siding officer may, to the extent consist-ent with the interests of justice and the policy of the statutes administered by the Commission, require the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise ad- versely affected on account of the making of such communication; (7) An ex parte communication shall not constitute a part of the record for de- cision. The Commission or the presiding officer may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the statutes administered by the Com- mission, consider a violation of this rule sufliclent grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly committed such violation or knowingly caused such violation to occur and may take such other action as may be appropriate under the circumstances. [Rule (k) .] \u00a7 502.170 [levoked] 3. Section 502.170 is proposed to be de-leted in its entirety. Interested persons may- participate in this rulemaking proceeding by filing with the Secretary,Federal Maritime Commis- sion. Washington, D.C. 20573, on or be- fore February 3, 1977, an original and fifteen copies of their views or arguments pertaining to the proposed rules. Since the proposals set forth in this rulemaking proceeding concern prcce- dural matters limited to the conduct of formal proceedings before the Commis- sion, their adoption could in no way be considered to result in major federal ac- tion significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 US.C. 4321 et seq.). Co~nequently, no environmental impact statement will be Issued in this proceed- ing. By Order of the Federal Maritime Commission. -Fscis O. Hux-Er. Secretary.

AND SOUTHERN AIRWAYS, INC. Domestic Air and Priority Reserved Air Freight Rates Investigation Adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C. on the 29th day of December, 1970. By tariff revisions 1 Issued December 1 and 3, 1976, and marked to become ef- fective January 1 and 2, 1977, Braniff Airways, Inc. (Braniff) and Southern Airways, Inc. (Southern) respectively propose, inter alia, to increase numerous \"Revisions to Airline Tariff Publishing Company, Agent, Tariff C.AB. No. 169. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES general and specific commodity airfreight and air express rates. Braniff proposes -to increase rates between Honolulu/Hilo and the Mainland byfrom 9 to 20 percent, but typically by 15 percent. Southern proposes to increase, systemwide, its rates by 6 percent, ex- cept for its minimum charges, which areto be increased by 7 percent, or $1.00 per shipment, to a level of $14.00. Braniff anticipates a net annual revenue in- crease of $152,000 and Southern, $283,000. In support of the proposal, Brafiiff asserts, inter alia, that it has not in- creased the minimum charge per ship- ment in these markets since March 1975, and other rates since April 1973; that the proposed rates do not exceed cur-. rently effective rates for competing car- riers; and that the rates are cost-justi- fied in view of the significant cost in- creases since its rates were last in'creased. The carrier further claimsthat, without the increase,lts return on investment for Hawaiian freight opera- tions would only be 1 percent, and only 10.8 percent with the increase. Southern claims that the proposed rates meet rates proposed for December 27, 1976, effectiveness by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta); that its losses on freight for the 12 months ended June 30, 1976, were $591,000; and that, even had the proposed rates been in effect during that period, it would have suffered freight losses of $192,000. All the proposed rates- come within the scope of either the Domestic Air Freight Rate Investigation (DAFRI), Docket 22859, or the Priority Reserved Air Freight Rates Investigation (PRAFRD, Docket 26338, and their lawfulness will be determined in those proceedings. The issue now before the Board is whetherto suspend the proposals or to permit them to become effective pending deci- sion.The Board has reviewed the increases in the light of industry-average costs2 and finds that Braniff's proposed under- 100 pound regular service rates and Southern's regular service minimum charge of $14.00 per shipment (to the ex-tent that it would apply to markets of 497 miles or less) significantly exceed .such costs. In view of the foregoing and all other relevant factors, the Board concludesthat the above rates and charges should be suspended pending DAFRI. The Boardfurther concludes that the correspond-ing express rates should be suspended pending PRAFRI inasmuch as they would exceed 130 percent of the regular service rates and charges. The remainder of the proposals do not appear excessiveand will be permitted to become effec- tive. Accordingly, pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and particularly Sections 204(a)i 403, 404, and 1002 2n1dustry-average costs as developed by the administrative law judge in DAERI, andrevised to reflect cost increases for the 12months ended June 30, 1976.

Chicago Midway Low-Fare Route Proceeding Adopted by the Civll Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C. on the 28th day of December 1976. On October 13, 1976, Midway Airlines, Inc. filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necesity to operate nonstop air service between Mid- way Airport in Chicago and the cities of Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City, Minne- apolis, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. The ap- plication was accompanied by a motion for expedited hearing stating, inter alla, that the applicant proposes to provide a two-tier pricing policy with substantially lower fares than currently offered in these Chicago markets. Two similar ap- plications predicated upon the same pric- ing considerations were filed on Decem- ber 10 by Midway (Southwest) Airway Co., which is a subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Co., an intrastate airline oper- ating exclusively in Texas. The applica- tion in Docket 30189 proposes service with B-737-200 aircraft between Chicago Midway Airport and fourteen other points I while the application in Docket 30188 requests authority between Chi- cago Midway and Las Vegas, utilizing the A30D Airbus or similar equipment. Answers in support of the motlon of Midway Airlines for expedited hearing were filed by the City of Chicago, the Council on Wage and Price Stability, the United States Department of Justice, and the United States Department of Trans-portation (DOT) .Answers in opposition were filed by Allegheny Airlines, Amer-ican Airlines, North Central Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, and Trans World Airlines. 11.e., Buffalo, Detroit, Cincinnati, Clove- land, Columbus. Dayton, Pittsburgh, Louis-ville, Memphis, Kansas City, St. Louis. Des Moines, Omaha and MinneapolWlSt. PauL2DOT's answer was accompanied by a motion for leave to file late. The motion will be granted.Upon consideration of the pleadings and all the relevant facts, we have de- cided to set Midway Airlines' application for hearing and to consolidate therewith the application of Midway (Southwest) Airway in Docket 30189 to the extent that the scope of the proceeding is determined by the order of investigation discussed below2 On their face, these applications are unique and could have far-reaching consequences for both the domestic air transportation system and the problem of service at Chicago Midway Airport. Moreover, our determination to set this matter for hearing is fully consistent with the priority of hearing- standards embodied in the Board's Policy State- ment, 14 CFR sec. 399.60. However, we shall not establish the final scope or the case until the pleadings filed in response to this order have been received and analyzed. Because of the uniqueness, complexity, and ramifications of these applications, we will issue a second order of investigation' which will define the precise scope of the proceeding and des- ignate the route and rate issues to be resolved, including the relationship of the applicants' fare proposals to the re- quirements of the Domestic Passenger Fare Investigaton5 In order to expedite the case and toeliminate any unnecessary procedural steps, all other applications, motions to consolidate and comments in response to this order must be filed within 30 days of the date of service of this order. Answers to motions filed pursuant to this directive will be due 14-days thereaftere Environ- mental evaluations pursuant to Part 312 of the Board's Procedural Regulations shall be filed by Midway Airlines, Mid- way (Southwest) Airway and any other applicant in the proceeding within 90 days of the date of service of this order.

On May 6, 1975, in furtherance of the objectives of, and under the terms of, the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, the Governments of the United States and Pakistan con- cluded a comprehensive bilateral cot- ton textile agreement concerning ex- ports of cotton textiles and cotton tex- tile products -from Pakistan to the United States over a three-and one-half year period beginning on July 1, 1974 and extending through December 31, 1977. Among the provisions of the agree- ment are those establishing specific lim- itations on Categories 39 through 63, as a group, and on individual Categories 9/10, 18/19 and part of 26 (prIntcloth), 22/23, parts of 26 (barkeloth and duck), and 31 (other than shop towels), for the agreement year beginning on January 1, 1977. Accordingly, there is published below a letter of December 30, 1976 from the Chairman of the Committee for the Im-plementation of Textile Agreements to,the Commissioner of Customs directingthat for the twelve-month period be-ginning on January 1, 1977 and extend- ing through December 31, 1977 entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from wdrehouse for con- sumption of cotton textile products incategories 39 through 63, as a group,and on individual Categories 9/10, 18/19 and part of 26 (printcloth), 22/23,parts of 26 (barkeloth and duck), and 31(other than shop towels), be limited to the designated levels. The levels setforth below for Categories 9/10, 18/19 and part of 26 (printcloth), 26 (duck), and 31 (other than shop towels) have been reduced to account for previous overshipments in these categories, as agreed between the Governments of the United States and Pakistan. The level of restraint for Category 31 (other thanshop towels) has also been reduced by 797,364 units to account for carryfor-, ward used during the agreement year which began on January 1, 1976.

IF Doc.77-300 Filed 1-3-77;8:45 4m]CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION [CP 76-41 FIVE GALLON GLASS BOTTLES Notice of Denial The purpose of this notice I- to an- nounce the denial of a petition fromGordon S. Churchill ho requested the Consumer Product Safety Commission to commence a proceeding for the issu- ance of a consumer product safety rule for five gallon glass bottles for use in dispensing drinking water. Section 10 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2059) providesthat any Interested person may petition the Consumer Product Safety Commis- sion to commence a proceeding for the issuance of a consumer product safety rule. Section 10 also provides that if the Commisson denies a petition, it shall publish In the PMnmAL 1i=. the rea- sons for such denial. By petition dated September 29, 1975, Gordon S. Churchill, an. attorney from San Diego, California, petitioned the Commiss on to develop a consumer prod- uct safety rule to regulate five gallon class bottles used for dispensing drink- ing water. The petitioner contends that these bottles frequently shatter without explanation, and that the resultant shards of glass cause serious injury. Therefore, he recommends producing such bottles using tempered glass or coating bottles with plastic, or producing non-glass bottles.In evaluating the petition, the Com- mission considered injury data available through November, 1975. These include 8 In-depth Investigation reports and 4 Incidents reported to the Commission's Injury Surveillance Division. These re- ports indicate patterns of Injury due to bre kage of a bottle dropped while be- ing carried or tipped over while in place or being placed In the dispensing unit. Two of the reported injuries may have occurred from shattering while the bot- tle was being carried. On the basis that 5-gllon bottles for dispensing drinking water are used In business and industrial establishments as well as In residences, the Commission has contacted the Oc- cupational Safety and Health Adminis- tratlon (OSHA) to learn if that agency has reports of Incidents with these bot- tles that would suggest a serious problem. OSHA is not aware of any incidents in- volving workers and these bottles. In reviewing the remedies sugg.ested by the petitioner, the Commission has learned that it has not yet become tech- nologically practicable to apply the tem- pering process to bottles as a means of preventing shattering. Plastic coating may not be suitable for reusable 5-gallon glass bottles because of possible damage to the coating from the wash solution or as a result of handling. In reviewn the data on all plastic containers, the Commission found Increasing avallabi- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES ity and use of 5-gallon plastic contain- ers for dispensing water. These are fairly new to the market and as their use in- creases, there may be even fewer Inci- dents associated with the breaking of 5- gallon glass containers. The Commission has carefully con- sidered the petitioner's recommenda- tions, the injury data, and container technology. From the information avail- able, the Commission is not able to deter- mine that an unreasonable risk of injury is associated with 5-gallon glass bottles for dispensing drinking water. Accord- ingly, the petition of Mr. Churchill is denied. , I I A copy of the petition and related materials may be seen during working hours, Monday through Friday, in the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Prod- uct Safety Commission, 1111 18th Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20207. Dated: December 29, 1976. SHELDON D. BuTTs, Acting FOR ,BEVERAGES; -BOTTLE CAPS Denial of Two Petitions I. INTRODUCTION The. purpose of this notice is to an- nounce the denial of two separate peti- tions requbsting the Consumer Product Safety Commission to take regulatory action. The first petition is from Thomas G. Packard who requested the com-mencement of a proceeding for the issu- ance of a consumer product safety rule on the design, construction, and func- Itional impact behavior of glass con- tainers for malt beverages, carbonated soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages. The second petition is from Judith A. Hecht who requested the issuance of consumer product safety rules on carbonated soft- drink glass bottles and their caps. She believes there are unreasonable risks ofinjury associated with glass shattering upon impact when soft drink bottles are dropped and unreasonable risks of in- jury associated with the difficulty of re- moving twist-off bottle caps. In addition, Ms. Hecht requested that carbonated soft-drink bottles be made to withstanda fall from a height of five feet without glaIs spattering, that all twist-off caps be banned, and that 'carbonated soft-drink bottle caps with sharp edges be prohibited. Section 10 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2059) provides that any interested person may petition the Consumer Product Safety Commission to commence a proceeding for the issuanceof a consumer product safety rule. Sec- tion 10 also provides that if the Commis- sion denies a petition, it shall publish inthe FEDERAL REGISTER the reasons for such denial. The Commission, staff decided to con- sider both petitions simultaneously be-cause each petition deals in part with a similar hazard. IL PETITIONS On April 15, 1975, the Commission re- ceived the petition (CP 75-21) from Thomas G. Packard. In his petition, Mr. Packard stated that glass beverage bot- tles present an unreasonable risk of in- jury due to their inadequate resistance to impact. He also outlined a design specification for beverage containers made of glass. On May 20, 1976, the Commission re- ceived the petition (CP 76-13) from Judith A. Hecht. In her petition, Ms. Hecht stated her belief that a consumer product safety rule for carbonated soft- drink bottles is needed regarding glass spattering on impact of the bottle and recommended that all carbonated soft- drink containers be able to withstand falls from heights of five feet without glass spattering. In addition, Ms. Hecht recommended that twist-off caps be banned and that no soft-drink bottle caps be permitted that have sharp edges. The petitioner proposed as substitutes the screw-off or pry-off caps with round, smooth edges. In reviewing the two petitions, the Commission staff separated them into requests for consumer product safety rules on glass containers for alcoholic beverages, glass containers for malt bev- erages, and glass containers for carbon- ated soft drinks in addition to the re- quest for banning twist-off capg and other carbonated soft-drink bottle caps- with sharp edges. Commission, staff reviewed National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data on injuries and in-depth investigations of injuries associated with beverage containers and bottle caps. Commission staff also considered the de- sign for beverage containers made of glass that was outlined in the rules sug- gested by each, of the petitioners, the technical feasibility of implementing the suggested rules, the potential economic -and environmental impact of the sug- gested rules, and the activities related to developing a proposed voluntary product standard. MIr. DxscussioN AND DECISION A. GLASS CONTAINERS FOR ALLT BEVERAGES The Commission determined in a prior proceeding that malt beverage bottles made of glass do not present an unrea- sonable.risk of injury. The Commission announced its decision in the FEDERAL REGISTER'Of July 31, 1975 (40 FR 32157). The Commission's decision resulted from a petition from the Adolph Coors Company of Golden, Colorado, request- ing the Commission to initiate a proceed-ing under section 7 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056) to develop a consumer product safety standard applicable to risks of injury associated with glass containers for malt beverages. From Commission staff estimates of injuries which: were treated in hospital emergency rooms during 1975, the, Com- mission finds that the estimated numberof injuries associated with malt beverage bottles is ten percent of the estimated total number of injuries associated with all types of glass containers. Eight in;- depth investigation reports of accidents associated with malt beverage bottles re- veal that one injury occurred when a beer bottle fell out of a refrigerator and allegedly exploded on\u00b0 impact with the floor and that one injury occurred when a bottle broke at its neck while being opened as a result of what was described as a small explosion. The other six In- juries occurred when the victims stepped on previously broken beer bottles or whent such bottles were used as weapons. The Commission concludes, uppn re- viewing this most recent data, that the information is not sufficient to change its prior determination that an unreason- able risk of injury does not appear to be associated with malt beverage bottles. Accordingly, this aspect of petition CP 75-21 has been denied. B. GLASS CONTAINERS FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES In the course of the Commission's earlier investigation of malt beverage bottles and the Commission's continuing investigation of the possible hazards pre- sented by carbonated beverage bottles, it has encountered no information that would cause it to conclude that bottles for alcoholic beverages pose unusual risk to consumers. The Commission has information con- cording to the in-depth investigation re- ports of accidents associated with glass containers for alcoholic beverages. Ac- cording to the in-depth investigation re- ports, none of the five accidents oc- curred from the bottle falling to the floor or impacting some other surface. The Commission concludes that at this time and unreasonable risk of Injury does not appear to'be associated with glass containers for alcoholic beverages. Therefore, this aspect of petition CP 75- 21 has been denied. C. GLASS CONTAINERS FOR CARBONATED BEVERAGES From an analysis that was prepared by the Commission staff, the Commis- sion estimates that 33,000 people were treated in hospital emergency rooms dur- ing 1975 for injuries associated with car- bonated beverage containers. The hazard analysis dated April 1975 and a prelim- inary analysis of a special telephone sur- vey of glass beverage-bottle injuries re- ported through the Commission's Na- tional Electronic Injury Surveillance Sys- tem (NEISS) between June 4 and August 12, 1975 indicate that about one half of the reported injuries are associated wltl carbonated beverage bottles that are dropped. When the results of the tele- phone survey have been evaluated by the Commission staff and an engineering analysis made of the hazard data ob- tained from the survey, this information may enable the Commission to evaluatethe relative risk of each hazard pattern, to Ideniffy'promising solutions, to evhlu-ate the likelihood of success of volitntAry activity, and to make a Preliminary de-termination of the risks of injurO and the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL..42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 I NOTICES need for a mandatory product safety rule.Continuation of these efforts Is part ofthe Commission's current operating plan. A proposed voluntary product stand-ard TS 214c Is being developed underthe procedures for the development of voluntary standards by the National Bu-reau of Standards (NBS), U.S. Depart- ment of Commerce. The proposed volun-tary product standard contains perform- ance requirements for temper, thermal shock resistance, internal pressure strength, impact resistance, and abrasion resistance. Additional requirements in- clude minimum wall thickness, dimen- sional tolerances, and visual inspection requirements. The proposed standard would apply only to conventional glassbottles for carbonated soft drinks as manufactured, not to non-conventional type bottles now in use, such as for ex- ample, plistic-encapsulated glass bottles or all plastic bottles. It also does not deal with those hazards that may be created after the bottles have been re- celved by the bottler or those hazardsthat may be created in a returnable bot- tle between fillings, although a voluntarystandard proceeding to do that has been requested of NBC by the National Soft Drink Association (NSDA). Commission -staff is monitoring these activities. Section 7(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)) providesthat the requirements of a stand- ard shall, whenever feasible, be ex-pressed in terms of performance require- ments. The Commission finds that Mr.Packard (CP 75-21) suggested a design specification for reducing the risk of in- jury associated with glass containers. The Commission believes it is possible that Mr. Packard's design, if adopted, could lead to an increased hazard be-cause of the possibility of incieased stresses along the grooves of the design. Ms. Hecht's suggestion in CP 76-13,that a standard for carbonated bever- age bottles include a drop test may be a useful one. However, on the basis of the Commission's extensive and continuing investigation of the possible hazards pre- sented by carbonated beverage bottlesand of various engineering approaches intended to reduce or eliminate them, the Commission is unable to conclude at thistime that a mandatory standard, as sug- gested, is needed. Therefore, these aspects of petition CP 75-21 and 76-13 have been denied. However as indicated, the Commission staff is continuing to work on the matter. D. TWIST-OFr AMD OTHER BOTTLE CAPS wYu1 SHARP EDGES The Commission has information con- cerning, six accidents associated with twist-off caps from carbonated beverage bottles and one injury associated with acrown-type cap. From an analysis of the injuries by the Commission staff, the Commission cannot determine that twist-off caps are more hazardous than other types of closures. Regarding the suggested replacement of twist-off caps with screw caps as found on fruit juicesor pry-off caps with round, smooth edges, 'the Commission is not aware of any datato show that the suggested alternatives are suitable for use with pressurized containers. .The Commission concludes that there is insufficient available information for determining at this time whether an un- reasonable risk of injury is associated with the difficulty of opening twist-off caps for carbonated beverage bottles. Therefore, this aspect of petition CP 76- 13 has been denied. IV..ConcLuszos After considering each of the two pe-titions and the information developed by the Commission staff in this matter, the Commission concludes that an unreason- able risk of Injury associated with the impact behavior of glass containers formalt beverages and alcoholic beverages does not appear to exist at this time. In addition, the Commission believes It is premature to conclude that a manda- tory safety standard for glass containers for carbonated beverages is rjecessary.The Commission has Insufficlent evidence to conclude that an unreasonable risk of Injury Is associated with the opening of twist-off caps and the sharpness of other carbonated beverage-bottle caps. There- fore, both petitions CP 75-21 and 76-13 have been denied. A copy of each petition and the Infor- mation developed by the Commission staff in this matter may be seen during working hours, Monday through Friday, in the Office of the Secretary, ConsumerProduct Safety Commission, Washing- ton, D.C. 20207. Accordingly, pursuant to tectlon 10(d) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (Pub. 1. 92-573, 86 Stat. 1217; 15 U.S.C. -2059(d)), notice is hereby given of the Commission's denial of the petitions. Dated: December 29,1976. ST- ou iCP 760-17] PIERCED EARRING SUPPORT WIRES Denial of Petition In this notice the Consumer Product Safety Commission denies a petition re- questing the establishment of safety standards for pierced earring support wires. Section 10 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2059) pro- vides that any interested person may e- titfon the Consumer Product Safety Commission to commence a proceeding for the Issuance of a consumer product safety rule. Section 10 also provides that if the Commission denies such a petition, it shall publish Its reasons for denial in the FEDERAL REGISTER. On August 30, 1976, Donald Montague petitioned the Commission to commence a proceeding to Issue a consumer productsafety rule setting performance stand- ards for pierced earring support wires, or in the alternative, establishing a reg-ulation for cautionary labeling of pierced - earring support wires. The petition asserts that pierced ear- ring ornaments suffer from an unsafe design In that the pierced earring sup- Port wire does not disengage from the earlobe when tension s applied; and the earring ornament does not disengage the earring support wire when tension is applied. The petition alleges that If cur- rently manufactured pierced earring or- naments are pulled, caught, or yanked. they can cause injury to the ear. The petition describes several possible acci- dent scenarios such as dangling earrings being caught in bedclothes, snagged while removing a sweater, or pulled during af- fectionate roughhousing. The petitioner alleged knowledge of five instances of ear injury caused by pierced earrings but this data was not submitted with the petition. After careful consideration, the Com- mission has determined to deny this pe- tition because presently available infor- mation does not support a preliminary determination that pierced earring sup- port wires present an unreasonable risk of injury. In assessing the. question of unreason-able risk of injury or injury potential the Commission weighs the degree, na-ture and frequency of injury associated with the consumer product against the potential effect of the rule on the cost. utility and availability of the product. The Commission also considers the rela- tive priority of the rsl of injury asso- elated with the product and the Commis- slon's resources available for rulemakin-' activities with respect to that risk of in- Jury. (Procedures for Petitioning for Rulemaking under Section 10 of the CPSA, 16 CFR 1110.11(b).) The CPSC policy on establishing priorities for Com- mission action, 16 CFR 1009.8, sets forth the criteria upon which Commission pri- orities are based. The injury data obtained by the Com- mission through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) does not have the specificity needed to Identify or quantify the hazards associ- ated exclusively with pierced earrings. The data indicates, however, that those types of Injuries that could be associated with both pierced and regular earrings (e.g., contusions/abrasions, hematoma and lacerations) apply only to about 3 (1,266) of the total estimated ear in- juries, and these injuries involve only relatively minor injuries. It thus appearfs that there Is a low frequency of injury asociated with pierced earrings andthose injuries that do occur are relatively minor in severity. While the Commission recognizes that there may be a potential for ear injury from currently designed pierced earring ornaments and support wires, this poten- tial does not appear to be reflected in the Commisslon's injury data. Only one in-depth investigation of aninjury associ- ated with pierced earrings has been con- ducted by the Commission. The injury in that case involved a 7-year old child fighting with a playmate and the injuries sustained were apparently minor. Ap- FEDERAL REGISTER.

CROIX RIVERS AND FOR LAKE SUPERIOR WATERS WITHIN MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN Receipt of Petition Notice Is hereby given that a joint petition has been received from the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin for a determination pursuant to section 312837 (f) (3) of Fuilic Lay: 92-500, that ade- quate facilities for the safe and sani- tary removal and treatment of se-,age from all vessels are rcasonably available for the Minnesota-Wiconsin portions of the Millssiippi River and the St. Croix River and for the Minnesota-Wisconsin portions of Lake Superior. In an earlier actlo-i (41 FR 11875, March 22, 1976) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determined for the waters of Lake Superior, the Mississippi River, and the St. Croix River to North Hudson, aU within the State of Wiscon- sin, that facilities to remove sanitary wastes from commercial vessels are not reasonably available and that pump-out facilities for recreational craft are sparsely located and would involve travel distances; between such locations of as much as 50 or 60 miles In some areas. In this joint petition from the two States, the Information and public com- ments relating to the March 22, 1976, determination were requested by the State of Wisco-sin to be made a part of the record, and that request is granted. The Governors of the States of Mnne- sota and Wisconsin requested that the petition for Lake Superior be considered separately from the petition for the MLsssippi and St. Croix Rivers, and on its ov.n merlts. Section 312(f) (3) states that \"After the effective date of the initial standards and regulations promulgated under this section, if any State determines that the protection and enhancement of the qual-ity of some or all of the waters within such State require greater environmental protection, such State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not, into such waters, except that no such prohibi- tion shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treat- ment of cewage from all vessels are rea- sonably available for such water to which such prohibition would apply.\" For the waters of Lake Superior, in- cluding Superior Bay and St Louis Bay,the state of Minnesota certifies that pump-out facilities are located at theMunicipal Tourist Park, Grand Marais;the Knife River Marina, Knife River; Drills Marina, Duluth; and LakeheadBoat Basin, Duluth. The Municipal Tourist Park facility operates from April 15 until October 15, 8 am. to 9 pm., 7 days per week. The Knife River marina operates 7 days per week from 8 am. to S p.m. Drills Marina operates from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the Lakehead Boat Basin operates from 8 am. until 4:30 p.m. Inaddition to the stationary pump-out facilities for recreational vessels, the petition states that septic tank pnmp-out facilities are available at Grand Marais, Beaver Bay, Two Harbors, Duluth and Cloquet. The State certifies that although the stationary pump-out facilities handle only recreational craft, the combination of septic tank Pumpers and stationary pump-outs precludes no vessel fcaue of insufficient water depth adjacent to the facility. The State certifies that all waste removed from all vessels are required to be disposed of either at a National Pollut- FEDERAL KEGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES ant Discharge Elimination System's per-mitted facility or on land in conformance with applicable Federal, State and local requirements. 'The State of Wisconsin certified thatshore-based licensed septic tank pump- out trucks are available for recreationalcraft at both Superior and Ashland onLake Superior and that fixed pump-out facilities are available for recreational vessels at Bayfleld and LaPointe. Thereare no.fixed pump-out Tacilities for rec-reational vessels at Superior. The Statecertified further that licensed septic tank trucks are available to service commer- cial vessels at Ashland and that the non-ore-carrying ships at Superior can be serviced by licensed septic tank punip-outtrucks. In commenting on this earlier in- dividual petition from the State of Wis-consin, the Lake Carriers' Association contended that there is no reasonable way that a truck can be driven over thedocks at Superior to reach a vessel be-cause of the configuration of the various loading and unloading docks. The State of Wisconsin stated that It is possible for ore boats to be serviced by shore-based trucks from the grain docks, either prior to being loaded or prior to leaving theSuperior Harbor. The State of Wisconsin certifies that waste collected by all suchpump-out facilities are treated in con- formance with both State and Federal law. The State of Minnesota petition ad- dresses the waters of the Mississippi River from the Iowa border to Lock and Dam No. 2 at Hastings, Minnesota, andthe waters of the St. Croix River fromits mouth to Taylor Falls, Miiinesota. The State certifies that pump-out facilities are located at Muller Boat Works, Still-water; Port of Sunnyside, Stillwater; Afton Standards Service, Dresbach. In addition, septic tank pumping facilities are available within 10 miles of docks and marinas in the metropolitan area, and within 20 miles outstate at 17 locations along these waterways for commercial vessels. The petition states that a majority of the commercial tugs use the commercial pump-out at S1. Paul for fuel, repairsand pump-out facilities. The State of Minnesota certifies that the combination of stationary pump-outs and septic tank pumpers will exclude no vessel because of insufficient water depth. Although the stationary pump-out facilities service recreational vessels, the septic tank pumping facilities to the best of the State's knowledge are able to reach all docks, recreational and commercial. The State of Minnesota certifies that all wastes removed from vessels at station- ary pUmp-out facilities and by septia tank pumping facilities are required to be disposed of at a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System's per- mitted facility or applied on land in con- formance with applicable Federal, State and local requirements. The State of Wisconsin filing jointly with the State of Minnesota for the Min- nesota-Wisconsin portions of the Mis- sissippi River and the St. Croix River in- dicates that a total of 13- recreational pump-out facilities are located at La- Crosse. Alma, Pepin, Prescott and Hud- son. The State certifies that towboats presently can be serviced by licensed septic tank pump-out trucks at LaCrosse, Wisconsin and, in correspondence filed with the petition, stated that on the Mis- sissippi River most of the commercial traffic is handled at private docks owned and operated by the towing companies for their customers. Although there are no \"in-place\" pump-out facilities for commercial vessels along the Mississippi River, the State of Wisconsin claims that the river towboats have used facilities to the north and south of the State for the past year for the disposal of con- tained vessel wastes. Comments and views regarding this joint request for action from- the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin may be filed on or before February 18, 1977. Such communications, or request for a cony of the applicant's petition, should be ad- dressed to the Director, Criteria and Standards Division (WH-585), Office of Water Planning and Standards, OWHM, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460. All comments made in response to the earlier petition from the State of Wisconsin for some of these waters (40 FR 37252, August 26, 1975) are a part of record in this action.

Copies of these legal autoritles are attached to the State Plan. The Plan lists the personnel available in the Department of Agriculture and the Cooperative Extenslon Service to carry out the certification program andthe approximate percentage of their time that will be devoted to the pesticide pro- gram. The Plan also includes a budget for the pestelde program for the De- partment of Agriculture and the Co- operative Extension Service. The Department of Agriculture will submit an annual report to EPA on or before May 1 of each year and other rea- sonable reports requested by the Admin- istrator of EPA. Colorado estimates that approxi- mately 2,763 commercial and 15.000 to 20,000 private applicators will need to be certified: Both certified cdmmercial and private applicators will be issued certifi- cation credentials indicating the cate- gory(s) or limitations. The commercial applicator categories proposed in the Plan are the same as those in 40 CFR 171.3. No now categories are proposed. New subcategories pro- posed are as follows: 1. AgrcultumI Pest Control-a) Plant: (1) Insect Control, (2) Plant DIs- ease Control, (3) Weed Control. (b) Ani- mal: (1) Insect Control. 2.

The standards, of competency for com- mercial applicators in Colorado will be the same as those in 40 CFR 71A.4(bi and (c) and 171.6. All commercial applicators will be re- quired to Pass a written examination prior to being certified. This examination will cover the general standards in 40 CFR 171.3(b) and 171.6 and the st-and- ards for the particular category or sub- category the applicator wishes to be czr- tifled In. All commercial applicators shal renew their certification by either paw- ing a written examination or by attend- ance at an approved training course every two years. The standards of competency for pri- vate applicators are the same as those listed n 40 CFR 171.5(a) and 171.6. Pr;- vate applicators will be certified by one of five options. 1. Submitting to the Commis-ioner r certification of evidence of attend-- at, or completion of, an approved work- shop, training course, or educational pr.7- gram. Each approved workshop, trainir- course, or educational pr gram will in- elude at a minimum: (a) Coverage o' the private applicator standard., and o b, Each applicator will complete a no p=-' no fail written questionnaire or have ri - celved a passing grade for a course c I- fered by secondary vocational agriv,,!- tura] Programs in Colorado or other re- - ognized educational Institution. 2. Submitting to the Commisson-- completed questionnaire provided r-Phan approved programmed text. U- completion of the written questionnt-j- and programmed text the applicator wil' sign a statement verifying that he com- Pleted such work himself. The Depart- ment of Agriculture will use the EPA developel programmed text \"Arjly F:-- ticides Correctly.\" 3. Satisfactorily completing a written examination given by the Commissioner. This examination will cover the private applicator standards. An applicator must have a score of 70% or better for pasccge. 4. Submitting evidence of certification or licensing as a private applicator in any other state pursuant to an approved United States Environmental Protection Agency applicator certification progran with which the Commissioner has en- tered into a reciprocal agreement. 5. Any person who has not been certi- filed as a private applicator may obtain a FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES point of purchase emergency certification by completing a questionnaire at any location of any licensed pesticide dealer who is certified to sell restricted use pesticides. The questionnaires shall be made available to the dealers by the Commissioner and when completed'shall be evidence of emergency certification. as a private applicator for the single pur- chase and single use of the restricted use pesticide purchased. The private appli- cator and the dealer shall certify to the Commissioner that they have discussed the subject matter of the questionnaire and its answers..Private applicators shall not be certi- 'fled for a period of more than five years. Private applicators who have not been convicted of a violation of the Colorado pesticide act shall be recertified by com- pletion of a recertification form, unless the Commissioner determines that changes in technology or state or federal laws require the applicator to redemon- strate his competency. Applicators who have been convicted of a violation of Colorado's pesticide actshall be recertified by completion of one of the original methods of certification. Applicators will be encouraged to main- tain their competency by participating in on-going state educational programs. No method to certify private applicators who cannot read English will be em- ployed within Colorado. Sample examinations for commercial and private applicators are attached tothe Plan, as provided by 40 CFR 171.7 (e) (1) (1) (D) and (ii) (E).. However, in view of the need to preserve the confi- dentiality of the examination format, theState of Coloi'ado has requested that the examinations not be made available for public inspection. The Agency agreeswith this position, and has removed the sample examinations from the public in- spection copies of the Plan.The Plan requests the approval of EPA to certify those commercial appli- cators who have passed written exami- nations administered under the State's present licensing program- EPA has re- viewed and evaluated these examina-tions and will accept as certified those applicators who have passed the re-quired examinations. A copy of this evaluation and determination is attached to the State Plan. The Plan provides for a statement concerning the Government Agency Plan (GAP) to be forwarded to EPA within 60 days after the approval of GAP by EPA. The Colorado Department of Agricul- ture has not entered into any agree-ments with any Indian reservations. ThePlan provides that any cooperative agreements entered into will be for- warded to EPA within 30 days. Coloradohas not entered into reciprocity agree- ments. However, in the event Colorado does, any reciprocity agreements entered.into by the State will be forwarded to EPA as a part of the State Plan. Colo- rado will provide available informationon integrated pest management (IPM) to applicators upon their request..Other Colorado pesticide. regulatory activities and authorities include pesti- cide product registration, dealer licensing and -regulation, equipment registration and inspection, and product sampling and analysis, A regular program of in- spection, product sampling, and follow up investigations of accidents and com- plaints will be conducted by Department of Agriculture personnel.

RP75-O1 ] CONSOUDATED GAS SUPPLY CORP. Order Granting Motion To Sever and Con- solidate Proceedings and To Omit Initial DecisionDxc= xnR 27, 1976. On December 1,1976, Consolidated Gas Supply Corporation (Consolidated) filed a Motion to Sever and Consolidate Pro- ceedings and to Omit Initial Decision in the instant docket. Consolidated seeks to sever from its pending rate case, Docket No. RP75-91, the depreciation is- sue and consolidate it with four other de- preciation proceedings currently con- solidated and before the Commission.' Consolidated also moves the Commis- sion to omit the Initial decision In the current docket (RP75-91) which would allow the Commission to consider the five currently pending depreciation.pro- ceedings as a single unit. On Decem- ber 6, 1976, the Rochester Gas and Elec- tric Corporation filed a response in which it indicated that subject to certain un- derstandings it supported Consolidated's motion. These understandings were that Consolidated's motion goes solely to the depreciation issue in Docket No. RP75- 91 and that the evidence submitted in connection with the depreciation issue in Docket No. RP75-91 would continue to be a part of the record in the remainder of that docket. On December 15, 1976, the Commission Staff filed an answer op- posing Consolidated's motion to sever, consolidate, and omit the initial decision. A similar situation confronted the Commission on May 30, 1975, when the Commission issued an order \"Granting Motion to Sever and Consolidate De- preciation Issues and Extend Procedural Dates\" in Docket Nos. RP71-77, RP72- 104, RP73-107, and RP74-90. In that or- der we stated: We have no doubt that there are many similarities among Docket Nos. RP7l-77, RP72-104, RP73-107 and RP74-40 and that they contain many common questions of law and/or fact as incident to their embracing four successive rate filings by a single natural-gas company. Such common ques- tions give us authority under 6 1.20(b) of our Rules of Practice and Procedure to con- solidate the proceedings or common parts of them. And while we can appreciate that dif- ferent test periods and rate levels may be in- volved, and that there may be differences In he postures of the proceedings, we believeon balance that such differences are out- weighted by the common veins among the proceedings and, consequently, that it Is ap- propriate and In the public interest to sever 'the depreciation Issues from Docket Nos. RP72-104, RP73-107 and RP74-90 and to con- solidate those severed Issues with the de- 'preclatlon issue in Docket No. RP71-77 for the purposes of hearing and decision. For the same reasons we are inclined to sever the depreciation issue in Docket No. RP75-91 and consolidate it with the current consolidated depreciation pro- ceeding. 'These proceedings are Docket Nos. RP71- 77 (remand), RP72-104, RP73--107, and RP 74-90, which are the subject of an initial de- cision of the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued April 12, 1976.As noted above, the consolidated de- preciation proceeding is the subject of an initial decision issued by Presiding Ad- mini trative Law Judge Benkin, issued April 12, 1976, and currently before the Commission on exceptions. Owing to the status of that proceeding, it would be a hollow gesture to consolidate the RP75- 91 proceeding with it and not omit the initial decision in RP75-91. Owing to the commonality of the facts and/or law of the five depreciation proceedings, we feel that it would be administratively expe- dient to omit the Initial decision in RP75-91 and thus allow the Commission to dispose of the entire package of pend- ing depreciation issues relating to Con- solidated.I Consolidated's motion also suggested that a short briefing schedule be estab- lished if the Commission were to grant its motion to sever, consolidate, and omit initial decision. The briefing schedule proffered by Consolidated was that initial briefs be submitted three weeks after the issuance of this order and reply briefs be due two weeks thereafter. Inasmuch as the omission of the initial decision will put this proceeding in the posture of any other proceeding before the Commission on exceptions, we feel that It is only proper to establish a briefing schedule analogous to that set forth in our Rules\" for briefs on exceptions and briefs oppos- ing exceptions. Accordingly, we will adopt the filing requirements set forth in g 1.31 of the Commission's Rules nf Practice and Procedure. The Commiqion find!; and orders: (A) Consolidated's Motion to Sever and Consolidate Proceedings and to Omit Initial Decision should be and Is hereby granted. (B) The Presiding Administrative Law Judge should be and is hereby directed to certify the record in Docket 1o, RP75-91 to the Commission. .(C) Initial briefs in Docket No. RP75- 91 shall be filed within thirty days after the issuance of this order and reply briefs shall be filed in response to Initial briefs within twenty days after the filing of initial briefs.

The affected project lands wre located in Gaston County, North Carolina, on the Catawba River. The proposed bridge would replace the existing steel beam span bridge over which State Road 1909 crosses the Ca- ta'wba River. Applicant states that the existing bne-lane bridge is In ppor struc- tural condition and has a low capacity, and consequently is considered a public safety hazard. The new bridge would be 90 feet long and 26 feet wide, and would accommodate two lanes of traffic. The right-of-way for the bridge and ap- proaches would be 60 feet wide. Upon completion of the new bridge, the superstructure and a portion of the substructure of the old bridge would be removed, and the remaining portion of the substructure left intacL The new bridge would be located about eight feet upstream (north) of the old bridge.

On December 1, 1976, Indiana & Mich-igan Electric Company (I & An tendered for filing with the Commission a -super- seding sefvice agreement with the Rich- mond Power & Light Company of the City of -Richmond (RP & L). Indiana, containing tariff rate WS. The revised service agreement Is proposed to become effective on January 1, 1977, the expira- tion date of the current rate schedule. RP & L filed a petition to Intervene and objected to the terms of service under the proposed agreement. For the reasons s2t forth below, the Commison shall sus- pond the effectiveness of 'he erviceagreement for one day, consolidate the proceedings with ongoing consolidated Docket Nos. ER76-792 nnd E-9329.t and grant the petition to intervene. RP & L is currently being servedunder I & M's Rate Schedule FPC No. 58,* which contains the company's tariff Rate IP. On December 15, 1976, RP & L fled a pe- tition to intervene, stating its objection to certain terms of service of the pro- posed service agreement. The proposed superseding service agreement would place RP & L on tariff rate WS and under new terms of service to which RP & L objects. Speclfcally, RP & L contends: (1) that I & M'As propozed contract capacity of 70,000 kiw does not conform to Tariff WS; (2) that the ap- plication to RP *& L of I & M's minimum billing demand provision uf 100 percent of contract capacity for partial require- ments customers would constitute un- lawful discrimination: and (3) that a price squeeze would result from Imposl- tion of the tendered service agreement on RP & L. RP & L requests that we TeJcct the filing and that we excise from I & 's Tariff WS the provision requiring partial requirements customers to pay a month- ly minimum billing demand equal to 10D percent of contract capacity. In the al- ternative, RP & L requests a five month suspension. We note that there is no patent failure on the part of I & L to comply with the Commission's ling re- quirements, such as would require rejec- tion of its filing under 9 35. of our Reg- ulations. The Issues raised by Petitioners can most nppropriately be addreszed in a hearing. The Commission's reviLe of I Z D'Vis filing indicates that the term, and con- ditions of the proposed service agre - ment have not been shown to be Just and reasonable and may be unjust, un- reasonable, unduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful. Accordingly. the Commisson will accept I & I's propoal \"Previously consolidated FPO Electric Tarir N8 Volume NO. I (michmond).for filing and suspend its operation forone day, to become effective January Z 1977, and grant RP & Ls petition to in- tervene. Since a hearing on simlar sery- Ice agreements between I & x and the cities of Anderson, Indiana, and Mrsha- wakae Indiana, containing terms similar to those In dispute herein, has prevl- ouly been ordered in consolidated Doc- ket Nos. EIL76-792 and ,-9329, the Com- mision shall consolidated the instant docket with that ongoing proceeding for PurPoses of hearing and decision. The proposed rate level under tariff rate WS %ill of cource be zubject to refund pend- Lng the outcome of the proceedings in Docket Xo3. ER76-714, et al. I & 1 requested waiver of the cost sup-port filing requirements of the Commis- sion's Regulations for the instant filing since It included cost support for tariffrate WS in its Ilay 28. 1976, filing in Dochcet 11c:;. ER7G-714, et, al. In view of the foregoing, it appears appropriate to grant the waiver re- quested by I&LM. However, I&M should file In Docket No. ERW7-'716 support for the contract capacity specified in the pro-posed service agreenent for service to RP&L. The Commssion finds: (1) It is n;c- esary and proper in the public interest and to aid in the enforcement of th Federal Power Act that the filing re- quirements be vaived as requested by I&M and that the service agreement proposed in Docket No. ER7-716 be ac- cepted for filing and suspended for one day, to become effective January 2, 1977, pending hearing and decision as to its avfulnez3. (2) Good cause does not exist to grant -RP 'a motion to reject, a motion forrecison of tariff provision or its mo- tion for a five month suspension. (3) Intervention In this docket by the RP&M may be in the public Interest (4) Good cause exists to consolidate vith Docket Nos. ER76-'92 and E-9323 the issue- with respect to RP&L concem- ing the limitation of contract capacity and day to day service and to consider In the separate proceeding, Docket No. EB7--716, all other issues relating to RP&TL.

Concurrently, Pan Eastern was authorized to sell to Panhandle the gas produced from the transferred prop- erties at the applicable area rates in- stead of at Panhandle's cost of service. Pan Eastern's collection of these In- creased rates was expressly conditioned on its establishment of an exploration and development fund equi7alent to the difference in rates (stated to be $43,609,- 205) plus 3.0 cents per Mcf and 50.0 cents per barrel for all recoverable gas and oil reserves, respectively, discovered by Pan Eastern. Pan Eastern was also required to dedicate 400,000,000 Mcf of new gs re- serves to Panhandle within seven (7) years of the commencement of the pro- gram or to reimburse Panhandle 11.0 cents per Mcf for each Mcf of the differ- ence between 400,000,000 Mcf and the gas reserves actually dedicated. The Stipulation and Agreement sub- stantially modifies the original proposal approved by the Commission. The pricing provisions take into account the source of funds used to develop the new gas re- serves and recognize the higher prices of gas, crude oil and other liquid hydro- carbons now prevailing. The term of the agreement Is extended to 1968. The re- quirement that Pan Eastern dedicate a specific volume of gas to Panhandle Is deleted, but Pan Eastern is-still required to sell.all new gas reserves to Panhandle except volumes which cannot be feasibly made available.8 A general description of the provisions of the Stipulation and Agreement is set forth below. Article I states that the Stipulation and Agreement is a negotiated settle- ment which settles all contested L-sues and additional matters relating to Pan Eastern's operation and future programs as set forth therein. Article II provides that Pan Eastern shall sell \"Flowing Gas\" and \"New Gas\" to Panhandle. Flowing Gas is defined as all gas produced from wells commenced prior to January 1, 1973, which were connected to Panhandle's system and transferred to Pan Eastern on or before January 1, 1973. New Gas is defined as all gas produced by Pan Eastern from wells commenced on or after January 1, 1973, except for volumes which cannot feasibly be made available to Panhandle. Article III defines the funds which Pan Eastern shall invest in gas lease acquisition, exploration, development and production activities. The funds are: 1. The amount by which the revenues for Flowing Gas exceed the cost of service (compUted in accordance with Appendix A to the Stipulation and Agreement) for each calendar year commencing January 1, 1973. (This amount is referred to as the Differential Amount.); 2. For each Mcf of New Gas, an amount equal to the sum of (1) the Base Price multiplied by the percentage equal to 25% less 25% times the Source Factor This pr6vision recognizes that Pan Fastern might bo required to relinquish certain volumes for compressor fuel or to -sell a portion of the volumes to the transporting pipeline to facilitate the delivery of the gas*to Panhandle's system.and (Ii) the Supply Refund Price inulti- plied by 10% times the Source Factor. (The Supply Refund Price is equal to the difference between the Base Price and the bracketed quantity set forth in Arti- cle IV(B) (1) .) ;3. One-seventh of the amount received from the sale of oil, condensate,* and liquid hydrocarbons produced from Pan Eastern's interest in gas leases; 4. The amount received by Pan East- ern upon conveying oil-only leases in ac- cordance with Article VII(C), which shall be equal to Pan Eastern's share of lease acquisition, exploration, develop- ment, and any other expenditures on such leases; and 5. One-seventh of the amount received by Pan Eastern's transferee or subse- quent assigns from the sale-of tion of oil and liquid hydrocarbons pro- duced from Pan Eastern's former inter- est in oil-only leases acquired after the approval date and conveyed In accord- ance with Article VII(C). Article IV specifies the price provisions to be included In contracts or rate sched- ules for the sale of gas by Pan Eastern to Panhandle as follows: 1. For Flowing Gas, the Base Price shall be the currently effective area rate, national rate or other rate authorized by the Commission for similar vintage gas sold by independent producers, subject to the price adjustments permitted for such gas;\" 2. For New Gas, the Base Price shall be the currently effective area rate, na- tional rate or other rate authorized by the Commission for similar vintage gas sold by independent producers including Btu adjustments and periodic adjust- ments, subject to other price adjust- ments permitted for such gas and to the Supply Refund Adjustment. The Source Factor is defined as a frac- tion which is deemed to be unity on the date the order approving the Stipulation and Agreement becomes ,final and non- appealable and which is to be recom- puted each succeeding December 31, but which is never to exceed unity. The nu- merator is the sum of the cumulative dif- ferential amounts computed under Ar- ticle III (A) for the period from the date the order becomes final and-nonappeal- able, and Pan Eastern's cumulative gross investment as of the date the order be- comes final and nonappealable in prop- erties other than the producing proper- ties acquired from Panhandle on or be- fore January 1, 1973. (This investment is referred to as the Phase I investment.) The denominator is the greater of: 1. The sum of (i) Pan Eastern's Phase I Investment; and (ii) the portion of the differential amount computed under Ar- ticle MW(A) for the period from the date the order becomes final and nonappeal- able until such December 31; and (liI) the cumulative amounts required to be Invested pursuant to Article 111(C), (W) as of such December 31; or 2. Pan Eastern's cumulative gross In- vestment in properties other than the 'producing properties acquired from Pan- handle on or before January 1, 1973..The Supply Refund Adjustment Pro- Visions In the Pan Eastern-Pmhandle contracts are not to operate during any period in which the cumulative total of Supply Refund Adjustment dollars for volumes sold after January 1, 1973, ex- ceeds the cumulative Differential Amount computed under Article IM(A). Article IV also provides for the determin- ation of the Supply Refund Adjustment in the event of certain specified changes In the Commission's regulation of pipe- line or pipeline affiliate owned gas or the termination of the program pursuant to Article VIII. Article V states that the Stipulation and Agreement is made in recognition of present governmental policies and that any party or the Commission Staff may request a prospective review and revision of the pricing formula in Arti- cle IV If there is a major change In these policies not covered by a provision of the Stipulation and Agreement. Article VI requires Pan Eastern to file 'annual reports with the Commission and any party which requests copies of such reports. This report is to be filed on Ap- pendix A to the Stipulation and Agree- ment and is to include cumulative data In addition to the prior calendar year's operations. In addition, Pan Eastern is to file quarterly reports during any sus- pension of the Supply Refund Adjust- ment provisions pursuant to Article IV (B) (3). Article VII states that the purpose of the Stipulation and Agreement is to aug- ment the gas supplies available for sale to the customers served by Panhandle's pipeline system and places certain con- straints on Pan Eastern's operations. Pan Eastern may not sell or otherwise transfer properties acquired from Pan- handle on or before January 1, 1073, without prior Commission authorization. Pan Eastern Is required to engage in exploration, development, and produc- tion activities on a continuous basis and to endeavor to utilize the funds required to be invested pursuant to Article III in an expeditious manner consistent with prudent and reasonable management judgment. Furthermore, Pan Eastern is to maintain a balanced program of lease acquisition, exploration, and de- velopment in order to connect new sup- plies of gas to Panhandle's system as soon as reasonably possible and, during the next three years, to give primary dmphasis to the development of existing leases.Pan Eastern Is to transfer to an ailli- ate the explored and developed portions of leases which will produce primarily oil and the wells on such leases have been designated as oil wells by the re- sponsible governmental agency. The affiliate Is to pay Pan Eastern an amount equal to all of Pan Eastern's expendi- tures on the properties transferred. Finally, any property acquired subse- quent to January 1, 1973, may, under certain conditions, be transferred free and clear of the Stipulation and Agree- ment other than the commitment of any gas ultimately discovered on such lease to Panhandle upon payment of the FEDERAL REGISTER,'VOL 42, NO.' 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY '4, 1977 NOTICES greater of the amount of consideration densate, and other liquid hydrocarbons received for the sale or transfer or the and the source of the funds used to de- amount of Pan Eastern's expenditures velop new reserves of gas and oil.

Order Approving Merger of Bank Holding Companies Ameriban, Inc, St. Joseph., Missouri (\"Applicant\"), a registered bank hold- ing company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for approval under section 3 (a) 57 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(al (5)) to merge with Consolidated Baneshares of Missouri, Inc., St, Joseph, Missouri, under the charter and title of Ameriban. Inc. Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views, has jbeen given in accordance with section 3 (b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and the Reserve Bank has considered the application and all comments received in: light of the factbrs set forth in. section 3(c) of the Act. Applicant, the ninth largest banking ofganization in Missouri, controls 13 operating banks with aggregate deposits of approximately $266.4 million, repre- senting 1.51- percent of the commercial bank deposits in the State.' Consolidated Bancshares of Missouri, Inc., is a one- bank holding company owning 89.4 per- cent of the voting shares of First State Bank, Rolla, Missouri C'Bank\"). Acqui- sition of Bank would increase Appli- cants share of State deposits only slightly, and would not result in a sig- nificant increase in the concentration of banking resources in MissourL Appli- cant's ranking among banking organiza- tions in the Stite would be unchanged. Bank (deposits: $18.7 million) is the second largest of five banking organiza- tions- in the Phelps County banking market and holds 29.4 percent of the deposits in commercial banks thereln.! None of Applicant's banks are located in the relevant market area. Applicant's nearest subsidiary Is located in Higgins- ville, Missouri, approximately 140 miles from Bank. The record indicates that there is no significant existing competi- tion between Bank and any of Appli- cant's subsidiaries, and it is not likely that significant competition will develop in view of the distances involved and. Missouri's restrictive branching laws. Furthermore, the possibflity that ap- proval would eliminate some potential competition is considered remote. The ratio of deposits per bank in the market suggests that de novo entry is unattrac- tive and unlikely at this time. Competi- tive considerations are, therefore, con- sistent with approval. The financial and managerial re- sources and future prospects of Applicant and its subsidiaries appear satisfactory. The financial condition and prospects of Bank are consistent with approval. 2All banking data are as of De-ember 31, 1975, and reflec(s bank holding Company for- mations and acquisittons approved by the Board to November 12, 1976.

These factors, as they relate to the convenience and needs of the community tor be served, lend some weight, for approval of the application. It is the Reserve Banks Judgment that consummation of the proposed acquLs- tion is in the public interest and that the application should be approved. On the basis of the record, the appli- cation is approved for the rea=ns sum- marized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth day following the effective date of this Order, or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order. unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board of Governors or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, pursuant to delegated authority. Winuma T. BrrLIUGTo, of Stock Interests in Bank Fasbuilding, Inc., Columbia Falls, Montana (\"Applicant\"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act C'Act\"), has applied for the Board's approval under section 3(a) (3) of the Act (12 U.SC. 1842(a) (3) to acquire an additional 18.7 per cent of the outstanding voting shares of Bank of Columbia Falls, Columbia Falls, Montana ('Bank\"). Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views, hoa been given in accordance with section 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all comments received In light of the factor. set forth in section 3(c) of tho Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). In July of 1971, Applicant, a one- bank holding company by virtue of its ownership of 33.3 per cent of the out- standing voting shares of Bank, acquired an additional 18.7 per cent of Bank's shares without the Board's prior approv- al. In 1972 Applicant sought to divest itself of the shares and Is now seeking to acquire them by cash purchase.' Bank ($13.4 million in deposits) Is the 38th largest banking organization in Mon- xit appears from the facts or record that the acquisition of the Ghare3 of Bank =as based on a misunderstanding of the applica- ble. statucs and reulations relating to tho acquisition of the voting stackz of bans by bank holding companies. Applicant Eought to take prompt corrective action to comply with the Act. In accord with the Board'a pest- tion with respect to violations of the Act, the Board has scrutiniz d the underlying facts surrounding the acquu-ition of the shares of Bank. Upon examination or all the facts of record, the Board Is of the view that the facts surrounding the violation are not such as would call for dental of the appU- cation.tana, controlling OA6 per cent of the total deposiLts in commercial banks in the State Bank ranks fifth in. the plat- head County banking market (which is approximated by -Flathead County and the northern third of Lake County) and holds 7.8 per cent of market deposits. As Applicant has no other banking subsid- iarie and the proposal involves only-the acquisition of additional stock interests in Bank. approval of the application will not result in any adverse competitive ef- fecet. It will eliminate neither existing nor potential competition nor will it in- crease the concentration of banking re- sourcea in any relevant area. Thus. com- petitive conmiderations are consistent with approval of the application. The financial and managerial re- sources and future prospects of Appli- cant and Bank are satisfactory and it appears that; Applicant will be able to service the debt az=,clated with this ap- plication while adeqiuately maintaining Bank's capltal position. Thus, banking factors are consistent ith approval. There la no indication that the con- venlence and needs of the community to be cerved are no& currently being met. Althouch there will be no immediate in- crease in the services offered by Bank, convenience and needs considerations are consiatent with approval Therefore, It I- the Board's Judgment that acquisf- tion of the share of Bank would be in the-public Interest and that the applica- tion should be approved. On the basi of the record, the appli- cation Is approved for the reaons sum- marized above. Acquisition of the shares of Bank shall notbemade (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the ef- fective date of this Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good caue by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Min- neapolIS pursu=,t to authority hereby delented.

Applicant controls 81 banks located in seven upper midwestern States,\" includ- ing Iowa, with total deposits of $6.1 billion? Applicant is the largest banking organization in Iowa, controlling six banks with total deposits of $603.1 nil-lion, representing approximately 5.5 per- cent of the total commercial bank de- posits in the State Acquisition, of Bank ($34.5 million in deposits) would increase Applicant's share of Statewide deposits by only 0.3 percent and would-have noappreciable effect upon the concentra- tion of banking resources in Iowa.4 Bank is the second largest of five bank- Ing organizations operating in the Ot- tumwa banking market,' controlling ap- proximately 25.4 percent of market de- posits. Two of Bank's competitors are also located in the city of Ottumwa, in- cluding the market's largest banking or- ganization, with 49.9 percent of total market deposits. Applicant's two closest banking subsidiaries are 'located in Des Moines and Keokuk, respectively, 85 and 90 miles from Ottumwa- In view of thedistances between Bank and Applicant's banking subsidiaries, and other facts of record, no significant comuetition exists or is likely to develop in the future be- tween Bank and Applicant's banking subsidiaries. Although Apnlicant has thefinancial capability to enter the market \"de novo,\" demographic data suggestthat this s not a likely means of entry by Applicant. Consummation of the pro-posal would not eliminate any significant existing competition, nor have an ad- verse effect unon the development of future competition in this market. -Ac- cordingly, based on the above and other facts of record, the Board has determinedthat competitive considerations are con- sistent with approval of the application.The financial and managerial re- sources and future prospects of Appli- cant, its subsidiary banks, and Bank are regarded as satisfactory and consistent with approval, particularly in light of Applicant's proposal-to inject additional capital into Bank upon approval of thisapplication. Affiliation with Applicant will allow Bank to use Applicant's .finan- cial and managerial resources tostrengthen and expand the services pro- vided by Bank, including expansion of Bank's trust, commercial and agricul- tural credit services, as well as extending Bank's hours.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 868 In order to make an affirmative de- termination and issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment as- sistance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a slgnlficant number or propor- tion of the workers in the workers' irm or an appropriate subdivision thereof, have be- come totally or partially -separated, -or are threatened to become totally or partlallyzep- arated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision 'have -decreased absolutely; (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division ard being Imported in increased quantities, either actual or relative to domes- tic production, and (4) That such increased importshave con- tributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease in sales or production. The term \"contributed im- portantly\" means a cause which is important but not necessarily more Important than anyother cause. The investigation has revealed that all of the above criteria have been met. Significant total or partial separations. Average monthly employment was high- est in July 1976 and then declined stead- ily through October 1976, representing a 50 percent decline over the four month period. Also, there were layoffs in every month during this four month period. Sales or production, or both, have de- creased absolutely. Sales in quantity de- clined 5 percent in 1975 compared to 1974 and then Increased 66 percent in the first 6 months of 1976 compared to the first 6 months of 1975. Sales then declined 24 percent in third 4quarter of 1976 com- pared to the third quarter of 1975.Increased imports. Imports increased both absolutely and relatively in 1972 over 1971 and in 1973 over 1972. In 1974, imports declined both absolutely and relatively compared to 1973.Imports of women's shoes increased from 179.8 million pairs in 1974 to 183.5 million paird in 1975, an increase of 2 percent. Imports for the first 9 months of 1976 increased 16.9 percent over the like period in 1975.The ratio of Imports to domestic pro- duction increased from 107.6 percent in 1974 to 119.1 percent in 1975 and declined slightly from 114.2 percent in the first 9 months of 1975 to 110.3 percent in the first 9 months of 1976. Contributed importantly. Imports by Alpeco International, a subsidiary of Cosmos, increased 113 percent in thefirst 9 months of 1976 compared to the first 9 months of 1975. Customers of Cosmos Footwear indi- cated they have decreased their pur- chases of women's shoes from Cosmos Footwear and have increased their pur- chases of imported shoes. Conclusion. After careful review of the facts obtained in the investigation, I con- clude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with women's shoes produced at the Little Falls. New York plant of Allegro Shoe Corp. contributed importantly to the total dr partial sepa- ration of the workers of that plant. InNOTICES accordance with the provisions of the Act, make the following certification: All -workers at the Little Falls, New York plant of Allegro Shoe Corp. who became totally or partially separated from employ- ment on or after July 1. 1976 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Title 1U, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Imports increased 229percent from 1974 to 1975, from 6.4 mil-lion pieces to 21.1 million pieces. In theJanuary-June 1976 period, imports were 109 percent greater than during the same period in 1975.Imports of textile -hangers increased relative to domestic production and con-sumption in each year from 1972 through 1975.

In 1975 and 1976 the domestic market for plant hang-ers was faced with an increase in thesupply of plant hangers coupled with a decline in demand. The saturation of themarket can mainly be attributed to in- creased imports of plant hangers. Cus-tomers of B & C West cited the impact of imports on the domestic market as amajor reason for reduced purchasesfrom the subject firm. Customers stated that B & C could no longer remainprice competitive with the cheaper im- ported hangers.Conclusion.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2-TUESOAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES The investigation was initiated on October 28, 1976 in response to a worker petition received on October 28, 1976 which was filed on behalf of workers and former workers of the Pulaski, Wisconsin plant of the Northern Shoe Division of Brierwood Shoe Corporation, a subsidi-ary of Kleinert's, Inc., Kutztown, Penn- sylvania. The investigation was expand- ed to include workers of the Clintonville, Wisconsin plant of the Northern Shoe Division. The Clintonville plant is a sat-elite facility of the Pulaski plant. The Notice of Investigation was pub- lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER on No- vember 19, 1976 (41 FR 51136). No public hearing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination. was made was obtained principally from officials of the Northern Shoe Division of Brierwood Shoe Corp., its customers, the Department of Com- merce, the International Trade Comrmis- sion, industry analysts, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination-and issue a certification of eli- gibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance. each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act-of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers in the workers' firm, oran appropriate subdivision thereof, have be- come totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially sep- rated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased abso- lutely; (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division are being imported in Increased quantities either actual or relative to domes- tic production; and (4) That such increased Imports have con-tributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease in sales or production. The term \"contributed mpor- tantly\" means a cause which Is Important but not necessarily more Important than any other cause. The investigation revealed that all four of the above criteria have been met with respect to the Pulaski plant butthat the first criterion has not been met with respect to the Clintonville plant. SaiN'cANT ToTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARATIONS The average number, of hourly work- ers employed at the Pulaski plant de- clined 7.5 percent in the August-October 1976 period compared to the like period in 1975. Prior to that period, average hourly employment had not changed from 1974 to 1975 and had Increased in the January-July 1976 period compared to the like period in 1975. The average number of hourly work- ers employed at the Clintonville plant increased 54.2 percent from 1974 to 1975 and rose 52.9 percent in the first ten months of 1976 compared to the like pe- riod in 1975. Average weekly hours worked at Clintonville increased 7.0 per- cent from 1974 to 1975 and declined 0.5 percent in the first ten months of 1976 compared to the like period in 1975.SALES OR PRODUCTION, on Bonr, HAVE DECS ED Northern Shoe Division production de- clined 7.9 percent In quantity in the Au- gust-October 1976 period compared to the like period In 1975. Prior to that pe- riod, production had Increased from 1974 to 1975 and in the January-July 1976 period compared to the like period in 1975. INCREASED ILPORTS Imports of chlldren's nonrubber foot- wear, the principal product of the North- em Shoe Division, decreased in absolute terms but increased relative to domestic production and consumption each year from 1973 to 1975. Imports increased both absolutely and relatively in the first nine months of 1976 compared to the like period in 1975. Imports of infants' and babies' non- rubber footwear decreased in absolute terms and relative to domestic produc- tion and consumption from 1972 to 1974 and did not change significantly from 1974 to 1975. Imports increazed both ab- solutely and relatively in the first nine months of 1976 compared to the like pe- riod in 1975. Imports of women's nonrubber foot- wear increased in absolute terms and relative to domestic production and con- sumption from 1972 to 1973, declined from 1973 to 1974, and then rose from 1974 to 1975. In the first nine months of 1976, imports increased absolutely but declined relatively compared to the like period in 1975. CoNTRImuTED IZroPnTA;mL, Northern Shoe's largest customer, ac- counting for about 90 percent of sales,reduced purchases of children's shoes from the company in 1976 and sIgnifl- cantly increased purchases of Importedchildren's shoes. Northern Shoe was un- able to secure enough new accounts to compensate for the lost sales to Its major customer and was forced to reduce em- ployment at the Pulaski, Wisconsin plant. CONCLUSION' After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the Investigation, I conclude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with nonrubber footwear for children, infants and women pro- duced at the Pulaski, Wisconsin plant of the Northern Shoe Division of Brier- wood Shoe Corporation, contributed Im- portantly to the total partial separa- tion of the workers of such plant. In ac- cordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following certification: All workers of the Pulaski. Wisconsin plant of the Northern Shoo Division of Brier- wood Shoe Corporation, who became or wil become totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 9, 1076, are eligible to apply for adjustment a-1 tancounder Title IrrChapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974. I further conclude that a significant number or proportion of the workers at the Clintonville, Wisconsin plant of the Northern Shoe Division of BrierwoodShoe Corporation have not become, and are not threatened to'become, totally orpartially separated as required under Section 222(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 Signed at Washington, D.C. this 20th day of December 1976.

The investigation was initiated on Au- gust 11, 1976 in response to a worker pe- tition received on that date which was filed by the workers at the Leachville, Arkansas plant of Brown Shoe Company on behalf of workers and former workers producing children's leather shoes at the Leachville, Arkansas plant of Brown Shoe Company, St. Louis, MissourL The notice of investigation was pub- lished in the Federal Register on August24, 1976 (41 FR 35776). No public hear- ing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from officials of the Brown Shoe Company, its customers, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. In- ternational Trade Commission, industry analysts, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and issue a certification of eli- gibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers in such workers' firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely; and (3) That articles like or directly com- petItive with those produced by the firm or subdivision are being imported in increased quantities, either actual or relative to do- mestle production; and (4) That such increased mports have contributed mportantly to the separations, or threat thereof, andr to the decrease in sales or production. The term \"contributed importantly\" means a cause which is im- portant but not necessarily more important than any other cause. The investigation has revealed that all of the above criteria have been met. Significant Total or Partial Separa- tions. The average number of produc- tion workers declined 3.6 percent in 1975 compared to 1974 and declined 9.1 per- cent in the first nine months of 1976 compared to the same period in 1975. Average hours worked declined 9.1 per- cent in 1975 compared to 1974 and de- clined 2.6 percent in the first nine months of 1976 compared to the same period in 1975. Sales or Production, or Both, Have Decreased Absolutely. Sales in number of pairs declined .4 percent in 1975 com- pared to 1974 and declined 24.4 percent in the first quarter of 1976. compared to the first quarter of 1975. Sales in num- ber of pairs increased 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 1976 over the second quarter in 1975 atid increased 29.3 per- cent in the third quarter of 1976 com- pared to the third quarter of 1975. Production in number of pairs de- clined 3.1 percent in 1975 compared to 1974 and declined 19.6 percent in the first quaxter of 1976 compared to the first quarter of 1975. Production in num- ber of pairs increased 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 1976 over the second quarter of 1975 and increased 38.2 per- cent in the third quarter of 1976 over the third quarter of 1975. Increased Imports. Imports of chil- dren't nonrubber footwear increased both absolutely and relatively in 1972 over 1971 and then decreased both ab- solutely and relatively in 1973 from levels in 1972. The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 58.8 percent in 1973 to 59.2 percent in 1974 to 64.5 percent in 1975.In the first six months of 1976 imports Increased both absolutely and relatively compared to the first six months of 1975. Absolute imports increased 44.3 percent in the first half of 1976 compared to the first half of 1975. Also the ratio of im- ports to domestic production increased from 73.5 percent the first six months in 1975 to 75.2 percent in the first six months of 1976. Contributed Importantly.

Customers of Brown Shoe Company indicated they had Increased purchases of imported children's shoes from both Brown and other suppliers relative to purchases of domestically manufactured children's shoes. Conclusion. After careful review of the facts obtained in the investigation, X con- elude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with children's shoes produced at the Leachville, Arkansas plant of the Brown Shoe Company con- tributed importantly to the total or par- tial separation of the workers of that plant. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certi- fication: All workers at the Leaohvlllo, Arkansas plant of the Brown Shoe Company who be- came totally or partially separated from em- ployment on or after August 3, 1970, and before July 1, 1076, are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Title IX, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The Investigation was initiated on Oc-tober 19, 1976 in response to a worker pe-tition received on that date which wasfield by the International Ladies' Gar-ment Workers Union on behalf of work-ers and former workers producingwomen's and Juniors' shirts and blousesat the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania plantof Dorn Shit Company. The Notice of Investigation was pub-lished In the FzDErAL Rzam on No-vember 5, 1976 (41 FR 48806). No publichearing was requested and none was-held. The information upon which the de-termination was made was obtained principally from officials of Dor ShhtCompany, its customers, the US. Inter-national Trade Commission, and Depart-mentfiles. n order to make an affirmative deter-mination and issue a certification ofeligibility to apply for adjustment assist-ance, each of the group eligibility re-quirements of Section 222 of the TradeAct of 1974 mustbemet: (i) That a signilcant number or propor- tlao workers in subdivsln thereof, bare be- como totaly. or partlally separated, or Wei FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 876 threatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absoltitely* (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division are being imported in increased. quantities, either actual or relative to domes- tic production, and (4) That such increased imports have con- tributed importantly to the separations,, or threat thereof, and to the decrease In sales' or production. The term \"contributed Im- portantly\" means a cause which is Important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. The Investigation has revealed that all of the above criteria have been: met by workers of the Dorn Shirt Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. SIGNIFICANT TOTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARATIONS E mployment of production workers at Dorn Shirt Company increased 2.1 per- cent from 1973 to 1974 before decreasing 2.1 percent from 1974 to 1975 and 12.8 percent for the first ten months of 1976 compared to tle first ten months of 1975. SALES OR PRODUCTION OR BOTH, HAVE DECREASED ABSOLUTELY Sales by Dorm Shirt Company In- creased 25.8 percent in value from 1973 to 1974 and 32.7 percent from 1974 to 1975 before decreasing 36.8 percent for the first ten months of 1976 compared to the first ten months of 1975. Production by Dorn Shirt Company Increased 13.2 percent in quantity from 1973 to 1974 and 24.1 percent from 1974 to 1975 before decreasing 37.2 percent for the first ten months of 1976 compared to the first ten months of 1975. INCREASED IIPORTS Imports of women's misses' and chil- dren's shirts and blouses have increased absolutely every year since 1971 as they rose from 15.6 million dozens in 1971 to 20.5 million dozens in 1974. Imports of women's, misses' and children's shirts and blouses increased from 20.5 million dozens In 1974 to 27.8 million dozens in 1975 or 35.6 percent. For the first nine months of 1976 Imports increased to 24.0 million dozens compared to 19.3 million dozens for the first nine months of 1975. CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY Customers of Dorn Shirt Company in- creased their purchases of Imported women's and Juniors' shirts and blouses, while decreasing their purchases of wom- en's and junior's shirts and blouses from Dorn Shirt Company. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the investigation, I concludb that increases of Imports like or directly competitive with women's and juniors' shirts and blouses manufactured by Dorn Shirt Company, Philadelphia, Pennsyl- vania contributed Importantly to the total or partial separations of the work- ers of the company.

The investigation was initiated on Sep- tember 24, 1976 in response to a worker petition received on September 24, 1976 which was filed on behalf of workers and former workers engaged in the catching and landing of shrimp on the dragger, \"Brant,\" in Walpole, Maine. The Notice of Investigation was pub- lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER on Octo- ber 15, 1976 (41 FR 45639). No public hearing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from officials of the dragger, \"Brant\", its customers, the U.S. Depart- ment of Commerce, the U.S. Interna- tional Trade Commission, industry ana- lysts, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and Issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers in the workers' firm, oran appropriate subdivision thereof, have be- come totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially sep- arated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased ab- solutely; (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division are being imported in Increased quantities, either actual or relative to domes-tic production; and (4) That such increased imports have con-tributed importantly to the separations, orthreat thereof, and to the decrease In sales or production. The term \"contributed Im-portantly\" means a cause which's important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. The investigation has revealed that criterion (4) has not been met.SIGNxIFicAxT TOTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARATIONS The average share earnings per worker on the \"Brant\" declined 10.8 percent from 1974 to 1975 and declined 22.3 per- cent in the first half of 1970 compared to the first half of 1975. The number of workers on the \"Brant\" remained con- stant until June 1976 when the \"Brant\" ceased fishing and all workers were let go. SALES OR PRODUCTI ON, OR BOTi 1AVII DECREASED ABSOLUTELY Sales of shrimp by the \"Brant! de- clined 55.8 percent from 1974 to 1975 and declined 96.6 percent in the first half of 1976 .ompared to the first half of 1975. Sales of other fish increased 5.6 per- cent from 1974 to 1975 and Increased 42.2 percent in the first six months of 1976 compared to the first six months of 1975. Combined sales declined 33,1 per- cent from 1974 to- 1975 and declined 36,7 percent In the first six months of 1976 compared to the first six months of 1975, INCREASED ILMPORTS Imports of shrimp Increased 18.3 per- cent from 1971 to 1972, declined 9.3 per- cent from 1972 to 1973, increased 15,9 percent from 1973 to 1974 and declined 13.6 percent from 1974 to 1975. Imports increased 23.2 percent in the first half of 1976 compared to the first half of 1975. CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY The Department's Investigation re- vealed that customers of the \"Brant\" did not purchase imported shrimp. Declines in sales of shrimp were due to declining catches caused by a reduction in the harvestable stock of shrimp in New Eng- land waters. On April 15, 1976 the North- ern Shrimp Section of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission en- acted a closed season on the taking and landing of shrimp in New England wa- ters making it impossible for the \"Brant\" to catch shrimp after that date. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the Investigation, I concludethat articles like or directly competitive with shrimp caught by the dragger, \"Brant,\" did not contribute mportantly to the total or partial separations of the workers on that boat as required In Sec- tion 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Imports fell from 13.8 percent and 12.3 percent of domestic production and consumption. respectively, in the first six months of 1975, to 12.4 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, in the same period in 1976. Products like those distributed by the Paulsboro facility accounted for 92 per- cent of the 1975 aggregate U.S. produc- tion of all refined oil products (by volume). As a result of a management decision positions at Exxon's New Jersey dIstribu- tion facilities will be eliminated by the installation of a new computer Informa- tion system and telephone system and the implementation of a new delivery system. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts I con- clude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with refined oil products distributed by the Exxon Com- pany, U.S-.A, Paulsboro, New Jersey didnot contribute Importantly to the total or partial separation of the workers of that firm.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK Negative Determination Regarding Eligibil- ity To Apply for Worker Adjustment As- sistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 the Department ofLabor herein presents the results of TA- W-1089: investigation regarding certifi- cation of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance as prescribed inSection 222 of the Act. The investigation was initiated on Sep-tember 23, 1976 in response to a workerpetition received on September 23, 1976 which was filed by the Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union on be-half of cutters and former cutters of the8th Avenue New York, New York plant of .Galaxy Costume Corporation. The notice of investigation was pub-lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER On Octo-ber 5, 1976 (41 FR 43974). No publichearing was requested and none washeld. The information upon which the determination was made was obtainedprincipally from officials of Galaxy Cos- tumhe Corporation, its customers, the U.S.Department of Commerce, the U.S. n-ternational Trade Commission, industry analysts, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment as-sistanee, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor-tion of the workers in the workers' firm oran appropriate subdivision thereof, have be-come. totally or partially separated, or arethreatened to become totally or partially sep-arated; .(2) That sales or production, or both, ofsuch firm or subdivision have decreased ab-solutely; - (3) That articles like or directly competi-tive with those produced by the firm or sub-division are being imported In increasedquantities, either actual or relative to domes-tic production; and (4) That such Increased imports have con-tributed Importantly to the separations, orthreat thereof, and to the decrease in salesor prodLiction. The term \"contributed im-portantly\" means a cause which s importantbut not necessarily more important than anyother cause. Without regard to whether any of theother criteria have been met, criterion (2) has not been met. Galaxy Costume Corporation is amanufacturer of women's' coats and jackets of all lengths In misses' sizes 10- 20; misses' half sizes I6%-24% and jun-ior sizes 5-15. Galaxy purchases and cutsfabric for coats and jackets, arrangeswith outside contractors for the stitching of the coats and jackets, and markets the finished product. Coats and Jackets are made predominately of corduroy, wool, suede, fake fur and melton. The investigation revealed that sales for Galaxy Costume Increased 12.4 per- cent in quantity and 11.8 percent In value from 1974 to 1975 and 2.8 percent In quantity and 4.4 percent in value for the first ten months of 1976 compared to the first ten months of 1975. Furthermore, production In quantity at Galaxy Cos- tume Corporation increased 10,1 percent from 1974 to 1975 and 8.4 percent for the first ten months of 1976 compared to the first ten months of 1975. After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the Investigation, I conclude that sales or production, or both, of Gal- axy Costume Corporation have not de- creased absolutely as required under Sec- tion 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The investigation was initiated on Oc- tober 19, 1976 In response to a worker petition received on October 19, 1976 which was filed on behalf of the workers and former workers producing athletic footwear at the Indian Head Shoe Corn-. pany, Manchester, New Hampshire. The notice of investigation was pub- lished In the Federal Register (41 PR 48810) on November 5, 1976. No public hearing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from officials of Indian Head Shoe Company, its customers, the U.S. International Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce, industry analysts,and Department lmes. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and issue a certification of eli- gibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers In the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision- thereof, have be- come totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially sep- arated; (2) That sales or production, or both, bf such firm or subdivision have decreased ab- -solutely;, (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division are being Imported In increased quantities, either actual or relative to domes- tic production; and (4) That such ncreased Imports have con- tributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease In sales or production. The term \"contributed Im- portantly\" means a cause which is important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. The Department's investigation has revealed that all of the above criteria have been met.Significant Total or Partlal Separa- tions. Plant employment decreased 16 percent in 1975 compared to 1974 and then increased 66 percent In the first nine months of 1976 compared to the first nine months of 1975. Employment declined in every month since April 1976. Nearly all employment was terminated when the plant ceasco production in September 1976, except for a small staff to close out inventory. This staff will remain at the factory until early 1977. Sales or Production, or Both, Have De- creased Absolutely. Company sales In quantity decreased 25 percent In 1975 compared to 1974. Sales increased 77 per- cent during the first 8 months of 1976 compared to the first 8 months of 1975, The increased sales in 1976 resulted from a new marketing strategy involving di- rect selling to small dealers. This strat- egy proved less successful than originally planned and preceded the cessation of production at Indian Head in September 1976. Sales reached a peak in April 1976 and then declined steadily, except for August 1976, the month Just prior to the ceasing of production at the plant. Increased imports. Athletic footwear Imports increased both absolutely and relatively In 1972 compared to 1971; Im- ports In 1973 increased absolutely com- pared to 1972. In 1974, imports again in- creased both absolutely and relatively over 1973. Absolute Imports of athletic footwear Increased 102 percent In 1975 compared to 1974 and increased from 84.3 percent of domestic production in 1974 to 148.0 percent in 1975. First half of 1976 Im- ports were 201.6 percent of domestic pro- duction compared to 137.1 percent for the same period in 1975. Contributed Importantly. The Depart- ment's investigation revealed that cus- tomers surveyed reported decreased pur- chases of athletic footwear from Indian Head and increased purchases of Import- ed footwear. Conclusion. After careful review of the facts obtained In the Investigation, I conclude that increases of Imports of like or directly competitive with athletic footwear produced at the Manchester, New Hampshire plant of Indian Head Shoe Company contributed Importantly to the total or partial separation of the workers of that plant. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification: All workers at the Alanchcater, Now amnp- shire plant of Indian Head Shoo Company who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 1, 1970 are eligible to apply for adjustment assist- ance under Title IT, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The ratios of imports to production and consumption increased from 5.4-per- cent and 5.5 percent, respectively in 1974to 6.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respective- ly in 1975. Imports increased from i31.9 millionsquare yards in the first seven months of 1975 to 165.0 million square yards in thefirst seven months of 1976. The ratios ofImports to production and consumption decreased from 7.3 percent and 7.5 per'- cent, respectively in the first sevenmonths of 1975 to 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively in the first seven months of 1976. CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY Customers of J. Bass, the converters, do not purchase Imported printed anddyed fabrics. The converters reduced business with J. Bass because the cus-tomers of the converters, the manufac-turers, have reduced their orders with the converters. The manufacturers re-port that any imported fabrics used bythem axe not available in the UnitedStates. Furthermore, changes In consum- er fashion preferences caused the manu-facturers to utilize other domestic man-ufacturers as the types of materials re- quired were not available from J. Bass. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob-tained in the investigation, I concludethat increases of imports like or directlycompetitive with printed and dyed fab- rics produced at the West Hazelton, Pennsylvania plant of J. Bass and Com-pany did not contribute Importantly tothe total or partial separations of the workers at that plant. Signed at Washington, D.C. this 23rd day of December 1976. JAs F.

Certification Regarding Eligib ity To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 the Department of Labor herein presents the results of TA- W-1185: investigation regarding certifi- cation of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance as prescribed in Section 222 of the Act. The investigation was initiated on October 19, 1976 in response to a worker petition received on October 19, 1976 which was filed on behalf of workers and former workers producing women's\" blouses and shirts at the Philadelphia plant of Louis Clark, Inc. -FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY', JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES The Notice of Investigation was pub- lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER On Novem- ber 5, 1976 (41 FR 48813). No public hearing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from officials of Louis Clark, Inc;, its customers, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, industry analysts and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and issue a certification of eli- gibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers in the worker's firm, or anappropriate subdivision thereof, have become totally or partially separated, or are threat- ened to become totally or partially separated;\" (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely. (3) That articles like or directly com- petitive with those produced by the firm or subdivision are being imported in increasedquantities, either- actual or relative to domestic production; and (4) That such increased Imports have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease in sales or production. The term \"contributed importantly\" means a cause which Is im-portant but not necessarily more important than any other cause.- The investigation has revealed'that all of the above criteria have bedn met. SIGNIFICANT TOTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARA- TIONS Average employment of production workers declined 7.5, 9.7 and 7.1 percent In the first three quarters of 1976, re- spectively compared to the Immediate preceding quarter. Employment also declined 3.4 percent ajid 16.1\"percent in the second and third quarters of 1976, respectively compared to the same quar- ters in 1975. SALES OR PRODUCTION, OR BOTH, HAVE DECREASED ABSOLUTELY Production at Louis Clark, Inc., de- clined 2.9, 10.1 and 15.4 percent in the first three quarters of 1976 respectively, compared to the immediate preceding quarter and declined 10.6 percent In thethird quarter of 1976 compared to the same quarter in 1975. INCREASED IMPORTS Imports of women's, misses' and chil- dren's blouses and shirts increased from 20.549 -million dozens in 1974 to 27.840 million dozens in 1975; and from 19.251 million dozens in the first nine months of 1975 to 24.016 million dozens in the same period of 1976. CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY Louis Clark, Incorporated produces women's blouses and shirts under con-tract from another firm. A representa- tive sample of customers of that firm indicated that several of these customers increased their imports of women's blouses and shirts, while decreasing their purchases from the contracting firm.CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the Investigation, I conclude' that increases of imports like or directly' competitive with women's blouses and shirts produced at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania plant of Louis Clark, In- corporated, contributed importantly to the total or partial separations of the workers engaged in the production of suCh blouses and shirts at the plant. In accordance with -the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification: All workers engaged in employment re- lated to the production of women's blouses and shirts at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania plant of Louis Clark, Incorporated, who be- came totally or partially separated from employment on or after January 1, 1976 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance -under Title Ir, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 the Department of Labor herein presents the results of TA- W-1198: investigation regarding certifi- cation of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance as prescribed in Section 222 of the Act. The investigation was initiated on October 20, 1976 in response to a worker petition received on that date which was filed on behalf of workers and former workers of the Edison, New Jersey ware- house of RCA Corporation. The investi- gation was expanded to include the Har- rison, New Jersey plant of RCA, for which the Edison warehouse serves as a support facility. The Notice of Investigation was pub-. lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER on No- vember 5, 1976 (41 FR 48816). No publichearing was requested and none was held. The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from officials of RCA Cor- poration, the U.S. Department of Com- merce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, industry analysts, and De- partment files. In order to make an affirmative de- termination and issue a ceitification of eligibility to apply for adjustment as- sistance, each of the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a slgnificant number or propor-tion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof, have be- come totally or partially separated, or arethreatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased abso- lutely; (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub- division are being imported in increased quantities, either actual or relative to do- mestic production; and (4) That such increased imports have con- tributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease in sales or production. The term \"contributed im- portantly\" means a cause which is Important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. The investigation has revealed that all four of the above criteria have been met. SIGNIFICANT TOTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARATIONS All employment of production workers at the Harrison plant was terminated in April 1975 when the plant closed. RCA has indicated that the remaining admin-istrative personnel will be separated when the administrative functions are complete and inventories are depleted from the Edison warehouse. All workers currently employed at the Harrison plant and Edison warehouse were engaged In employment related to tube and mountproduction during the Harrison plant's period of operation. SALES OR PRODUCTION, OR BOTH, HAVE DECREASED ABSOLUTELY All production at the Harrison plant was terminated In April 1975 when the plant closed. I INCREASED IMIPORTS Imported electronic receiving tubes have increased their share of the declin- ing domestic market for such products in each year from 1972 to 1975. Imports increased relative to domestic produc- tion from 27.4 percent in 1971 to 57.6 percent in 1975. CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY Increased imports of electronic receiv- ing tubes resulted in the closure of the Harrison plant and separation of pro- duction workers from that plant in mid- 1975. Since that time RCA has continued to employ certain workers in adminis- trative functions at Harrison and inven- tory depletion at the Edison warehouse. RCA officials have Indicated that the re- maining workers at the Harrisori plant and Edison warehouse will be separated when the close-out operations are com- pleted. The separation of such workers will, thus, be due to increased imports of electronic receiving tubes, relative to do- mestic production, and the resultant closure of the Harrison plant in 1975. A certification of eligibility to apply for ad- justment assistance, issued under provi- sions of the Trade Expansion Act of 1902, expires on December 24, 1976--two years from Its date of issuance. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob-tained in the investigation, I conclude that increases of Imports like or directly competitive with electronic receiving tubes and mounts produced by the Har- rison, New Jersey plant and Edison, New Jersey warehouse of RCA Corporation contributed importantly to the threat- ened separation of workers of those fa- cilities. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the fol- lowing certification: All workers of the Harrison, Now Jersey plant and Edison, New Jersey warehouse of RCA Corporation who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 24, 1076 are certified eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Title II, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

No public hearing was requested and none was held. - The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained principally from information provided by officials of the ReynoldsMetals Com- pany..In order to make an afirmative deter- mination and Issue a certification of eli- g bility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of the group eligibility re- quirementts of Section 222 of the TradeActof 1974 must be met-: (1) That-a significant number or propor- tionu of the -workers in the workers' firm, oran appropriate subdivision thereof, have become tqtally or partally~separated, or are- threatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) That sales or production, or both, ofthe firm or subdivision have decreased ab- solutely; (3) That articles like or directly competi-tive -with those produced by the firm orsubdivision are being Imported in Increased quantities, either actual or relative to do- mestic production; and (4) That such increased imports have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease Insales or production. The term \"contributed importantly\" means a cause which is Im- portant but not necessarily more important than any other cause. If any one of the above criteria is not -satisfied, a negative determination must be made. The Department of Labor has already determined, that the performance of services is not included within the term \"articles\" as used in Section 222(3) ofthe Act. See Notice of Negative Deter- mination in Pan American World Air- ways, Incorporated (TA-W-153; 40 FR 54639). The San Patricio Reduction Plant, Corpus Christi, Texas, is one of seven domestic smelting plants in the Primary Metals Division of the Reynolds Metals Company. Due to a drop in demand for aluminum products and an increase In corporate inventories, the Reynolds Met-als Company decided to curtail corpo-rate production of primary aluminum in early 1975. As a result of this decision, all =melt-Ing operations at San Patrlcio ceased In March 1975, and all shipments of pri-mary aluminum from- San Patriclo stopped in April 1975. Employment at the San Patriclo plant since April 1975 has been related to the construction and installation of new pol- lution control equipment at the plant. The San Patrclo Plant has not been re- activated primarily because of the high cost of the natural gas used at San Patrlclo compared-to energy costs at other Reynolds Metals' smelting plants.After careful review of the Issues, I have determined that since September 1, 1975, the earliest possible Impact date under this petition, the San Patriclo Re- duction Plant, Corpus Christi, Texas, hasnot produced an \"article\" within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Trade Act of 1974.

The investigation was initiated onOctober 7, 1976 in response to a workerpetition received on that date which wasfiled on behalf of workers and formerworkers producing fishing rods and reelsat True Temper Corporation, TackloDivision. Anderson, South Carolina.The notice of investigation was pub- lished in the FEDERAL REGISTER on Octo-ber 29, 1976 (41 PR 47632). No publichearing was requested and none washeld. The information upon which the de-termination was made was obtainedprincipally from officials of True TemperCorporation, Its customers, the U.S. De-partment of Commerce, the U.S. Inter-national Trade Commission, industry analysts and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter-mination and issue a certification ofeligibility ,to apply for adjustment as-sistance, each of the group eligibility re-quirements of Section 222 of the TradeAct of 1974 must be met:(1) That a significant nu!mbor or propor-tion of the workers In that workera firm, oran appropriate subdivision thereof, have ba-come totally or partially separated, or arethreatened to become totally or partiallyseparated: (2) That sales or production, or both, ofthe firm or subdivision have decreased abso-lutely, (3) That articles like or directly competi-,tive with those produced by the firm or sub-division are being Imported in increasedquantities, either actual or relative to doAmestio production: and(4) That such Increased Imports have con-tributed Importantly to the separation, orthreat thereof, and to the decrease in salesor production. The term \"contributed Impor-tantly\" means a cause which is Importantbut not necessarily more Important than anyother cause. The investigation has revealed that allfour of the above criteria have been met. SIGNIFICANT TOTAL OR PARTIAL SEPARATIONS Employment of production workers atthe Anderson plant of True Temper Cor-poration declined 30.7 Percent in 1975from 1974 and declined 38.9 percent inthe first six months of 1976,compared tothe like period of 1975.

Sales in value at the Anderson plant decreased 27.4 percent in fiscal year ,1975 from fiscal year 1974, and decreased 41.9 percent in the first six months of fiscal year 1976 compared to the like pe- riod of fiscal year 1975. Production in quantity at the Ander- son plant decreased 39.4 percent in cal- endar 1975 from 1974, and decreased 37.2 percent. in the first six months of 1976 compared to the like period of 1975. Production of fishing reels ceased in June 1976, and production of fishing rods ceased in July 1976.. INCREASED \"I IPORTS Imports are recorded on a August- July fiscal year basis. Imports of fishing rods and reels increased absolutely in fiscal 1973 compared to fiscal 1972 and' in fiscal 1974 compared to fiscal 1973. Imports declined in fiscal 1975, then increased in fiscal 1976. Imports of fishing rods increased from 2.3 million units in the first nine months of calendar 1975 to 3.7 million units inthe first nine months of calendar 1976. Imports of reels increased from 3.7 mil- lion units in the first nine months of calendar, 1975 to 6.1 million units in calendar 1976. CONTRIUTED IMPORTANTLY Customers of True Temper indicated that they purchased imported fishing tackle. The imports were reported to be cheaper than the domestic product and of comparable quality. The customers in- dicated that this lightweight tackle is sold more chdaply b'y importers than by .domestic manufacturers. C!NCLUsION After careful review of the facts ob- tained. in the investigation, I conclude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with fishing rods and reels manufactured by True Temper Corpo- ration, Tackle Division, Anderson, South Carolina, contributed importantly to the total or partial separations of the work- ers of that company. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following certification: All workers engaged in employment relatedto the production of fishing rods and reels atthe Tackle Division of True Temper Corpo- ration, Anderson, South Carolina who became totally or partially separated from employ-ment on or after September 26, 1975 andbefore August 1,- 1976 are certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance underTitle I, Chapter 2 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The investigation was initiatcd on No- vember 8, 1976 In response to a worker petition received on November 8, 1976 which was filed by workers and former workers producing custom injection molders at the Bedford Heights plant of VCA Nymold, Incorporated. The Inves- tigation revealed that the Bedford Heights plant produces Injection molded thermoplastic parts. The Notice of Investigation was pub- lished in the FEDuArL R rs=z on No- vember 23, 1976 (41 FR 51634). No pub- lic hearing was requested and none w.as held. The information upon which the de- thrmlnation was made was obtained principally from officials of VCA Nymold, Incorporated, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative de- termination and Issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment as- sistance, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or propor- tion of the workers In such workers' firm oran appropriate subdivision of the Iirm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) That sales or production, or both, ofsuch firm or subdivision have decre ed ab- solutely;(3) That articles like or dirctly competl- tive with those produced by the firm or sub. division are being Imported in increased quantities, either actual or relative to do- mestic production; and(4) That such Increased Importa have con- tributed importantly to the separations, orthreat thereof, and to the decreace In zales or production. Tho term \"contributed impor- tantly\" means a cause which Is importantbut not necessarily more important than any other cause. Without regard to whether any-of the other criteria have been met,-criterlon (1) has not been met. The evidence de- veloped in the Department's investiga- tion reveals that in each quarter from the third quarter of 1975 through the third quarter of 1976, average hourly employment increased compared to the immediately preceding quarter. Since April 1975 there have been no involun- tary separations of production employ- ees. The average weekly hours worked since April 1975 have not been reduced. CONCLUSION After careful review of the facts ob- tained in the Investigation, I concludethat employees at the Bedford Heig-hts Ohio plant of VCA Nymold, Incorpo- rated have not become or threatened to become totally or partially separated as required In Section 222(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.

The notice of investigation was pub- lished in the FxEanAr Rcr on Octo- ber 29, 1976 (41 FR 47633). No public hearing *as requested and none was held. 'The information upon which the de- termination was made was obtained from olilcials of the Vesuvius Crucible Com- pany, Its customers, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, industry analysts, and Department files. In order to make an affirmative deter- mination and Issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assist- ance, each of :the group eligibility re- quirements of Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 must be met: (1) That a significant number or ProPa- tion of the warkers in the workers firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof, have be- come totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially ceparated; (2) That ale-s or production, or both, of such firm or subdivisilon have decreased ab- colutely (3) That articles like or directly competi- tive with those produced by the firm or sub-divtion are being Imported in Increased quantities either actual or relative to do- mestic production; and (4) That such Increased Imports have con- tributed Importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the decrease In sales or production. The te \"contributed Im-portantly\" means a cause which is important but not necessarily mre Impotant than anyother cause, FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES The investigation has revealed that al- though the first and second criteria have been met, the third and fourth criteria have not been met. Significant Total or Partial Separa- tions. The average number of hourly workers declined 31 percent in 1975 com- pared to 1974. The average number of hourly workers declined 23 percent in the first three quarters of 1976 compared to the like period in 1975. Sales or Production, or Both, Have De- creased Absolutely. Total sales of all products produced at the Swissvale plant declined 54 percent in 1975 compared to 1974 and declined 29 percent in the first three quarters of 1976 compared to the like period in 1975. Increased Imports. The products man- ufactured at the Swissvale plant are in- eluded in the import category of carbon and graphite refractories. Imports of cdrbon and graphite refractories in- creased in each year from 23.7 tons in 1971 to 92.4 tons in 1974. In 1975 imports declined to 86.4 tons. In the first six months of 1976 imports declined to 25.5 tons compared to 47.5 tons in the first six months of 1975. The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 0.2 percent in 1971 to 0.3 percent in 1972 and 1973. In 1974 the ratio of imports to )domestic production increased to 0.4 per- cent and in 1975 to 0.5 percent. In the first six months of 1976 the ratio of im- ports to domestic production declined to 0.3 percent comliared to a ratio of 0.4 percent in the first-six months of 1975. Contributed Importantly. Customers of Vesuvius Crucible Company indicatedthat they do not purchase imported prod- ucts of the type manufactured by Vesu- vius Crucible Company. Customers of stopper heads indicated that they re- duced purchases from Vesuvius in 1975 because of a decline in the demand for steel products. With steel production down, the manufacturers did not need to add capacity or replace existing stopper heads as frequently. In addition, the management of Vesuvius'Crucible shifted some stopper head production to a newer plant located within the United States. Conclusion. After careful review of the facts obtained in the investigation, I con- clude that increases of imports like or directly competitive with stopper heads, crucibles, and other graphite refractories produced atthe Swissvale, Pennsylvania plant of the Vesuvius Crucible Company did not contribute importantly to the total or partial separations of the work- ers at such plant.

Article LI-Definitions: 23. Covered-The term \"covered\" in respect of a short position in a][n call option contract means that the writer's obligation is secured by a \"specifl de- posit\" or \"escrow deposit\" or 610(h) respectively of [as defined in] the Rules of the Options Clearing Corpuration, orthe writer holds [an equivalent lon. position in the underlying stock in an account with the member organization through which the option contract was written.] in the same account as theshort position, on a share-for-sharebasis, a long position either in the under- lying security or in an option contract of the same class of options where theexercise price of the option contract insuch long position is equal to or lessthan the exercise price of the option contract in such short position. Theterm \"covered\". in respect of a shortposition in a put option contract meansthat the writer holds in the same ac-count as the short position, on a share-for-share basis, a long position in an option contract- of the same class of options where the exercise price of theoption contract in such long position is equal to or greater than the exerciseprice of the option contract in such short position. EXCHANGE'S STATEIENT OF BASIS'AuN PURPOSE The basis and purpose of the fore- going proposed rule change is as follows: The general purpose of the -proposedrule changes are to provide the self-regulatory framework for the trading of put options on the Midwest Stock Ex- change. In addition, in a few instances, certain clarifying amendments are pro-posed with respect to existing rules ap- plicable to call options. The purpose of the proposed rule changes are as follows:Article XL, Rule 1. Position Limits. No change to this rule is needed in orderto provide for put options the same posi-tion limits presently applicable to call options. The change which is proposed Is designed to reflect the clarification ofthe* definition of \"covered\" referred to -above. Article X, Rule 7. Restrictions of Out-of-the-Money Options. Rule 7 is proposed to be amended to provide limi- tations on the trading of out-of-the- money call options. In addition, the ruleIs proposed to be amended to reflect the proposed clarifications of the definition of \"covered\" discussed above. The dele- tion of Interpretation .01 and the amendment of Interpretation .03 reflect the proposed changes in the rule itself. Article XLI, Rule 1. Trading Rota- tions. Interpretation .01 Is proposed tobe amended by providing in respect of both opening rotations and closing rota- tions that when series of put and call options contracts covering the same underlying securities are traded, the Order Book Official shall determine the order in which -such series of options should be opened or closed in light of current market conditions. Article XLIV, Rule 6. Priority of Bids and Offers. The proposed amendment to Interpretation .02 provides for straddleorders (as defined in proposed Rule 13 (g) of Article XLIV below) the same priority as presently is provided for spread orders. This interpretation means that where a straddle order may be executed on the basis of bids or of- fers in the trading crowd, but may nbt be executed within the bids or offers dis- played in the Order Book Official's book, the order may be filled in the trading crowd notwithstanding that one side, but not both sides, of the order touchesa bid or an offer in the Order Book Of- ficial's book. Thus, if a Floor Broker hasan order to- buy an XYZ July 50 call at- 5% and an XYZ July 50 put at 4%, the order may be filled on the basis of a total offer in the crowd of 10 for the straddle, reflecting an offer of .5 ' for the call and 4% for the put. Article XLV, Rule 11. Reporting Du- ties. Interpretation .01 is proposed to be amended to provide that the card or ticket on which a transaction on the floor is reported shall include, in addi- tion to the information presently setforth, the \"type\" of option contract that is the subject of the transaction (i.e., whether it is a putor call). Article XLIV, Rule 13. Certain Types of Orders Defined. It Is proposed to add to Rule 13 the definition of \"straddle order\". This definition is relevant only for the purpose of Rule 6 of Article XLIV, and it conforms to existing inter- pretations of the Internal Revenue Serv- ice which provide special tax treatment for orders to buy or to sell the same number of options of each type (put or call) with respect to the same underly- ing security and having the same exercise price and expiration date. In addition, the definition of \"spread order\" is pro- posed to be amended to mean an order to buy a stated number of option con- tracts and sell the same number of option contracts of the same class (i.e., a spread order may pertain to puts or to calls, but not to both puts and calls, with respect to the same underlying security). Article XLIV, Rule 4. Responsibilities of Floor Brokers. The proposed amend- ment to paragraph (c) of Rule 4 of Ar- ticle XLIV would replace the word \"spread\" with the word \"combination\",. This change reflects the fact that with the advent of put trading there will bemultiple option orders in addition to spread orders (e.g., straddle orders) for which a Floor Broker may not be held responsible during a rotation, when op- tions are traded one series at a time. Article XLVII, Rule 7. Restriction on Acting as Market-Maker and Floor, Broker. The proposed change to delete the phrase \"same class\" in Rule 7 of Article XLVII and to substitute the phrase \"covering the same underlying security\" reflects that the restriction of -this Rule.applies to both puts and calla, which are separate \"classes\" of options. Article XLVII, Rule S. Financial Ar- rangement of Market-Makers. The pro- posed amefidments to Rule 8 reflect that Market-Makers appointed to to both puts and calls in the same underlying security are appointed to separate classes of options. Accordingly, the amendment would requir6 Market-Makers to report all of their financial arrangements as Market-Makers. Article L, Rule 3. The proposed amend- ment to Rule 3 of Article L reflects that as between a call option and a put op- tion, the respective roles of the holder hand writer are reversed with respect to delivery and payment following exercise. Article LI, (23). The principal pur- pose of this amendment Is to define the term \"covered\" with respect to a short position in a put option to mean the situation where the writer of a put option holds on a share-for-share basis in the same account as the short put position a long position in a put option of the same class having an exercise price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the short position. In addition, In the in- terest of clarity, 1It Is proposed to add to the definition of a covered short position in a call option the situation where the obligation of the writer of the call is covered on a share-for-share basis with a long position in a call option contract of the same class having an exercise price equal to or less than the exercise price of the short call position. The latter pro- posed amendment Is consistent with the present provisions of Article XL, Rules 1 and 7, and appropriate changes are proposed in those rules so that there will be no change in their application. The Midwest Stock Exchinge believes it is consistent with the protection of In- vestors and the public interest to provide a central, regulated marked for the trad- ing of put options comparable to the markets presently provided for the trad- ing of call options. The Exchange mark- ets in call options have provided inves- tors with new investment opportunities and greater flexibility in managing in- vestments in common stocks. The basic economic function of a put option, as with a call option, is to permit the sepa- ration of the risks and opportunities of investing In securities, and their redis- tribution between the holder and the writer of the option. There are many economic functions of put options, along or In combination with calls or underlying securities, which will benefit investors. For example, the addition of put option trading will per- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 NOTICES mit increased possibilities for the hedg- ing of positions in common stocks by in- vestors. The only manner in which listed options may be used to hedge long stock positions at the present time is by writ- ing call options against such positions. This strategy serves the need of investors who are willing to sell stock at the exer- cise price but it only protects against a downside movement in the stock price which is no greater than 'the amount of the premium and further requires the in- vestor to forego the opportunity for gain if the stock price should move above the exercise price by more than the amount of the premium. On the other hand, for the cost of the option, a put provides complete protection against loss no mat- ter how far the price of the stock may decline below the exercise price and the investor does not give up the opportunity to participate in increase in the stock price. In addition, the commencement of put trading on the Midwest Stock Exchange will give investors the opportunity to purchase puts as a risk limiting alterna- tive to a short sale of common stock. Put options will also permit leveraged participation in stock price declines by purchasing puts covering a greater num- ber of shares than might have been sold short directly by the investor. In addi- tion, as with call options, puts may be written on a covered or uncovered basis to generate income for the writer. Put options may also be used by in- vestors who would not be adverse to ac- quiring a particular stock at a price less than the current market price. By writ- ing a put option, such investors will be in a position to accomplish their objective and purchase the stock at a pre-deter- mined price, if the stock declines in price. Should the stock not decline, the writer will still benefit by the amount of pre- mium income generated in the writing transaction. W flfe the uses of put options discussed above may be theoretically available in the over-the-counter options market, it is the secondary market that enables the risk limiting uses of options to achieve their full potential, since only in an Exchange market may the investor establish and liquidate options posi- tions in coordination with the establish- ment and liquidation of stock positions. With respect to safeguards, the Mid- west Stock Exchangebelieves that the risks-of put trading, both from an eco- nomic point of view and from the point of view market regulation, are no dif- ferent in kind of degree from the risks of call trading and are susceptible to thq same types of controls. The Midwest Stock Exchange sees no reasons why put options will require a different kind of safeguards. Accordingly, the Midwest Stock Exchange proposed to apply the safeguards presently applicable to calls to puts as well. The Midwest Stock Exchange's posi- tion and exercise limit rules will apply to put options, just as they presently ap-ply to call options. The Midwest Stock Exchange's suitability rule will be ap- plied to recommended transactions in put options, and special suitability stand- ards will apply to all recommended writ- ing transactions in puts in the same manner that they apply to recommenda- tions for the writing of uncovered call options. The Midwest Stock Exchange's prospectus delivery requirement will ap- ply equally to put and call options and The Options Clearing Covporation has prepared a single prospectus for both types of options. Comments were not formally solicited from members or member organizations, however, many of them have expressed their views, and all comments received were in strong support of the introduc- tion of put trading. The Midwest Stock Exchange believes the proposed rule changes will Impose no burden on competition. The Exchange has consented to a 90 day extension of the time periods spec- ified in section 19 (b) (2) of the Act and therefore, on or before May 9, 1977, or within such longer period (W as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer pe- riod to be appropriate and publishes Its reasons for so finding or (i) as to which the above-mentioned self-regulatory or- ganization consents, the Commisson will: On or before February 8,1977, or with- in such longer period (I) as the Commis- sion may designate up to 90 days of such date if It finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons 'for so finding or (it) as to which the above-mentioned self-regulatory orga- nization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such propozed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change &hould be disapproved.

Th pending exemption was requested in ai anplication filed by Ragnar Benson, Inc (Ragnar Benson) and the Trustee ani Plan Committee (collectivelv referre to as \"Applicants\") under the Ragna Benson Profit Sharing Plan and Trus (the Trust) for a proposed Trust in vestment in a long-term mortgage loa to a party in interest and disqualiflei person and for related transactions. The application was filed pursuant t section 408(a) of the Act and sectioi 4975(c) (2) of the Code and in accord ance with the procedures set forth i, ERISA Procedure 175-1 (40 FR 18471 Proc. 1975-1 C.B. 722.. Summary of Representations. The ap plicatlon contains representations wit regard to the pending exemption w hice are summarized below. Interested per sons are referred to the application an supporting documents on file with th Department and the Service for a com plete statement of the representations c the Applicants. 1. Ragnar Benson, a corporation en gaged in general contracting and build ing, purchased a 50 percent stock in terest in Woodiane Corporation (Wood lane), a real estate holding compan,. in October 1967. The only other sharc holder in Woodlane is Elmhurst-Chicag Stone Company (Elmhurst-Chicago which is otherwise unrelated to the pax ties to the proposed mortgage transac tion. 2. In April 1967 Woodlane and Wesl ern Electric Company, Incorporate (Western Electric) executed a lea. agreement which provided for the cor struction and.leasing to Western Ele( tric of a new facility to be known Bell System Center for Technical Edt cation (the Training Center) -on Wooc lane's 22 acre parcel of land located i DuPage County, Illinois. The Trainir Center has developed into a dormitoi and school complex in which diven groups of employees of Bell Svste across the country receive technical ar managerial training. 3. Ragnar Benson constructed tl Training Center pursuant to a contra with Woodiane which predated its puchase of Woodlane stock. Additionally, Western Electric's right under the 1967 lease agreement to construct additional buildings and improvements on the par- cel was subject to the express condition that it make a bona fide effort to nego- tiate a contract with Ragnar Benson for such constructions on the basis of pre- liminary drawings and cost estimates to n be prepared by Ragnar Benson. 4. Central National Bank and Conti- nental Assurance Company (Conti- y nental) each provided Woodlane with a $1,5 million in financing for the initial a construction of the Training Center. -Such loans were secured by a mortgage n on the 22 acre parcel of land and by the -rental payments under the lease with J Western Electric which were geared to 5 repay the loans over the 15-year primary e term. of the lease. f 5. In 1969 and 1972, additions to the e Training Center were constructed by a Ragnar Benson. The first addition was financed by a $2 million loan from Con- t tinental and the second was financed by d a $600,000 loan from Continental and a r $600,000 loan from the Trust. Both loans t for the second addition are secured by a -trust deed on the original 22 acre parcel a and on an additional 20 acres adjacent d thereto, which Woodlane purchased in 1971. Continental, Central National Bank o and the Trust each agreed to a first lien a interest in the combined 42 acre parcel -in proportion to its share of the total a indebtedness., In connection with the construction of these additions, therental payments to Woodlane by West- ern Electric were increased to a level sufficient to insure repayment of all loans h over the term of the leasb. Final pay- , ment on the loan from the Trust is scheduled to be made in May 1983. The d remaining principal on the original e amount of $600,000 was approximately-$450,000 as of November 9, 1976. ;f 6. On August 4, 1975, Woodlane and Western Electric entered into a modifi- cation of te lease agreement. The amended agreement provided for the construction of a'10-story highrise addi- tion to the Training Center at a cost of $6.3 million (the \"third addition\"). In -accordance with the terms of the original lease, Ragnar Benson has constructedthe third addition. 7. Raymond Benson (Benson), theTrustee under the Trust, after consult- ing with the plan committee and after meeting with, and receiving consents from, all of the participants in the Trust,.e has determined that one million dollars e n Trust assets which are currently held -in short term certificates of deposit should be invested in a new loan to as Woodlane to provide permanent financ- -ing for the third addition (the \"new loan\").In 8. The Trust contained total assets of 1g S6.5 million as of December 31, 1975. ,7 Thus, the amount of the new loan, to- se gether with the remaining principal of m the Trust's loan for the second addition, id will represent less.than 25 percent of the Trust's total assets. ct 9. In addition to being Trustee, Ben- r- son is also the President of Ragnar Ben-son, an officer of Woodlane, a share- holder of Ranger Benson by attribution from his family's holdings and a member of the Plan Committee. Under the Raig- nar Benson Profit Sharing Plan, which was established for salaried employees In 1956, Ragnar Benson appoints both the Trustee and the five members of the Plan Committee. The Plan Committee directs the Trustee in the placing of in- vestments and supervises the adminis- tration of funds held by the Trustee, All of the current members of the Plan Com- mittee are salaried employees of Ragnar Benson and participants in the Trust. 10. Woodlane will obtain any balance of the $6.3 million in permanent financ- ing required for the third addition from banks and/or other institutional lenders in the Chicago metropolitan area on terms which are no more favorable to any of such lenders than are available to the Trust. In this regard, 13 banks in the Chicago area have committed a total of $5.45 million, in individual amounts ranging from $150,000 to one million dollars, for, permanent financing. Two of these banKs have an existing banking relationship with Ragnar Benson, and a third bank provides escrow account serv- ices to Woodlane, but at least one of the lending institutions which has com- mitted one million dollars for financing noted herein does not have an existing banking relationship with Ragnar Ben- son or its principals. In addition, an in- suraice company has furnished a verbal commitment for $4 million in permanent financing at an interest rate of 9% per- cent. 11. All of the proposed loans for tho third addition (with the exception of a verbal commitment from an insurance company) will bear a 9/2 percent inter- est rate and will be repaid over 15 years, This repayment period coincides with the term of the amended lease, which expires in 1991. Under the amended lease, Western Electric will pay an an- nual rental of $1,440,000 for use of the Training Center, the addition thereto 'and the 42 acre parcel surrounding the facilities. This rental will be sufficient to repay all of the loans over the term of the lease. However, because the stag- gered repayment dates of the various loans to Woodlane would otherwise necessitate a partial interest-only re- payment schedule on some of the now loans, Ragnar Benson and Elmhurst- Chicago have committed themselves to make additional capital contributions to Woodlane to cover the negative cash flow which will be experienced by Wood- lane during the first seven ,ears of the proposed loans. With this capital con- tribution, which will total approximately $140.00 over the seven year period, all of the new loans will be repaid on a straight-line principal plus interest basis. 12. The proposed loans by the Trust and the unrelated financial institutions will be secured by a first mortgage on the new addition and the one acre por- tion of the 42 acre tract on which the addition is located. This portion of the property is connected to Illinois Route FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 2-TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1977 53 by an access easement. Each of the lenders involved in the proposed trans- action will have a first lien interest with respect to such security in proportion to its share &f the total indebtedness. All of the prior mortgagees, including the Trust, will release their existing prior rights to the one acre underlying the third addition.- 13. The debt will also be secured by an assignment of the lease 'docdment be- tween Western Electric and Woodiane and all rents thereunder, for the benefit of the mortgagees. Under this arrange-ment, Western Electric will make allrental payments directly to one of thelending banks as the \"lead\" bank re- sponsible for colledting principal and interest payments for distribution among the various mortgagees. 14. Additionally, Ragnar Benson has guaranteed and Benson has personally guaranteed the repayment of all sums that will be owing to the Trust as a re-sult of the proposed loan. These guaran- tees also extend to the prior loan by the Trust so that the Trust will be in no worse position by. virtue of its proposedagreement to subordinate its first lienposition-with respect to the one acre upon which the addition is being con- structed. As of February 11, 1976, Rag-nar Benson had a net worth of approxi-mately $6.5 million, and as of July 28, 1976, Benson had a net worth In excess of $1 million. 15. The lease with Western Electricis noncancellable and gives Woodlane, or the mortgagees by intervention, a con-tractual right'as against a prime rated tenant. Pursuant to the lease assign-ment agreement, the mortgagees will be empowered to intervene to assert any of Woodane's rights if it fails to do so.16. The lease is a \"net-net\" lease whereby Western Electric is responsiblefor maintenance, real estate and per- sonal property taxes, utility expenses and insurance expenses. 17. The prior mortgagees have ap- proved the amended lease and the Trust and all other mortgagees must approveall further amendments to the lease. In- surance will be obtained by Woodianeguaranteeing Payment of one year'srent in the event that Western Electric should default on its obligations under the lease. 18. The mortgage (or trust deed) and the promissory note to be executed infavor of the Trust will be insured bymortgage title insurance guaranteeing that the mortgage is a valid lien againstthe property. 19. The value of the mortgaged prop- erty will provide adecuate security forthe repayment, of the loans should it be necessary at any time to foreclose. Addi- tionally, the applicants state that evenin the event of distress conditions, there Would be no difficulty in disposing ofthe property which will secure Wood-lane's indebtedness to the Trust and the other lenders.NOTICES 20. The applicants have requested an exemption to permit: (a) Ragnar Ben- son to construct the third addition to the Training Center, notwithstanding the Trust's participation in any financing ar- rangements for the addition; (b) The Trust to provide one milon dollars to Woodlane for permanent mortgage fi- nancing of the third addition; c) The Trust to release Its existing security rights in the one acre of property under- lying the third addition so that the pro- posed loans may be secured by a distinct portion of the property (d) Ragnar Ben- son and Benson to guarantee the prin- cipal and interest payments which Wood- lane will be obligated to pay the Trust under the proposed loan and which Woodlane is currently obligated to repay the Trust under its 1972 loan transac- tion. 21.

The attention of interested persons is directed to the fol- lowing: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption granted under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c) (2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party In interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan to which the exemption Is applicable from certain other provisions of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited trans- action provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which, among other things, require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a) (1) (B) of the Act;nor does It affect the requirement of sec- tion 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for exclusive benefit of the em- ployees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c) (2) of the Code, theDepartment and the Service must find that the exemption is administratively957- feasible, in the Interest of the Plan and of Its participants and beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of the partici- pants and beneficiaries of the Plan; and (3) The pending exemption, if granted, Js supplementalto, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including statutory exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction Is the subject of an exemption is not dispositive of wheth- er the transaction would have been a prohibited transaction in the absence of such exemption or, though it would have been a prohibited transaction, is exempt by operation of a statutory exemption or a transitional rule.

The Department, after considering all comments received, is now issuing those amendments for final effect. They re- quire that additional information to be provided on the data plate, and that the manufacturer's certification of compli- ance be affixed to each transportable sec- tion of each mobile home in the form of a label. Specific subsections of the final rule also have been modified slightly. The following is a discussion of the changes made to the miscellaneous amendments as published for comment in the FEDERAL REGISTER on May 11, 1976. -A change to \u00a7 280.8(c), which sets out the language of the certification label, reflects considerationby the Department of comments made by mobile home man- ufacturers in response to the language required on the label by 24 CPR 3282.362 of the Procedural and Enforcement Regulations when it became effective on May 13, 1976. The language of the cer- tification label is changed so that the phrase \"to the bestof the manufacturer's knowledge and belief\" modifies the certi- fication that the home has been in- spected as well as the certification that the home conforms to the standards. The revised language will appear on all labels provided by IPIA's after existing label inventories held by IPIA's as of December 31, 1976, are exhausted, ex- cept that all labels applied on or after June 30, 1977, shall contain the revised language. This change in the language of the label does not change the sub- stantive impact of the label. Enforce- ment Interpretative Bulletin H-1-76 published on June 21, 1976, at 41 FR 24973 stands as the Department's inter- pretation of the label language. Section 280.7, as proposed in the FED- ERAL REGISTER on May 11, 1976, is renum- bered as \u00a7 280.8 because the Department issued a \u00a7 280.7 after this section was proposed. Cross references are corrected, as appropriate. Section 280.203 has been 'retitled \"Flame Spread Limitations and Fire Pro- tective Requirements\". Paragraph (2) of this section also has been amended by changing its title from \"Combustibility\" to \"Fire Protection Requirements\".

However, the interior surfaces of walls and ceilings encasing furnace and water -heater enclosures shall be protected by -u\" gypsum board or material having equivalent fire protective properties. Use of the term, \"protected by\", is intended to permit any finish material application to be applied to a gypsum board sub- strate or material having equivalent fire protective properties, as long as the sur- face flame spread of the finish material complies with the requirements of \u00a7280.203(a)(3) or \u00a7280.203(a)(5), as appropriate. Section 280.611(d) (III) is amended to clarify that the vent protection required is for the toilet drain, and not the main drain, when anti-siphon trap vents are used to vent secondary fixtures. Other minor editorial revisions also have been incorporated into the amend-. ments. Because there is need for early clari- fications and interpretations as provided by these amendments, the Secretary finds, as required by section 604 (c) and (e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5403 (c) and (e), that it is in the public interest that these amendments take effect January 4, 1977. The Department has determined that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required -with respect to these amendments. A copy of the Finding of Inapplicability is available for inspection and copying according to Department rules and regulations during regular business hours at -the Mobile Home Standards Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. It is hereby certified that the economic and inflationary impacts of the proposed rule have been carefully evaluated in ac- cordance with OMB Circular A-107. These amendments are being signed by two Assistant Secretaries because the standards were originally codified in the FEDERAL REGISTER Chapter assigned 'to the Assistant Secretary for Housing Pro- duction and Mortgage Credit, but the substantive authority for the program has been transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Consumer Affairs and Reg- ulatory Functions. .Accordingly, several sections of 24 OFE Part 280 are amended or promul- gated as follows: 1.

INTERPRETATIVE BULLETIN D-1-76 (\u00a7 280.303(f) AND 280.304) Interpretative Bulletin D-1-76 has been revised by deleting the paragraph covering the assignment of design stresses to non-graded lumber. The De-partment, In analyzing the comments received, determined that there were too many variables to permit individuals not qualified with lumber grading skills to assign lumber grades which also reflected the allowable working stress values to be used in design. This means that man- ufacturers may not assign grades to non- graded lumber and then use the recog- nized stress values of the grades in mak- ing calculations to determine whether the lumber is acceptable. However, this revision is not intended to eliminate the use of non-graded (nonidentifled mem- bers, or the use of lumber which has been ripped or resawn after grade stamp- ing. Such lumber may be used when thestructural components or assemblies in which it Is incorporated are tested and requalifled to the satisfaction of the DAPIA under the testing procedures de- scribed in \u00a7\u00a7 280.401 or 280.402, The De- partment intends, In the future, to Issue guidelines on levels of follow-up testing described in \u00a7\u00a7 280.401 and 280.402. Further, when mobile home manufac- tures are producing components made of non-graded materials, the procedures for assuring that tht nonidentifled members used in components are adequate shall be incorporated In the manufacturers quality control program. In addition, Interpretative Bulletin D-1-76 has been revised to allow design stresses to be assigned to boards less than 2\" in nominal thickness rather than limitthe application to 1\" nominal boards, INTERPRETATIVE BULLETIN D-2-76 (\u00a7 280.305(a)) Two commentors argued that carpet- ing should be permitted under shear walls, a practice prohibited by this Bul- letin. The Department does not believethe evidence is adequate to refute the probability that placing carpeting under shear walls would lessen the home's ability to withstand lateral loads be- cause the necessary connection between the wall and the floor could be weak- ened. INTERPRETATIVE BULLETIN D-3-76(\u00a7 280.305(b)) Interpretative Bulletin D-3-76 has been revised to limit the exclusion of the vertical roof projection for wind load calculation to roof slopes that do not exceed 20. Regardless of the roof slope of the mobile home, as suggested by acomment, the vertical roof projection shall be Included when determining the wind loading for split level or clerestory type roof systems. INTERPRETATIVE BULLETIN D-7-76 (\u00a7\u00a7 280.306(a) &(f)) Interpretative Bulletin revised to make clear how profes- sional engineers or architects shall deter- mine the design requirements for an- choring systems (ground anchors, at- NOTICES tachment points, and ties) that must be called f6r in the manufacturer's installa- tion instructions. First, each individual anchoring system must be capable of re- sistinga total force of 4725 pounds with- out failure. Second, in determining the number of individual anchoring systems that must be called for in the installa- tion instructions, the professional en.gieer or architect shall consider the simultaneous effects of horizontal wind and vertical uplift forces when those forces are increased by a safety factor of 1.5. The professional engineer or archi- tect shall assign to each anchoring sys- tem a maximum allowable working load value of 3150 pounds in determining how many such systems are required. These additions to the Interpretative Bulletin were made as a result of a com- ment to avoid possible misinterpretation in determining anchoring requirements provided in the manufacturer's instruc- tions by pointing out that 3150 poundi not 4725 pounds is the allowable load to be used in design. I=Rs a TIVE BUL.uTIn D-8--76 (\u00a7 280.305(g) (2)) has been revised to provide additional meth- ods for protecting wood, wood fibre, or plywood floors or subfloors in areas sub- jec6t to excessive moisture. This revision clarifies that when a non-absorbent floor covering is used without a continuous application of water resistant adhesive,the covering and any backing thereto must be non-absorbent and designed to be installed without the use of a water resistant adhesive or sealer except at penetrations made in the floor covering. Alternately, the Bulletin provides that a overlay of non-absorbent floor covering applied with either a water resistant ad- hesive or sealer can provide the required moisture protection required by the Standard. -I RIwETAiv BUTIXm F-1-76 (\u00a7 280.504(b) (2)) Interpretative Bulletin F-1-76 has been revised pursuant to a comment to make it clear that neither the sheathing nor the exterior covering may have an individual perm rating of less than the rating of a vapor barrier if a vapor bar- rier is installed on the warm side of the -wall cavity. The Bulletin also clarifies that when no -vapor barrier Is installed on the warm side of the wall, the com- bined permeance of the covering and/or 'sheathing be no los than 5.0 perms. IlTnMETAT1vEBULLETnG 0-1-76\" Bulletin G-1-76 has beenrevls to make it clear that the receptacle outlet required for the use of a listed heat tape must be located underneath the mobile home and within 2 feet of the water supply inlet. These clarifications were added Since:(1) The Department determined that a condition for the terms of a listed heat tape is that It be installed on the bnder- side of the mobile home; and (2) To assure that if the listed heat tape is installed It can be properly con- nected to the outlet provided. The Department, in consideration of many comments received, concluded that. in the event skirting is installed during installation, the underside receptacle would no longer be accessible from the outdoors. Therefore, an underside recep- tacle cannot be used to satisfy the re- quirements for an outdoor receptacle in section 280.806(d) (8). Thls would be ap- plicable whether or not the outlet pro- vided was a single or duplex receptacle. I=ERPRETATivE BuLLnar G-2-76 (\u00a7 280.609(b) (M)) a comment, Interpreta- tive Bulletin G-2-76 has been revised to permit any valve having through-flow capability equal to or greater than the maximum required water distribution piping size to serve as the master cold water shut-off full flow valve. This valve Is required to be accessible to the main feeder line of the mobile home, or to be installed In the water supply line adja- cent to the mobile home. IwiERPRETATIVE BuLLETI H-2-76 (\u00a7 280.709(e) (6)) Interpretative Bulletin H-2-76 has been revised to exempt external cooling systems (e.g., self contained air condi- tioning systems, etc.) from the connec- tion preparations required by section 280.709(e) (6) as suggested by severalcomments. However, the connection pro- visions are required to be installed by the manufacturer when the mobile home has been designed to accept external heating or combination heating and cooling external systems. I RETA=v Bu -T- 1-1-76 (\u00a7 280.808(n)) Interpretative Bulletin 1-1-76 has been revised to make clear that whenever the listing permits, snap-in' type integral boxes may be secured directly to wall paneling without any structural bracing or reinforcements. The Department -received no signifi- cant comments on the following has determined that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required with respect to these Inter- pretative Bulletins.

The determinations In these decisions of such prevailing rates and fringe bene- fits have been made by authority of the Secertary of Labor pursuant to the provi- sions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931. as amended (46 Stat. 1494, asamended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred toIn 29 CFR 1.1(including the statutes listed at 36 FR 306 following Secretary of Labor's Order No. 24-70) containing provisions for thepayment of wages which are dependentupon determination by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act; and pursuant to the provisions of Part 1 ofSubtitle A of Title 29 of Code of Fed-eral Regulations, Procedure for Prede- termination of Wage Rates, (37 FR 21138) and of Secretary of 15-71 (36 FR 8755, 8756). The prevailing rates and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in ac-cordance with the provisions of the fore- going statutes, constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics of the specified classes en-gaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. Good cause is hereby found for notutilizing notice and public procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these de-terminations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in-effec-tive date as prescribed in that section, because the necessity to issue construc-tion industry wage determination fre- quently and in large volume causes pro- cedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. General Wage Determination Deci- sions are effective from their date of pub-lication in the FEDERAL REGISTER withoutlimitation as to time and are to be usedIn accordance with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the ap-plicable decision together with any modi-fications issued subsequent to its publica- tion date shaU be made a part of everycontract for performance of the de- scribed work within the geographic areaindicated as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR, Part 5. The wage rates contained therein shall be the minimum paid under such contract by contractors and subcontrac- tors on the work. MODIFICATIONS AND SUPERSEDEAS DECI- SIONS TO GENERAL WAGE DETERMINATION DECISIONS Modifications and Supersedeas Deci- sions to General Wage Determination Decisions are based upon information ob- tained concerning changes in prevailing hourly wage rates and fringe benefit pay- ments since the decisions were Issued. The determinations of prevailing rates and fringe benefits made in the Modifica- tions and Supersedeas Decisions have been made by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931, as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal stat- utes referred to in 29 CFR 1.1 (including the statutes listed at 36 FR 306 follow- ing Secretary of Labor's Order No. 24- 70) containing provisions for the pay- ment of wages which are dependent upon determination by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act; and pur- suant to the provisions of Part 1 of Sub- title A of Title 29 of Code of Federal Regulations, Procedure for Predetermi-. nation of Wage Rates, (37FR 21138) and of Secretary Labor's Orders (36 FR 8755, 8756). The prevailing -rates and fringe benefits determined in foregoing General Wage Determination Decisions, as hereby modified, and/or superseded shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes, con-stitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construe- * tion projects to laborers and mechanics of the specified clAsses engaged in con- tract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
