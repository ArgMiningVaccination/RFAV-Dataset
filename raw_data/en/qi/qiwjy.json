Do we really understand the immune system and how to enhance it? One immune system is inherited or innate, the other one is adaptive. These two immune systems are the key players in dealing with COVID-19 prevention or treatment. So how can we boost both the innate and the adaptive immune systems to best deal with COVID-19? This is where Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be a major player in complementing Western medicine's approach to dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The concepts and theory behind TCM's understanding of the immune system uniquely positions practitioners to enhance immunity. TCM views the immune system response as being based on organ function. The respiratory and digestive systems's major organs are connected energetically to and support to the body's defense lines. So the stronger the organ systems' functioning, the better the immune system's response to pathogens. The inherited immune system, or innate immune system, corresponds to the first two lines of defense in the body. An energy field called \"defensive Qi\" provides support to the first line of defense in the nose, throat, mouth, and skin. The respiratory system, or the Lungs, creates this defensive Qi field, which provides a natural barrier to pathogens. Tears, mucus, and saliva are also part of and circulated by this first line of defense. These body fluids are produced by different organs including those from the respiratory and the digestive systems (Stomach and Spleen). The second line of defense, composed of phagocytes -- non-specific white blood cells that destroy pathogens -- are also circulated by defensive Qi. As long as the innate immune system remains strong, viruses cannot get past these first lines of defense. If any viruses do get past them and infect the body's cells, their number is low enough that the adaptive immune system can readily deal with them. The adaptive immune system, composed of virus-specific B-cells and T-cells, is dependent upon the bone marrow, which in TCM is energetically connected to the Kidney organ. For strong antibody and T-cell response, the Kidney organ must be functioning at a high level. This unique view of immunology brings an entirely different perspective and approach to dealing with viruses such as COVID-19. These concepts are key to understanding how TCM can truly complement Western medicine in the fight against COVID-19, as it brings into play an entirely different understanding of how to effectively enhance immune system function. TCM's view of immunology also helps us to understand why some unvaccinated individuals are able to tap into their natural immunity and not get sick, while other individuals, vaccinated or not, still get sick from COVID-19 (original strain and variants). The innate and the adaptive immune system's strength can only be based on your own body. If the functioning of all key organs are compromised, then not only will a significant amount of virus get past the inherited immune system, but also the adaptive immune system will have a delayed or inadequate response, allowing infection to set in. Because of TCM's time-honored tradition of preventative medicine, acupuncturists have long known how to enhance our natural immunity using a function-based approach to strengthening the relevant organ systems. By using acupuncture, herbs, and self-care tools such as breathwork, meditation, Qigong energy exercises, and acupressure, one can boost organ function to directly impact both inherited and adaptive immune system response. Furthermore, because of TCM's comprehension that mind-body-spirit affects health, we also look at the entire patient as a whole and ask the following questions: who are they? what are they? Certain emotional or physical conditions are understood to be related to different organ systems. Once you have an understanding of who the patient is and what their life is like, this knowledge -- of lifestyle, emotions, and habits -- gives us clues as to which organs need the most help. Lastly, TCM has long honored and placed importance on the unique relationship between patient and practitioner. In the modern world of fast-paced medicine and overburdened healthcare resources, nurturing this special relationship has become more important than ever to provide quality patient-centered care. Creating a relationship of trust between patient and practitioner -- one based on face-to-face time, listening, and acknowledgment of the patient as a person -- can make all the difference when it comes to improved treatment outcome,and patient compliance with prescribed self-care. As a result, what the practitioner teaches the patient to do for self-care and prevention can make a notable difference in maintaining health and wellness in the face of the ongoing pandemic. As the pandemic continues and the short-term effects of various vaccines become more apparent, it seems increasingly likely that COVID-19 is here to stay. It also may not be feasible, healthwise or financially, for everyone to get multiple vaccine shots yearly forever. So why not rely on something more powerful and intelligent -- such as our bodies' natural defenses -- that can do more to help and less harm? To our benefit, the unique concepts behind TCM offer a true complementary answer as to how to best enhance our natural immune system to deal with any virus that comes our way. "}
