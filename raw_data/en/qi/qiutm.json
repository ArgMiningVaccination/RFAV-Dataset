Vol. 17, No. 11 February 12, 2008 2 The 2008 session of the Indiana General Assembly has reached the deadline for bills to be considered in their house of origin. \"In hockey terms, we've reached the end of the first pe - riod,\" says Kevin Green, Purdue's director of state relations. \"Dur - ing the second period, the House considers the Senate bills and vice versa. The third period is when they work out the differences be - tween bill versions in conference committees.\" Of the nearly 800 bills intro - duced at the beginning of January, fewer than 300 are still being con - sidered. About 150 bills actually make it through the entire process each session, Green says. \"We had our eye on more than 100 bills this year, and we are still following about half of them,\" he says. \"From bills on where the flags Purdue flies are made to enhanced 911 service, if it can or will affect Purdue, we watch it.\" Several bills of particular interest to Purdue are still making their way through the legislature. House Bill 1246 deals with cours - es taught in high schools that also qualify for college credit. These \"double-up\" courses offer an opportunity for students to come to college with credits already earned. Universities want to ensure that the quality of these courses matches what students receive on campus. \"I think the proposal will be modified to include further study over the summer,\" Green says. \"This is a laudable goal of ex - panding the offerings while doing it at little cost to the students, but it still needs more work.\" House Bill 1280, authored by Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Blooming - ton, would require that univer - sity buildings be constructed or remodeled to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and Green Globes energy and environmental standards. \"We're working to ensure that the standards are realistic given the diverse facilities on a universi - ty campus,\" Green says. \"We strive to be as efficient as possible. How - ever, we don't want to be more restrictive in setting targets than is attainable. There's an additional cost up front, and that has to be weighed against savings.\" The bill is now in the Senate after passing the House 51-46. House Bill 1249, authored by Rep. Sheila Klinker, has also passed the House. The bill, which would provide tuition exemption for Purple Heart recipients, has been amended to reduce its fiscal load on available state student aid funding. The University would be reimbursed by the State Stu - dent Assistance Commission of Indiana for the forgiven fees if the commission has available funds. \"We want to make sure that other students aren't denied aid to fund this new program,\" Green says. \"We're also concerned that Purdue will have to cover this en - titlement if SSACI funds run out.\"purdue looks ahead as bills cross chambersStatehouse UpdateBoard appoints named professor, vice chancellor The Board of Trustees on Friday approved the appointment of one named professor and one vice chancellor. Trustees also ratified a bachelor's degree program in mo - torsports engineering at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and approved a department name change in the College of Engineering. Bruce Hamaker was appointed the Roy Whistler Chair in Carbo - hydrate Science in the Department of Food Science. Hamaker's ap - pointment brings the University's total of named and distinguished professors to 150. \"Dr. Hamaker epitomizes the kind of faculty member that makes Purdue one of the lead - ers in food science,\" said Interim Provost Victor Lechtenberg. \"The Whistler Center is the premier food carbohydrate center in the United States, and Dr. Hamaker will continue the center's mis - sion through his groundbreaking research and leadership.\" As director of the Whistler Center for Carbohydrate Research and a professor of food science, Hamaker performs research on carbohydrates and health, cereal starch and protein structure- function relationships, and cereal chemistry and processing. His research ranges from designing carbohydrates for potential health benefits to ways to improve cereal use in developing countries. Hamaker earned his bache - lor's degree in biological sciences from Indiana University in 1977. He received his master's degree in human nutrition in 1983 and doctoral degree in food chemis - try in 1986, both from Purdue. Before joining the Purdue faculty in 1992, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Nutricional/Johns Hopkins University in Lima, Peru, and was an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas. Trustees voted to ratify Lawrence Barrett's appointment as vice chancellor for student services and enrollment manage - ment at Purdue North Central. Barrett served as associate vice chancellor for student services and enrollment management at North Central since 2005. Previously, he was responsible for areas including admissions, financial aid, registration, dean of students, student counseling, stu - dent athletics, student activities, academic advising, library and media services, and school part - nerships. With his promotion, Barrett also is responsible for correctional education, including the programs at Westville Cor - rectional Facility and the Indiana State Prison, and K-12 outreach programs, including the Success Through Education Program and Purdue North Central College Bound Program. Barrett earned a bachelor's degree in communications from the State University of New Y ork at Plattsburgh in 1986. In 1993, he earned a master's degree in educational administration from the State University of New Y ork at New Paltz. He is working to - ward his doctoral degree in higher educational leadership. The bachelor's degree pro - gram in motorsports engineering at IUPUI is designed to augment an existing program on the cam - pus. The School of Engineering and T echnology offers a mo - torsports technology certificate program, in which more than 30 students are enrolled. \"This program will educate graduates for careers in automo - tive-related companies, either in motorsports or in the broader automotive industry, which could include airplanes, boats, trucks, off-road vehicles and unmanned competition vehicles,\" Lechten - berg said. Enrollment for the new program is expected to be 21 students over the first years and increase to 106 students by the fourth year. The program will be offered first in fall 2008, pending approval by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. Lechtenberg said it is believed that there are currently no comparable programs in the central part of the United States and only a limited number of similar programs in the country. Trustees also approved chang - ing the name of the Department of Engineering Education to the School of Engineering Education. The change reflects the full range of academic programs, from the undergraduate to doctoral level, that are offered by the depart - ment. The department has a total of 18 faculty members as well as seven courtesy faculty members from the colleges of Agriculture, Education, T echnology, Science and Engineering. It administers an array of in - terdisciplinary graduate programs, including a master of science, a master of science in engineering education and a doctorate. Since 2003-04, research awards in the area have grown by more than 700 percent, Lechtenberg said.Hamaker Barrett Trustees approve ME addition, planning of athletic complex The Board of Trustees on Friday approved financing and construc - tion of a new energy-efficient ad - dition to the Mechanical Engineer - ing Building and granted authority to plan a new athletic complex. The board also approved a construction contract for a new residence hall at Purdue Calumet, energy conservation work in three buildings and a lease for Lafayette Aviation. Mechanical Engineering's $34.5 million Roger B. Gatewood Wing will house a 120-seat class - room, teaching labs, instructional space, breakout spaces for the Prototype Engineering and Real - ization Lab, faculty and graduate student offices, graduate and un - dergraduate commons, research labs, and a tech-atrium. Scholer Corp. of Lafayette and Moody-Nolan Inc. of Indianapo - lis were hired in April to provide architectural and engineering work for the wing, which will add 84,500 square feet and expand the building space by 55 percent. Purdue will apply for certifi - cation to the U.S. Green Building Council for its Leadership in En - ergy and Environmental Design rating. Gatewood would be the University's first facility \u2014 and the seventh in the state \u2014 to receive LEED certification. \"The Gatewood Wing will be a model for sustainable facilities at Purdue,\" said Morgan R. Olsen, executive vice president and treasurer. \"It represents the next generation of architecture that serves both the people inside it and the environment around it.\" In honor of mechanical engineering's history as Purdue's first engineering discipline, the wing's Dr. Milton B. Hollander Atrium will showcase the clock from the original Heavilon Hall, the first mechanical engineering building on campus. The Northwest Athletics Complex to be planned will be home to a 1,500-seat baseball stadium designed to expand to 2,500 seats. Planning also will include upgrades to the adjacent soccer facility and a multipur - pose restroom, locker room and concession building to service all venues at the site. This continues the migration of Intercollegiate Athletics facilities from the center of campus, consol - idating them along the north edge of the campus. The effort also will free up land in the core of campus for other University uses, such as recreational or residential. No tax dollars will be used for the complex, which will be planned, financed and built in phases. The first phase is expected to cost about $15 million. Cooke Douglass Farr Lemons Ltd. of Jackson, Miss., is the architectural firm for the project. The stadium will be compa - rable to others in the Big T en and also upgrade fan and news media amenities, said athletic director Morgan Burke. \"This stadium will attract not only more student-athletes, but also will draw more people to watch Purdue sports,\" Burke said. \"It will offer the same quality facility to the baseball program that Mackey Arena and Ross-Ade Stadium have provided for our basketball and football programs.\" The board also approved an $18.1 million construction con - tract with Berglund Construction of Chesterton, Ind., for the $21.1 million second phase of student housing at Purdue Calumet. An L-shaped structure will provide 369 beds in 99 fully furnished units. Eighty-six units will have four bedrooms and 12 will have two bedrooms. The remaining single unit will be for the assistant housing director. Olsen said he expects students to be living there by fall 2009. The project is funded by bonds to be repaid through student housing fees. On Thursday, the board's Physical Facilities Committee approved planning for a $3.5 mil - lion renovation of the Krannert Building's third floor, to be funded with gifts. When completed, the west half of the floor will house the Steven A. Webster Undergradu - ate Programs Office. The office's current space in the basement will be renovated to provide a gradu - ate student office and study areas. Moody Nolan Inc. of Indianapolis will serve as architect and engineer.As part of Indiana's Quali - fied Energy Savings Program, the trustees approved a $4.5 million contract with Energy Systems Group of Indianapolis for the Herbert C. Brown Laboratory of Chemistry, Stewart Center and the Civil Engineering Build - ing. The program is designed to achieve annual energy savings and reduce overall campus peak demand for steam, chilled water and electricity. Proceeds from qualified energy savings bonds will finance the work. The board also approved a 17-year lease for Lafayette Avia - tion Inc.'s operation at the Purdue Airport, subject to approval by the governor and the Indiana Com - mission for Higher Education. February 12, 2008 3 New Purdue Extension director striving for success around state The new director of Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service will be spending a lot of time behind the wheel in 2008. Charles Hibberd plans to visit each of Indiana's 92 counties during the first year of his new position, which started on Nov. 1. So far, it's 19 down, 73 to go. \"I want to get to know the Ex - tension staff in each county and to learn about the counties, their economies, and the initiatives that are important to each area,\" he says. \"These trips have been a tremendous op - portunity to get a feel for Indiana and what goes on in the state, which is quite different from western Nebraska.\" Hibberd comes from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he served as district direc - tor of the Panhandle Research and Extension Center and Pan - handle Extension District. At the University of Nebraska, he was responsible for research and Ex - tension activities at four research locations and 12 county offices. Now in Indiana, Hibberd will guide the administration and management for Purdue Extension, an organization with nearly a $50 million budget and more than 500 educators on campus and throughout the state. But whether it be Nebraska or Indiana, one thing has remained consistent for Hibberd \u2014 Exten - sion's commitment to excellence. \"Extension professionals in Nebraska and in Indiana have the same dedication to their clien - tele,\" he says. \"No matter where you go, Extension staff have the same mentality and the same ap - proach, and that's really gratify - ing.\" That spirit and dedication reflect Hibberd's own passion about his work. The new direc - tor appreciates Extension's role in providing the science-based research, information and educa - tion that help people succeed. Now, he plans to further that role by not only solving problems but by getting out in front of them. \"Extension has always been known as a problem solver, and we do that extremely well,\" he says. \"A good example of that came during the flooding in Janu - ary in northwest Indiana. We had Extension publications on flood recovery delivered to the affected counties before floodwaters had even crested. \"Our opportunity, though, is not only to be responsive to things like that, but to try to be proactive. Right now, there's a team from Consumer and Fam - ily Sciences developing mold management education. That will be a huge issue this spring and summer.\" Hibberd also plans to concen -trate on developing opportunities for Indiana residents by helping to identify new revenue sources and new avenues to market products. 'The wine industry in Indiana is a great example of this,\" he says. \"Over the past 10 years, the business has exploded, and new wineries are being formed by Indiana residents. These winer - ies are becoming very successful because they have a high-quality product, and much of the grape growing and wine making exper - tise comes from Purdue research and Extension programs.\" Most of all, Hibberd wants people to know that Purdue Extension is available to provide information or referrals to the right resources for any topic. \"We have Extension educa - tors in all 92 counties, and they bring Purdue to the people of Indiana,\" Hibberd says. \"People can come to us with any issue or questions, and we will respond. We want people to value us for the outstanding customer service and information that we provide on economic development, family nutrition and health, youth, and agriculture.\"photo by mark simons Charles Hibberd, the new director of Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service, wants Indiana residents to value the organization for its responsiveness, customer service, and science-based research and information. Hibberd, also associate dean of Purdue Agriculture and associate vice provost for engagement, started at Purdue on Nov. 1. Senate to vote on grade index adjustment on Feb. 18 The University Senate will vote on an amended proposal that ad - dresses grade index adjustment at its Feb. 18 meeting. The original proposal brought before the Senate on Jan. 28 called for the use of two scholastic index - es \u2014 a semester and an adjusted cumulative \u2014 and uncoupled aca - demic forgiveness from the change of degree objective (CODO). The Senate passed an amendment that eliminated any adjustment to the cumulative index. James McGlothlin, chair of the Educational Policy Committee, brought the original proposal to the Senate floor. Under the propos - al, students would be allowed to omit up to 12 credit hours taken in the first 24 months of undergradu - ate studies. The omitted courses would appear on the transcript with an \"X\" before the grade. \"Students who knew how to work the system by CODO-ing to different colleges and schools could significantly impact their GPA at any time during college,\" said McGlothlin, who also is associate professor of industrial hygiene and ergonomics.. \"The proposal by the EPC puts limits on this process in terms of credits and time, and it offers fairness and flexibility to students who want to either stay in their major or transfer to another program.\" Scott Feld, who presented the amendment, said that placing an adjusted cumulative index on a transcript, even with explana - tory notes, could be perceived as misleading. \"While it is legitimate for faculty to consider some form of student forgiveness, especially for freshmen, the issue of the nature and extent of appropriate forgive - ness can be treated directly and separately from transcript GPA grade adjustments,\" said Feld, professor of sociology. Other senators also voiced their opposition to using the GPA as a means of forgiveness and suggested that any leniency be left for the individual colleges and schools to decide. George Bodner, chair of the University Senate, called for a show of hands on the amend - ment. Thirty-one voted in favor of the amendment, 27 voted against it and two abstained. After the vote, another discussion occurred, and several senators left the meeting. When the Senate then attempted to take a vote on the amended proposal, it lacked the 51 members needed for a quorum. The vote is now scheduled for Feb. 18. In other business n The Educational Policy Committee proposed scheduling changes for evening exams. Under the revised policy, the earliest evening exam would be at 6 p.m., and no exam would run later than 10 p.m. Currently, evening exams start at 6:30 p.m., and some exams last until 10:30 p.m. McGlothlin said student safe - ty issues and an increase in exams longer than one hour prompted the EPC's discussion of the policy with the Registrar's office. The revised policy is scheduled to be voted on in February. n Bodner reported to the Sen - ate about a proposed draft of an interpretation of the University's Policy on Intellectual Property. The interpretation of the policy was created to resolve questions that arose after the intellectual property policy was revised in May 2007. n Bodner also reported on proposed modifications to Pur - due's Policy on Research Integrity, Executive Memorandum C-22. The policy has not been modi - fied since its adoption in 1991 and is no longer consistent with the federal policy on research misconduct. Bodner says the modifications also are intended to address procedural concerns with Purdue's current policy. Bodner asked for questions on both reports during the meet - ing and told Senate members to e-mail their comments and sug - gestions on the drafts to him. The e-mail will be forwarded anony - mously to the authors of the final drafts of these documents.Football head coach Joe Tiller received the Order of the Griffin on Sunday night in Naples, Fla., as part of President's Council Weekend. The Order of the Griffin, one of the University's highest honors, is given to individuals whose com - mitment and service to the Univer - sity go well beyond the call of duty, and whose strength and vision have greatly benefited the institution. Tiller received the award from President France A. C\u00f3rdova, who was joined during the presentation by athletics director Morgan Burke and New Orleans Saints and former Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. C\u00f3rdova praised Tiller's leadership as Purdue's coach for the past 12 years. \"There are many people who say that Joe Tiller not only changed the football for - tunes of Purdue, he changed the way the game is played in the Big T en and made it more exciting than ever for our stu - dents and fans,\" C\u00f3rdova said. \"Joe, your accomplish - ments are not only in football victories but in developing young men who go on to be leaders in their communities and our nation.\" Past recipients of the Order of the Griffin have included Nobel Prize winner Herbert Brown, and astro - nauts Neil Armstrong and Gene Cernan.tiller honored with order of the Griffin Purdue literary magazine to celebrate 20th anniversary with gala Sycamore Review, Purdue's nationally recognized journal of literature, opinion and arts, will celebrate its 20th anniversary with a gala on Feb. 29. \"For two decades Sycamore Review has consistently published a lively mix of established and emerging writers and visual art - ists,\" said Patrick Nevins, manag - ing editor of the Sycamore Review and a graduate student in creative writing. The event, which is free and open to the public, is at 7:30 p.m. at the Wells Center, 638 North St., Lafayette. Music will be provided by jazz artist Danny Weiss. Complimentary beverages and hors d'oeuvres will be served. Participants can enter a raffle to win prizes from area businesses. Funds raised will benefit the Syca - more Review and help expand its Looseleaf Writing Workshop Series, which offers creative writing ses - sions to adults and children. Writ - ing topics include fiction writing, character development and poetry. These community workshops take place at Lafayette's Southside Community Center, the down - town branch of the Tippecanoe County Public Library, and the West Lafayette Public Library. The next workshop will be 6:30-8:30 p.m. Feb. 21 at the West Lafayette Public Library. Registration is available at each location and a complete schedule of workshops is available online at www. sycamorereview.com . Graduate students in the mas - ter of fine arts creative writing program instruct the workshops and participate in the editing process of the Sycamore Review, which is published twice a year. The students screen hundreds of submissions a year. The journal is affiliated with the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of English. The Sycamore Review has an advisory board composed of Purdue faculty members David Blakesley, Marianne Boruch, Patricia Henley, Bich Minh Nguyen, Donald Platt, Porter Shreve, Sharon Solwitz and Patri - cia Sullivan. The graduate student staff has control over the content and managing of the journal. Early Sycamore Review contributors included John Updike, Mary Oliver and Charles Bukowski, and recent issues have featured interviews with novelists Charles Baxter and Nick Hornby. Poet Paul Muldoon selected Amy Gerstler's poem \"Watch\" \u2014 first published in Sycamore Review \u2014 for inclusion in \"The Best American Poetry 2005.\" \"Beginning with the Winter/Spring 2006 issue, Sycamore Review started pub - lishing in a striking eight-inch square format, distinguishing it from other magazines of its kind,\" Nevins said. In that same issue, the staff launched the Wabash Prizes in Poetry and Fiction, which award a $1,000 prize and have been judged by such well-known authors as Richard Bausch, Eavan Boland and Ellen Bryant Voigt. Tiller February 12, 2008 4 Kapp named United Way volunteer of year Greg Kapp, executive assistant to the president, recently received the Volunteer of the Y ear award from United Way of Greater Lafayette. The organization honored Kapp for his role in \"transforming the way we invest campaign dol - lars in programs and services\" in the community, according to Kate Walker of the United Way. \"It's the biggest award we give for individuals,\" Walker said. Kapp helped organize and was chairman of the new Commu - nity Investment Committee. The committee, a combination of the previ - ous allocation and planning committees, revamped the system by which agencies apply for funding. The Indiana Associations of United Ways will recognize Kapp in April at a statewide banquet with volunteer award winners from other areas, Walker said.

February 12, 2008 7 Rec Sports tour to Texas furthers vision for renovation planning A recent staff and student visit to five T exas universities added to Purdue's sense for what a campus recreational hub can be, says the director of recreational sports. Howard Taylor, the director, says, \"What stood out was the nature of rec - reation and the range of things that it encompasses. For our students, it was a great opportunity to catch a vision for the impact a modern recreational facility can have.\" Opinion favoring major improvements to the Recreational Sports Center on the West Lafayette campus \u2014 a longstand - ing wish of many \u2014 has broadened since Taylor's arrival in March 2005. He has tapped into student interest through surveys, advisory groups and im - ages of facilities at other universities. Many go far beyond barbells, treadmills and basketball courts. Eight students visited campuses with Taylor; Mitch Nettesheim, RSC associate director of facilities and operations; and Christopher Marks, contract manager in Physical Facilities' Engineering, Utilities and Construction section. The group visited T exas-Austin, T exas A&M in College Station, T exas State in San Marcos, T exas-San Antonio and the University of Houston. Kelly McMains, president pro tem of Purdue Student Government and chair of its 2-year-old ad hoc committee on the Co- Rec, made the trip. \"The features that we thought were the most interesting were the student commu - nity oriented features like classrooms for organization meetings, grills for cookouts, massage clinics, personal trainers available for appointments, and leisure pools in ad - dition to a more open feeling with a natural light design incorporated in the buildings,\" she says. Modern amenities and open spaces are universal themes, Taylor says, including outdoor pools that are anything but rectan - gular. Purdue will consider building a pool for leisure recreation indoors, as Midwest universities such as Illinois, Missouri, Kent State and Ohio State have done. Most of the T exas facilities on the itin - erary are quite recent, and generally they feature rock climbing walls in a visually impressive central location, Taylor says. Taylor says the trip, in early December, also furnished much information about operational factors. For example, in plan - ning a pool with sections and elevated features such as slides or waterfalls, it's important to maintain lines of sight for lifeguards. There are numerous modern design issues that can be learned by visiting other facilities. His collection of photos from the trip includes not only pools, indoor tracks and weighlifting areas, but lockers, fire alarms, stairs, instructional signs, motivational posters, gathering spaces, flooring, equip - ment shops, kitchens and bathrooms. He is working on sustainability factors. The project will meet as many as possible of the \"green\" criteria of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, he says. But like research laboratories, it has special factors that make full LEED approval for buildings in general difficult. \"For example, intense activity increases the need for 'turnover' of the air in a room,\" Taylor says. \"It's best to have the system be adaptable to changes in usage. \"But some steps are available. Natural lighting decreases the need to run artificial lighting. Sensors can turn off lights when no movement occurs in an area.\" Other sustainability issues include the durability of materials and appeal of design features. Taylor also has added insights from T exas into his assessment of how much Purdue should aim to build if finances allow. A common experience of universities, he says, has been a boom in interest once a new, versatile, more spacious facility opens. \"It's hard to get at the number who have chosen not to come to the [univer - sity's old] facility because of its lack of space,\" Taylor says. \"My colleagues at other universities say it's often more than you imagine.\"Taylor's surveys and imagination- stimulating \"recreation solution\" for Pur - due presentation also have incorporated knowledge from a leading consulting firm, Brailsford and Dunlavey. The firm will be important in determining the optimal scope of the project, he says. Several newer centers elsewhere have one or two large exterior walls that are not load-bearing and can give way easily to further expansion. The overall aim is to develop an invit - ing space for a wide variety of health and recreation activities, fun and social gather - ings. By using windows and open spaces, the center invites spectators and visitors to try new activities and get involved. Recreational centers are providing multi -purpose rooms and refreshment areas that make them important to their campuses as gathering places and centers for campus community The project has not reached official design status, but administrators and stu - dents are working hard to identify the most appropriate concepts to begin to solve the long overdue issues of aging recreational facilities. President France A. C\u00f3rdova is voicing her support for it as an element in student experience, within the new strategic plan. McMains gave a PowerPoint presenta - tion to the Board of Trustees in December. The PSG Senate has passed a resolution and is seeking statements of support from student organizations. Taylor is working to make the most of this support. \"We're continuing our information gathering, putting together concepts that will meet the program goals,\" he says. \"We identify a range of goals, work out their costs and look at what can realistically be achieved. \"If we can't afford all of it, we look at ways to make 90 percent of it work, and so on. \"This all has to be looked at in terms of the new Strategic Plan. So we'll see where that's going, and we'll give everyone the best information we can.\" staff, students learn what went into impressive recent facilities photos provi DeD by Division of reCreational sports This Purdue group traveled with Howard Taylor, director of recreational sports, to this facility at the University of Houston and four other Texas campuses in December. They saw how facilities put features together, talked with students and staff, and collected information on nuts and bolts issues for the next steps in planning a renovation and expansion of the Recreational Sports Center. Purdue staff members on the tour were Taylor; Mitch Nettesheim (front left), associate director of facilities and operations at RSC; and Chris Marks (far right), contract manager in Physical Facilities' Engineering, Utilities and Construction. Students in the group are affiliated with Purdue Student Government or its ad hoc committee on the initiative.

He was 98 years old. \"Butz served Purdue well as a respected faculty member, department head and dean,\" said Randy Woodson, the Glenn W. Sample Dean of Agriculture. \"He was a tireless advocate for agriculture, and his efforts helped bring Purdue Agriculture into international prominence.\" Of the many roles he had in life, it was teach - ing that he most enjoyed, accord - ing to his comments in a Purdue \"Connections\" article. Wally Tyner, former agri - cultural economics department head, remembers Butz as a friend and mentor. \"He always knew how to provide encouragement, and he thanked people for a job well done,\" Tyner said. Butz earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture from Purdue in 1932. As a senior, he was edi - tor of the Purdue Exponent. In 1937, he earned the first doctoral degree in agricultural economics awarded at Purdue. Butz joined the staff in the Department of Agricultural Economics in 1937. He served as head of the department from 1946 to 1954. Butz was made dean of Purdue Agriculture in 1957 and served until 1967.

This trend is not because the number of students who qualify for these services has increased, says David Schwarte, manager of ITaP's Adaptive Learning Pro - grams lab. \"Actually, the number of stu - dents we have helped every year since I joined ALPs in 1995 has been about 700 to 800,\" Schwarte says. \"What has changed is greater awareness among students, faculty, and staff of what assistive services we offer and the training we conduct on adaptive software and other tools. \"Students are coming to the lab because they see others with disabilities enjoying better mobility and independence with the tools we now have available. Increasing students' indepen - dence is one of our essential goals. A degree from Purdue is valuable, so they must earn their degrees independently. I just help these students help themselves.\" Services available ALPs, a unit of ITaP's T each - ing and Learning T echnologies, offers help to students, faculty, and staff. Its consulting assists instructors in creating learning materials that are accessible to all students, especially with comput - ers and technology. Schwarte of - fers one-on-one software training for faculty by appointment. He also conducts personal evalua - tions of students to assess their technology needs for all their courses. For those who are visually im - paired, ALPs has many software programs, such as JAWS for Win -dows, a screen reader, and Zoom T ext Magnifier, used for screen enlargement. Naturally Speaking, a voice recognition software, and Kurzweil 1000 and 3000, a text- to-speech software, help students who are primarily auditory learn - ers or visually impaired. Because ITaP has a campus-wide license for Kurzweil 3000, it is available in all ITaP instructional comput - ing labs. photo by mark simons Dean Brusnighan (left) uses a keyboard designed to assist the visually impaired as David Schwarte reads a sheet of braille last week in the lab for Adaptive Learning Programs, Room 111, Stewart Center. Both men are assistive technology specialists for ALPs, a part of ITaP's Teaching and Learning Technologies unit. \"The vast majority of Purdue students with disabilities, how - ever, have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD or ADHD) or another learning disability,\" Schwarte says. In such cases, he meets with the student \u2014 and the instructor, if available \u2014 to evaluate needs and deter - mine what assistive technology is appropriate. T o review all that ALPs offers, call the lab at 49-44387 or browse to www.itap.purdue.edu/tlt/idc/ alps/index.cfm/ . Competitive climate T oday, many high school stu - dents with disabilities and their parents check out the assistive technology and disabled student services programs when they tour prospective universities. With all that the Americans with Disabili - ties Act requires of educational institutions, Purdue is finding more ways to help students with all kinds of disabilities, whether they be physical, cognitive, visual, or auditory. Dean Brusnighan, assistive technology specialist who works with Schwarte, says, \"Students with disabilities today have so many more options in choos - ing universities. Each institution complies with the ADA, but they also have individual policies that create strengths in providing certain services. Because those policies vary, students are active consumers in deciding which campus offers them the best situ - ation for their particular needs.\" With the increase in students seeking services, Schwarte had less and less time to attend to overarching institutional needs, such as keeping software up-to- date and consulting with Purdue's human resources department on technology for an employee with disabilities. T o remedy the time shortage, Brusnighan transferred last fall from Adaptive Programs in the Office of the Dean of Students. He now works directly with Schwarte, primarily to handle the administrative duties that the University and the federal govern - ment require. \"Our focus is to localize this national law (ADA) and apply it to our Purdue population,\" Brus - nighan says. \"By centralizing the technology needs for all persons with disabilities on campus, we are more efficient.\" One of Brusnighan's cur - rent projects is finalizing a Web accessibility policy, which will define standards that Purdue's Web developers follow to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to the Web and the Internet. This policy includes such guidelines as using text equiva - lents for images, headers for data tables, and descriptive frame titles that facilitate navigation. The policy also recommends that de - signers avoid screen-flicker rates that may cause an individual to have a seizure.
