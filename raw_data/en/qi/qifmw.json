Although it is preferable to start the program before the vaccination, it can also be carried out after the vaccination administration and also months later. The pre and post vaccination biophysical program consists of an immune treatment that is carried out both before and after the vaccination to prepare the patient's body to better deal with the possible stress caused by the vaccination, it can also be undertaken months later, to counteract any unwanted effect of the vaccination received. The most common situations in which an adult is required to be vaccinated relate to travel abroad to high-risk countries, flu prophylaxis especially in the elderly and contact with infectious diseases, in the case of health workers or in the event of epidemics. The Pre and Post Vaccination Program naturally supports the body's immune system by preparing it to deal with any stress resulting from vaccination as easily as possible. Following the visit or medical consultation and on the basis of the patient's clinical situation, it will be established whether or not it is necessary to carry out a biophysical investigation on capillary sampling, before proceeding with the program.

As can happen with some pharmacological treatments, reactions can also arise following a vaccination. These are effects that can occur locally, ie in the vicinity of the site where the administration took place, or at a general level. The area of the puncture where the vaccine was administered may be swollen, red or hard and the child may feel some pain. On a general level, however, a very frequent reaction is represented by fever which is not infrequently accompanied by irritability and loss of appetite. Less frequent, but still to be included among the normal reactions, are vomiting and diarrhea. As can happen with any other drug, allergic reactions can occur even after a vaccine, sometimes even serious, but they are quite rare. The AIFA 2018 Vaccine Report (the latest available to date) describes the vaccine surveillance activities conducted in Italy. (The reports can be found on the AIFA - Italian Medicines Agency website). These activities consist in the monitoring and evaluation of reports of suspected adverse reactions to vaccines, both spontaneous (passive pharmacovigilance) and stimulated by appropriate independent studies (active pharmacovigilance), conducted by the Regions in collaboration with AIFA. All these reports are included in the National Pharmacovigilance Network and come from both health professionals and citizens. An adverse event after immunization is any adverse event of a medical nature that occurs after a vaccination and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with it, but which requires further investigation (suspected adverse event occurring in temporal coincidence with the vaccination (s) /the). In 2018, out of 7,267 reports, the most frequent adverse reactions (> 1,000 events) were those already known and expected and corresponding to fever (body temperature 38 \u00b0), local reactions at the injection site and generalized skin reactions (including skin rash type). Less common (> 500 and <1,000 events) were agitation / irritability, hyperpyrexia (body temperature 39.5 \u00b0), vomiting and urticaria adverse reactions. For most vaccines, these adverse reactions are described in the SPCs as very common and common. More rarely (under 400 overall events) other known adverse reactions such as diarrhea, vagal reactions (i.e. related to the vagus nerve, such as nausea, cramps, tachycardia, neuralgia, dizziness and fainting), asthenia, pain, crying, headache and lack of appetite. The other adverse reactions are below the value of 100 events and are among the rare and expected events, such as febrile convulsions. Some of those reported with a very rare frequency (less than 20 events) are characteristic of specific vaccines. Vaccinations are not carried out or are postponed in the following cases: Presence of a febrile state over 38 \u00b0 C or of general ailments considered important Presence of alterations in the immune system that may be due to congenital diseases, which lead to the decrease or absence of naturally produced antibodies or to a reduction in the immune defenses resulting from certain pathologies or for particular therapies, for example the administration of high doses of drugs containing cortisone.
