Tomohiko Yoshida on offering quality care to patients across Japan Leading the way Toshinkai Medical Corp. is a medical institution specializing in the treatment of rheumatism and collagen diseases. It operates three clinics including the Shinjuku Rheumatology Clinic. We would like to become a leader in the field and provide the best rheumatism and collagen disease treatment in Japan. We also want to address regional disparities in treatment and become a model of team medical care. I am the general director of three clinics: Shinjuku Rheumatology Clinic, Setagaya Rheumatology Clinic Medicine and Rheumatology Clinic in Sakaki, Nagano. Owing to regional disparities between Tokyo and the other parts of Japan, our group focuses on the clinic in Nagano while maintaining a presence in the capital. Remote control The medical institutes in Tokyo boast some of the best treatment in the world for rheumatism and collagen diseases. However, treatment outside Tokyo is several years behind. There are many rheumatologists in Tokyo but outside Tokyo physicians with other specialties often see patients with rheumatism or collagen diseases. Our group, however, has four full-time specialists and 18 part-time specialists. We dispatch physicians from Tokyo to Nagano in order to improve medical care there. Nagano is vast and mountainous, so traveling to healthcare facilities is very inconvenient for patients due to the poor accessibility. Even if some physicians want to study rheumatism and collagen diseases to help their patients, it is difficult for medical practitioners in other prefectures like Nagano to pass the qualifying examination required to become a rheumatologist because the current certification requirements are very strict. So, I am now trying to construct a system to support non-specialists remotely. Specifically, we plan to connect clinics outside Tokyo to our clinic via the internet to provide advice in real time to physicians in far-flung places during consultations, while also sharing the patients' medical records. The patients' physicians will present a course of treatment and prescriptions which will be approved by our specialists. If we succeed in building this system, we will be able to provide high-level rheumatism treatment across Japan. The right mix Shinjuku Rheumatology Clinic provides patients with comprehensive medical care as it features Chinese medicine, acupuncture and physiotherapy departments in addition to internal medicine for rheumatology and collagen disease. This is because many patients use various alternative therapies such as Chinese herbal medicines and supplements without sharing this with their attending physicians. We want our patients to share information about all of the treatments and therapies they use. All of the departments within our clinic share their medical records. If a patient is using Chinese medicine, acupuncture or physiotherapy, for instance, in addition to Western medicine, we can keep all of the physicians informed of all of the treatments and therapies provided by other departments. The essence of the treatment of rheumatism and collagen diseases is the regulation of abnormal immune function. This is what Western medicine should address. Immune system-modulating therapies cannot eliminate fatigue or joint pain. Chinese medicines and acupuncture, however, are able to reduce the side effects of hard immunoregulatory drugs and steroids. Physiotherapy helps to improve physical function. We aim to achieve remission in patients through comprehensive medical care linked with other treatments and therapies while centering on Western medicine. All of our physicians are rheumatologists. Our nurses and physiotherapists are also qualified to treat people for rheumatism. At our clinic, our nurses acquired medical and pharmaceutical knowledge concerning rheumatology before the establishment of the rheumatology nurse qualifying system. Patients may be too nervous to say the things they want to say in front of a physician. Therefore, our clinic enables patients to talk to nurses in a calm and relaxing setting after consultations. This helps patients understand their condition and treatment strategy better. Our clerks support patients as a part of team medicine. For example, they consider the social background and family circumstances of patients with rheumatism or collagen diseases and provide information about the medical expense subsidy system when necessary. We also established the Kizuna Fund to support pregnant women who require rheumatism treatment. About 15 years have passed since I opened the clinic specializing in rheumatism and collagen diseases in Setagaya. Recently developed new drugs have dramatically improved treatment results such as biological products and JAK inhibitors. We would like to be a leader in improving the treatment of rheumatism and collagen disease by facing and resolving the remaining issues in the field and providing patients with advanced therapeutic drugs. Going forward, our plans include training physicians, establishing a medical service system and promoting subsidies for patients who want children.
