He was a clinician, researcher, leader, and advocate for paediatrics and Child Health. In addition tohis roles as Professor of Paediatrics and Infectious Diseases at theUniversity of Ottawa and as Executive Vice-President of theCanadian Paediatric Society, he made a significant contribution tothe surveillance of rare diseases in children. Victor played the majorrole in the development of the Canadian Paediatrician SurveillanceProgram in 1996 and forged close links between that unit and theunits in Britain, Australia and elsewhere. He was a key player indeveloping a proposal for formation of the International Network ofPaediatric Surveillance Units, which came to fruition in 1998. He was a member of the INoPSU Executive from 1998 and was unanimously elected to become Convenor ofINoPSU in 2002. He was due to take up this position in 2003. The network will miss his leadershipand commitment - he will be hard to replace. We will also miss Victor's personal qualities: hisenthusiasm, integrity and hard work, his compassion and commitment, his friendship and his readysmile. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 ii INoPSU Report 1999-2002 iiiMembership Units . . . is a trulycollaborative organisation.Established in 1998, it joins14 diverse countries with acommon purpose - toconduct surveillance ofuncommon conditions of childhood. The member units span the globe - from theNetherlands to Papua New Guinea to New Zealand. All usethe active, monthly, surveillance method developed bySusan Hall and the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit in1986. The hallmark of these units is that they involve paediatricians in research. Child health specialists runmost studies. Most results are reported at paediatricmeetings and in paediatric journals. Thus, paediatriciansfeel an 'ownership' of these units and, as a result, thereturn of monthly report cards is remarkably high. Collectively, INoPSU members conduct surveillance in a population of over 46 million children. More than 8000clinicians report each month and the average responserate is over 90%. Over 180 conditions have been studied,from vaccine-preventible diseases through injuries,infections, rare syndromes and genetic diseases. Morerecent studies have linked the laboratory with thepopulation to describe the molecular epidemiology ofdisease - Rett syndrome is one such example. The Britishsearch for cases of variant Creutzfeld Jacob Disease is anexample of how units can respond to the public healthneed for monitoring emerging diseases. For manyconditions studied, our surveillance units provide the onlyavailable national, prospective data. Many studies havegenerated hypotheses, fostering further research. INoPSU provides a unique opportunity for collaborative research. Consultation encourages units to use the samediagnostic criteria for conditions studied. Simultaneousconduct of studies allows comparison of data betweencountries for conditions such as perinatally acquired HIVinfection, vitamin K deficiency bleeding and early onseteating disorder. INoPSU also allows member units tocritically evaluate surveillance methodology and to addresscurrent issues such as confidentiality in research. Importantly, INoPSU has a major role in education, through dissemination of results in the medical press and themedia. Lack of long-term funding to support unitinfrastructure remains a problem for many INoPSUmembers. It is up to us to produce high quality data toconvince governments and granting bodies of the worth ofour units. INoPSU functions predominantly as a virtual network and I invite you to visit us at www.inopsu.com. However, we areindebted to those who have made it possible for membersto meet in person: the Canadian Paediatric Society andHealth Canada (Ottawa 2000) and the Royal College ofPaediatrics and Child Health (York 2002). In closing, I must acknowledge the contribution made by Richard Lynn and Greta Ridley to the preparation of thisfirst INoPSU progress report and pay tribute to AngusNicoll, the first INoPSU Convenor and to the INoPSUExecutive. I look forward to meeting you all again inPortugal in 2004! Elizabeth Elliott (INoPSU Convenor 2000-2004) INoPSU Report 1999-2002 1Foreword Rare diseases and infections are, paradoxically, a numerically important cause of morbidity and mortality inchildhood. Individually uncommon, together they numberthousands, and many result in severe sequelae. Many arecharacterised by chronicity and by high rates of disablingsequelae or death. Most pose a large financial andemotional burden for affected children, their families andhealth systems. To address this, in 1986 the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) initiated surveillance of rare paediatricdisease. The success of the BPSU and the methodologyit adopted quickly led to the establishment of other nationalunits. This led to the potential of multi-national surveillanceof such rare disease. Initial discussions to develop the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INoPSU) began in 1996following successful collaborations between the existingEuropean Units. In 1998 a framework for such a networkwas developed and in the year 2000 it was officiallylaunched in Ottawa, Canada at the first INoPSU scientificconference. The mission aim of the Network is 'theadvancement of knowledge about rare and uncommonchildhood infections and disorders through the participationof paediatricians in surveillance on a national andinternational basis'.To achieve its mission aim, the Network's main concern is that of epidemiological surveillance, defined as 'thecollection analysis and dissemination of high quality datarelevant to the understanding, prevention and control ofmedical conditions of public health importance so as tosatisfy the needs of health care professionals, science,government, voluntary organisations and the public atlarge' (adapted from: Bulletin of the World HealthOrganisation 1994; 72). At its launch in 2000, there were ten founding paediatric surveillance units; from Australia, British Isles, Canada,Germany, Latvia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Netherlands,Papua New Guinea and Switzerland. Wales, Portugal, theRepublic of Ireland, Greece and Cyprus have since joinedthem. Between them, these units involve over 8000 clinicians in the surveillance of rare paediatric disorders, covering achild population of over 40 million. To date these units havehelped to facilitate research into over 180 disorders. This, the first annual report of the INoPSU, will outline the development of the Network and, by highlighting itsactivities from its inception, will demonstrate the potentialfor such a Network. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 21 Introduction Current INOPSU Members Britain WalesNetherlandsGermany Latvia MalaysiaPapua New Guinea NewNew ZealandZealandAustraliaSwitzerlandCanadaCanadaPortugalIreland Greece/CyprusHistory The origins of the first national paediatric surveillance unit, the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU), can betraced back to 1979. Attempts by the British PaediatricAssociation and the Health Protection Agency (formerly thePublic Health Laboratory Service) in that period relied onpassive reporting to undertake surveillance of Reye'ssyndrome, Kawasaki disease, haemolytic uraemicsyndrome and haemorrhagic shock syndrome.Paediatricians were asked to remember and report casesof rare conditions when they were diagnosed. This metwith only relative success and led to the development of anactive alternative, sending paediatricians monthlyreminders of the condition they were being asked to report.This system was officially launched in 1986 as a jointinitiative between the British Paediatric Association (nowthe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health), theInstitute of Child Health (London) and the Health ProtectionAgency. Over the following 15 years the BPSU hasfacilitated surveillance of over 50 rare disorders, includingReye's syndrome, HIV/AIDS and variant Creutzfeldt JacobDisease (vCJD). The successful methodology of circulatinga monthly report card to all consultant paediatricians in theUnited Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland was the basisfor that now used by all the current members of INoPSU. The aims, developed by the BPSU, have been incorporated by the other national surveillance units, andare: To facilitate research into uncommon paediatric disorders of public health importance for theadvancement of knowledge and the improvement ofprevention, treatment and service planning. To increase the awareness of the less common disorders of childhood among paediatricians. To respond rapidly to public health emergencies. Establishment of an International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units The national and international recognition of the work of the BPSU led to enquiries from other national paediatricassociations and in 1992 similar such units were launchedin Germany, the Netherlands and Australia. From very early on, the European units met informally to discuss research protocols and funding issues. Supportedin 1995 by the establishment of the Swiss Unit, theEuropean group met in Leiden, Netherlands to discussjoint surveillance of paediatric disorders and the need toseek funding from the European Union. Though the latterhas been unsuccessful, several joint studies have been undertaken, namely in vitamin K deficiency bleeding,haemophilus b influenzae and childhood diabetes. These have led to the publication of several leading papers andpresentations. During this time the BPSU continued to have close ties with the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU)and the newly formed Canadian surveillance programme.With the support of the APSU, units in Malaysia, PapuaNew Guinea and New Zealand were formed in the mid1990s. At the same time the Irish Paediatric SurveillanceUnit (covering Northern Ireland and the Republic ofIreland) and the Welsh Paediatric Surveillance Unit werealso being established. Though using the samemethodology, their remit is slightly different in that theysurvey more common childhood disorders. It became clear that even though representatives from each of the Units were meeting occasionally there was aneed for an International Network of PaediatricSurveillance Units (INoPSU) to formalise the links amongunits. A proposal for INoPSU was drawn up in 1996 andratified at the 22 ndInternational Congress of Paediatrics held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in August 1998. The first INoPSU conference held in Canada in June 2000 confirmed the establishment of the network with thepublication of the Amsterdam-Ottawa Note. Angus Nicollwas elected Convenor in 1998 and Elizabeth Elliott in2000. Mission and Aims of INoPSU The Amsterdam-Ottawa Note laid down the mission ofINoPSU that being \"the advancement of knowledge aboutrare and uncommon childhood infections and disordersthrough the participation of paediatricians in surveillance ona national and international basis\". INoPSU's primary aimis to facilitate communication and co-operation amongnational paediatric surveillance units (and researchers whouse these units), and to assist in the development of newand existing units. INoPSU's aims are detailed in Table 1overleaf. Communication is enhanced by the establishmentof the INoPSU website http://www.inopsu.com. It linkswebsites of individual units and various national paediatricbodies to facilitate the sharing of information onmethodology, evaluation and ethical issues, and dataderived from studies. The simultaneous collection ofidentical data in different countries also allows comparisonsto be made of disease incidence, management andoutcome among geographic regions. INoPSU also aims todevelop uniform diagnostic criteria, disseminate newknowledge and enhance the ability to mount internationalsurveillance of emerging disorders rapidly. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 32 BackgroundINoPSU Structure INoPSU's founding members are listed in Table 2 opposite. An elected secretariat oversees the INoPSU, undertakingregular consultation with units and seeking funding asnecessary. An 'international link person' has beennominated from each Unit. INoPSU functions primarily asan electronic network. An INoPSU website(http://www.inopsu.com) has been developed linking thewebsites of the individual units. Richard Lynn at the BritishPaediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) initially acted as theINoPSU secretariat and the APSU administers the website.These duties were due to transfer to the CanadianPaediatric Surveillance Programme in April 2003. However, following the untimely death of the convenorelect Professor Victor Marchessault, a decision to do sowill not be made until the 3 rdINoPSU conference in April 2004. Most national units are affiliated with their country's professional paediatric organisation and various otherorganisations concerned with child and public health arefrequently represented on units' administrative boards.Staffing levels are variable depending on the size of theUnit and available funding.

It can be characterised as anefficient postal system which, by the use of a monthlymailing card, allows the simultaneous and efficient conductof multiple surveillance projects whilst limiting the burdenof reporting for individual doctors. Individuals ororganisations are able to apply to use surveillance units toconduct a study. Selection of studies All existing units have adopted a similar selectionprocedure in order to identify studies for inclusion in theirrespective reporting system. Applications to conduct astudy are considered by the scientific panel overseeing therunning of the surveillance unit. This panel will normallycomprise of paediatricians (general and specialist),epidemiologists and specialists in public health.Applications need to outline the research aims of the study,the diagnostic criteria to be adopted, and practicalities onhow the study is to be administered and funded. To beapproved for study, conditions must fulfil certain criteria(see box). Importantly, before a study can be approved, itmust conform to international ethical guidelines(International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical ResearchInvolving Human Subjects prepared by the Council forInternational Organisations of Medical Sciences and theWorld Health Organisation in 1993). For a number of reasons it may be considered that the surveillance mechanism is not suitable for answering theobjectives of a proposed study. The condition may be toocommon and therefore place too great a burden onpaediatricians for reporting or follow-up; there may be nosuitable case definition; the aim of the study may be tocollect a cohort for further unspecified research or theinvestigation may constitute audit rather than surveillance.If a study is not accepted, the panel advises the applicanton alternative means of undertaking the work. Though considered stringent, the advantages of this procedure are two-fold. Firstly, respondents know that astudy must be methodologically sound to be accepted bythe surveillance unit. Secondly, prospective investigatorsknow that if a study is accepted they are assured of a highlevel of involvement from clinicians. Once accepted, studies are usually included in the reporting mechanism for a period of one to three years. Study durationmay be extended if the condition is deemed of particularpublic health significance (e.g. vCJD), if it is a condition ofvery low frequency (e.g. congenital rubella) or when thepaediatric surveillance unit is the optimal mechanism forgathering routine surveillance data (HIV and AIDS).The reporting system Factors that favour acceptance Scientific importance. Rarity of the condition, though short-term or geographically limited studies of commoner disorders are considered. Proposals with study outcomes of clear importance to public health. Uniqueness, priority will not be given if similar studies have recently been undertaken or if other data sourcesare readily available (although the investigators areencouraged to use alternative data sources for validation and completeness of reporting). Attention to detail, in terms of clear achievable objectives, practicability, patient confidentiality andresources. Practicality and limited workload for reporting paediatricians. Ethics approval. All INoPSU members undertake \"active\" surveillance, in which the initiation for notification comes from the Unitrather than the clinician (\"passive\"). Active surveillanceresults in considerably higher case ascertainment thanpassive surveillance, and minimises recall bias. Themethodology varies slightly among INoPSU units to suitlocal conditions. Each month, all clinicians participating inthe scheme are sent a card listing the conditions currentlyunder surveillance. Figure 1 shows a sample card from theBPSU. Figure 1 A set of instructions for completing the card, including case definitions of the conditions listed on the card is alsocirculated. Before a new study begins, the mailing list alsoreceives a specially produced study protocol card, a casedefinition and other information about the study. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 63 How the Surveillance System Works British Paediatric Surveillance Unit Report Card NOTHING TO REPORT June 2003 [203-06] Specify in box number of cases seen CODE No [ ] HIV & AIDS Progressive Intellectual & Neurological Deterioration Congenital RubellaSuspected Fatal Adverse Drug ReactionsCongenital in the newbornLangerhans Cell HistiocytosisRespondents are asked to return the card to the surveillance unit, indicating on the card the number ofcases of each condition that they have seen during thepreceding calendar month orthat they have nothing to report. When reporting a positive case, respondents arealso asked to make a note of the condition and keeppatient details for future reference. Participants are expected to return cards even if they have nocases to report - and for this purpose there is a 'nothing to report' box on the card for them to tick. This is animportant feature of the surveillance scheme as it allows non-responders to be identified and provides an estimateof how many cases might have been missed. Remindersare sent to all participants in the scheme who do notregularly return their card. Using this system overall,compliance rates are continually monitored. Some units use a reply paid report card, and email reporting was introduced in Australia in 1997. Telephoneand facsimile reporting is requested for some studies whentimely reporting is required (e.g. to facilitate the obtaining ofbiological specimens). On receiving a case report, the surveillance unit informs the relevant investigating team who contact the reportingclinician for further information about the case, inaccordance with the agreed protocol for the particularstudy. Particular care is taken to ensure that questionnairessent to reporting clinicians are as short as possible, areclear and straightforward and are not excessive in theirdemands. The amount of patient identifiable data collectedis strictly limited, though not to an extent that wouldcompromise study aims. In two units (Canadian PaediatricSurveillance Program and the New Zealand PediatricSurveillance Unit) study questionnaires are sent directly tothe notifying clinician from the unit for some studies.The investigators subsequently report back to the surveillance unit on the outcome of each case, indicatingwhen cases have been confirmed as meeting the casedefinition and identifying duplicate case reports.Duplication of reporting is most likely to occur when thecondition requires referral to a tertiary unit, but this isencouraged, as it is better to receive duplication than missthe chance of receiving a report (Figure 2). Workload and response rates Mailing lists range in size from 40 to 2300 individuals, andinclude general and specialist paediatricians and non-paediatric specialists (paediatric surgeons anddermatologists). In Switzerland, Germany and Latvia,departmental heads rather than individual clinicians reporton behalf of their colleagues. In developing the mailing listit is important it is as inclusive (hence representative) aspossible, to maximise ascertainment. Surveillance coversthe national population younger than 16 years of age,which ranges from 0.5 million in Latvia to 12.8 million inBritain/Ireland. Currently over 8000 paediatriciansworldwide contribute monthly to the reporting ofuncommon disease in a population of over 46 million.(Table 3 overleaf) The return rate of monthly cards to units ranges from 30% to 100% and that of questionnaires for individual studiesranged from 47% to 100%. The workload for mostclinicians who participate in national surveillance of raredisease is low. In any single year a large proportion ofclinicians on the mailing list do not report a single caseand, hence, are not required to complete a questionnairerequesting further details. An evaluation of the reportingsystem undertaken by the Australian unit showed thatclinicians perceived this method of surveillance to besimple and useful. The high return rate of monthly cardsand questionnaires indicates acceptability by clinicians onthe mailing list.

The need for complimentary data sources Although desirable, full case ascertainment is not always achievable. Indeed, complete ascertainment is not alwaysrequired to fulfil the aims of some studies, especially whenthe system aims to identify cohorts that are later invited toenter randomised control trials or clinical surveys.However, awareness of potential reasons for underascertainment is important. This can be due toincompleteness of the mailing list, cases being seen bynon-paediatricians, complicated case definitions ordiagnostic difficulties. Investigators are therefore encouraged to use other complimentary case sources to optimise ascertainment,provide validation and improve the accuracy of datacollected. Within the British Isles, national surveillance of HIV and AIDS in children has, for example, ascertained data viapaediatricians, obstetricians, the national and group b streptococcal disease have alsoused laboratories to compliment their data capture. Otherdata sources have included death registers, birth defectregisters and parent support groups. Multi-ascertainment also allows for the use of capture- recapture techniques to support surveillance, allowingestimation of the true frequency of disease in a population.Using these methods it has been shown that nationalsurveillance units can ascertain between 75-95% of cases.Funding Units represent value for money as they can conduct up to16 surveillance studies simultaneously. However, there arefixed costs which include postage and salaries. Most unitsare funded by a variety of government, charitable andcommercial sources. The national health department is thepredominant funding source in New Zealand, Switzerlandand Britain and is a major contributor in Australia andCanada. In some countries, an investigator fee contributestowards infrastructure costs and ranges from EURO\u20ac110to EURO \u20ac9800 per year. As an organisation INoPSU receives no funding. Its activities are supported through the budgets of individualunits. Health Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Societysupported the first INoPSU conference and the secondreceived grants from the Wellcome Trust, Wyeth Vaccinesand the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Figure 3 INoPSU Report 1999-2002 8Table 3 Reporting mechanism Death Entries, Haemophilia Centres, etcSurveillance - The Bigger Picture HIV/AIDS in the UK Laboratory ReportsRCOG HIV in BPSU OfficeBPSU Orange CardsInvestigator Follow-up ReportingDataThe value of individual units and of INoPSU will be measured in several ways, including their ability to: raise awareness of rare paediatric disease through education of health professionals and the lay public contribute new information about rare diseases inform public health policy, research and resource allocation. Individually, the national surveillance units have already demonstrated their educational impact. This has beenachieved by the dissemination of information vianewsletters, annual reports, presentations to scientificmeetings and publications in the scientific literature (seeAppendices 1 and 2). In the APSU evaluation, the majority of clinicians said provision of diagnostic criteria and information derivedfrom studies was educationally useful and 33% said suchinformation had informed or changed their clinical practice.The increase in reports of Kawasaki disease in the BritishIsles during 1986-7 was attributed not to a true increase inincidence but to the newly established active reportingsystem of the BPSU, which increased clinicians awarenessof the diagnostic criteria for this condition. A similarphenomenon occurred in Australia when congenital andneonatal varicella became notifiable to the APSU. The development of the INoPSU website in 2000 <www.inopsu.com> (see over page) has raised the profileof the Network further, allowing professionals and thegeneral public access to information on the studies beingconducted, either individually or jointly, by Units. Many studies by units have impacted on public health by monitoring outcomes of national vaccination programs,late sequelae of vaccination, or incidence of vaccine-preventable conditions prior to the availability ofvaccination. These studies include of haemophilus b influenzae (Hib) vaccine failures, the latter being part of a collaborative Dutch/British surveillance. Units also have the ability to respond rapidly to public health emergencies. Several units have assessed theimpact of changing the route of administration of vitamin Kprophylaxis on the incidence of vitamin K deficiencybleeding in the newborn. Five units (Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Canada and Portugal) have monitored the association betweenhaemolytic uraemic syndrome and Shiga toxin-producingE.coli and comparative data was presented at the second INoPSU conference. The recent identification of variant Creutzfeld Jacob Disease in Britain has led to monitoring of the incidenceand aetiology of progressive intellectual and neurologicaldegeneration in childhood. Studies have also informed public health policy.1. Studies of HIV/AIDS and perinatal exposure to HIV have provided information on perinatal transmission of HIVand the role of screening and treatment in pregnancy. 2. Studies on toxoplasmosis and neonatal herpes simplex virus infection concluded that universal screening inpregnancy was not warranted due to insufficient casefrequency. 3. A repeat warning of the danger of using aspirin in childhood was issued after the BPSU study on Reye'ssyndrome described the continued association betweenaspirin use in children and this disorder. 4. Some studies have allowed evaluation of prevention strategies, such as pool fencing. 5. Some studies have identified potential risk factors, e.g. epilepsy for drowning or being the child of an immigrant(unvaccinated) parent not vaccinated for congenitalrubella. 6. Data from the BPSU study on chemistry set poisoning supported data which led to changes in European Unionlaw regarding the packaging of children's toys. 7. Some studies e.g. Rett Syndrome have provided insight into the molecular epidemiology of disease andphenotype-genotype correlation and have identifiedcohorts for future research, including randomisedclinical trials of novel treatment. 8. Studies have also provided information on current management strategies, e.g. use of immunoglobulin inKawasaki disease and the usefulness of a pilot neonatalscreening program for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Data from studies has also allowed validation of diagnostic criteria, documentation of short-term outcome anddescription of the clinical spectrum of disease. The Dutch,British and German units have collaborated on surveillanceof insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in the under fives,while the Dutch and British Units collaborated on a studyon Hib vaccine failures. Use of several Australian studyprotocols syndrome, congenitalrubella, acute flaccid paralysis, HIV/AIDS, infection and vitamin K deficiency bleeding) INoPSU Report 1999-2002 94 Surveillance Activitiesby New Zealand researchers allows international comparison of data. The exciting potential for simultaneous study of a single condition by all INoPSU member countries also exists. The examples above demonstrate the impact that national surveillance units and their studies have had in informingpublic health professionals and their practice. Themethodology developed by the BPSU broke new groundand has been adapted for use elsewhere. INoPSU hasbuilt on the strength of individual units and provides aunique mechanism for international collaborations. Todate in total 180 conditions have been studied (Table 4 andAppendix 3), leading to the reporting of tens of thousandsof cases. Two scientific conferences have been held byINoPSU and a third is planned in Portugal in 2004 and thenumber of countries showing interest involved in the international network continues to grow. One of the main aims of INoPSU is to encourage the development of multi-national surveillance studies so thatdirect comparisons can be made between countries withdiverse geographical and population characteristics. Forthis to be truly successful, we must develop study protocolsthat will allow universal implementation of studies andagree on appropriate case definition and questionnaires.Examples of where such data sharing and comparisonshave taken place are illustrated in Chapter 6. As INoPSUmatures its is hoped that surveillance can commence intandem using agreed protocols. This with the developmentand use of uniform diagnostic criteria and thedissemination of new knowledge will ultimately be ofbenefit to children in paediatric care. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 10 Figure 4 Website of International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units The International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INoPSU) What is INoPSU? INoPSU was established in 1998 to provide a mechanism for individual paediatric surveillance units across the world to beable to compare and share data about uncommon rare childhood diseases and paediatric surveillance. Through the use ofactive case ascertainment the units provide an efficient, effective framework for case-finding for investigators who wish tostudy uncommon rare conditions in children. All units contact each other for results, sharing of protocols, putting researchersin touch with each other and a common international report is shared as part of national reports.To learn more about theINoPSU click on the buttons below to gather information on specific areas.Acute Flaccid Paralysis Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (including Haemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn) Hirschsprung DiseaseHIV/AIDS and/or Perinatal Exposure to HIV Infants Malignancies Physical Child Abuse INoPSU Report 1999-2002Table 4 Conditions under surveillance in 2001/2 by National Paediatric Surveillance Units and studies and Neurological Deterioration (including CreutzfeldJakob disease) Renal Tubular AcidosisRetinopathy of Prematurity Thromboembolic Complaints INoPSU Report 1999-2002 in 1986-9.

It is a Unit of the RoyalAustralasian College of Physicians. The APSU currentlysurveys approximately 1042 clinicians in child health on amonthly basis, covering a child population (<15 years) of3.9 million. The current return rate for monthly report cardsis 96% and for completed questionnaires is 86%. TheAPSU introduced email reporting in 1997 and currently52% (538) of clinicians have elected to use this method ofreporting. Currently 16 studies are conducted simultaneously. Studies that commenced in 2001 include adverse effectsfrom complimentary or alternative medicine, fetal alcoholsyndrome and infants hospitalised with pertussis. Studiesthat were completed in 2001 include haemolytic uraemicsyndrome (December 2001), congenital and idiopathicnephrotic syndrome (June 2001), severe combinedimmunodeficiency syndrome (December 2001) and infantshospitalised with pertussis (December 2001). Otherstudies currently under surveillance include acute flaccidparalysis, CHARGE Association, congenitalcytomegalovirus infection, congenital rubella infection,HIV/AIDS simplex virusinfection, Rett syndrome and vitamin K deficiencybleeding. Conversion disorder and early onset eatingdisorders were approved for study in 2002. In 2001, the APSU provided clinical and diagnostic information to a number of Public Health organisations.The APSU investigators participated in a national review offetal alcohol syndrome conducted by the National ExpertAdvisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol. Investigatorsof the study on infants hospitalised with pertussiscontributed to a workshop in Sydney on Pertussis inAdolescents and Adults. Investigators on the acute flaccidparalysis study contributed data to the WHO and to anational workshop on containment of polio virus andsurveillance for poliomyelitis. Data from the primaryimmunodeficiency disorders study has been included inthe national Primary Immunodeficiency Register. Studies through the APSU have given rise to more than 108 publications including peer-reviewed articles, researchreports and published abstracts and a wide range ofpresentations (102) that have informed the general publicand the wider medical community. The APSU's mostrecent publication, \"The Australian Paediatric SurveillanceUnit Progress report\" which is currently in press in theJournal of Paediatrics and Child Health, provides asurveillance overview of the APSU and discusses studyresults to date. The APSU updates paediatricians with quarterly bulletins that include current study profiles and also provides theBulletin of Royal Australasian College of Physicians(RACP news) with regular updates. Information on theASPU may be accessed through the APSU website(http://apsu.inopsu.com). APSU personnel have beenresponsible for developing websites for INoPSU(http://www.inopsu.com) and assisted in the developmentof the BPSU website (http://bpsu.inopsu.com). The APSU currently receives its major funding from the Federal Department of Health and Aged Care. Individualstudies have been sponsored by Roche (vitamin Kdeficiency bleeding), GlaxoSmithKline (infants hospitalisedwith pertussis) and Healthways (fetal alcohol syndrome). APSU continues to maintain close links with INoPSU members. Currently Associate Professor Elizabeth Elliott isthe Convenor of INoPSU.

Itis a joint project of the Royal College of Paediatrics andChild Health, the Health Protection Agency and theInstitute of Child Health, with support from the ScottishCentre for Infection and Environmental Health and theRoyal College of Physicians of Ireland. Over the period of17 years it has facilitated surveillance of over fifty raredisorders. The BPSU currently sends its monthly orangecard to over 2100 paediatricians and specialist clinicians inthe United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, coveringa child population of nearly 13 million. Compliance inreturning the orange card and questionnaires is excellentat around 92%. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 135 Reports from the National Paediatric Surveillance UnitsIn 2001, five studies came to an end, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, group b streptococcal disease, and encephalitisin early childhood, Reye's syndrome and subacutesclerosing panencephalitis. The latter two conditions hadbeen on the card since 1986. Five studies commenced in2001, namely vitamin K deficiency bleeding, cerebralvascular disease/stroke and like illness, congenitalcytomegalovirus infection, thrombosis in childhood andinternal abdominal injury due to child abuse. Studies alsoundertaken in 2001 include HIV/AIDS, congenital rubellainfection, and progressive intellectual neurologicaldeterioration (including vCJD). In 2002 three studies commenced, fatal adverse drug reactions, severe complications of varicella infection andcongenital toxoplasmosis. Studies on invasive fungalinfections in cellhistiocytosis herpes simplex virushave been approved to commence in 2003. The Department of Health, by awarding the Unit a further 3-year grant to 2004, suitably acknowledges the work ofthe BPSU. This past year also saw the revamping of theBPSU website (http://bpsu.inopsu.com) and much thanksshould go to our colleagues in Australia who greatlyassisted. Some highlights of the Unit's work over the past fifteen years include the confirmation of an association betweenaspirin and Reye's syndrome; identification of the under-recognition of Kawasaki disease; confirmation of the linkbetween E.coli O157 and HUS in the UK. In addition the Unit has undertaken the first national surveillance ofinflammatory bowel disease; addressed the impact ofchanging management with regard to vitamin Kprophylaxis and identified concerns over the packaging oftoy chemistry sets - leading to a change in European law.Over 200 papers arising from BPSU studies have beenpublished in peer review journals and many presentationsacross the globe have been given. Perhaps of most importance, the BPSU has shown that the methodology used is a reliable and effective way ofcollecting data. This is confirmed by the replication of thissystem by other specialist groups within the UnitedKingdom and by other paediatric groupings across theworld. Contact: Mr R Lynn, Scientific Coordinator, Surveillance Program The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) started in 1996 as a joint project of the Canadian PaediatricSociety (CPS) and Health Canada's Centre for InfectiousDisease Prevention and Control. From three studies in theinaugural year to nine studies in 2001, today nearly 2350paediatricians and paediatric sub-specialists participatemonthly and achieve a 95% response rate for completingdetailed case questionnaires. The Canadian paediatricpopulation under the age of 18 years is 6.3 million. Three studies concluded in 2001 - anaphylaxis, cerebral oedema in diabetic ketoacidosis and progressiveintellectual and neurological deterioration, and two wereadded - CHARGE association/syndrome and necrotisingfasciitis. Other current studies included - acute flaccidparalysis, congenital rubella syndrome, haemolyticuraemic syndrome, hepatitis C infection, neonatal liver failure/perinatalhaemochromatosis and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Intotal 19 studies have been facilitated through the Program. For 2002, the CPSP Steering Committee approved new studies on vitamin D dependent rickets and severehyperbilirubinemia in the newborn and is consideringproposed studies on severe adverse drug reactions,autism and Prader-Willi syndrome. No surveillance programme would be complete without timely feedback to its participants. So in 2001, the CPSPconcentrated on promoting the programme and increasingcommunication to its participants and the general public. Aseries of publications followed including educationalresources, abstract and poster presentations, updates inthe CPS News, monthly highlights in the CPS Journal:Paediatrics & Child Health, culminating with the May/Juneissue dedicated to surveillance. The bilingual CPSPwebsite was updated in-house and will be up and runningearly in 2002. The CPSP also continues to participateactively in INoPSU. The CPSP is most encouraged by the recent trend of an increased level of support from CPS expert committees,national paediatric sub-speciality associations, chronic-disease family support groups, various departments withinHealth Canada and paediatric hospital researchfoundations. This is a manifestation of how the CPSP isbuilding recognition within the Canadian researchcommunity.

Encouraged by the success of the BPSU, a German adaptation of the surveillance scheme called the ESPEDwas initiated in July 1992 to cover a country which has oneof the largest child populations of any of the units (around12 million). The surveillance system differs from theoriginal British methodology in that monthly report cardsare sent to paediatric department heads rather thanindividual paediatricians. The response rates for the 452groups of clinicians have risen significantly from 55% in1992 to 98% in 2001, with the follow-up rate of completionof questionnaires in the range of 47 to 100%. A number of studies have been completed. These include Reye's syndrome, Ondine's curse (primary failure ofrespiratory regulation), Kawasaki disease, acute renalfailure and acute liver failure, haemolytic uraemicsyndrome, HSES, fatal/near fatal asthma and neonatalinfection due to fungi (candida). In 2001 the conditions under surveillance were:Diabetes mellitus under 5 years / insulin-dependent transientmyeloproliferative syndrome in neonates with Down-Syndrome, haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (vitaminK deficiency bleeding), glucose transporter defect(GLUT1).

Contact: Professor E The MPSU was established in December 1993 and surveillance began in September 1994 under the auspicesof the Malaysian Paediatric Association. It covers all ofMalaysia with a child population of 7.6 million. The unit hasadopted the classical BPSU methodology with cards beingcirculated to around 400 paediatricians and surgeons. Theinitial response rate is encouraging at 75%, having risen asthe system becomes more familiar to respondents. Initiallyfour conditions were under surveillance, paediatric HIV and INoPSU Report 1999-2002 15AIDS, neonatal meningitis, acute fulminant liver failure and death from asthma. 1998 saw the commencement ofsurveillance for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and in 1999for neonatal congenital heart disease. However since thenthere have been financial problems that led to the systembeing suspended. The management of the Unit hasrecently undergone re-organisation and we hope to re-commence surveillance soon. Contact: Dr Rowani Modi, Department of Paediatrics, The Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit started surveillance in October 1992. It has a scientific board of eight clinicians,one co-ordinating paediatrician (0.2 FTE) and secretarialassistance (0.3 FTE). It started following approval of theDutch Paediatric Society and all 932 clinically workingpaediatricians participate, whether personally orrepresented by a colleague. Every month the Unit sends \"blue cards\" with ten conditions to 410 paediatricians in general hospitals, 30cards to representatives of paediatric departments(covering 125 paediatricians) and 53 cards to contactpersons for a specific disease in the eight academichospitals (covering 397 academic paediatricians). Ourchild population under 15 years is about three million. Following the report of a case, a questionnaire is sent by post from the NSCK office. Since January 2002 about 30%of the paediatricians receive an \"electronic blue card\". Ifthey report a case electronically they automatically receivea questionnaire, which they then complete and send to theinvestigators. The response rate in 2001 was 87% (89% forcontacts in general hospitals and only 77% for contacts inacademic hospitals). Where possible full caseascertainment by other sources is pursued. To date 16 studies have been completed, ten are under surveillance and there are three studies that are underconsideration. The following studies have now been completed: sickle cell disease, thalassaemia major; postneonatal mortality in and coeliac disease. Data for studies completed in 2001 is as follows (thenumber of 2001 reports is in brackets) neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (30), diabetes mellitus(473), neonatal group B streptococcal disease (240),inflammatory bowel disease (82) and adrenogenitalsyndrome (34). Studies currently under surveillance are: acute flaccid paralysis (30), HIV/AIDS (97), neural tube defects (72),hospital admissions pertussis (182), severe complicationsof medical therapy (32), atypical mycobacterial infections(25). Studies conducted by the unit have influenced clinical practice. The surveillance unit study demonstrated thatadrenogenital syndrome (AGS) screening was 100%reliable and this has now been implemented nationwide. The study on diabetes showed that there was a strong rise in incidence, especially in children under five (this doubledin five years) and in immigrants. Further studies areurgently needed to clarify this increase. Three studies have been approved for Erb paralysis, TPN due to bowel insufficiency. Contact: Dr The NZPSU, established in 1997, is co-directed by Professor Barry Taylor and Dr Nigel Dickson. From thebeginning the NZPSU has received financial support fromthe New Zealand Ministry for Health to provide activesurveillance of acute flaccid paralysis as part of WHO'spolio eradication initiative. Covering a child population of0.83 million, each month over 180 paediatricians arecirculated with a surveillance reply-paid card or email(depending on their preference). The mean response rateand completion rate of questionnaires has remained highat 90%. Ten conditions are currently being surveyed. These flaccid paralysis, congenital idiopathic nephroticsyndrome and childhood inflammatory bowel disease. Studies on fetal alcohol syndrome, childhood diabetes (types 1 & 2) and retinopathy of prematurity (stage III) havealready been completed since the NZPSU's inception.

The German unit provided the software to run thesystem. Report cards are circulated to a willing paediatrician (n=45) at each of the 38-paediatric teaching clinics representingabout 250 hospital or clinic-based paediatricians (i.e. not tothose delivering primary care) and covering a total childpopulation of 1.3 million children. The response rate for theinitial cards was 100% in each year, and 96-98% for thecomplementary questionnaires. The eight conditions under surveillance in 2001 were: acute flaccid paralysis (15 cases), varicella/zoster(83 cases) and acute rheumatic fever (6 cases), neuraltube defects (38 cases), severe RSV infections (12 cases).The study on cystic periventricular leukomalacia wascompleted in December 1997. The study on congenitaltoxoplasmosis ended December 1998, with a total of 21confirmed cases. The study on vitamin K deficiencybleeding ended in December 2000, with a total of 19confirmed late-onset cases. In 2002 neonatal herpessimplex commenced. Contact: Zimmermann, Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Federal, Paediatric Surveillance Unit (WPSU) was set up in 1994 as a joint venture between the University ofWales Departments of Public Health Medicine (ProfessorS. Palmer) and Child Health (Professor J. Sibert). Themanagement of the system was reorganised in 1996 inconjunction with the Welsh Paediatric Society, whichsupports the system. Funding has also been obtained INoPSU Report 1999-2002 17from the Welsh Office for Research and Development and latterly from the National Assembly for Wales. The Welsh system looks at conditions considered too common for a UK study or too uncommon for a localhospital to perform. The WPSU uses the samemethodology as the BPSU with whom we have a veryclose relationship. We discuss all our new projects with theBPSU to ensure that there is no overlap and haveconsequently suspended one study on subduralhaemorrhages in the past. Monthly green cards are distributed to consultant paediatricians and senior doctors of whom there areapproximately 135. This covers a child population of650,000. The overall response rate for 2001 was 89%. When necessary, mailings can be extended to include consultant physicians and surgeons in Wales particularlywhere it is considered that older children may be affected.This has been very successful in studies involving acuteand chronic renal failure and inflammatory bowel disease.Paediatricians along the border of England and Waleshave also been very helpful where some Welsh childrenhave been treated outside the confines of Wales. Doctors in training may initiate studies under supervision and thereby encourage a culture of audit and research.We are not in a position to record responses by email atthe moment but there are many Welsh paediatricians whoare enthusiastic about such a system and this is currentlybeing considered. The following studies have been completed successfully: acute and chronic renal failure, severe child abuse, thecritically ill child, coeliac disease, inflammatory ingestion of householdproducts and haemoglobinopathy. Current studies includenewly diagnosed malignant disease, newly diagnoseddiabetes, Marfan syndrome, childhood tuberculosis,subdural haemorrhage (II) and facial palsy. Studies undertaken in 2002 include tuberculosis, subdural haemorrhage, septo optic dysplasia, splenectomy andhyposplenism and palliative care. The unit hopes to provide the Welsh National Assembly with data that can assist in the planning of Health Care forChildren in Wales, to act as a resource for thedetermination of the epidemiology of diseases in childhoodand to assist audit and research. Contact: Professor J. Sibert Chair, Mrs. H. O'Connell, Research Assistant, Department of Child Health, Academic Centre, LlandoughHospital, Penarth, Vitamin K Experience Introduction In the 1970s and early 1980s there were no official recommendations in Germany regarding the use of vitaminK as prophylaxis against haemorrhagic disease of thenewborn. The emergence of late vitamin K deficiencybleeding (VKDB) in Germany prompted recommendationsfor universal intra-muscular (IM) vitamin K prophylaxis inthe mid 1980's. The recommendation was based onevidence from national surveillance studies thatdemonstrated that late VKDB was extremely rare inchildren given 1-mg vitamin K IM but that one oral dose of vitamin given at birth did not confer similar protection rates(Table 5). National data from other countries confirmedthese findings (1). Following the Golding publication suggesting possible association of IM, vitamin K and childhood cancer therecommendations were changed to a three dose oralvitamin K prophylaxis regimen. A 3 times 1mg scheduleproved inadequate, whereas 3 x 2mg vitamin K given orallyat birth, week 2 and week 4 - 6 reduced the VKDB rateacceptably (Table 6). The rates for late VKDB, however,were still higher with oral vitamin K than with 1mg IMvitamin K prophylaxis. INoPSU Report 1999-2002 196 Comparison of international surveillance data: potential benefit Table 5: Late VKDB and vitamin K prophylaxis at birth Country Year Vitamin K Cases Rate / 100,000 95% CI Sweden 1991 Oral: 1-2 mg 16 6 3.7 - 9.8 i.m. 1 mg 0 0 0.0 - 5.6 Switzerland 1986 Oral: 1-3 mg 7 6.4 2.5 - 13.1 i.m. 1 mg 0 0 0.0 - 5.3 Japan 1992 nil 20.4 10.5 7.0 - 15 Menaquinone 4 29.5 2.8 2.0 - 3.78(2 mg: 1-3x) UK 1991 nil 9 4.4 2.0 - 8.4 Oral: 1-2 mg 7 1.5 0.6 - 3.2i.m.

Because of the rarity of late VKDB, national randomised trials are notfeasible. Since different countries used different oralvitamin K regimes, comparison of VKDB bleeding ratesascertained by identical surveillance schemes usingidentical case definitions might be possible if each unit'sstudy was considered as a cohort study. The \"exposure\"would depend on the national recommendations and\"country\" being a surrogate for the potential confounders.(Figure 4 below). Results Using this approach, the rarities of VKDB in Australia and Germany (2) were very similar when the same oral vitaminK prophylaxis was used, suggesting that such internationalcomparison gives plausible results. The followingconclusions may be drawn from these findings of nationalunits: a) oral vitamin K may prevent late VKDB b) repeatedoral doses of vitamin K are required c) the oral vitamin Kregimen may be optimised by either increasing theindividual doses or the number of doses d) a daily dose of25 mg or a weekly dose of 1 mg may be as effective as 1mg IM given at birth e) because of the extreme rarity of lateVKDB, the low numbers of children exposed in theNetherlands and in Denmark preclude statistical inferenceregarding superiority of either of these schedulescompared to the 3 times 2mg oral schedule presently usedin Germany (3). Comparison of national late VKDB rates to assess the relative effectiveness of different oral vitamin K prophylaxisregimen has to take account of the limitations listed inTable 7 . Conclusion The vitamin K experience shows that comparison of national surveillance data collected in an identical mannerusing the same case definitions may be useful to generatehypotheses on the effectiveness of different prophylaxisregimen for very rare conditions and possibly be valid toguide public health recommendations.

It is characterisedby microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia,thrombocytopenia and acute acommon pathogenesis (thrombotic microangiopathy) andare regarded as part of a disease spectrum. Method Six national paediatric units monitor HUS via active monthly surveillance for incident cases, with reporting bypaediatricians (population > 26.5 million children <15years; mean return rate for monthly cards 82%). Studyduration ranged from 9 months (Portugal) to 7.5 years(Australia) (Table 8). Results A total of 786 cases were identified in six countries at the time of this analysis (Table 8) The reported HUS rate/105children < 15y varied (Australia 0.5, Britain 0.8, NZ 0.8, Canada 1.0, Switzerland 1.1). Themajority of children were aged < 5 years (range 61% to100%). Their mean age ranged from 22 months to 59months. Overall mortality was 4% (range 0-6%). Themajority (90%) of cases followed toxin-producing E.coli and presented with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea-associated HUS had a significant seasonal (summer) peak in all countries but NZ and Portugal wherecase numbers were low. Outbreaks (clusters of > 2 casesin the same region in the same time period) occurred in UK(4), Australia (1) and Canada (1). Outbreaks wereassociated with contaminated mettwurst, well water, meatpies and with a visit to a kindy farm. The causativeorganisms showed considerable heterogeneity andgeographic (H7, H-, or not-typed) accounted 96% of in the UK, 94% in Canada,38% in NZ, 13% Australia. InAustralia E.coli O111:H- predominated and caused a larger outbreak but was not seen elsewhere. All O111:H-isolates in Australia produced Shiga toxins 1 and 2 and hadgenes encoding for eae (intimin) and enterohaemolysin. A range of non-O157 isolates O26,O55, O113, O128 and O145. Shigella dysenteriae was isolated in one Portuguese case and one British case. Atypical cases (no evidence of gastrointestinal infection) had a variety of causes, most commonly infection(pnemonia, meningitis and septicaemia) withneuraminidase-producing organisms (predominantly causes included familial HUS, STEC urinary tract infection, drugs and idiopathic. Conclusion INoPSU is a unique epidemiological tool which allows us to take a \"snap-shot\" of HUS in a variety of different settings.HUS is endemic in all countries studied and causessignificant morbidity and mortality, particularly in youngchildren. Geographic variation in the incidence, aetiologyand outcome of HUS is observed. E.coli O157 is the most common cause of HUS in countries studied but the widerange of isolates suggests the need for rapid, reliablediagnostic tests for non-O157 serotypes. Atypical HUS hasa variety of causes and with a greater likelihood ormorbidity and mortality and further analysis of these datawill provide new information on outcome Elizabeth Elliott (APSU) On behalf of Richard Lynn and Bob Adak (BPSU), Paul Sockett and Francois Proulx (CPSP), (Switzerland), Mario Coelho(PPSU), Diane Redmond (APSU); members of theAustralian, British, Canadian, New Zealand, Swiss andPortuguese Paediatric Surveillance Units / HUS studygroups.

Using data provided by five participating paediatric surveillance units (PSUs), the rubella immunizationstrategies, incidence and epidemiology of CRS werecompared in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerlandand the United Kingdom. All PSUs used the same CRScase definition. Results While rubella vaccine has been universally available since the early 1970s, program strategies targeting differentgroups, ranging from schoolgirls to adolescents andsusceptible postpartum women, have varied over theyears. By the late 1980s, all of these countries included inthis study had a universal first dose of rubella vaccine atbetween 12 and 24 months of age, and universal seconddose at between 4 and 7 years by the late 1990s. These immunisation strategies proved to be extremely successful. In the five countries included in this study, thenumber of reported cases of CRS decreased from a totalof 69 cases in 1993 to two in 2001 (Table 9). In fact, four ofthe PSUs (Australia, Canada, New Zealand andSwitzerland) have not reported any CRS cases for a yearor more. However, CRS is still occurring in most countries,particularly in the immigrant population, and in womentravelling, early in their pregnancy, to countries withincomplete or absent rubella immunisation programs. Immunisation strategies have been extremely successful in decreasing CRS incidence. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland have not reported any CRS cases for one or more years. CRS is still occurring and is a vaccine preventable disease. Surveillance showed evidence of missed rubella and CRS prevention opportunities, as maternal rubella immunisationwas absent or unknown in more than a third (38.9%) ofCRS with data. In Canada, 60% of the CRS cases haddocumentation of prenatal rubella susceptibility (some onprevious pregnancy) and few cases represented womenexperiencing primary vaccine failure. Immunisation strategies have been extremely successful in decreasing rates of CRS Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland have no reported CRS for one year or more CRS does still occur but is vaccine preventableSurveillance showed evidence of missed opportunities for prevention of rubella and CRS. Maternal rubellaimmunisation had not been given or details were unknownin more than a third (39%) of mothers of babies with CRS.In Canada, 60% of mothers of CRS cases haddocumented prenatal rubella susceptibility, some in theprevious pregnancy. Few cases of CRS representedprimary vaccine failure in the mother. Conclusion All five participating PSUs now have a two-dose universal rubella immunisation strategy. CRS, though rare andvaccine-preventable, still occurs. Standing orders forimmunisation of rubella susceptible women in theimmediate postpartum period may prevent missedopportunities for vaccination in non-immune women.Maintenance of MMR vaccine uptake at >85% is essentialto decrease the risk of rubella infection and CRS.

Does not include 2 CRS children reported only to the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (one in 1996 and one in 2000).Progressive Intellectual & Neurological Deterioration (PIND) - The Canadianand British Perspectives Introduction In 1997, the BPSU commenced surveillance of PIND, with an aim to determining its incidence in the paediatricpopulation, evaluating and classifying cases by differentdiagnoses, and identifying and investigating possiblevariant CJD (vCJD) presenting as PIND. In 1999, sinceCanada was both free of bovine spongiformencephalopathy and was also doing CJD surveillance, theCPSP was invited to serve as a sentinel country to the UKfor PIND surveillance from July 1999 to June 2001. Both countries used the same PIND case definition and had an expert advisory panel reviewing cases. The BPSUpanel included seven paediatric neurologists, while itsCPSP counterpart consisted of three paediatricneurologists, a medical geneticist and a paediatricneuropathologist. Results Overall, results were comparable, considering the differences in population (UK 59.5 million versus Canada30.5 million), and duration of studies (UK five years,Canada two years). One iatrogenic case of CJD case was reported to the CPSP. The patient underwent a duraplasty at three yearsof age for removal of an occipital hematoma, presented tenyears later and deteriorated rapidly. Diagnosis wasconfirmed at autopsy. The BPSU did not have any CJDcases. On the other hand, the BPSU received six vCJD reports - four definite and two probable - presenting similarly below16 years of age. All had bilateral pulvinar increased signalintensity on their T2MRI and were methionine homozygousat codon 129 of the PrP gene. Autopsies confirmed thediagnoses. No vCJD cases were reported in Canada. Interestingly, both units confirmed many different aetiologies for PIND (BPSU 90 and CPSP 20), and asimilar range of conditions were documented in the twocountries. While the absence of case reports of Huntington disease and gangliosidosis to the CPSP may be due to someunder-reporting, it may also be related to the successfulgangliosidosis prenatal screening of the at-risk populationestablished in the 1970s. Both units were faced with patients - BPSU 42 and CPSP 9 - in whom no diagnosis was confirmed even afterexhaustive investigations and review by the expert panel.Conclusion The PIND collaboration has shown that results are comparable between Canada and UK. While vCJD wasreported in the UK, Canada had none. Both countriesfound that a variety of different difficult diagnosespresented as PIND. Even after complete investigations,the cause of PIND remains unknown in some children. D. Grenier, J. Doherty, A.
