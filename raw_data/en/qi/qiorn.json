You don't hear about many cases of measles or whooping cough any more.Sample Response We don't see as many cases of those diseases as we used to, but they are still around and these diseases can make your child very sick. And if your child does get sick because she didn't get her shots, doctor bills can be expensive and you could lose money if you have to be o from work. Further, your children will miss classro om time because they are not allowed to attend school unlessthey have gotten their vaccines.What You May Hear From ParentsTalking with Parents about Vaccines Strategies for Community Health Workers Immunizations are necessary to help keep our communities healthy and safe and from diseases. Parents are sometimes concerned about vaccines.Because you have a trusted relationship with the communities you serve, yo u are uniquely qualied to support parents in understanding the value of immunizations. Communications strategies are essential to relieveparental concerns, dispel myths about vaccines, and keep communities protected from vaccine-preventable disease.Vaccines cause au/g415sm.Sample Response Of course we understand that your child's health is your top priority. There has never been a link shown between vaccines and autism - in fact, alldocuments that have madethat claim have been disproven. Vaccines are safe, but the diseases that vaccinesprevent can cause serious complications and sometimes death - they are still a threat and vaccination is your best chance to stay healthy. There are too many shots,too closetogether.Sample Response Multiple medical professionals came together to design a schedule that will provide protection as early as possible.They have studied this for a long time and there isn't any evidence that your otherwise healthy child's immune system will be damaged by getting more than one vaccine at a time. Your baby, even as a newborn,can handle many shots at once.Vaccines cause side eects.Sample Response Most babies don't have side eects from vaccines. In the rare instance that they do, side eects usually aren't serious. Somevaccines may cause low fever, a rash, or soreness at the spot where the shot was given. These reactions are signs that the immune system is working like it's supposed to and learning to ght o infections. There is a U.S. Vaccine Safety System and their job is to monitor fo r possible side eects, even after a vaccine is licensed. The U.S. has the safest vaccine supply in history. IOCI 18-33 Why does my baby get the same vaccine more than once?Sample Response All childhood vaccines are given in two or more doses. Your baby needs more thanone dose because each onebuilds on the last one to develop your baby's immunity.Immunity is her body'sprotection from disease. Asecond or third dose is neededto fully protect her. These doses work best if they'regiven on schedule. We don't trust the health care system.Sample Response That is understandable. But the same list of vaccines and the schedule for getting them is required for all children inthis country. There is nodierence in the vaccines youreceive and those of children from other communities.
