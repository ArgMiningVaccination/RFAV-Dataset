Thousands of acclaimed physicians.Dr. Hiroyoshi Takata, Cardiac Surgery Pioneer, Retires Hiroyoshi Takata, M.D., who helped to shape Hartford Hospital's cardiac surgery program, retired on Oct. 1. Born in Kobe, Japan, he trained at Kobe University and completed an intern - ship at a nearby U.S. Naval Hospital. His program coordinator, a New Haven physician, encouraged Dr. Takata to train in Connecticut. After interning at the Hospital of Saint Raphael, he ar - rived at Hartford Hospital in 1966. Hartford Hospital was then estab - lishing its national reputation as a cen - ter for open-heart surgery. By 1984, when Henry Low, M.D., performed the state's first successful heart transplant, Dr. Takata was at his side. He also performed open-heart surgery on Dr. Low. Dr. Takata and his family established a small clinic in Kobe in 1980, which has become the 350-bed Takata Kamitani Hospital. Over the years, he has trav - eled regularly to Japan to support the hospital and to help train physicians. During nearly a half-century of service to Hartford Hospital, Dr. Takata touched many lives. Richard and Jane Lublin have made a generous lead gift to help establish the Hiroyoshi Takata, MD Fund for Cardiovascular Surgery.

New Family Health Center in South Windsor A new Hartford Hospital Family Health Center located at 1559 Sullivan Ave. in South Windsor will open in October. The LEED-certified satellite office will provide urgent care and a full spectrum of clinical services and wellness education to the South Windsor community. Many advanced health care treatments and technologies will be provided, from urgent care to primary care and rehabilitative services. A high-tech education center will offer support groups and more. Correction Dr. Alexander R. Gaudio is practicing full-time with Eye Disease Consultants LLC, which has offices at 85 Seymour Street (Medical Office Building), Suite 522, Hartford and at 1043 Farmington Ave., West Hartford. His practice status was given incorrectly in the 2011 Hartford Hospital Community Benefit Report. 2Beauty may be only skin deep, but nothing tops a flawless face. Younger-looking skin can now be yours in the safety of the Hartford Specialists medical spa (MedSpa) in the Farmington Valley. A medical office building in Farmington provides a private, convenient setting for laser hair removal and medical skin care treatments for facial rejuvenation, anti- aging and skin care. Eyebrow tattoos and lash thickening are also available to enhance the look of eyes. Medical Spa The MedSpa offers laser skin tightening, anti-aging treatments and skin revitalizing services for women and men. Medical professionals can improve frown lines in the brow with Botox injections, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002. Microdermabrasion is a noninvasive procedure that whisks away dead cells as it exfoliates the top layer of skin. A variety of facial peels can help smooth acne scars, erase wrinkles or improve sun-damaged skin. One skin- revitalizing facial is designed especially for men. The HydraFacial treatment removes dead skin cells and extracts impurities while simultaneously bathing the new skin with hydrating and moisturizing serum. The treatment is soothing, refreshing, non-invasive and non- irritating, providing instant results with no discomfort or downtime. The HydraFacial treatment improves the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, oily or acne-prone skin, hyperpigmentation and brown spots. It is safe for all skin tones and types, including rosacea. The highly trained aesthetician is expert in facials and mineral-based makeup. \"A woman can go back to work looking great after spending her lunch hour having micro - dermabrasion,\" says aesthetician Connie Santilli. \"We also offer convenient evening appointments.\" Laser Light In the past, the only remedies for unwanted hair were plucking, shaving, waxing or chemical depilatories. Now the laser rids you of unwanted hair with only minimal discomfort.The MedSpa's powerful, yet nearly painless GentleMAX Laser is FDA-approved. The machine's highly focused beam selectively targets hair follicles and heats them with laser energy, while simultaneously delivering a cooling burst of icy spray. Nurses perform skin tightening and treatments to lessen the appearance of unsightly veins. The laser can eradicate spider veins, as well as remove hair. Blotchy dark areas on the skin or sun-relat - ed age spots often disappear\u2014al - though it may take several sessions, depending on the treatment and the condition of your skin. Clearance from your derma - tologist\u2014to make sure an unsightly lesion isn't cancerous or precancer - ous\u2014is required before any laser procedure to remove it. In addition to hair removal and age spot re - moval, the laser can also be used to tighten loose or sagging skin. Plastic Surgery \"Cosmetic surgery goes beyond laser treatments and chemical peels,\" says Alan Babigian, M.D., a plastic and reconstructive surgeon with Hartford Specialists. \"While laser skin-tightening is less invasive, our group of five board-certified surgeons can perform surgical face - lifts or brow lifts for longer-lasting results.\" Injectable fillers firm facial wrinkles and lessen folds around the nose and mouth. \"Botox injections relax the muscles and smooth superficial lines in the upper face,\" says Dr. Babigian. \"We also give Juv\u00e9derm gel injections to temporarily improve laugh lines and give the face a younger appearance.\" Surgery is performed at both Hartford Hospital and the West Hartford Surgery Center in Blue Back Square.

A New Look at a MedSpa 3Colorectal Cancer SurgeryRobotics on the Cutting Edge The risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with age.The colon, or large intestine, is the body's waste pipe. Six feet long and three inches in diameter, the colon bends and twists its way across the abdomen, eventually curving down to the rectum. Cancers of the colon and rectum, col - lectively known as \"colorectal\" cancer, are tumors that develop in the colon or rectum (end of the colon). Colorectal cancer strikes an estimated 140,000 Americans and kills more than 50,000 annually. It's the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States, exceeded only by lung cancer. Five-year survival rates are high when colorectal cancer is caught early, but drop sharply if the cancer is widespread. More than a million colorectal cancer survivors are alive today in the United States, thanks to early diagnosis and lifesaving surgery. Most colorectal cancers develop from tiny polyps that only have the poten - tial to become cancerous over time. More than 80 percent of colorectal tumors develop from so-called adenomatous polyps, gland-like growths that begin in the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine. Although benign polyps can easily be snipped off during a routine colonoscopy, a tumor can turn deadly when it invades deeper tissues or spreads to distant organs. Colorectal Cancer In its early stages, colorectal cancer has no symptoms. The American Cancer Society recommends that people with no known risk factors be screened for colorectal cancer with colonoscopy or other methods begin - ning at age 50. Those with a family history of the disease should be screened earlier. \"The risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with age,\" says Jeffry Nestler, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Division of Gastroenterology. \"Routine screening, beginning at age 50 and continuing at regular intervals at least until age 75, has been proven to save lives. Research suggests that African Americans may be at especially high risk and should start screening at an even earlier age.\" \"Anyone with rectal bleeding or abdominal pain should see a physician right away,\" says colorectal surgeon William V. Sardella, M.D., of Hartford Specialists. \"Changes in bowel habits or unexplained weight loss may be symptoms of colorectal cancer.\" Colorectal cancer metastasizes to the liver in a significant number of Americans diagnosed with the disease every year. In some cases, liver tumors can be removed surgically. In other cases, interventional radiologists use minimally invasive procedures to deliver a tumor-busting blast of energy directly to the cancer. \"Hartford Hospital performs a high volume of colorectal cancer surger - ies,\" says colorectal surgeon Paul V. Vignati, M.D., of Hartford Specialists. \"We work closely with gastroenterologists and oncologists when patients need chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Our collaborative and multidisciplinary approach assures the best outcomes.\" Smaller scars, reduced pain, minimal blood loss and shorter recovery times are the benefits of minimally invasive surgery at Hartford Hospital. Now, with the addition of robotics, surgeons are bringing their expertise to a wide range of colorectal cancers, in cooperation with a multidisciplinary gastroin - testinal (GI) team. \"Our colorectal surgeons and surgical oncologists do a great job caring for colorectal cancer patients,\" says Andrew L. Salner, M.D., director of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"They work with an incredible comprehensive colorectal cancer team to ensure that each patient has an individually tailored plan of care. Other team members include the GI nurse navigator, genetic counselor, medical and radiation oncologists, GI imaging radiologists, GI 5pathologists, research nurse, social workers and other GI specialists, all of whom work closely together to coordinate the best care for each colorectal cancer patient.\" Clues in the Genome A national genome-wide study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), found similar genetic changes in tumors of both the colon and rectum. Researchers identified 32 different cancer-causing mutations that dam -age chromosomes and disrupt vital signaling pathways. Faulty genes alter protein synthesis and cause DNA repair to go awry. \"Hartford Hospital is now part of TCGA, in view of our expertise in collecting tissue samples for genomic analysis,\" says Dr. Salner. \"We are the only TCGA participant in Connecticut.\" The bur - geoning science of genomics is driv - ing research into treatments tailored to a cancer patient's personal genetic blueprint. Pharmaceutical firms are studying genes, enzymes and growth factor receptors, seeking novel drugs aimed at colorectal cancer targets. Lynch syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome that strikes men and women of all ethnicities, dra - matically raises the risk of develop - ing cancer at a young age. \"Hartford Hospital pathologists examine all surgically removed colon and rectal tumors to screen for the disorder,\" says Dr. Sardella. \"Families with Lynch syndrome are at high risk for Colorectal surgeons, Dr. William Sardella (left) and Dr. Paul Vignati 6digestive tract cancers, particularly of the colon and rectum.\" Even a small change in a single gene can dramatically raise the risk of developing colorectal cancer. If the Lynch syndrome mutation is found, the patient's relatives are tested to see whether they also carry the genetic defect. People with the gene mutation can reduce the risk of developing or dying from cancer by having earlier and more frequent cancer screenings and colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer survivors can help prevent a recurrence by avoid - ing red meat, fatty foods and rich desserts after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Research showed that patients who consumed a high-fat diet after colorectal cancer treatment were three times more likely to have their cancer return than those who ate mostly fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables. Aspirin has been shown to benefit colorectal cancer patients whose tumors express an enzyme called COX-2. Those patients were about 30 percent less likely to die from cancer than their peers if they regularly took aspirin after their diagnosis. Hartford Hospital physicians are currently participating in a clinical trial to see whether the cholesterol- lowering statin drug rosuvastatin (Crestor) can prevent a recurrence of early colorectal cancer. Colorectal Cancer Surgery In the late 1990s, Hartford Hospital surgeons pioneered the hand-assisted laparoscopic colecto - my (colon tumor removal) technique now used by physicians around the world. The hospital leads the region in minimally invasive colorectal cancer surgery. Minimally invasive techniques al - low physicians to perform life-saving surgery with faster recovery and less risk of blood loss than conventional \"open\" methods. Hartford Hospital's commitment to innovation provides the most sophisticated medical tech - nology available anywhere. High- tech tools offer advanced techniques for 3D imaging, performing a biopsy or removing a colorectal tumor. Whenever possible, surgeons avoid lengthy incisions in the abdominal wall, instead making small slits in the skin for a camera and laparoscopic instruments. Sliding a fiberoptic scope through an opening the size of a buttonhole is far less disruptive to delicate tissues than a long incision made by a surgeon's scalpel. \"Over the years, colorectal sur - geons at Hartford Hospital have performed more than 3,500 laparo - scopic colorectal procedures,\" says Dr. Sardella, who is participating in a pi - lot study of colorectal robotics with Dr. Vignati and Christine M. Bartus, M.D., of the Hospital of Central Connecticut. Although minimally invasive tech - niques have revolutionized nearly every surgical specialty, colorectal surgeons at Hartford Specialists have only recently begun to use robotics for select patients. Eventually all of Hartford Hospital's colorectal sur - geons will be trained on the da Vinci robot. The robot combines high-defini - tion vision with streamlined surgical instruments to take surgery beyond the limits of conventional proce - dures. By overcoming the challenges of traditional open and laparoscopic surgery, colorectal surgeons can oper - ate through only a few small incisions with more precision, dexterity and control than ever before. The robot's versatility gives the surgeons the ability to rotate instru - ments even more freely than the human hand. \"The articulated robotic arms are particularly useful when working in a tight space,\" adds Dr. Vignati. \"We can manipulate instru - ments using \"endowrists\" that twist and turn through the full range of motion.\" The robot may be a valuable surgi - cal tool for treating inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, as well as colorectal cancer. \"The robot is at its best in a focused area,\" adds Dr. Sardella. \"The robot has the advantage of remaining perfectly steady during complex and repetitive procedures, such as repairing pelvic floor prolapses.\" Both Drs. Sardella and Vignati have performed thousands of proce -dures in their more than 20 years as colorectal surgeons. \"We're uniquely positioned to compare robotics to laparoscopy,\" says Dr. Sardella. \"We believe the surgical robot's tools and attachments can offer potential advantages over laparoscopy when working within the pelvis.\" Putting the Robot to the Test Robotic-assisted techniques have revolutionized surgical control and precision. The multiple instrument arms of the spider-like robot and a camera are inserted through the navel and three small incisions in the patient's abdomen. Seated at a remote console a short distance from the patient, the surgeon studies high-definition 3D images in a viewfinder while cutting and sealing blood vessels with robotic precision. Three robotic arms snip and stitch, in tandem with the move - ments of his hands, as his feet oper - ate bright yellow and blue foot pedals. The oversize video screen linked to the camera in the patient's abdomen provides close-up, real-time anatomi - cal views. Colorectal surgeons remove tumors lodged in the muscular wall of the intestine or slice out a cancer - ous segment of the colon, seamlessly reattaching the ends. \"These can be very long operations,\" says Dr. Vignati. \"The robot offers the ergonomic ben - efit of allowing us to sit rather than stand for hours.\" Hartford Hospital surgeons have pioneered many innovative robotic procedures since 2003, when Hartford Hospital became the first medical center in Connecticut to acquire the revolutionary da Vinci robot. Today, Hartford Hospital is among the top 10 robotic surgery centers in the coun - try and the largest in New England. Hartford Hospital physicians have performed more than 5,000 robotic cases using the hospital's seven surgical robots.

Soldiers and sailors lined up to receive multiple-dose vaccines, got tattoos in back alleys or shared razors in barracks. Baby boomers who decades ago used in - travenous drugs or snorted cocaine through plastic straws never knew they were infected with hepatitis C\u2014and the liver-destroying virus is still lurking silently in their cells. Hepatitis is a family of viruses. The most common types of hepatitis are A, B and C. Notorious for closing restaurants, hepatitis A (infectious hepa - titis) is spread by contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B and C are spread through bodily fluids, sexual contact or from mother to child. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B, but not C. Depending on the type, hepatitis can go away or become chronic. About 75 to 85 percent of people who become infected with the Hepatitis C virus develop a lifelong infection. Since hepatitis C can linger in the body for years without symptoms, people are shocked to learn they have the disease. Most contracted the virus in the 1970s or 1980s. Everyone born between 1945 and 1965 should have a one-time blood test, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Now that treatment is available, the screening guidelines are expected to identify more than 800,000 infections and save 120,000 lives nationwide. Baby boomers account for more than 2 million of the 3.2 million Americans infected with hepatitis C. Left untreated, the infection can lead to cirrhosis (scarring), liver failure and liver cancer. Hepatitis C kills more than 15,000 Americans each year as a result of liver damage or cancer. \"Some patients engaged in risky behavior in their party days,\" says hepa - tologist Colin T. Swales, M.D. \"The disease is transmitted mainly by blood exposure, but 10 percent of patients have no idea how they were infected. They may simply have shared a toothbrush with someone. The good news is that unlike many viral infections, hepatitis C can be cured.\" Last spring, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several new antiviral drugs. \"The newer drugs target the virus cell,\" explains hepa - tologist Michael M. Einstein, M.D. \"In combination with weekly injections of immune-boosting interferon, the new medications can clear the body of hepatitis C virus altogether.\" Hartford Hospital's Comprehensive Liver Center offers multidisciplinary treatment of patients with hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Armed with new medications\u2014and with new classes of drugs in the pipeline\u2014liver dis - ease specialists can now cure patients who have previously failed treatment. \"We've seen a revolution in hepatitis C treatment,\" says Dr. Rolland Dickson, M.D., the Liver Center's medical director. \"It's an extremely excit - ing time to be working in the field of hepatology. The new drugs are amaz - ing, but our comprehensive center also offers a dedicated team of surgeons, interventional radiologists and other specialists to manage people who have already progressed to cirrhosis or liver cancer.\" Cirrhosis is a chronic disease that overwhelms the liver's ability to heal and regenerate. Once the liver begins to fail, a transplant may be the only option. \"Cirrhosis causes degenerative and irreversible changes in the liver,\" explains hepatologist Jonathan Israel, M.D. \"Early treatment can often slow its progression, but fibrous tissue permanently scars the liver.\" \"I worried for years about facing a terrible death from liver failure,\" says Debbie (not her real name), a Navy veteran who is now 53. \"Now my whole life has changed. After a year of treatment, every trace of virus is gone.\" For more information, visit our website at: www.harthosp.org/Liver/Hepatitis/. 9PHYSICIAN PROFILE Elizabeth A. Fasy, M.D. Elizabeth A. Fasy, M.D. is an endocrinologist at the West Hartford-South Main office of the Hartford Medical Group (HMG). Endocrinology is the branch of medicine that treats disorders that affect hormones and the metabo - lism, among many other functions. Dr. Fasy, who is board-certified in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, is a member of the Endocrine Society and a fellow of the American Association for Clinical Endocrinologists. She earned her undergradu - ate degree, magna cum laude, at the College of the Holy Cross and her medical degree from the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Mass., in 1994. She completed her residency in Internal Medicine at the University of North Carolina in 1997, and her fellowship in Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of Virginia in 2000. Dr. Fasy was an Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine from 2000-2005 and the Emory University School of Medicine from 2006-2007. A native of Rhode Island, she enjoys running with her dog and cycling with her husband and two young children. Dr. Fasy was included on the \"Best Doctors\" list in the January 2012 issue of Hartford magazine and has been named to the national \"Best Doctors\" list since 2007. Has your doctor told you to drop a few pounds? Excess fat quietly ravages the insulin-producing cells of a small but powerful organ lying just behind the stomach. Those extra pounds you're lugging around\u2014espe - cially in your belly\u2014may be destroy - ing your pancreas. When your pancreas stops pro - ducing insulin, the body loses its abil - ity to use the glucose in food for ener - gy. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood, but can be diagnosed at any age. Type 2 diabetes, often linked to excess weight, and a family history of diabetes, can develop at any age. In type 2, the pancreas produces insulin but the body becomes resistant to its effects. As insulin resistance builds and outpaces the pancreas, fasting blood sugar (glucose) levels can soar. Rising blood sugar increases cardiovascular disease risk. The \"triple threat\"\u2014high blood pressure, high blood sugar and obesity\u2014doubles your risk of a heart attack or stroke. \"My doctor told me I was prediabetic last year,\" says Nancy (not her real name), who recently attended a series of Diabetes LifeCare educa - tion classes. \"Now I have type 2 diabetes. Since my diagnosis, I have lost 25 pounds. I count the carbohydrates in every meal and take medication. Whenever I stick my finger to test my blood sugar, I think, 'Why didn't I just lose weight sooner?'\" \"Crash dieting simply isn't sustainable,\" says endocrinologist Elisabeth Fasy, M.D. \"The only way to lose weight and keep it off is to cut back on desserts, sugary beverages, cheese and meat\u2014while eating more fruits and vegetables. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people initially lost weight on 'no carb' diets, but slow, steady weight loss was safer and more lasting.\" The good news for people at risk for diabetes is that losing weight prevents the life-altering disease. Diabetes afflicts an estimated 26 million people in the United States, including seven million who haven't yet been diagnosed with the disorder. Dramatic weight loss is possible with lifestyle changes. \"Avoid packaged foods and 'energy' drinks,\" says Dr. Fasy. \"An apple has a lot more vitamins and fiber than a granola bar. The healthy, plant-based fat in a slice of avocado or a couple of tablespoons of nuts can often make you feel less hungry. Even if you have diabetes, you can still eat fruit in moderation.\" For more information, visit www.hartfordmedicalgroup.com.Fighting Fat: The Best Way to Stave Off Diabetes 10Schizophrenia is a dark and disorienting illness that ruins social relation - ships. People suffering from the psychiatric disorder find it hard to com - municate while battling mental confusion and crippling cognitive challenges. Similarly, c hildren with autism have a brain-based developmental disorder that skews their perception of social cues and sensory information. Traditionally considered separate diagnoses, both schizophrenia and an au - tism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve core social and communication deficits. Not much is known, however, about exactly how each neuro developmental disorder disrupts the brain or how much they may overlap. \"Social interactions are essential for normal human brain development and function,\" explains Michal Assaf, M.D., director of the Autism and Functional Mapping Laboratory at the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Schizo phrenia and ASD are thought of as separate entities based on clinical symptoms, age of onset and the course of the illness,\" says Dr. Assaf, who re - cently received a $2.9 million research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study social cognition and brain function in schizo - phrenia and ASD. \"Recent evidence sug - gests a potential overlap.\" To assess the social brain in schizo - phrenia and ASD, Dr. Assaf uses a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a sophis - ticated type of electroencephalography (EEG) called \"event-related potential\" (ERP) to measure brain activity during cognitive processing. The IOL research - ers employ a multimodal approach and non-invasive high-tech techniques to compare clinical and functional symp - toms common to both schizophrenia and ASD. Lack of empathy and an inability to interpret social signals are common to both disorders, although direct comparisons are scarce. \"Schizophrenia is a psychotic illness that typically appears in early adulthood,\" says Dr. Assaf. \"In contrast, children with ASD show core deficits in social and communication skills\u2014typically without psychotic symptoms\u2014before age three.\" Both cognitive neuroscience and advanced neuroimaging methods can be used to map the social brain, including theory of mind (the ability to under - stand other people's thoughts and beliefs), social judgment and empathy for others. The study will directly compare a matched group of schizophrenia and ASD patients using a battery of social assessment tools and several neuro- imaging tasks that assess different aspects of social cognition. \"If successful, the current study will support the emerging shift in measur - ing and classifying schizophrenia, ASD and other psychiatric disorders,\" says Dr. Assaf. \"Looking beyond clinical symptoms to the biological and genetic basis of these apparently different illnesses may someday lead to new treatments.\" The IOL is seeking adults age 18 to 30 with schizophrenia or ASD for a study of neural activation of brain regions in psychiatric disorders that affect social behavior.

News & Breakthroughs in the Doctor's Office Alzheimer's Advances Although drug compa - nies continue to search for genes linked to Alzheimer's disease, more than 95 percent of people with the disease have no known genetic risk factors. Environment may be a fac- tor. Alzheimer's disease oc- curs more often in African- Americans than West Africans of similar age in Nigeria, say Columbia University researchers. MomMe App Hartford Hospital recently launched its all-in-one ma - ternity application (\"app\") for moms-to-be and cur - rent parents. The free app for smartphones or tablets can be downloaded from Apple iTunes or Google Play. You can use the app to calculate fertile phases on a calendar or keep up with feeding schedules, baby changing times and doctor appointments.Bleeding Stroke Heavy drinkers are at risk for a brain hemorrhage at a much younger age than their peers, reports the journal Neurology . French researchers found that those who have four or more alcoholic drinks a day experience bleeding in the brain at an average age of 60, or 14 years ear - lier than those who aren't heavy drinkers.Frying Fears Pan-frying red meat may raise the risk of prostate cancer by up to 40 percent, warns a study of 2,000 men in the journal Carcinogenesis. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the Cancer Prevention Institute of California linked pan- fried hamburgers to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Pan-frying is riskier than grilling or broiling.Treating the Urinary Tract 12 Urinary incontinence is a relatively common problem that afflicts an estimated 20 million Americans. Although patients are often embarrassed to discuss their symptoms with their doctors, treatments are evolving as a steadily aging population confronts the problem. About a quarter of women of childbearing age experi - ence urinary incontinence, and the number of sufferers rises sharply when estrogen levels drop at menopause. Being overweight not only raises the risk for heart disease and diabetes, but also for urinary incontinence. Some women leak a few drops of urine when they cough (stress incontinence), while others feel a strong, sudden urge to urinate just before losing a large amount of urine (urge incontinence). The lives of women who experi - ence both problems are often ruled by frequent bathroom trips and pad changes.Urinary incontinence is not unique to women. Some men develop urinary incontinence after undergoing a prostatectomy to remove a cancerous prostate gland. \"Incontinence after prostatectomy is fairly common and very bothersome, but it can be treated,\" says urolo - gist Richard T. Kershen, M.D., of Hartford Specialists, a fellowship-trained expert in voiding dysfunction, fe - male urology and incontinence. \"When you suffer from incontinence, it can affect your life in profound ways. We can help patients reclaim their vitality by eliminating the leakage problem.\" Simple behavioral modification and pelvic floor exer - cises help many patients. Office-based therapies include injection of Botox into the bladder for relief of urge incon - tinence or a gel-based \"bulking agent\" into the urethra for relief of stress incontinence. Dr. Kershen may treat incontinence by surgically implanting an FDA-approved, programmable device to stimulate the nerves that control the bladder and pelvic floor. The treatment can help patients with bladder-emp - tying difficulties or urinary retention (the feeling that you need to go, but can't). \"My hope is that patients will come to see me even if a previous medical therapy or prior operation has failed to correct the problem,\" says Dr. Kershen. \"My patients include people who have had complications from prior surgery, as well as those with neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and spinal cord injuries.\" Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in the state to routinely use the hospital's surgical robot for uro - logic surgery. The da Vinci robot can be used for pelvic reconstructive surgery to correct problems that lead to incontinence. A Single Shot for Shingles After lying dormant in the nerves for decades, a childhood infection can reappear with a vengeance. If you've ever had chickenpox, you're at risk for shingles. The painful skin rash is caused by the varicella- zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. If age or illness weakens your immune system, the dor - mant virus can overwhelm your body's defenses and cause shingles. Ninety-eight percent of American adults have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember having the dis - ease. Years later, shingles may suddenly erupt, usually along one nerve on one side of the body. An estimated one million Americans develop shingles each year. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Zostavax vaccine for individuals 60 and older. In 2011, the FDA extended the approval to those between 50 and 59. Shingles can strike at any age, but tends to occur after age 50. \"Patients who have been vaccinated are only half as likely to develop shingles,\" says Frances Gurtman, M.D., medical director of the West Hartford-South Main office of Hartford Medical Group. \"Only one of my patients who had the vaccine later developed shingles\u2014and it was milder than we usually see.\" The outbreak usually begins with pain, burning, tingling, or itching, along with flu-like symptoms. At the same time or a few days later, small, red, fluid- filled blisters appear, usually on the back, chest or abdomen. \"Since shingles can be very painful and debilitat - ing, everyone over 60 should consider getting the vaccine,\" adds Dr. Gurtman. \"The primary exceptions are people with compromised immune systems due to illness or medication.\" See your primary care physician promptly if you experience numbness, tingling, itching and pain, which often precede the telltale blistering rash. Antiviral medications such as valcyclovir (Valtrex) can shorten the duration of an outbreak and mini - mize later pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 out of every 3 people in the United States will develop shingles during their lifetime. Most people only experience a single bout of shingles, but it is possible to develop an outbreak a second or even a third time. \"If you think you have shingles, call your primary care physician and ask to be seen the same day,\" says Dr. Gurtman. \"Shingles can be treated with anti - viral medications, but they work best if given within the first 72 hours of the start of symptoms. If you're over 60, ask your provider if the Zostavax vaccine is appropriate for you.\" 13Hartford Hospital's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center becomes a reality.Is Your Epilepsy Under Control? Hartford Hospital's ambitious plan to create the region's premier epilepsy program is well underway. The new center, slated to open in November, will give epilepsy pa - tients access to coordinated, patient- centered diagnostic, medical and surgical care. Epilepsy often strikes the tempo - ral lobe of the brain. When abnormal electrical activity suddenly erupts, bursts of energy jam the neural pathways and overwhelm the brain. Seizures can disrupt \"eloquent\" re - gions of the brain that control vital functions such as speech, movement and even consciousness. Epilepsy is the fourth most com - mon neurological disorder in the United States, exceeded only by Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Up to 30 percent of all children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder develop epilepsy. An estimated 60 million people worldwide suffer from the condition, with approximately 70,000 new cases of epilepsy diag - nosed each year in the United States. About three million Americans suffer from the chronic neurological disorder. The Comprehensive Epilepsy Center offers new high-tech tools to diagnose and treat the esti - mated 18,000 central and northern Connecticut residents\u2014plus another 11,000 from the southern and north - west regions of the state\u2014who have been diagnosed with epilepsy. Nearly 9,700 of them have \"medically refrac- tory epilepsy,\" which means they don't have complete seizure control despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs. The percentage of patients with refractory epilepsy has not decreased despite the arrival of nine new FDA-approved antiepileptic drugs since 1993. In addition to inpatient medical care and surgery, the Center will offer inpatient video-EEG to measure brain wave activity. The Institute of Living's Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center pinpoints regions of abnormal brain activity with functional MRI (fMRI), which can be combined with highly sophisticated PET imaging, brain scans, angiograms, speech and language evaluation and neuropsycho - logical testing. EEG monitoring shows whether abnormal electrical activity is gener - alized across the brain\u2014common in people whose seizures begin in child - hood\u2014or just in one area of the brain. Patients with refractory epilepsy who aren't candidates for surgery may ben - efit from a surgically implanted device called a vagus nerve stimulator. Although an implantable neuro- pacemaker is still in clinical trials, new devices available at Hartford Hospital include subdural electrodes and depth electrodes. Nationally, only about one percent of patients with medically refractory epilepsy are referred to an epilepsy center for treatment. Hartford Hospital wants to improve those odds. Epilepsy patients treated at Hartford Hospital can now take advantage of advanced brain surgery that can \"cure\" the disorder when it's caused by a lesion or brain tumor. By 2013, the hospital expects to achieve Level-IV status, the highest designa - tion given by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC). 14We welcome some of the newest members of our Hartford Hospital Medical Staff.
