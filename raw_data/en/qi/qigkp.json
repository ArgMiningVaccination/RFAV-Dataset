With a special blend just for Kids, one for healthy Adults, and a super strong phenol blend to blast out all kinds of bugs, this is the pack to boost your immune system. It includes 3 oils: 1. Immune Blend Formulated for: Ages 10 and up. This essential oil blend was formulated to support and strengthen the immune system. Use as a preventative during the \"sick\" season to aid and boost your body's immune system. If you do get sick this is your daily use oil to strengthen and boost your immune system to fight off the bug. 2. Kids Immune Blend Formulated for: Ages 12 months old up to 9 to 10 years old. This essential oil blend was formulated to support and strengthen the immune system of kids, pregnant women, and the ailing elderly. Because you cannot use the same oils on children that you use on healthy adults, this oil was formulated specifically for their little, underdeveloped bodies. The oils in this blend work better with their little bodies and do not hurt them in any way. Use this oil on children from ages 12 months to around 9 or 10 years old, pregnant women, and the ailing elderly. Use as a preventative during the \"sick\" season to aid and boost their body's immune system. If they do get sick this is your daily use oil to strengthen and boost their immune system to fight off the bug. 3. Mega Immune Blend Formulated for: Ages 9 to 10 years old and up. This essential oil blend was formulated to be the atomic bomb of essential oils. It is a perfect blend of all the super powerful high phenol oils, and it is a very HOT blend. This blend was formulated to be a strong immune stimulant for when you are really sick or when you are facing very serious short term illness. It can support and strengthen the immune system by giving it a huge boost to have the ability to knock out invading bugs. This is the strongest blend of essential oils in aromatherapy. Use this when you're serious about knocking out bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. This blend is to be used by healthy teens and adults, it is NOT for children under 9 years of age, pregnant women, or for the ailing elderly. For these people use either Immune blend or Kids Immune blend. We also have a BABY IMMUNE for babies from birth to 1 year of age.
