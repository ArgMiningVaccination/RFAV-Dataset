Steven G. Pochop, Jr. ANA member , and ANA Ethics Advisory Board Members Dr. Nelda God frey, Stacy Smith, Dr. Ian Wolfe, and Epiphany Cruz -Maxwell. Adopted By: ANA Board of Directors This position statement supersedes the Position Statement on Immunizations, July 21, 2015. I. PURPOSE Historically, the American Nurses Association (ANA) has strongly supported immunizations to protect the public from highly communicable and deadly disea ses such as measles, mumps, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza (ANA, 2019; ANA, 2015; ANA, 2006), and has supported mandatory vaccination policies for registered nurses and health care workers under certain circumstances. Considering several recent and s ignificant measles outbreaks in the United States, as well as the global pandemic of COVID -19, ANA has reviewed our current position statement for clarity and intent and examined present best practices and recommendations from the broader health care commu nity. II. STATEMENT OF ANA POSITION Effective protection of the public health mandates that all individuals receive immunizations against vaccine -preventable diseases according to the best and most current evidence outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advi sory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). All health care personnel (HCP), including registered nurses (RNs), should be vaccinated according to current recommendations for immunization of HCP by the CDC and Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC). ANA also believes that it is imperative for everyone to receive immunizations for vaccine -preventable diseases as vaccines are critical to infectious disease prevention and control . Moreover, nurses have a professional and ethical obligation to model the same health care standards they recommend to their patients. ANA does not support any exemptions from immunization other than for medical contraindications. All requests for medic al exemption from vaccination should be accompanied by documentation from the appropriate authority to support the request. 8515 Georgia Avenue, Suite 400 Silver Spring, MD 20910 www.nursingworld.org Page | 2 Immunizations Recertification of the medical exemption is an annual obligation. Individuals exempted from vaccination may be required to adopt mea sures or practices in the workplace to reduce the chance of disease transmission. Employers should offer reasonable accommodations in such circumstances. ANA does not endorse philosophical or religious exemptions. As nov el diseases emerge, such as COVID -19, ANA supports ongoing research and development of safe, easily accessed vaccinations for these public health threats. Vaccinations must be available and accessible to all to ensure public health and safety. III. BACKGROUND In 2015, ANA revised our immunization and vaccine policy statement to address the culture of vaccines that were prevalent at that time (ANA, 2015). The contemporary evolving climate and growth in vaccination hesitancy and noncompliance coupled w ith outbreaks of once eradicated and vaccine -preventable illnesses emphatically indicate a narrower approach is necessary for public safety. The Public The reduction or elimination of vaccine -preventable diseases is one of the greatest public health achievements of the United States (CDC, 2011). Current evidence an d research illustrate that immunizations are essential to the primary prevention of disease from infancy throughout adulthood. According to the current recommendations of the CDC and ACIP, effective vaccination programs for children and adults promote and maintain the health of the populace, and include obtaining the annual seasonal influenza immunization, another vaccine -preventable disease. Between 2010 and 2018, the number of deaths annually from influenza is estimated to be from 12,000 to 79,000, with m any more people hospitalized due to the severity of symptoms (CDC, 2018b). Registered Nurses , Ethics , and COVID -19 Vaccines The COVID -19 pandemic has been defined by the constant and rapid stream of changing information, often affecting how nurses practice . Fluctuations in information may lead to caution and hesitancy. Some nurses may find it difficult to balance personal concerns with obligations to colleagues and patients. When faced with uncertainty about choosing a course of action, nurses are encourage d to turn to the Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (ANA, 2015) for guidance. Provision 1 of the Code of Ethics for Nurses affirms that nurses have a role in promoting health, welfare, and safety and serving the common good. Provision 1.3 directs nurses to function as leaders who actively participate in assuring responsible and appr opriate use of interventions to optimize the health and well -being of those in their care. This includes acting to minimize unwarranted, unwanted, or unnecessary medical treatment and patient suffering. Participating in COVID -19 vaccination provides nurses the opportunity to model optimization of health. Provision 2 of the Code states that the nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, as an individual or community. Participating in COVID -19 vaccination protects the patient and can 8515 Georgia Avenue, Suite 400 Silver Spring, MD 20910 www.nursingworld.org Page | 3 Immunizations contribute to herd immunity. Vaccination will help protect individual patients and contribute to lowering and preventing community transmission and morbidity. These provisional statements from the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses would support an ethical obligation to participa te in and promote COVID -19 vaccination programs. The Code in Provision 1.4 also supports the right to self -determination. Patients and nurses have the right to make individual choices. However, individual choices may conflict with organizational policie s, professional guidelines, and impact the health and safety of others. Consequences of these choices may affect the individual nurse's ability to practice. Nurses are in a unique role to assist patients with these decisions and offer truthful and non-coercive information. Nurses have an obligation to counsel and inform patients based on the nurse's obligation to be informed and educated (Provision 7). Provision 1.4 also recognizes that individuals are members of their communities. There may be situations in which one's choices may conflict with the health and welfare of the community. Further, Provision 2.2 invites nurses to examine conflicts that arise between their own personal and professional values, the values and interests of others, and the value s and interests of patients themselves. Nurses are called to address these conflicts in a way that ensures patient safety and promotes a patient's best interest while preserving professional integrity and supporting interprofessional collaboration. In addition to the duty to patients, nurses also have an obligation to themselves. Provisions 5.1 and 5.2 outline the duty nurses have to promote their own health and safety. The provision states that nurses should model the same health promotion measures they teach and research, obtain health care when needed, and avoid taking unnecessary risks to their own health or safety in the course of their own personal or professional activities. When considering the COVID -19 vaccination, nurses must remember their e thical duties towards their patients and the common good. It is highly recommended that nurses fully vaccinate against COVID -19 to model public health maintenance standards, foster patient trust in the medical community, and affirm the proven clinical safe ty and effectiveness of the COVID -19 vaccinations. Immunization of HCP Many states do not have legislation requiring vaccination of HCP. Therefore, the responsibility falls upon hospitals and other health care facilities to develop and enforce their own p olicies. Evidence of vaccination against highly communicable diseases such as mumps, measles, and rubella, as well as an annual influenza immunization, is often a prerequisite of employment in health care facilities. The most successful vaccination program is the voluntary influenza vaccination programs for HCP's, established in 1984 upon the CDC's recommendation for all health care workers to receive the influenza vaccination. However, immunization rates amongst health care workers achieved only 78 percent coverage during the most recent 2017 -2018 flu season and signal that improvement is needed (CDC, 2018a). In sharp contrast, facilities that have adopted mandatory influenza vaccination policies and programs have been highly successful (Wang, Jing, & Bocch ini, 2017). ). Such adoption rates emphasize the need for mandatory 8515 Georgia Avenue, Suite 400 Silver Spring, MD 20910 www.nursingworld.org Page | 4 Immunizations immunization programs where voluntary programs fail in order to promote and maintain the health of the public. All individuals may apply for a medically contraindicated vaccination exempti on that meets standard criteria. Formal documentation from an appropriate authority such as a health care provider must accompany an exemption request that details the condition that compels the request. This medical exemption needs to be recertified annua lly. If an RN or other health care worker is medically exempt from vaccination, the health care facility will have the discretion to determine what steps, if any, unvaccinated RNs or health care workers must take to reduce the risk of transmitting disease to patients, while complying with all local, state and national regulations. Refusal by RNs or other health care workers to: (a) participate in a mandatory vaccination program, or (b) if medically exempted from vaccination, to follow steps to reduce the ri sk of disease transmission, may result in disciplinary action by the employer and jeopardizes patient and employee health . IV. RESPONSIBILITIES OF REGISTERED NURSES AND EMPLOYERS Successful immunization policies and programs require open communication and transparency between RNs and employers. RNs are responsible for providing patients with evidence -based information to support and promote optimal health and wellness, and for leading by example by participating in health -oriented activiti es such as immunizations to the greatest possible extent. \"Public trust will be damaged if [nurses] appear to suggest vaccines for others but avoid them for themselves\" (Galanakis, Jansen, & Lopalco, 2013). Nurses must advocate for, educate, and advise pat ients to adhere to vaccination schedules recommended by the CDC and ACIP, explaining their need and public health implications. Patients' fears and questions regarding immunizations should be acknowledged, and then answered with evidence -based information. Nurses must emphasize that recommended immunizations are safe and necessary. Please see sections V and VI below for resources to assist with this messaging. Employers of registered nurses are responsible for establishing a culture of safety and implementi ng policies that improve the health of their workers. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommend that immunizations be provided in the work setting at no cost to HCP to ensure access to vaccinations, and that workplace immunization programs include appropriate education and training of staff (IDSA, SHEA, & PIDS, 2013). If registered nurses are represented by a union or collective bargaining unit, the employer should work with a designated representative to clarify or resolve any issues that may arise associated with implementation of a mandatory vaccination policy or program.
