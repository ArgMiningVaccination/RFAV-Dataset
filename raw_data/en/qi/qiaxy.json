Unfortunately, the number of geriatricians in the U.S. has not been keeping up with the demand for their services. Our center is the first in the world to offer Academic Integrative Geriatrics. Why is this so special? There are many excellent geriatricians, however, very few are capable of treating many chronic medical conditions without or with the minimal use of medications. Our geriatricians prescribe specific diets, supplements, herbals, exercise, and modalities such as acupuncture, massage, hypnosis and many others. Through years of experience we have found that often we are able to decrease or eliminate the dependency on medications and thus substantially minimize the risk of side effects. Believing strongly in the principle that innate healing capacity is present in every human being, despite their age or comorbidities, we carefully form an individualized plan that involves our support staff and a large team of clinical providers. The result is a \"medical home\" where we address your needs carefully, emphasizing more natural approaches to disease management and health. Our affiliation with the GW University Geriatric and Palliative Care Medicine Division and Fellowship keeps us true to the evidence-based principles that we honor. We play a key educational role within the GWU and across the U.S. Dr. Kogan has been asked to serve as a founding board member on the American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM). Our clinic is one of the few clinical training sites for the world's first Integrative Geriatric Fellowship Program. Please note that at present we only accept Medicare, but we will consider accepting all insurance plans for a small annual fee. The additional fee will cover extra time that comprehensive integrative consultations and primary care visits require. With Medicare patients, we allocate 60 minutes for a first visit and 15-30 minutes for follow-up appointments. While supplements, medical foods, diets, and modalities such as hypnosis and acupuncture are covered by only a few insurance plans, many other fees can be covered by your FLEX or HSA and are tax-deductible. We will provide you with all needed paperwork. Our integrative geriatricians [, Kogan, Mikhail, MD](https://gwcim.com/wp22/people/mikhail-kogan-md/), have been "}
