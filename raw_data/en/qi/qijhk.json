Export Citation Metadata [Show full item record](/handle/2144/45851?show=full) Permanent Linkhttps://hdl.handle.net/2144/45851 Abstract Replanted teeth are too often associated with external root resorption. Two of the three types of resorption, surface replacement and inflammatory resorption leading to ankyloses, are responsible for most replantation failures. The terms were introduced by Andreasen & Harting-Hansen in 1966. If cause and effect are examined closely, it becomes apparent that many, if not most, of the recommended procedures are aimed at preservation and reattachment of a normal Periodontal Ligament and cementum. This study initially intended to prove that an additional physiologic factor, such as megadose of ascorbic acid, added to the list of mechanical attentions brought to the tooth upon replantation, would deter root resorption. Such was not the case for this experiment. In both animal and human study of this research, surface replacement and inflammatory resorption were observed.
