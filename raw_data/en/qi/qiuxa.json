Microwave ovens, for example, just do not make food as good as the oven and the use of plastics in them is concerning. Instant coffee is another modern convenience designed to give us more time. However, the price we pay is with taste. Boxed hair color is also convenient, but our hair lacks depth when we use it. Fast food restaurants come with poor nutritional content. We pay the price with added weight and other potential health issues. More recently, there has been debate over the modern convenience of the flu vaccination and the potential harmful side effects. Receiving a flu vaccination comes with a price. However, before we go there, let's look at why this modern convenience is so readily available. Walk into just about any pharmacy and you will undoubtedly see signs advertising that you can receive a flu shot there. Chances are there is also an added perk involved, too. Perks like a \"free\" flu shot, a discount to shop that day in the store after you receive your vaccination, or a voucher for some future savings. The reality is that nothing is really free. Someone needs to pay. While it may not be you initially, you can be assured that your insurance company will be billed and the pharmacy will receive the reimbursement for that flu shot. Pharmacies also receive additional revenue if you choose to take advantage of any other discounts offered on purchases made. That's a big win for that company! Now, you might be thinking, \"But I win, because now I am protected against getting the flu this season!\" But, are you really? At best, the flu vaccination is 50% effective because no one knows which strain of the flu will arrive that year. Receiving the shot means we are also introducing a known neurotoxin into our system as well, thimerosal. The good news is that we do not need this modern day convenience to protect ourselves from getting the flu. Our body has the built-in ability to protect through the nervous system. This is the hub that controls all the other systems in our body. If not functioning at 100%, then neither will the other systems that it controls. Regular chiropractic care keeps the nervous system functioning at 100% with spinal adjustments. These adjustments prevent the nerves along the spine from becoming irritated from daily wear and tear on our body. Irritation causes inflammation which in turn affects the adjoining vertebrae and its alignment. Compromised nerves impacts the nervous system's ability to communicate with the other systems of our body. Give your body the best defense you can this flu season. Arm yourself with all the benefits of chiropractic care. "}
