Nearly 5,000 families of autistic children have filed claims for compensation from a federal vaccine injury fund, with many parents believing a mercury compound (thimerosal) found in vaccines is at least partly responsible for their childrens autism. Cases began being heard today in US court. Below is a list of articles I've indexed, spanned over seven years, that mention the term thimerosal within content. The information may be helpful to those seeking to get some history on the topic of vaccinations, thimerosal, and autism. October 31, 2006 [Autism, mercury poisoning, thimerosal and the flu vaccine](https://planetc1.com/search/autism-mercury-poisoning-thimerosal-and-the-flu-vaccine.html) After increased pressure from consumers, parents of autistic children groups, and government elected officials, vaccine manufacturers and the FDA have collectively agreed to begin removing thimerosal from childhood vaccines. Problem is, up until these recent recommendations, the flu vaccine was not considered a childhood vaccine. November 2, 2006 [Mercury in your child's flu vaccine](https://planetc1.com/search/mercury-in-your-child-s-flu-vaccine.html) California government health officials today agreed to override a statewide ban on a mercury based compound (thimerosal) so that more kids under the age of three could get flu shots even though recent research suggests the shots may not be safe or effective. March 20, 2006 [Tuna, or not tuna? That is the question](https://planetc1.com/search/tuna-or-not-tuna-that-is-the-question.html) Curiously, only ten years before that time, drug companies began adding mercury to vaccines using a compound called thimerosal as a preservative. Remarkably, the safety of this practice was based on a single study done by one researcher in the 1930s in which a handful of terminally-ill patients was given mercury-containing thimerosal. All the patients died, but hey, weren't they dying already? This stunning example of meticulous scientific inquiry was all it took for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the drug companies to enthusiastically promote mercury as \"safe and effective\" for close to 70 years. February 9, 2004 [Study Links Vaccine to Autism](https://planetc1.com/search/study-links-vaccine-to-autism.html) In tests on human brain cells, researchers found two natural chemicals-one compound that stimulates cell growth and also dopamine, which transmits nerve signals-are key to a process in the brain called methylation. Methylation helps DNA work properly and is crucial to the normal development of the brain. The team found thimerosal, ethanol and mercury all interfere with methylation. What's more, thimerosal not only did so in amounts typically found after a child is vaccinated, but even at doses 100 times lower than a child would receive after a single shot with a thimerosal-containing vaccine. \"It was by far the most potent,\" says investigator Dr. Richard Deth, a professor of pharmacology at Northeastern University in Boston. \"Some would consider (thimerosal) a smoking gun,\" he said. \"I think it is.\" June 21, 2002 [The Status of Research into Vaccine Safety and Autism](https://planetc1.com/search/the-status-of-research-into-vaccine-safety-and-autism.html) It has been parents who have formed non-profit organizations to raise research dollars to conduct the research that the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH have neglected to do. We have heard from many of these parents in the past, Elizabeth Birt, Rick Rollens, Shelley Reynolds, and Jeanna Smith, to name just a few. Each of these parents had healthy babies who became autistic after vaccination. July 23, 2001 [Mercury and Vaccines](https://planetc1.com/search/mercury-and-vaccines.html) According to the article, thimerosal has been used in vaccines and other medical products since the 1930s. (but vaccines were not given with such frequency as today) And although mercury has long been known to be a neurotoxin, both vaccine makers and some federal officials have argued that it is harmless in the doses found in vaccines. May 8, 2001 [Vaccine Safety Concerns Are Up](https://planetc1.com/search/vaccine-safety-concerns-are-up.html) The article suggests that \"skeptical vaccination information on the Internet\" has also fed fears and misconceptions about the effectiveness of vaccination. Yet those involved in the survey, reported that issues related to the roto-virus vaccine (which was pulled from the market) and concerns over vaccine additives such as thimerosal have played a role in their increased concern regarding vaccine safety. According to the article, just over one-third of all physicians surveyed said the roto-virus vaccine recall had increased their concern. July 14, 2000 [Mercury in Vaccines to be Reduced](https://planetc1.com/search/mercury-in-vaccines-to-be-reduced.html) According to the article, \"Federal health officials and the doctor groups have said the slight risk of neuro-developmental effects from the mercury compound in thimerosal is outweighed by the value of childhood vaccinations.\" May 19, 2000 [Autism and Mercury Relationship](https://planetc1.com/search/autism-and-mercury-relationship.html) In July of 1999 when the FDA first released preliminary statements that the amount of mercury injected into infants and toddlers through childhood immunizations exceeded government safety levels, a few parents, including myself, began to investigate whether mercury toxicity might be a contributing factor in our children's autism. Our review of the available medical literature, summarized in our report, \"Autism, a Unique Type of Mercury Poisoning\", found that the symptoms and abnormalities which characterize autism are identical to those found in past cases of mercury poisoning. planetc1.com-news @ 6:32 "}
