I also use homeopathic medicine and Reiki/Energy Medicine as appropriate to facilitate healing. My patients appreciate that my focus for them is ongoing total-body healing. One of the fundamental tenets of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine is the belief that treatment is directed to balance Yin and Yang and supplement the Qi, Blood, and Organs. True Acupuncture treatment pays less attention to the specific disease or condition and more to the individual and his or her unique presentation and constitution. An accurate statement is that \"modern medicine treats the disease and Acupuncture treats the individual.\" This being said, we do recognize that in contemporary society patients and their doctors must categorize their disorders into recognizable disease names. Therefore the following list is a partial index of diseases or conditions that are common in our practice and that we have found to respond very well to Acupuncture therapy.
