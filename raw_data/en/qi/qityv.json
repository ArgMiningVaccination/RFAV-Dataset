PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in pre -filled syringe Hexaxim is a whitish, cloudy suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Hexaxim is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers from six weeks of age against diphtheria, teta nus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Medicinal Product no longer authorised3 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Primary vaccination: The primary vaccination consists of 2 doses (with an interval of at least 8 weeks) or 3 doses (with an interval of at least 4 weeks) in accordanc e with the official recommendations. All vaccination schedules including the WHO Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age can be used whether or not a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth; - Hexaxim can be used for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. - Hexaxim can be used for a mixed hexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine immunisation schedule in accordance with official recommendations. Booster vaccination: After a 2 -dose primary vaccination with Hexaxim, a booster dose must be given. After a 3 -dose primary vaccination with Hexaxim, a booster dose should be given. Booster doses should be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and in accordance with the official recommendations. As a minimum, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered. In addition: In the absence of hepatitis B vaccination at birth, it is necessary to give a hepatitis B vaccine booster dose. Hexaxim can be considered for the booster. When a hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, after a 3 -dose primary vaccination, Hexaxim or a pentavalent DTaP- IPV/Hib vaccine can be administered for the booster. Hexaxim may be used as a booster in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with another hexavalent vaccine or a pentavalent DTaP -IPV/Hib vaccine associated with a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. WHO-EPI schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks): After a WHO -EPI schedule, a booster dose should be given - As a minimum, a booster dose of polio vaccine should be given - In absence of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, a hepatitis B vaccine booster must be given - Hexaxim can be considered for the booster Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Hexaxim in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No data are available. No data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Method of administration Hexaxim should be administered intramuscularly. The recommended injection sites are generally the antero -lateral aspect of the upper thigh in infants and toddlers and the deltoid muscle in older children. 4.3 Contraindications Medicinal Product no longer authorised4 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to any pertussis vaccine, or after previous administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components or constituents. Generally vaccination must be postponed in cases of moderate or severe febrile and/or acute disease. The presence of a minor infection and/or low- grade fever does not constitute a contraindication. The vaccination with Hexaxim is contraindicated if the infant has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B, polio and Hib vaccines. Uncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy: Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with these conditions until the treatment regi men has been established, the condition has stabilized and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hexaxim will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other diphtheriae , poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. Hexaxim will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognized hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. Hexaxim does not protect against infectious diseases caused by other types of Haemophilus influenzae or against meningitis of other origins. Prior to immunisation Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the person's medical history (in particular previous vaccinations and possible adverse events). In persons who have a history of serious or severe reaction within 48 hours of a previous injection with a vaccine containing similar components, administration of Hexaxim vaccine must be carefully considered. Before the injection of any biological medicinal product, the person responsible for administration must take all precautions known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions. As each dose may contain undetectable traces of glutaraldehyde, formal dehyde, neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, caution should be exercised when the vaccine is administered to subjects with hypersensitivity to these substances. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should alway s be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis- containing vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered: Temperature of 40\u00b0C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause; Collapse or shock -like state (hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination; Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; Medicinal Product no longer authorised5 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Hexaxim. Vaccinees with a history of febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination. If Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome or brachial neuritis has occurred following receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks, such as w hether or not the primary immunization schedule has been completed. Vaccination is usually justified for infants whose primary immunization schedules are incomplete (i.e. fewer than three doses have been received). The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited. Special populations Immunogenicity data are available for 105 preterm infants. These data support the use of Hexaxim in preterm infants. As expected in preterm infants, lower immune response has been observed for some antigens, when indirectly compared to term infants, although seroprotective levels have been achieved (see section 5.1). No safety data were collected in preterm infants (born 37 weeks of gestation) in clinical trials. The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of r espiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. Immune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism. In chronic renal failure s ubjects, an impaired hepatitis B response is observed and administration of additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered according to the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti -HBsAg). Precautions for use Do not ad minister by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection. As with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration. Interference with laboratory testing Since the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be observed within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm Hib infection during this period. Hexaxim contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium Hexaxim contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. Medicinal Product no longer authorised6 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Hexaxim contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \"potassium -free\" and \"sodium -free\". Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Hexaxim can be administered simultaneously with a pneumococcal meningococcal conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine, as no clinically relevant interference in the antibody res ponse to each of the antigens have been shown. There may be a clinically relevant interference in the antibody response of Hexaxim and a varicella vaccine and these vaccines should not be administered at the same time. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate injection sites. Hexaxim must not be mixed with any other vaccines or other parenterally administered medicinal products. No significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been reported except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4). Interference with laboratory testing : see section 4.4. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Not applicable. This vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child -bearing age. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not relevant. 4.8 Undesirable effects a- Summary of the safety profile In clinical studies in indivi duals who received Hexaxim, the most frequently reported reactions include injection -site pain, irritability, crying, and injection- site erythema. Slightly higher solicited reactogenicity was observed after the first dose compared to subsequent doses. The safety of Hexaxim in children over 24 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials. b- Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions; Very common (1/10) Common (1/100 to <1/10) Uncommon <1/100) Rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) Very rare (<1/10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from available data) Medicinal Product no longer authorised7 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Table 1: Adverse Reactions from clinical trials and post marketing surveillance System Organ Class Frequency Adverse Events Immune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity reaction Rare Anaphylactic reaction* Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common Anorexia (decreased appetite) Nervous system disorders Very common Crying, somnolence Common Abnormal crying (prolonged crying) Rare Convulsions with or without fever* Very rare Hypotonic reactions or hypotonic - hyporesponsive episodes (HHE) Gastrointestinal disorders Very common Vomiting Common Diarrhoea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rare Rash General disorders and administration site conditions Very common Injection -site pain, injection -site erythema, injection -site -site nodule Pyrexia (body temperature 39.6\u00b0C) Rare Extensive limb swelling * Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. See section c c- Description of selected adverse reactions Extensive limb swelling: Large injection -site reactions (>50 mm), including extensive limb swelling from the injection site beyond one or both joints, have been reported in children. These reactions start within 24 -72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site and resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on the number of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing vaccine, with a greater risk following the 4th dose. d- Potent ial adverse events (i.e. adverse events which have been reported with other vaccines containing one or more of the components or constituents of Hexaxim and not directly with Hexaxim) Nervous system disorders - Brachial neuritis and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrom e have been reported after administration of a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine - Peripheral neuropathy (polyradiculoneuritis, facial paralysis), optic neuritis, central nervous system demyelination (multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administra tion of a hepatitis B antigen containing vaccine - Encephalopathy/encephalitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Apnoea in very premature infants ( 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Oedematous reaction affecting one or both lower limbs may occur following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If this reaction occurs, it is mainly after primary injections and within the first few hours following vaccination. Associated symptoms may include Medicinal Product no longer authorised8 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 cyanosis, redness, transient purpura and severe crying. All events should resolve spontaneously without sequel within 24 hours. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions af ter authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. 4.9 Overdose Not documented. 5.

The immune Medicinal Product no longer authorised11 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 responses to PRP, PT and FHA antigens one month after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were similar to those observed one month after a 2-dose priming given at 3 and 5 months of age: - anti-PRP titers 0.15 \u00b5g/ml were observed in 73.0% of individuals, - anti-PT vaccine response in 97.9% of individuals, - anti-FHA vaccine r esponse in 98.6% of individuals. Persistence of immune response Studies on long- term persistence of vaccine induced antibodies following varying infant / toddler primary series and following Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth or not have shown maintenanc e of levels above the recognized protective levels or antibody thresholds for the vaccine antigens (see Table 3). In addition, immunity against the hepatitis B component of the vaccine has been shown to persist up to 9 years of age after a primary series consisting of one dose of Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth followed by a 3- dose infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age without a toddler booster where 49.3% of vaccinees had antibodies 10 mIU/ml with geometric mean concentrations at 13.3 (95% CI: 8.82 - 20.0) mIU/ml. Immune memory against Hepatitis B had been demonstrated by the presence of an anamnestic response to a challenge Hepatitis B vaccination at the age of 9 years in 93% of vaccinees with development of geometric mean concentrations at 3692 (95% CI: 1886 - 7225) longer authorised12 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Table 3: Seroprotection rates a at the age of 4.5 years old after vaccination with Hexa xim Antibody Thresholds Primary 6-10-14 weeks and booster at 15- 18 months Primary 2-4- 6 months and booster at 12-24 months Without hepatitis B at birth With hepatitis B at birth With hepatitis B at birth N=173b N=103b N=220c % 99.5 Anti-Polio type 2 ( 8 (1/dilution)) NAd NAd 100 Anti-Polio type 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)) NAd NAd 100 Anti-PRP ( 0.15 \u00b5g/ml) 98.8 100 100 N = Number of individuals analysed (per protocol set) a: Generally accepted surrogates (PT, FHA) or correlates of protection (other components) b: 6, 10, 14 weeks with and without hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Republic of South Africa) c: 2, 4, 6 months with hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Colombia) d: Due to an OPV National Immunisation Days in the country, Polio results have not been analysed e: 8 EU/ml corresponds to 4 LLOQ (Lower Quantification in enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay ELISA).

One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.01 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.01 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 89.8% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 79.4% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 0.15 \u00b5 g/mL). One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were Medicinal Product no longer authorised13 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 90.6% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 1 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 98.7% and 100% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens respectively. One month after the booster dos e 98.8% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis antibody concentrations were increased by 13-fold after primary vaccination and by 6- to 14- fold after the booster dose. Immune responses to Hexaxim in infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy Immune responses to Hexaxim antigens in term (119) and preterm (90) infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy (between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation) were evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 (preterm infants) or 15 (term infants) months of age. One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.01 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.01 IU/mL) poliovirus types 1 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 97.3% of subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus 2 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 88.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 0.15 \u00b5g/mL). One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 93.9% of subjects were 10 IU/mL) and seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 1 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 99.4% and 100% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens respectively. One m onth after the booster dose 99.4% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis antibody concentrations were increased by 5- to 9 -fold after primary vaccination and by 8- to 19 -fold after the booster dose. Efficacy and effectiveness in protecting against pertussis Vaccine efficacy of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexaxim against the most severe WHO- defined typical pertussis ( 21 days of paroxysmal cough) is documented in a randomized double-blind study among infants with a 3 dose primary series using a DTaP vaccine in a highly endemic country (Senegal). The need for a toddler booster dose was seen in this study. The long term capability of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexaxim to reduce pertussis incidence and control pertussis disease in the childhood has been demonstrated in a 10- year national pertussis surveillance on pertussis disease in Sweden with the pentavalent DTaP- IPV/Hib vaccine using a 3, 5, 12 months schedule. Results of long term follow- up demonstrated a dramatic reduction of the pertussis incidence following the second dose regardless of the vaccine used. Effectiveness in protecting against Hib invasive disease The vaccine effectiveness against Hib invasive disease of DTaP and Hib combination vaccines (pentavalent and hexavalent including vaccines containing the Hib antigen from Hexaxim) has been demonstrated in Germany via an extensive (over five years follow- up period) post -marketing survei llance study. The vaccine effectiveness was of 96.7% for the full primary series, and 98.5% for booster dose (irrespective of priming). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not appli cable.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Hexaxim is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers from six weeks of age against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Medicinal Product no longer authorised17 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Primary vaccination: The primary vaccination schedule consists of 2 doses (with an interval of at least 8 weeks) or 3 doses (with an interval of at least 4 weeks) in accordance with the official recommendations. All vaccination schedules including the WHO Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age can be used whether or not a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth ; - Hexaxim can be used for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. - Hexaxim can be used for a mixed hexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine immunisation schedule in accordance with official recommendations. Booster vaccination: After a 2 -dose primary vaccination with Hexaxim, a booster dose must be given. After a 3 -dose primary vaccination with Hexaxim, a booster dose should be given. Booster doses should be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and in accordance with the official recommendations. As a minimu m, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered. In addition: In the absence of hepatitis B vaccination at birth, it is necessary to give a hepatitis B vaccine booster dose. Hexaxim can be considered for the booster. When a hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, after a 3-dose primary vaccination, Hexaxim or a pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine can be administered for the booster. Hexaxim may be used as a booster in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with another hexavalent vaccine or a pentavalent DTaP -IPV/Hib vaccine associated with a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. WHO-EPI schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks): After a WHO-EPI schedule, a booster dose should be given - As a minimum, a booster dose of polio vaccine should be given - In absence of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, a hepatitis B vaccine booster must be given - Hexaxim can be considered for the booster Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Hexaxim in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No data are available. No data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Method of administration Hexaxim should be administered intramuscularly. The recommended injection sites are generally the antero -lateral aspect of the upper thigh in infants and toddlers and the deltoid muscle in older children. 4.3 Contraindications Medicinal Product no longer authorised18 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to any pertussis vaccine, or after previous administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components or constituents. Generally vaccination must be postponed in cases of moderate or severe febrile and/or acute disease. The presence of a minor infection and/or low- grade fever does not constitute a contraindication. The vaccination with Hexaxim is contraindicated if the infant has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B, polio and Hib vaccines. Uncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy: Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with these conditions until the treatment regi men has been established, the condition has stabilized and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hexaxim will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetan virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. Hexaxim will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognized hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. Hexaxim does not protect against infectious diseases caused by other types of Haemophilus influenzae or against m eningitis of other origins. Prior to i mmunization Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the person's medical history (in particular previous vaccinations and possible adverse events). In persons who have a history of serious or severe reaction within 48 hours of a previous injection with a vaccine containing similar components, administration of Hexaxim vaccine must be carefully considered. Before the injection of any biological medicinal product, the person responsible for administration must take all precautions known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions. As each dose may contain undetectable traces of glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, caution should be exercised when the vaccine i s administered to subjects with hypersensitivity to these substances. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis- containing vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered: Temperature of 40\u00b0C withi n 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause; Collapse or shock -like state (hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination; Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; Medicinal Product no longer authorised19 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Hexaxim. Vaccinees with a history of febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination. If Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome or brachial neuritis has occurred following receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus t oxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks, such as whether or not the primary immunization schedule has been completed. Vaccination is usually jus tified for infants whose primary immunization schedules are incomplete (i.e. fewer than three doses have been received). The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited. Special populations Immunogenicity data are available for 105 preterm infants. These data support the use of Hexaxim in preterm infants. As expected in preterm infants, lower immune response has been observed for some antigens, when indirectly compared to term infants, although seroprotective levels have been achieved (see section 5.1). No safety data were collected in preterm infants (born 37 weeks of gestation) in clinical trials. The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be considered when ad ministering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. Immune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism. In chronic renal failure subjects, an impaired hepatitis B response is observed and administration of additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered according to the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti -HBsAg). Precautions for use Do not administer by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection. As with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration. Interference with laboratory testing Since the Hib capsular polysaccharid e antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be observed within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm Hib infection during this period. Hexaxim contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium Hexaxim contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up becau se the body cannot remove it properly. Medicinal Product no longer authorised20 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Hexaxim contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \"potassium -free\" and \"sodium -free\". Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Hexaxim can be administered simultaneously with a pneumococcal meningococcal conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine, as no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the antigens have been shown. There may be a clinically relevant interference in the antibody response of Hexaxim and a varicella vaccine and these vaccines should not be administered at the same time. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate injection sites. Hexaxim must not be mixed with any other vaccines or other parenterally administ ered medicinal products. No significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been reported except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4). Interference with laboratory testing : see section 4.4. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Not applicable. This vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child -bearing age. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not relevant. 4.8 Undesirable effects a- Summary of the safety profile In clinical studies in individuals who received Hexaxim, the most frequently reported reactions include injection -site pain, irritability, crying, and injection- site erythema. Slightly higher solicited reactogenicity was observed after the first dose compared to subsequent doses. The safety of Hexaxim in children over 24 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials. b- Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions; Very common (1/10) Common (1/100 to <1/10) Uncommon <1/100) Rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) Very rare (<1/10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from available data) Medicinal Product no longer authorised21 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Table 1: Adverse Reactions from clinical trials and post marketing surveillance System Organ Class Frequency Adverse Events Immune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity reaction Rare Anaphylactic reaction* Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common Anorexia (decreased appetite) Nervous system disorders Very common Crying, somnolence Common Abnormal crying (prolonged crying) Rare Convulsions with or without fever* Very rare Hypotonic reactions or hypotonic - hyporesponsive episodes (HHE) Gastrointestinal disorders Very common Vomiting Common Diarrhoea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rare Rash General disorders and administration site conditions Very common Injection -site pain, injection -site erythema, injection -site -site nodule Pyrexia (body temperature 39.6\u00b0C) Rare Extensive limb swelling * Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. See section c c- Description of selected adverse reactions Extensive limb swelling: Large injection -site reactions (>50 mm), including extensive limb swelling from the injection site beyond one or both joints, have been reported in children. These reactions start within 24 -72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site and resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on the number of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing vaccine, with a greater risk following the 4th dose. d- Potential adverse events (i.e. adverse events which have been reported with other vaccines containing one or more of the components or constituents of Hexaxim and not directly with Hexaxim) Nervous system disorders - Brachial neuritis and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome have been reported after administration of a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine - Peripheral neuropathy (polyradiculoneuritis, facial paralysis), optic neuritis, central nervous system demyelination (multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B antigen containing vaccine - Encephalopathy/encephalitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Apnoea in very premature infants ( 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Oedematous reaction affecting one or both lower limbs may occur following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If this reaction occurs, it is mainly after primary injections and within the first few hours following vaccination. Associated symptoms may include Medicinal Product no longer authorised22 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 cyanosis, redness, transient purpura and severe crying. All events should resolve spontaneously without sequel within 24 hours. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the med icinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. 4.9 Overdose Not documented. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmaco -therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code J07CA09.

The immune Medicinal Product no longer authorised25 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 responses to PRP, PT and FHA antigens one month after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were similar to those observed one month after a 2-dose priming given at 3 and 5 months of age: - anti-PRP titers 0.15 \u00b5g/ml were observed in 73.0% of individuals, - anti-PT vaccine response in 97.9% of individuals, - anti-FHA vaccine r esponse in 98.6% of individuals. Persistence of immune response Studies on long- term persistence of vaccine induced antibodies following varying infant / toddler primary series and following Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth or not have shown maintenanc e of levels above the recognized protective levels or antibody thresholds for the vaccine antigens (see Table 3). In addition, immunity against the hepatitis B component of the vaccine has been shown to persist up to 9 years of age after a primary series consisting of one dose of Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth followed by a 3- dose infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age without a toddler booster where 49.3% of vaccinees had antibodies 10 mIU/ml with geometric mean concentrations at 13.3 (95% CI: 8.82 - 20.0) mIU/ml. Immune memory against Hepatitis B had been demonstrated by the presence of an anamnestic response to a challenge Hepatitis B vaccination at the age of 9 years in 93% of vaccinees with development of geometric mean concentrations at 3692 (95% CI: 1886 - 7225) longer authorised26 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Table 3: Seroprotection rates a at the age of 4.5 years old after vaccination with Hexaxim Antibody Thresholds Primary 6-10-14 weeks and booster at 15- 18 months Primary 2-4- 6 months and booster at 12-24 months Without hepatitis B at birth With hepatitis B at birth With hepatitis B at birth N=173b N=103b N=220c % 99.5 Anti-Polio type 2 ( 8 (1/dilution)) NAd NAd 100 Anti-Polio type 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)) NAd NAd 100 Anti-PRP ( 0.15 \u00b5g/ml) 98.8 100 100 N = Number of individuals analysed (per protocol set) a: Generally accepted surrogates (PT, FHA) or correlates of protection (other components) b: 6, 10, 14 weeks with and without hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Republic of South Africa) c: 2, 4, 6 months with hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Colombia) d: Due to an OPV National Immunisation Days in the country, Polio results have not been analysed e: 8 EU/ml corresponds to 4 LLOQ (Lower Limit Quantification in enzyme -linked immunosorbe nt assay ELISA). LLOQ value for anti -PT and anti -FHA is 2 EU/ml Immune responses to Hexaxim in preterm infants Immune responses to Hexaxim antigens in preterm (105) infants (born after a gestation period of 28 to 36 weeks), including 90 infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy and 15 to women not vaccinated during pregnancy, were evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 months of age. One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.01 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.01 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 89.8% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 79.4% were seroprotected a gainst Hib invasive diseases ( 0.15 \u00b5g/mL). One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were Medicinal Product no longer authorised27 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 90.6% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 1 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 98.7% and 100% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens respect ively. One month after the booster dose 98.8% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis antibody concentrations were increased by 13-fold after primary vaccination and by 6- to 14- fold after the booster dose. Immune responses to Hexaxim in infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy Immune responses to Hexaxim antigens in term (119) and preterm (90) infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy (between 24 and 36 weeks of g estation) were evaluated following a 3- dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 (preterm infants) or 15 (term infants) months of age. One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.01 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.01 IU/mL) poliovirus types 1 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 97.3% of subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus 2 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B ( 10 IU/mL) and 88.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 0.15 \u00b5g/mL). One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria ( 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus ( 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 ( 8 (1/dilution)); 93.9% of s ubjects were seroprotected B ( 10 IU/mL) and 94.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases ( 1 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 99.4% and 100% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against P T and FHA antigens respectively. One month after the booster dose 99.4% of subjects developed antibodies 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis antibody concentrations were increased by 5- to 9 -fold after primary vaccination and by 8- to 19 -fold after the booster dose. Efficacy and effectiveness in protecting against pertussis Vaccine efficacy of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexaxim against the most severe WHO- defined typical pertussis ( 21 days of paroxysmal cough) is documented in a randomized double-blind study among infants with a 3 dose primary series using a DTaP vaccine in a highly endemic country (Senegal). The need for a toddler booster dose was seen in this study. The long term capability o f the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexaxim to reduce pertussis incidence and control pertussis disease in the childhood has been demonstrated in a 10- year national pertussis surveillance on pertussis disease in Sweden with the pentavalent DTaP -IPV/Hib vaccine using a 3, 5, 12 months schedule. Results of long term follow- up demonstrated a dramatic reduction of the pertussis incidence following the second dose regardless of the vaccine used. Effectiveness in protecting against Hib invasive disease The vaccine effectiveness against Hib invasive disease of DTaP and Hib combination vaccines (pentavalent and hexavalent including vaccines containing the Hib antigen from Hexaxim) has been demonstrated in Germany via an extensive (over fi ve years follow -up period) post -marketing surveillance study. The vaccine effectiveness was of 96.7% for the full primary series, and 98.5% for booster dose (irrespective of priming). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable.

What is in this leaflet : 1. What Hexaxim is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before Hexaxim is given to your child 3. How to use Hexaxim 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Hexaxim 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Hexaxim is and what it is us ed for Hexaxim is a vaccine. Vaccines are used to protect against infectious diseases. Hexaxim helps to protect against diphtheria , tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexaxim is g iven to children from six weeks of age. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria and viruses that cause these different infections: Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection causes pain and swelling which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria that cause the disease also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys and nerves. Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usuall y caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe and the possibility of suffocation. Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a bacterial infecti on of the airways that can occur at any age but mostly affects infants and young children. Increasingly severe coughing spells that can last for several weeks are a characteristic of the disease. Coughing spells may be followed by a whooping noise. Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control breathing and swallowing can be fatal. Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are seriou s bacterial infections and can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), infections of the blood, lungs, inflammation of the tissue under the skin, inflammation of the joints and bones and inflammation of part of the back of the throat, causing difficulty in swallowing and breathing. Medicinal Product no longer authorised46 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Important information about the protection provided Hexaxim will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses targeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseas es with similar symptoms if they are caused by other bacteria or viruses. The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the infectious diseases against which it protects. This vaccine does not protect against infectio ns caused by other types of Haemophilus influenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro -organisms. Hexaxim will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognized hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. As with any vaccine, Hexaxim may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine . 2. What you need to know before Hexaxim is given to your child To make sure that Hexaxim is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if any of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. Do not use Hexaxim if your child: has had an allergic reaction to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6, to any pertussis vaccine (any vaccine that protects against whooping cough), after previous administration of the vaccine or to any vaccine containing the same components or constituents. has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold or flu). Vaccination with Hexaxim may need to be d elayed until your child is better. suffered from encephalopathy (cerebral lesions) within 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain (uncontrolled neurologic disorder) and nervous system or uncontrolled epilepsy. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your chi ld: is allergic to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these substances are used during the manufacturing process. if any of the following events are known to have occurred after receiving any vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered: Fever of 40\u00b0C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiabl e cause. Collapse or shock -like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) within 48 hours of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. presented Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (abnormal sensitivity, paralysis) or brachial neuritis (paralysis, diffuse pain in the arm and shoulder) following receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (vaccine against tetanus), the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be evaluated by your doctor. Medicinal Product no longer authorised47 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 follows a treatment that suppresses her/his immune defenses or if your child presents with immunodeficiency: in these cases th e immune response to the vaccine may be decreased. It is then recommended to wait until the end of the treatment or disease before vaccinating. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited. suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency (or failure). suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your doctor will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor cuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexaxim. Other medicines or vaccines and Hexaxim Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken any other medicines or might take any other medicines. Hexaxim can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-mumps -rubella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines or meningococcal vaccines. Your doctor will give the injections at different sites and will use separate syringes and needles for each injection. Hexaxim contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium Hexaxim contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. Hexaxim contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \"potassium -free\" and \"sodium -free\". Pregnancy, breast -feeding and fertility Not applicable. Driving and using machines Not relevant. 3. How to use Hexaxim The vaccination should be given by medical or healthcare professionals who are trained in the use of vaccines and who are equipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection. Please refer to section 4. Hexaxim is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your child's leg or upper arm. The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. Always use this vaccine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The recommended dose is as follows: First Course of Vaccination (Primary Vaccination) Your child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months or three injections given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used according to the local vaccination programme. Medicinal Product no longer authorised48 VV-LBL- 0168626 version 2.0 Additional injections (Booster) After primary vaccination when indicated by the local vaccination schedule, your child should receive a booster dose, in accordance with local recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the primary vaccination.
