This fact sheet is designed to give healthcare professionals the most up-to-date information about recommendations for reducing COVID-19 risks in blood cancer patients. FSHP6 COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment for Blood Cancer Patients I page 1www.LLS.org Information Specialist: 800.955.4572 COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment for Blood Cancer Patients HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS No. 6 in a series providing the latest information Hematologic malignancy patients require one extra COVID-19 vaccine dose in the primary series and earlier boosters CDC has expressed a \"clinical preference\" for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech) over the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.1 Immunocompromised patients who begin their vaccination series with an mRNA vaccine should receive 5 doses (3 primary, plus 2 boosters). Patients who begin their vaccination series with the J&J vaccine should receive 4 doses (2 primary\u20141 J&J and 1 mRNA, plus 2 booster doses).2 Which patients are considered \"moderately to severely immunocompromised?\" LLS explains to patients it comes into contact with that because the immune system is very complex, there is no simple answer to who is moderately to severely immunocompromised. This is why CDC and other policy making bodies provide guidance on the issue and encourage discussions between patients and their own healthcare providers. LLS strongly encourages all blood cancer patients, regardless of where they are in their treatment, remission or recovery to talk with their blood cancer treatment team about the status of their immune system and whether EvusheldTM and an additional COVID-19 booster dose are right for them. LLS agrees with the approach taken by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)3, which considers all blood cancer patients to be moderately to severely immunocompromised. However, LLS makes one addition: patients who have had CD19- targeted CAR T-therapy should consider themselves immunosuppressed for as long as the CAR T is working, even if it has been more than two years since their infusion.

For immunocompromised patients, Moderna doses 1-3 are full strength. Only the booster doses (doses 4 and 5) are half strength. Booster doses may be \"mixed and matched.\" June 2022Vaccine dosing in moderately to severely immunocompromised patients only FSHP6 COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment for Blood Cancer Patients I page 2 COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment for Blood Cancer PatientsLLS data: COVID-19 vaccine response varies by malignancy and treatment type LLS has reported anti-spike antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines from the largest study of blood cancer patients to date. Our first published study in over 1,400 hematologic patients4 reported that 25% were seronegative after two mRNA vaccine doses. Results varied by type of malignancy and treatment. Patients with B-cell malignancies, including CLL, tended to do worse. LLS presented additional data at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December 2021 showing that most hematology patients benefit from a third COVID-19 vaccine dose. (Figure) However, a large proportion of hematology patients will remain at risk even with the additional dose. It is important to encourage hematology patients to take additional precautions to avoid infection, such as masking and distancing, and to ensure they have access to the prophylactic monoclonal antibody (Evusheld), as well as monoclonal antibody and antiviral treatments that can reduce their risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.COVID-19 prevention and treatment guidelines The National Institutes of Health convened an expert panel to develop COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines .5 The guidelines are updated as the pandemic evolves. The guidelines provide an algorithm for pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure- prophylaxis, and treatment of COVID-19 in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. LLS has developed tables for consumers with important information about monoclonal antibodies and antiviral medications available for prophylaxis and treatment in the outpatient setting.6 LLS makes every effort to rapidly update these tables as recommendations evolve, but suggests that frontline medical professionals stay informed of recent changes by monitoring the NIH \"What's New\" antibody authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 disease. Data reported at American Society of Hematology annual meeting, December 13, 2021.Source: The LLS National Patient Registry. Data collected from 699 patients who had a third dose of Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine between June and September 2021. * Response measures anti-spike antibody levels. Most patients received the same vaccine brand for all three doses. There were not enough \"mix and match\" third doses to draw conclusions about whether mixing doses has an effect on immune response.

Patients who received the earlier recommended dose of 150 mg of each agent should receive another dose as soon as possible. o There are no recommendations for repeat dosing at this time. If Evusheld retains activity against BA.2 and future variants, FDA is likely to recommend repeat dosing. The latest information will be available here.8 Snapshot: COVID-19 Treatment in the Outpatient Setting One monoclonal antibody , bebtelovimab, is authorized to treat COVID-19 in outpatients. Authorizations for other antibody treatments were withdrawn because they are not active against currently circulating variants. o T reatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years and weighing 40 kg who have tested positive for COVID-19, are not hospitalized or using supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. o T reatment should be initiated as soon after positive COVID-19 test results as possible or within 7 days of symptom onset. Three antivirals , nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets (Paxlovid), molnupiravir capsules, and remdesivir (Veklury\u00ae) IV infusion or injections are authorized to treat COVID-19 in outpatients. (Remdesivir is also approved for use in hospitalized patients.) o T reatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 confirmed by a positive COVID-19 test in non-hospitalized patients who are at high risk of progression to severe infection. o Molnupiravir is authorized for use in adults 18 years. o Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir is authorized for use in adults 18 years and children 12 years and weighing 40 kg. o Remdesivir is authorized for use in adults 18 years and pediatric patients at least 28 days of age and weighing at least 3 kg. o T reatment should begin as soon as possible after COVID-19 diagnosis and within 5 days of symptom onset (7 days for remdesivir).o Oral treatments (molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) should be taken for no more than 5 consecutive days; remdesivir is a 3-day course of treatment. o Important note: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir may impair the efficacy and safety of certain cancer medications.
