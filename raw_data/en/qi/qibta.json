Use of complementary medicines and therapies (CAM) and modication of lifestyle factors such as physical activity and exercise, and diet are being increasingly considered as potential therapeutic options for anxiety disorders. The objective of this metareviewwas to examine evidence across a broad range of CAM and lifestyle interventions in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In early 2012 we conducted a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library, for key studies, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses in the area. Our review found that in respect to treatment of generalized anxietyor specic anxiety disorders, CAM evidence revealed support f or the herbal medicine Kava. One isolated study shows benet for naturopathic medicine, whereas acupuncture, yoga, and T ai chi have tentative supportive evidence, which is hampered by overall poor methodology. The breadth of evidence does not support homeopathy for treating anxiety. Strong support exists for lifestylemodications including adoption of moderate exercise and mindful ness meditation, whereas dietary improvement, avoidance of caeine, alcohol, and nicotine o er encouraging preliminary data. In conclusion, certain lifestyle modications and some CAMs may provide a benecial role in the management of anxiety disorders. 1. Introduction Anxiety disorders as a collective entity are pervasive and include discrete diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder(GAD), social phobia (SP), obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD), panic disorder (PD), and post traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) [ 1]. Anxiety disorders present with a marked element of psychological tension and distress andare accompanied by a range of somatic symptoms such aspalpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, hyperthermia,and digestive disturbance [ 1]. Lifetime prevalence rates ofanxiety disorders are approximately 3%-6% for 4%- 2,3]. There are currently various e ective psychological therapies and pharmacological treatments available foranxiety disorders. The recommended rst-line treatmentstrategies for most anxiety disorders include antidepressantsand/or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) [ 4]. In respect to pharmacotherapies, there is a good evidence base for both short-term and long-term treatment with paroxetine (espe-cially for PD), escitalopram, venlafaxine extended release,2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Ta ble 1: Domains and individual interventions reviewed.

Despite their modest e ectiveness (eect size GAD SSRIs) [ 6], antidepressants have signicant limitations, a relatively slow onset of action andtime to maximal e ect, and a number of possible side e ects, including initial increase in anxiety in the short-term (oftenproblematic for patient compliance), and sexual side e ects, which a ect over 50% of users [ 7] in the longerterm. Benzodiazepines have established e cacy for many anxiety disorders [ 5] but also numerous limitations. They can be very helpful for ameliorating symptoms rapidly andare usually prescribed for short-term use. However, thisrecommendation can be very di cult to institute due to potential reliance for symptom relief. Benzodiazepines are nolonger recommended beyond short-term use due to potentialfor abuse, the development of dependence, signicant riskswhen combined with alcohol, and possible long-term cogni-tive e ects [ 8]. There have been recent positive randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with pregabalin, however, its indica-tion for GAD in Europe has not yet been replicated by otherregulatory authorities [ 5]. Psychological techniques are also eective rst-line interventions for anxiety [ 9]. In particular, there is a body of evidence for CBT that usually involvespsychoeducation, relaxation training, cognitive restructuringand behavioural aspects [ 4]. Despite e ectiveness, some patients are not suited or motivated for face-to-face CBT,access may be an issue, and the cost can be prohibitive [ 10]. Approximately 50%-65% of patients with anxiety disor- ders benet from CBT or antidepressants [ 11,12]. However, many patients continue to su er signicant symptoms despite treatment, underlining the need for further optionsor adjuncts to current conventional treatments. Further-more, anxiety disorders are often under-treated [ 13], moti- vating patients to seek di erent treatment approaches such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Non-conventional treatments are commonly used for anxiety,with CAM, lifestyle modications, and self-help techniquesoften used in concert with pharmacotherapies and psy-chological techniques [ 14,15]. Complementary medicines consist of herbal and nutrient products, while complemen-tary therapies include interventions such as acupuncture,naturopathy, chiropractics, and homeopathy [ 16]. Self- help techniques include T ai chi, yoga, and meditation,while lifestyle modications may involve the employment of dietary alteration, exercise, and the minimisation ofsubstances such as alcohol, ca eine, and tobacco. CAM use for people with anxiety disorders is prevalent with a UScross-sectional and longitudinal survey demonstrating 43%of individuals with DSM-IV criteria for GAD, PD, SP , orPTSD use a variety of CAM treatments [ 17]. Use of CAM was associated with a diagnosis of GAD, older age, greater educa-tion, and having two or more chronic medical conditions. While previous reviews have explored the use of CAM or self-help techniques in the management of anxiety [ 14, 18,19], to date no review has comprehensively assessed this broad area across all major clinical anxiety disordersto provide an integrated assessment of current evidence.Thus, this narrative paper examines the current evidencebase for nonconventional treatments of anxiety disorders,including discussion of their neurobiological underpinnings,and provides considerations for their potential integrationinto clinical practice. 2. Methods A range of databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web ofScience and PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library) weresearched during early 2012. Each author contributed toan area of their respective expertise (D. Mischoulon: CAMtherapies; J. Sarris and M. P . Pase: herbal and nutrient supplements); F. andS. modication; I. Schweitzer:conventional pharmacotherapies). The literature search ofkey interventions for treating general anxiety, and diagnosedclinical anxiety disorders (GAD, PD, SP , OCD, and PTSD) focused on (1) CAM natural products (nutraceuticals) (2) CAM modalities (3) Meditation and mindfulness techniques(4) Lifestyle modication using physical activity, exercise,diet, and restriction of ca eine, alcohol, and nicotine (see Ta bl e 1 ). As a narrative inclusive \"metareview\" was conducted, the studies included a range of evidence (fromepidemiological to human clinical studies, and metaanalysesand systematic reviews). Key studies, reviews, and metaanal-yses were focused on. Further review of the literature wasundertaken to study the posited mechanisms of action ofthese interventions. The literature reviewed was restricted topapers written in English. The term \"signicant\" was appliedto results with a Pvalue of<0.05.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 3. Results 3.1. Complementary Therapies 3.1.1. Overview. There are several complementary therapy modalities touted as having potential benet in the treatmentof anxiety, including interventions such as acupuncture,massage, naturopathy, chiropractics, and homeopathy [ 16]. Regulation of these practices and their practitioners varydepending on jurisdiction, and if clinicians are referring patients for these treatments, several considerations should be recognised, including evidence for the modality, cost ofthe treatment, and the training and qualication of thetherapist. 3.1.2. Naturopathic Medicine. Naturopathic practitioners seek to improve health by assisting the body's innatecapacity to recover from illness [ 20]. Practitioners typically employ a combination of many CAM therapies, includingherbal and nutritional supplementation, and dietary andlifestyle recommendations, and may additionally incorporateacupuncture or homeopathy. Only one study has been per-formed with regard to naturopathic medicine (naturopathy)in the area of anxiety disorders, although another naturalisticobservational study is currently underway [ 21]. A double-blind RCT by Cooley and colleagues [ 22] compared a naturopathic therapy (NT) protocol, includingthe herbal medicine Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera ) 300 mg twice daily, breathing relaxationtechniques, and a standard multivitamin. Eighty-seven sub-jects with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than six weekswere recruited. The control group received a standardizedpsychotherapy intervention (PT), matched deep breathingrelaxation techniques, and placebo pill supplement over 12weeks. Final Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores decreasedsignicantly in both groups, by 56.5% in the NT groupand 30.5% in the PT group, with a highly signicantadvantage for the NT group compared to PT group. The NTgroup also had signicantly greater clinical benet in mentalhealth, concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality,and overall quality of life. No serious adverse reactions werereported in either group. The study, while enlightening,was limited by a small sample size, and utilisation ofcomprehensive treatment packages, making it di cult to assess the benet of any particular component. Additionally,Naturopaths frequently apply complex personalized herbaland nutritional formulations in treatment protocols, and thus the standardized intervention does not reflect normal practice. The results however are encouraging and endorsefurther research. 3.1.3. Massage Therapy. Therapeutic massage is one of the most popular CAM treatments for anxiety, but has hadfew rigorous evaluations for diagnosed anxiety disorders.A recent study by Sherman and colleagues [ 23] assessed the e ectiveness of massage for treatment of GAD. The investigators randomised 68 patients with GAD to ther-apeutic massage, thermotherapy (the application of heatto the body), or relaxation-room therapy for 12 weeks (total 10 sessions). Changes in various outcome measures,such as the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), wereassessed at the conclusion of the 12 weeks and also aftersix months of additional followup. All three treatmentgroups had signicant improvement on the HAM-A after 12 weeks and maintained their gains after 26 weeks. However, no signicant di erences were found between groups. The authors concluded that all three treatment arms showedsome clinically signicant improvements, perhaps due to ageneralized relaxation response rather than any individualcharacteristics of the three treatments. In fact, given thelower expense of the relaxation-room, the authors suggestedthat this particular intervention might prove the most cost-eective for GAD patients who are interested in CAM [ 23]. Other investigations have compared CBT against aro- matherapy massage (AM) for treating symptoms of anxietyor depression in cancer patients. In a sole comparison ofthese two interventions, Serfaty and colleagues [ 24] recruited 39 cancer patients with anxiety and/or depression assessedon the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Subjects were randomised to treatment as usual (TAU) plus up to eight sessions of AM or CBT over three months. AM provedthe more acceptable therapy based on sessions attended,and both treatments were signicantly e ective based on the Prole of Mood States (in respect to total mood, depression,and anxiety scores). CBT had a trend to an advantage indepression but not in anxiety. Black and colleagues [ 25] performed the rst controlled study of chair massage for anxiety in 82 inpatients with-drawing from alcohol, cocaine, and opiates. Patients wererandomised to three days of chair massage or a relaxationcontrol condition. Standard counseling and pharmacologicmanagement were o ered concurrently to all patients. Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were reduced for both interventions, with a signicant advantage for chair massage. In summary, preliminary results for massage therapy suggest benet in various di erent patient populations and contexts, but results are not conclusive, nor commonlyemploy a clinical population, while comparisons withcontrol interventions have often not suggested signicantdierential e ects. Additional research will be necessary to characterize their place in anxiety disorder treatment. 3.1.4. Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a very popular CAM intervention that, unlike the previously mentioned interven-tions, has a more substantive body of clinical trial evidenceregarding its e cacy and safety in the treatment of anxiety and depression. A recent review by Pilkington et al. [ 26] identied 10 randomized and two nonrandomised clinicaltrials of acupuncture for generalised anxiety or anxietydisorders. Among the RCTs, four were in patients withGAD or anxiety neurosis, and six in patients with acuteperioperative anxiety. Analysis of the studies was hampered by common problems encountered when interpreting the acupunctureliterature in general. These include between-trial variation4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine in acupuncture protocols and specic points used. Furthermore, di erent studies used a variety of control interventions, including behavioral desensitisation, shamacupuncture with nonspecic points, biofeedback, and drugtherapy. The authors were rightfully suspicious of some ofthe reported \"cure rates\" that they described as \"unrealisti- cally high\" . Acupuncture appeared to be comparable in e - cacy to drug therapy, but this similarity could be explained bythe small sample sizes leading to underpowering of studies,limiting the ability to detect a di erence between treatments. Other limitations included the mixing of diagnoses in thesamples, for example, anxiety disorder and depression. Regarding studies for specic DSM-IV diagnoses, Pilkington and colleagues [ 26] identied 3 trials specically on GAD. These trials were all of short duration (four to sixweeks) and compared acupuncture against pharmacother-apy. Similar e cacy was found for both interventions, but small sample sizes limited the generalisability of the ndings.V ery few trials in other anxiety disorders such as OCD andPTSD have also been published, but due to design flawsdo not support solid recommendations about potential ecacy. In summary, acupuncture appears e ective in short-term use for anxiety symptoms, but we cannot yetmake clear recommendations for specic clinical anxietydisorders. Adjunctive therapy studies are lacking, whichis unfortunate given that acupuncture is generally welltolerated and does not appear to cause adverse interactionswith pharmacological therapies [ 27]. Acupuncture has been documented to interact with opioid pathways, and interventions which modify thesepathways have been shown to have potential moodmodulatory activity [ 28,29]. Other potential mechanisms of action that may induce anxiolysis include increased releaseof serotonin and norepinephrine, and cortisol modulation[30]. Examination of biological mechanisms of acupuncture and massage therapy, including measurements of neuro- transmitters and immune biomarkers has been conductedin the area of depression [ 26,31], although specic research into the underpinning neurobiological e ects of these interventions to treat anxiety has not yet been explored. 3.1.5. Homeopathy. The practice of homeopathy (use of preparations consisting of highly diluted substances) has itsroots in the 1800s in Germany where it was used to treata range of illnesses and health disorders [ 16]. A systematic review by Pilkington and colleagues [ 32] identied eight RCTs using homeopathy to treat anxiety. Results revealedthat the benet of homeopathy in generalised anxiety andanxiety disorders is unable to be determined, as the identiedstudies all exhibited signicant methodological issues (e.g.,small samples, lack of control group). Reported adverseeects appear to be limited to \"remedy reactions\" and included temporary worsening or reappearance of minorsymptoms. Another stricter systematic review by Davidsonet al. [ 33] of homeopathy in psychiatry, found that for four of ve studies for anxiety (two on GAD), homeopathywas not superior to placebo. An example of an RCT usinghomeopathy to treat anxiety was conducted by Bonne andcolleagues [ 34]. Forty-four patients with diagnosed GAD participated in a 10-week RCT of individually tailoredhomeopathic remedy. While signicant improvement inmost measures, including HAM-A, was observed in both theactive treatment and placebo groups, no di erence was found between groups. In summary, on the basis of the current literature it is not possible to provide support for the use of homeopathy for treatment of anxiety disorders. 3.1.6. Conclusions. At this time there is preliminary evidence for CAM therapies including acupuncture, massage, andnaturopathy in the treatment of anxiety disorders; whilehomeopathy is not supported by clinical evidence. No studiesidentied assessed chiropractics or osteopathy in treatinganxiety disorders. Thus, in the absence of conclusive studies,clinicians should prescribe these treatments with caution astheir e cacy is not as well characterised as more standard therapies. 3.2. Nutraceuticals (Herbal and Nutritional Medicine) 3.2.1. Overview. Over the past 25 years, there has been increasing interest in the use of nutraceuticals (herbal ornutritional medicines) for the treatment of anxiety disorders, with numerous human clinical trials emerging in the area [19,35,36]. At present, the clinical evidence for herbal medicines, nutrients, and aromatherapy in the treatment ofanxiety varies greatly in respect to methodological quality(see Ta bl e 2 ). Considerations when referring or prescribing nutraceuticals involve the knowledge of potential druginteractions (e.g., with Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) [ 37]), the additional cost of these supplements, and most importantly, concern over quality issues [ 38 ]. While some nutraceutical companies provide researched,standardised products, manufactured to a pharmaceuticalstandard, such condence cannot be extended to manyproducts, thus clinicians need to be mindful that quality andsafety are paramount when integrating nutraceuticals intothe therapeutic domain. 3.2.2. Clinical Evidence for Herbal Medicines. The most researched herbal medicine in the treatment of anxiety isPiper methysticum (Kava); a perennial plant native to various r e g i o n so ft h eS o u t hP a c i c[ 62]. The roots of the Kava plant are traditionally prepared as a water-based beverage for its medicinal properties and psychotropic e ects [ 63]. In 2003, a Cochrane review evaluated the e ectiveness of Kava in treating anxiety [ 42] .O u to f1 2R C T st h a ts a t i s e d the inclusion criteria, seven used the HAM-A and wereincluded in the metaanalysis. The pooled analysis foundKava to be e ective in reducing the HAM-A total score relative to placebo (weighted mean di erence =3.9, n=380). Another pooled analysis of six studies found an e ect size of 1.1 (Cohen's d) in favour of Kava reducing HAM-A score over placebo [ 64]. Those studies not included in the pooled analysis were generally congruent with this result. A furthermetaanalysis of six RCTs reported that a standardised KavaEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Ta ble 2: Summary of nutraceuticals reviewed.

The anxiolytic properties of Kava appear to be due to a collectivegroup of compounds called kavalactones [ 65]. Amongst numerous mechanisms, kavalactones appear to modulate calcium and sodium channels [ 66], modify binding of ligands to GABA receptors [ 67] and inhibit noradrenaline uptake [ 68]. Despite evidence of e cacy, support for the use of Kava has been blunted by ongoing safety concerns followingnumerous reports of liver toxicity [ 69]. As discussed in detail elsewhere [ 64], various factors such as the manufacturing quality, plant part of Kava used, the method of extraction,and the dose are potential in factors that a ect the safety of Kava [ 70]. Interactions with alcohol and pharmaceutical medications should also be considered. Limited evidence suggests that Bacopa monnieri (Bacopa) [71]a n d Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo) both used for their cognitive enhancing e ects, may have anxiolytic properties in humans. Although Ayurvedic writings document Bacopain the treatment of anxiety RCTs inves- tigating e ects of Bacopa on anxiety are scarce. In one study, where cognition was the primary outcome, 300 mgof standardised Bacopa extract daily for three months in46 healthy volunteers was found to reduce State anxietyrelative to placebo [ 39]. One double-blind RCT investigated the e ects of Ginkgo extract EGb 761 on anxiety [ 41], using the HAM-A as the primary outcome measure in 107 patientswith GAD or adjustment disorder with anxious mood. After four weeks of supplementation both a high (480 mg/day) and low dose (240 mg/day) of EGb 761 signicantly reducedanxiety compared to placebo in a dose-dependent fashion. Commonly considered an anti-depressant, the anxiolytic eects of St John's wort were investigated in a double-blind multicentre RCT using a cohort of 324 outpatients with mildto moderate depression. Twice daily supplementation with250 mg of St John's wort, relative to 75 mg of imipramine,signicantly improved scores on the HAM-A somatisationsubscale [ 73] over a period of six weeks. A further 6-week double-blinded RCT various subscales on theHAM-A in a cohort of 151 outpatients with somatoformdisorders [ 51]. However, studies exploring the use of St John's wort in specic anxiety disorders have not producedpositive results. For example, two smaller double-blind RCTsh a v en o ts u p p o r t e di t su s e( b o t ht r i a l su s e dafl e x i b l ed o s eof 600-1800 mg extract daily over 12 weeks) in reducing thesymptoms of OCD [ 49]o rS P[ 50]. Due to this, St John's wort cannot be recommended as an anxiolytic for use in anyanxiety disorder. Limited evidence exists for an anxiolytic e ect of Scutel- laria lateriflora (Scullcap) and Passiflora incarnata (Passion flower), both of which have traditionally been used in the Americas as calming agents [ 74]. Following acute admin- istration, one small study reported that Scullcap reducedanxiety relative to placebo in a dose-dependent fashion [ 48], however, the methodology was weak and the results werecommunicated poorly. Building upon promising preclinicalresearch [ 75], Akhondzedah et al. [ 47] reported that 45 drops of randomised Passion flower extract was comparable tooxazepam in reducing anxiety in 36 patients with GAD. Twoacute double-blind RCTs (samples of 60 participants) havereported that 500 mg of the herbal medicine signicantlyreduced anxiety associated with surgery relative to placebo [46,76]. Importantly, no negative interactions with anesthe- sia and surgical outcomes were observed. A single double-blind RCT has assessed the use of Matricaria recutita (Chamomile) in the treatment of GAD [40]. Following eight weeks of treatment in 57 patients, Chamomile was found to have a modest e ect on reducing anxiety (HAM-A scores) relative to placebo. Adverse eventswere not di erent between the placebo and treatment groups. Several small double-blind RCTs suggest that Melissa ocinalis (Lemon balm) increases self-rated calmness acutely in healthy participants [ 44,45]. Interestingly, all three of these double-blind studies reported signicant e ects on self-rated calmness with di erent dosages of Lemon balm (ranging from 300-1600 mg). The e ects of Lemon balm have yet to be investigated in clinical samples. Aromatherapy (the practice of prescribing isolated volatile oils from plants via inhalation, massage, or internaluse) is one of the most widely used CAMs in the treatmentof anxiety. A recent systematic review concluded that, acrossthe 16 studies, aromatherapy was generally safe and e ective in reducing anxiety symptoms [ 61]. The review reported that those with higher levels of anxiety appeared to respond betterto aromatherapy than those with mild anxiety. However, thereview noted that many of the studies were of questionablequality and study cohorts were heterogeneous, comprisingparticipants with dementia, cancer, and also healthy volun-teers. 3.2.3. Clinical Evidence of Nutrients. At present, there is little evidence to support the anxiolytic e ects of nutrient supplementation for treatment of most anxiety disorders bl 2 ). One large =264) reported that supplementation with magnesium, when combined ina herbal formula, decreased anxiety in patients with mildto moderate generalised anxiety over three months relativeto placebo [ 77]. In relatively healthy samples, multinutrient therapy has been shown to have no e ect on state anxiety ( n = 205) over 12 months [ 57]or self rated calmness following 28 days ( n=198) [ 56] and 33 days ( n=215) [ 55]o ft r e a t m e n t . However, while approximately one month of multinutrientsupplementation reduced anxiety relative to placebo across88 healthy males [ 52] and 44 women with premenstrual symptoms [ 53], a further study reported no benecial eect of multinutrient therapy on anxiety in participants in aged care following eight weeks of supplementation [ 54]. In healthy participants ( n =108), one double-blind RCT reported that a week of amino acid treatment (2.64 g L-lysine and 2.64 g L-arginine per day) decreased stress-relatedanxiety [ 78]. Despite a lack of evidence for nutrient supplementation in other anxiety disorders, evidence does suggest thatinositol may have a potential role in ameliorating panic. In8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 21 patients with diagnosed PD with or without agoraphobia, 12 g/day of inositol was shown to quell the frequency andseverity of panic attacks and the severity of agoraphobiain a double-blind four week cross-over trial [ 58]. A later small trial involving 20 participants reported thatInositol (18 g/day for one month) was more e ective than fluvoxamine (250 mg/day for one month) in reducing weekly panic attacks [ 60]. In 13 patients with OCD, 18 g/day of Inositol reduced OCD symptoms in a six week cross-overtrial [ 59], however other studies have revealed equivocal eects to placebo [ 79]. 3.2.4. Mechanisms of Action. The proposed pharmacody- namics of herbal medicines used for treatment of anxietydisorders primarily involve modulation of neuronal commu-nication, a ecting neuroreceptor binding and activity [ 35], or alteration of neurotransmitter synthesis and activity [ 36]. Anxiolytic nutraceuticals may have e ects on the GABA system either via inducing ionic channel transmission byvoltage-gated blockage, or through transaminase or acid decar-boxylase inhibition, or less via binding withbenzodiazepine receptor sites (e.g., GABA-A) [ 35]. Other actions may involve dampening CNS activity, and regulatingor supporting the healthy function of the hypothalamicpituitary adrenal-axis [ 80]. 3.2.5. Conclusions. In summary, for reducing generalised anxiety, evidence supports the use of Kava (although poten-tial extremely rare hepatotoxicity needs to be considered),while limited research points towards a benecial e ect of Ginkgo, Passion flower, and Chamomile, multinutrientformulations, Scullcap, Lemon balm, and Bacopa. Further studies are needed to extend this research into clinical cohorts. Although there appears to be growing supportfor a general anxiolytic e ect of aromatherapy, future research is required to explore the e ects on clinical anxiety disorders. There is little support for the use ofSt John's wort for any anxiety disorder, while tentativeevidence supports inositol for PD and discourages its use inOCD. 3.3. Physical Activity and Exercise 3.3.1. Overview. Physical inactivity is an established risk factor for the development of many of health disorders,including psychiatric illnesses [ 81]. For example, increased rates of MDD were correlated with physical inactivityin surveys of German [ 82] and Norwegian populations [83]. Regular physical activity appears to reduce all-cause mortality and is an established independent protective factorfor premature death [ 84,85]. Mortality and morbidity aside, regular physical activity has been repeatedly shown to beassociated with improved emotional wellbeing [ 86]a n d inactivity with poorer emotional wellbeing [ 87]. 3.3.2. Epidemiological Evidence. There is now considerable evidence drawn from epidemiological surveys demonstratingthe association of regular physical activity with reduced depressive and anxious symptoms [ 88,89]. Utilising cross-sectional data from the US national comorbiditystudy of 8098 adults aged 15 to 54, Goodwin [ 90] revealed regular physical activity as being associated with decreasedprevalence of current anxiety disorders, including panic attacks (OR: 0.73), 0.64). However, an inherent issuewith these cross-sectional studies is their inability to explainthe direction of relationship between physical activityand anxiety. Regardless, mental disorders characterised byanxiety and depression are associated with many symptomswhich may lead to reduced physical activity, such as fatigue,poor motivation and social isolation [ 91]. 3.3.3. Clinical Evidence. Few prospective observational stud- ies have been conducted assessing the impact of physicalactivity on anxiety disorders. Str \u00a8ohle et al. [ 92]d e m o n - strated a lower incidence of some anxiety disorders, and all anxiety disorders when grouped (OR: 0.70), as beingassociated with regular physical activity in a sample of 2548 adolescents and young adults. In a Swedish cohort prospectively followed for 2 years, moderate to vigorousphysical activity (dened as >2 hours of activities per week, including aerobics, dancing, swimming, playing football, orgardening) was signicantly associated with fewer symptomsof anxiety on the HADS (adjusted RR: 0.56) [ 93]. In this study, the association between physical activity anddepression was of greater magnitude than with anxiety;a nding consistent with previous studies in which selfreported depression rates (but not anxiety) were associatedwith less physical activity [ 94,95]. Prescriptive exercise has demonstrated e cacy as a treatment strategy for anxiety symptoms. In a recent metaanalysis, exercise as a therapeuticintervention was found to be as e ective as psychotherapy, and nearly as e ective as pharmacotherapy, for the treatment of self-reported anxiety symptoms [ 96]. The e ect size of exercise for reduction of anxiety symptoms ( d =0.48) however appears smaller than the benet observed inRCTs of exercise therapy in clinical depression ( d =1.42) [97]. In regards to prescriptive use of exercise in diagnosed anxiety disorders, currently there is a surprising decit ofrobust studies. However, in PD, a study of 46 individu-als su ering from moderate to severe PD reported that patients who received structured aerobic exercise had signif- icantly greater symptomatic improvement than patients whoreceived placebo, but less improvement than those receivingclomipramine [ 98]. Further, aerobic exercise training was not statistically superior to relaxation when combined witheither paroxetine or placebo in the treatment of patientswith PD [ 99]. Other available pilot studies of structured exercise programs have demonstrated benecial e ects as individual or adjunctive therapies in patients with PTSD[100-102], SP [ 103]a n dO C D[ 104]. However, these studies generally su er from methodological issues including lack of control groups and small sample sizes. As it stands,little other RCT evidence exists supporting the e cacyEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9 of exercise in the treatment of clinical anxiety disorders, although further evidence may soon become available [ 105, 106]. 3.3.4. Mechanisms of Action. The therapeutic e ect of physical activity or exercise in reducing anxiety is likelythe result of complex interactions between developmental,neurobiological, and psychological processes [ 107]. The neu- robiological mechanisms underpinning the e ect of physical activity on anxiety are not yet fully elucidated, but potentiallyinvolve modulating activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsalralph nucleus (DRN), modulation of the autonomic nervoussystem (ANS) and regulation of various neuroactive agents,including brain derived neurotrophic factor [ 109], and 5-HT DRN neurons which are known toexhibit a erent and projections coeruleus (LC), and periaqueductal greymatter, which are areas associated with fear, anxiety, andmood regulation [ 111]. In addition, exercise is known to produce an anti-inflammatory state [ 112] and potentially increase production of brain antioxidants [ 113]. Inflamma- tion and oxidative stress are both postulated to have rolesin the pathogenesis of numerous mental disorders includingmajor depression [ 114]. In PD, exercise may be benecial by inducing interoceptive cues that elicit anxiety, and by this repeated exposure to those sensations may assist in training the person to manage these symptoms [ 115]. Furthermore, exercise may induce benecial downregulation of 5-HT2Creceptors in su erers of PD [ 116,117]. It is possible these factors interact in a complex fashion in exerting protectiveeects on the tumescence of anxiety symptoms. 3.3.5. Clinical Recommendations. Current clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anxiety disorders including,PD, [ 118] support regular physical activity (e.g., walking for 60 minutes or running 20-30 minutes at least four days perweek) as part of best-practice treatment. These recommen-dations are the same as those for MDD [ 119]. This is prudent given the high comorbidity between depression and anxiety.Moreover, given the relationship between physical activityand mental health appears to be complex [ 120], the input of robust RCT evidence will assist in substantiating and reningthese recommendations. For example, some evidencesuggests exercise recommendations should di er between men and women. In a survey assessing the relationshipbetween exercise intensity and mental health, the positive eects of vigorous activity on anxiety symptoms found in men were not replicated in women [ 120]. In contrast to men, women appeared to benet signicantly from less intenseforms of exercise (e.g., walking), with benets found in moregeneral domains (e.g., well-being and somatisation) and notthose directly related to depressive or anxiety symptoms. 3.3.6. Conclusions. T h ew e i g h to fe v i d e n c es u p p o r t st h e use of moderate graded exercise to reduce anxiety andcan be in most cases recommended after an appropriatehealth assessment. While the evidence strongly supports PA and exercise as an acute anxiolytic, the utility of exerciseas treatment for anxiety disorders would benet fromrigorously controlled studies. 3.4. Meditation Techniques (Mindfulness, Y oga, T ai Chi) 3.4.1. Overview. The concept of meditation is varied, with a key attribute of the practice involving \"mindfulness, \" com-monly dened as the awareness which arises through \"payingattention in a particular way: on purpose, in the presentmoment, and nonjudgmentally\" [ 121]. The development of mindfulness has its origins in the spiritual tradition ofBuddhism, which dates back over 2,500 years. Over the past60 years, ever since the advent of Buddhism in the West, therehas been growing interest in the relationship between mind-fulness, meditation, and mental health. In regards to anxietydisorders, a growing body of empirical evidence exists. Theuse of meditation as a Western behavioral intervention was pioneered by Kabat-Zinn [ 122], who originally investi- gated structured mindfulness training for the treatment ofchronic pain. The training program has become known asMindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is an8-10 week structured program which involves (i) training inmindfulness meditation practice, (ii) mindful awareness, forexample, during yoga postures, and (iii) mindfulness duringstressful everyday situations and social interaction. The typi-cal MBSR course involves weekly group meetings, a one-dayworkshop, and daily individual practice at home [ 123]. Over the past 30 years, the MBSR technique has been investigatedin relation to a number of physical and mental illnesses, witha moderate clinical e ect being reported in relation to the eect of MBSR on general mental health [ 123]. There is also evidence to suggest that amongst the general population, theMBSR technique may bring about a reduction in trait andstate anxiety and symptoms [ 124,125]. A number of mind- fulness techniques in the context developed, Behavior Therapy (DBT) [127], and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [128]. However, due to the vast quanta of data in the area, the focus of the current section will be on formal mindfulness meditation techniques rather than obscure techniques, or specic mindfulness approaches to CBT. 3.4.2. Clinical Evidence. Kabat-Zinn et al. [ 129] r s ti n v e s - tigated the e cacy of an 8-week MBSR program on anxiety scores in 22 patients who met DSM-IIIR diagnostic criteriafor GAD or PD, as well as 58 \"non-study\" participants whodid not meet formal criteria for an anxiety disorder yet scoredabove the 70th percentile on the Symptom Check List-90Revised (SCL-90-R). At the end of the treatment period, aswell as at 3-month followup, the number of patients expe-riencing panic symptoms (measured by the Hamilton PanicScore), was found to be signicantly reduced, together withoverall symptoms of anxiety. In a followup study, 18 of theoriginal patients in addition to 39 of the larger study compar-ison cohort we assessed by Miller [ 130] in order to determine10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine if the improvements in anxiety symptoms were maintained at 3 years. In the 18 original patients, posttreatment improve-ments in the Hamilton Panic Score, as well as the number andseverity of panic attacks were maintained at 3-year followup,together with improvements on anxiety outcome measures. As an adjunct to pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines or SSRIs, Lee et al. [ 131] investigated the e cacy of an 8- week variant of the MBSR program in ameliorating anxietysymptom severity in 41 patients who fullled DSM-IVdiagnostic criteria for either GAD or PD. Twenty one patientswere assigned to the MBSR group while the remaining 20were assigned to an active control group in which they wereeducated about the biological aspects of anxiety disordersfor one hour per week. In comparison to the educationgroup, the MBSR group displayed signicant improvementin anxiety symptoms on a range of outcome measures, suchas the HAM-A. Koszycki et al. [ 132]c o n d u c t e das t u d yw h i c h directly compared the e cacy of an 8-week course in MBSR with 12-weeks of group CBT in 53 patients with chronic SP .Participants in both treatment groups were found to improvesignicantly over the course of treatments, however, bothpatient and clinician-rated measures of social anxiety werefound to be signicantly lower in the CBT group in com-parison to the MBSR group at endpoint. The response andremission rates were also found to be signicantly higher forthe CBT group in comparison to the MBSR group, althoughthe reported response rate of 45% for the completer samplein the MBSR group is encouraging [ 132]. In a more recent study V\u00f8llestad et al. [ 133] investigated the e cacy of 8-week MBSR in reducing anxiety amongst 39 patients with PD, SP , or GAD, in comparison to a wait list control group of 37 participants. A signicant di erence between treatments in favor of MBSR was found on the primary anxiety outcome.Further, all treatment gains were found to be maintained at6-month followup in the anxiety disorders group [ 133]. It has been argued that mindfulness practice may be of some benet in OCD [ 134]. However, there is a scarcity of empirical research to date to investigate the e cacy of mindfulness interventions for OCD, despite the fact thatsome clinicians have claimed a degree of success using mind-fulness approaches with their patients [ 134,135]. A small pilot study by Hanstede et al. [ 136] investigated the e cacy of eight meditation group meetings (similar to MBSR) withparticipants experiencing OCD symptoms; eight participantswere assigned to the mindfulness training while nine par-ticipants were assigned to a waiting-list control group. Themindfulness intervention was found to signicantly reduceOCD symptoms by enhancing the mental ability of \"lettinggo\" . However, in the absence of a formal diagnosis of OCDand a broadly recognised outcome measure it is di cult to draw rm conclusions from this study. 3.4.3. Mechanisms of Action. A number of mechanisms have been proposed whereby meditation and mindful-ness techniques may ameliorate anxiety symptoms. First,through meditation training physiological arousal or nega-tive thoughts may become viewed increasingly as transientevents that come and go, decreasing the propensity of thesethoughts to trigger secondary reactions that increase subjec- tive distress [ 137]. Second, meditation has been proposed as a form of gradual exposure therapy, whereby prolongedexposure to anxiety-provoking thoughts and images mayfoster habituation [ 138,139]. In this regard, Rapgay et al. [ 140] argue that \"classical mindfulness, \" with a greater emphasis on concentration to acquire direct experience, may be more e ective for the treatment of GAD than MBSR because it involves greater exposure and habituation tothreatening stimuli, rather than discriminate analysis. The benets of meditation and mindfulness are also now beginning to be understood at a neurobiological level.Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence to suggest thatregular meditation is associated with a number of changes togray matter morphology using magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). A study by Lazar et al. [ 141] reported that regular insight meditation practice was found to be associated withincreased cortical thickness in a number of brain regionsassociated with attention, such as the prefrontal cortexand right anterior insula. Di erences in prefrontal cortical thickness were also found to be more pronounced in olderparticipants, which the authors interpreted as evidence thatmeditation may o set decline in cortical thickness associated with aging [ 141]. A number of other meditation practices have also been investigated, with the hippocampus andthe right anterior insula found to be the most consistentlyimplicated regions for group di erences [ 142]. Finally, there is emerging direct evidence suggesting meditation may alsoinfluence neurotransmitter release, with intriguing researchby Yu et al.[ 143] reporting that 20 minutes of focused attention on breathing movements in the lower abdomen is associated with signicantly increased levels of oxygenatedhaemoglobin in the anterior PFC, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, as well a signicant increase in wholeb l o o ds e r o t o n i n( 5 - H T )l e v e l sa t5m i n u t e sa n d3 0m i n u t e safter meditation [ 143]. 3.4.4. Y oga and T ai Chi. Y oga and T ai chi are mind-body practices that both have a long standing history of use. Y ogais generally dened as a practice which consists of threecomponents: gentle stretching, exercises for breath control,and meditation as a mind-body intervention [ 144 ]. T ai chi is practiced in China as both a form of exercise and as a martialart and involves moving from a standing position through aseries of postures like a choreographed dance. Sequences of postures are known as \"forms\" , which require considerable time and concentration to master [ 145]. I nas y s t e m a t i cr e v i e wo fy o g af o ra n x i e t y ,K i r k w o o de t al. [ 144] assessed eight studies for evidence of e cacy in the amelioration of anxiety. Positive results were reported for theeects of yoga treatments of durations up to three months, although many of the studies su ered from methodological limitations such as inadequate randomisation and highdropout rates. Firm conclusions were also hindered by thefact that there was a large diversity in the conditions studied,including OCD, examination anxiety, snake phobia, and theoutdated diagnoses of anxiety neurosis and psychoneurosis[144]. It is interesting to note that the most rigorouslyEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11 conducted study was in 22 adults with OCD, as diagnosed by DSM-III-R. In this small study, three months of yogatreatment was found to provide a signicantly greaterreduction on the Y ale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale(Y-BOCS) and SCL-90-R at endpoint in comparison tothe relaxation response and mindfulness meditation control group [ 146]. A recent systematic review of the e ects of T ai chi on psychological health and well-being was conducted by Wanget al. [ 147]. While not relating directly to clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders per se, the authors identied two RCTsand six nonrandomised studies which reported T ai chi tobe associated with a signicant reduction in anxiety whenp r a c t i c e dt w ot of o u rt i m e saw e e k( 3 0t o6 0m i n u t e s / t i m e )for ve to 24 weeks. The overall e ect size (Hedge's g) associated with reduction in anxiety symptoms betweengroups was reported to be 0.66. However, it should benoted that the 359 participants included in the metaanalysispresented with a diverse range of health conditions. Whilethese preliminary ndings are intriguing, further researchusing individuals with formally diagnosed anxiety disordersis required in order to properly test for the e cacy of T ai chi in ameliorating anxiety in clinical populations. In regardsto the putative mechanisms of action of yoga and Tai chiin reducing anxiety, further investigation is also required ino r d e rt op r o p e r l yd i erentiate the e ects of these meditative exercise practices compared to normal physical activity orother relaxation techniques. 3.4.5. Conclusions. In summary, while research into the eectiveness of meditative techniques in the treatment of anxiety is still in its infancy, a number of studies in clinicalpopulations have provided encouraging preliminary data of a potential benet for MBSR technique in GAD, SP and PD, and insu cient but encouraging evidence for yoga and T ai chi for the treatment of general anxiety. However, for OCD,it is di cult at this stage to properly gauge the e cacy of these techniques due to the scarcity of current research usingmindfulness interventions. 3.5. Diet and Nutrition 3.5.1. Overview. Public health and governmental agencies support a balanced diet low in processed foods and richin fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, sh, and lean meats as part of a healthy lifestyle [ 148]. Such a diet reduces the risk of developing numerous medical disorders includingcardiovascular disease [ 149] and some cancers [ 150]. There is now emerging evidence that diet also a ects our mental health, although the relationship appears to be complexand bidirectional. Many would recognise that changes instress levels influence our dietary choices. In a study of selfreported eating behavior, Oliver and Wardle [ 151]n o t e d that although people di erentially increase or decrease their food intake when anxious and stressed, the choice of foodappears to consistently move away from normal meal-type foods toward high fat, high palatable snacks. Thisnding appears independent of gender or dieting status.Such changes in stress induced dietary choices have been extensively replicated [ 152]. However, this phenomenon may not necessarily extend to people with chronic mentaldisorders, such as MDD, as some may in fact better their dietin an attempt to improve their mental health [ 153]. 3.5.2. Epidemiological Evidence. Research into the role of diet on mental health is still developing and few studies haveassessed this in anxiety-disordered populations. However,literature reporting on the relationships between diet qualityand anxiety in population-based observational studies doesprovide some insight. The rst study to examine theassociation between whole diet and clinical anxiety anddepressive illnesses was conducted in population-based sam- ple of Australian women [ 153]. In this cross-sectional study, women scoring higher on a \"traditional\" (healthy) dietarypattern, comprising fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and leanred meats, were less likely to have either an anxiety disorderor MDD or dysthymia, assessed using a gold-standardclinical interview. In this study, higher scores on a \"Western\"(unhealthy) dietary pattern were associated with an increasedlikelihood of depressive illness (OR: 1.38), but not anxietydisorders. Similarly, in a cross-sectional analysis of a largesample of middle-aged and elderly adults from Norway,higher scores on an ap r i o r i diet quality score (compris- ing vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, sh, and nonprocessedmeats) was found to be associated with reduced likelihoodof anxiety, measured on the HADS, in women (OR: 0.77),and with reduced case-level depression in both men (OR:0.83) and women, (OR: 0.71) before and after adjustmentfor age, income, education, physical activity, smoking, andalcohol consumption [ 154]. Conversely, consumption of a \"Western diet\" (comprised of processed meats, pizza, saltysnacks, chocolates, sugars and sweets, soft drinks, margarine,French fries, beer, co ee, cake, and ice cream) was associated with signicantly increased likelihood of anxiety, but notdepression, in men and women [ 154]. 3.5.3. Mechanisms of Action. Although incompletely under- stood, numerous studies provide some insight into themechanisms of the diet-anxiety interaction. As in humans,increased stress in rats is associated with increased con-sumption of highly palatable foods [ 155]. In the \"drive induction hypothesis\" [ 156] this association is thought to result from the e ects of stress induced elevated glucocor- ticoids (GC). Elevated GC are hypothesised to cross the blood brain barrier and act directly on central pathways mediating appetite behaviors (increasing motivation forconsumption). As this occurs, peripheral elevations of GCfacilitate increased negative feedback blunting central stressresponses. There is some evidence that intake of highfat diets may provide selective protection against certainanxiety states. In a study of rats fed a chronic high fatdiet, certain antidepressant-sensitive anxiety behaviors (e.g.,from the forced swim test), and those provoked by thelight-dark box test, appeared reduced but anhedonic andsocial avoidance behaviors remained unchanged [ 157]. The short-term protective e ects of highly palatable food may12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine however lead to adverse long-term consequences. Recent evidence has demonstrated that intake of highly palatablefoods is associated with increased production of reactiveoxygen species (ROS) [ 158]. Increased ROS production and subsequent oxidative stress are postulated to contribute tothe development of anxiety disorders [ 159]. In respect to which nutrients from the diet may have an anxiolytic e ect, numerous studies have identied the relationship between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acidsand depression and anxiety. Decreased omega-3 and anincreased omega-6 to omega 3 ratio are associated withan increased rate of depression in some studies [ 160, 161]. Similarly, decreased levels of omega-3 have been associated with increased SP [ 162], while low levels of DHA consumption exhibited a cross sectional relationshipwith anxiety disorders in a large population cohort (Jackaet al., 2012, unpublished data). In one recently reportedRCT, supplemental omega-3 was compared to placebo ina group of medical students on depressive and anxietysymptoms and levels of various inflammatory mediators[163]. The students who received omega-3 supplementation showed a 14% reduction in lipopolysaccharide stimulatedinterleukin 6 (IL-6) and 20% reduction in anxiety symptomsmeasured on the BAI. Interestingly, no e ect was found on depressive symptoms. Other dietary elements includingmagnesium [ 164] and zinc [ 165] also appear related to mental health status [ 166], and have preclinical animal model evidence of anxiolytic and antidepressant e ects [ 167, 168], however, empirical studies have not yet conrmed any therapy e ect of supplementation for anxiety disor- ders. 3.5.4. Conclusions. While prospective studies are currently limited, the emerging body of evidence encourages the recommendation for bettering general mental health byadopting a diet rich in lean protein, complex carbohydrates,fruit and vegetables, with adequate omega 3; and low inrened carbohydrates, saturated fats, and processed foods.At present however, no clinical trial has been conductedassessing the e ect of a healthy diet versus a suitable control, to establish whether dietary modication is benecial intreating anxiety disorders. 3.6. Substance Use/Misuse (Alcohol, Ca eine, Nicotine) 3.6.1. Overview. There is a solid body of evidence linking lifestyle factors with depression. Modiable factors impact-ing on risk, course and outcome include alcohol, smoking,recreational drugs, diet, and exercise. The same is true ofanxiety, although the body of clinical and epidemiologicaldata is larger in depression than in anxiety. There is howevera well-replicated relationship between anxiety disorders andsubstance use. The use of all drugs of dependence (smoking,alcohol, opiates) result in an enduring withdrawal stateinterrupted by periodic intoxications. This is mediated bythe homeostatic adaptation to the persistent presence ofexogenous drugs. Substance abuse can also be seen asa maladaptive coping strategy that procrastinates havingto manage the source of the dysphoria or anxiety and undermines the development of adaptive strategies [ 169]. Substance use may mitigate anxiety symptoms in the short-term. However, the use of tobacco and/or alcohol predisposespeople to the development of anxiety over time by producingchronic withdrawal symptoms, reduced health quality, and the possible precipitation of somatic or emotional symptoms that maintain anxiety [ 170]. It is however, important to note that not all individuals who have anxiety abuse substances;other vulnerability factors, including personality, socialsupport, development and attachment, and genetics, mediatethis relationship. From a management perspective, anxietyand concurrent substance abuse require integrated manage-ment. While there are few trials for management of comorbidsubstance use and anxiety [ 171], CBT, for example, has been shown to be useful for substance abuse related anxiety [ 172]. 3.6.2. Nicotine. Smoking is more common in those with anxiety, particularly PD [ 173], and those with anxiety smoke for longer periods, increasing the predisposition to smoking-related complications. In the Australian Survey of MentalHealth and Wellbeing [ 174], over a fth of adult smokers reported 12-month anxiety disorders. There was a dosedependant relationship between smoking rates and illnessseverity, however, smoking rates were doubled even amongthose with mild anxiety. Complicating management, smok-ers with anxiety were less likely to attempt cessation. Smok-ing cessation specically for the treatment of anxiety has notbeen formally examined in rigorous clinical trials, however,anxiety is noted to increase withdrawal symptoms in thecontext of smoking cessation [ 175]. People with anxiety or depression are as likely as those without these symptomsto want to stop smoking, but are less likely to make aquit attempt [ 176]. Smoking cessation, importantly, does not appear to increase anxiety or depression after quittingand might reduce symptoms, although data are inconsistent[177-179]. Cigarettes modulate perception of emotional and somatic states via postsynaptic nicotinic receptor agonism, and ultimately downregulate dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, the site of the reward system [ 180]. 3.6.3. Ca eine. Ca eine is perhaps the most commonly used psychoactive substance. It is perceived to increase attention,alertness, cognition, and mood, with some individuals withdysphoric mood being predisposed to use it more heavily, tapping into its mood-elevating potential (via activation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways) [ 181]. As a common consequence of overuse, this psychostimulant mayincrease arousal and subsequent anxiety and insomnia [ 182]. It additionally carries the potential for mild drug depen-dence. Those with anxiety disorders, including PD and SP ,are especially sensitive to the anxiogenic e ects of ca eine. The e ects of oral administration of ca eine (10 mg/kg) in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteriafor agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder foundcaeine produced signicantly greater increases in subject- rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, palpitations, restlessness,and tremors compared with healthy controls [ 183]. Ca eineEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 13 also increased plasma cortisol levels in both the anxious and healthy groups. Ca eine modulates the adenosine system, while the anxiogenic potential of ca eine is influenced in part by polymorphisms of the A2A receptor [ 184]. While evi- dence supports the avoidance of ca eine in anxiety disorders, a contrary therapeutic approach involves using ca eine to provoke panic attacks (similar to inducement from exercise), in order to train the person via a ca eine \"challenge test\" to manage these anxiogenic symptoms [ 185]. While prospective studies have not evaluated the e ect of ca eine reduc- tion/avoidance in people with anxiety disorders, pragmati-cally, those with anxiety symptoms who have large amountsof ca eine should be counselled to moderate their intake. 3.6.4. Alcohol. Approximately half of people receiving treat- ment for an alcohol misuse or abuse disorder also su er with an anxiety or depressive disorder [ 186]. Alcohol misuse or abuse may prompt acute withdrawal anxiety, via an increasedlevel of stimulatory glutamate, and a desensitization of GABA pathways [ 187]. Furthermore, long-term alcohol use may reduce levels or critical nutrients required for neuro-logical function, such as B vitamins [ 188]. A metaanalysis of RCTs that reviewed additional focused treatment of alcoholuse disorder in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders(GAD, PD, SP) found a signicant e ect for both drug and CBT interventions for reducing anxiety, with a pooled e ect size ( d)o f0 . 5 2[ 189]. This e ect was also signicant for addressing alcohol reduction with an e ect size of 0.27. As anxiety disorders are also highly comorbid with alcohol abuse and dependence [ 190], there appears to be a bidirectional relationship between alcohol use and anxiety,such that each disorder can maintain or exacerbate the other.This relationship appears most relevant in young people,the age of genesis of most adult patterns of illness [ 191]. The coaggregation of these disorders has a range of potential explanations. The \"self-medication\" hypothesis suggests thatpeople use alcohol to reduce anxiety, emotional distress ordysphoric a ective symptoms [ 192], and thus patients with aective or anxiety disorders should be screened for alcohol misuse. 3.6.5. Conclusions. While the link between substance misuse and generalised anxiety or anxiety disorders has beenestablished, further therapeutic treatment approaches arerequired. At present, CAM treatments such as herbalmedicines or acupuncture appear to not have su ciently supportive evidence in addressing alcohol misuse or abuse disorder [ 193,194]. Regardless, it is likely these may have a role as \"supportive\" interventions rather than treatmentsper se. An erudite clinical position is to encourage with-drawal/reduction of alcohol, nicotine and ca eine with appropriate health professional supervision. 4. Discussion Across the breadth of the literature reviewed, many non-conventional interventions provide promise for assistingin reducing anxiety and treating anxiety disorders. Of thenutraceuticals reviewed, the only intervention currently supported by evidence is Kava, while preliminary evidenceis extended for a range of nutraceuticals. Currently, ofthe CAM modalities reviewed, naturopathic medicine hasone supportive un-replicated study, while acupuncture andmassage have preliminary evidence, although the area su ers from poor methodology and the common use of nonclinical samples. Present evidence does not support homeopathyas a treatment to reduce anxiety. This review suggeststhat supportive evidence exists for the recommendation oflifestyle modications including moderate graded exercise,mindfulness meditation techniques, and ca eine minimisa- tion. While no prospective studies support the use of dietarymodication as an intervention, the epidemiological evi-dence supports dietary improvement. Restriction of lifestylevices such as alcohol and nicotine appears to be benecial inreducing anxiety, although more data are needed, specicallythe study of assisted substance-withdrawal programs onanxiety disorders, and controlled prospective studies. Oneconsideration regarding the impact of lifestyle modicationin addressing anxiety disorders that is challenging to teaseapart scientically, is the e ect that by altering behavior (e.g., a new dietary pattern or exercise), this will usually cause arange of psychosocial changes that may also be therapeutic. Currently, a notable gap in the literature concerns the decit in our understanding of the impact of healthy dietarychange on anxiety disorders. Surprisingly, to date there havebeen no quality RCTs investigating the impact of wholedietary improvement in those with an anxiety or depressivedisorders. As such, further such investigations would assist in making specic dietary recommendations in mental health treatment. Regarding MBSR as a treatment, future researchwould benet from the following guidelines; (i) the e ects of MBSR needs to be clearly di erentiated according to the varied anxiety disorders, (ii) greater e o r tn e e d st ob em a d e to include a suitable control group, and (iii) there needsto be stricter adherence to the standardised MBSR protocoltogether with more detailed documentation of treatmentcompliance. It would be valuable to also consider the e cacy of longer term meditation and mindfulness techniques inthe treatment of anxiety and the prevention of relapse.Given that these techniques have traditionally been used asa daily practice over the course of the lifetime, it would beinformative to conduct studies of longer duration. Advice for clinicians wishing to institute lifestyle, self- help or CAM interventions in patients with anxiety disorderscenters initially upon considerations such as their patients'diagnosis and state of distress, current medication, psychoso-cial factors, personal preferences, and nancial resources.Specic considerations include assessment of a patient'sphysical health if prescribing exercise, as is referral for appro-priate assessment. Dietary modications should be delicatelyinstituted as patients may nd change di cult if using food as a psychological crutch. Referral to dieticians, often acces- sible through the public system, may be of benet to some. Considerations regarding nutraceuticals include potentialinteractions with medications, thus pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamic elements need to be assessed. Cost ofthese supplements is also a factor, with some high-quality14 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine standardised nutraceuticals being expensive. CAM research needs to be increased, as currently many nutraceuticalsand modalities have either unreplicated studies, or studiesusing poor methodology. Reduction of vices such as alcohol,caeine and nicotine may initially exacerbate anxiety and should therefore be undertaken in a graded and supported fashion. Limitations to this metareview include a nonsystematic approach to data inclusion. Regardless, a narrative inclusivemethodology was employed specically to cover both anover-arching cross section of the literature, and to providea clinically relevant narrative for readers. Only Englishlanguage studies were included, which may have discountedother important evidence. A nal limitation is that, as thearea covered was very broad, an intricate written analysisof the data was not possible due to publication spacerestrictions. In summary, a range of CAM, lifestyle and self-help interventions hold promise as adjunctive approaches topsychological and pharmacological interventions to reduceanxiety and treat anxiety disorders. Future focus can involvethe use of integrated approaches combining evidence-basedapproaches to address lifestyle, psychological, biological, andsociological determinants of these disorders.
