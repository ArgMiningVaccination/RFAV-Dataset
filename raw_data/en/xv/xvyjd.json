Genome-Wide Association Study of Metachronous Colorectal Adenoma Risk among Participants in the 75(1), 143-153. [More info](#more-journal-publication0)Genetic variants related to colorectal adenoma may help identify those who are at highest risk of colorectal cancer development or illuminate potential chemopreventive strategies. The purpose of this genome-wide association study was to identify genetic variants that are associated with risk of developing a metachronous colorectal adenoma among 1,215 study participants of European descent from the Selenium Trial. Associations of variants were assessed with logistic regression analyses and validated in an independent case-control study population of 1,491 participants from the Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA). No statistically significant genome-wide associations between any variant and metachronous adenoma were identified after correction for multiple comparisons. However, an intron variant of gene, rs61901554, showed a suggestive association ( = 1.10 \u00d7 10) and was associated with advanced adenomas in CORSA ( = 0.04). Two intronic variants, rs12728998 and rs6699944 in were also observed to suggestive associations with metachronous lesions ( = 2.00 \u00d7 10) in the Selenium Trial and were associated with advanced adenoma in CORSA ( = 0.03). Our results provide new areas of investigation for the genetic basis of the development of metachronous colorectal adenoma and support a role for involvement in the Wnt/-catenin pathway leading to colorectal neoplasia.Trial Registration number: NCT00078897 (ClinicalTrials.gov). - Ashouri, Y., Ho, K., Ho, H., Hsu, C.

This paper describes the Community-Based Participatory Research processes and assessment of cancer screening behavior and the appropriateness of the mHealth approach for Hopi men's promotion of cancer screenings. This Community-Based Participatory Research included a partnership with H.O.P.I. (Hopi Office of Prevention and Intervention) Cancer Support Services and the Hopi Community Advisory Committee. Cellular phone usage was assessed among male participants in a wellness program utilizing text messaging. Community surveys were conducted with Hopi men (50 years of age or older). The survey revealed colorectal cancer screening rate increased from 51% in 2012 to 71% in 2018, while prostate cancer screening rate had not changed (35% in 2012 and 37% in 2018). Past cancer screening was associated with having additional cancer screening. A cellular phone was commonly used by Hopi men, but not for healthcare or wellness. Cellular phone ownership increased odds of prostate cancer screening in the unadjusted model (OR 9.00, 95% CI: 1.11-73.07), but not in the adjusted model. Cellular phones may be applied for health promotion among Hopi men, but use of cellular phones to improve cancer screening participation needs further investigation. - Bauman, J. E., Hsu, C.

Randomized Crossover Trial Evaluating Detoxification of Tobacco Carcinogens by Broccoli Seed and Sprout Extract in Current Smokers. Cancers, 14(9). [More info](#more-journal-publication4)Consumption of cruciferous vegetables, rich in the isothiocyanate glucoraphanin, is associated with reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers. Sulforaphane, released by hydrolysis of glucoraphanin, potently induces cytoprotective phase II enzymes. Sulforaphane decreased the incidence of oral cancer in the 4NQO carcinogenesis model. In residents of Qidong, China, broccoli seed and sprout extracts (BSSE) increased detoxification of air pollutants benzene and acrolein, also found in tobacco smoke. This randomized, crossover trial evaluated detoxification of tobacco carcinogens by the BSSE Avmacol in otherwise healthy smokers. Participants were treated for 2 weeks with both low and higher-dose BSSE (148 \u00b5mol vs. 296 \u00b5mol washout, randomization to low-high vs. high-low sequence. The primary endpoint was detoxification of benzene, measured by urinary excretion of its mercapturic acid, SPMA. crotonaldehyde, modulation by genotype, and toxicity. Forty-nine participants enrolled, including 26 (53%) females with median use of 20 cigarettes/day. Low and higher-dose BSSE showed a mean 0.04), acrolein ( < 0.01), and crotonaldehyde ( = 0.02), independent of genotype. Retention and compliance were high resulting in early study completion. In conclusion, BSSE significantly upregulated detoxification of the tobacco carcinogens benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde in current tobacco smokers. - Cruz, A., Dickerson, F., Pulling, K.

Impacts of Neighborhood Characteristics and Surgical Treatment Disparities on Overall Mortality in Stage I Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients. International journal of environmental research and public health, 19(4). [More info](#more-journal-publication5)Racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States have high renal cell carcinoma (RCC) mortality rates. This study assessed surgical treatment disparities across racial/ethnic groups and impacts of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics on surgical treatments and overall mortality. Stage I RCC patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2016 from National Cancer Database were included (n = 238,141). We assessed differences in associations between race/ethnicity and treatment patterns using logistic regression and between race/ethnicity and overall mortality using Cox regression with and without neighborhood characteristics in the regression models. When compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), American Indians/Alaska Natives and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) were more likely not to receive surgical care and all racial/ethnic minority groups had significantly increased odds of undergoing radical rather than partial nephrectomy, even after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics. Including surgical treatment and neighborhood factors in the models slightly attenuated the association, but NHBs had a significantly increased risk of overall mortality. NHBs who underwent radical nephrectomy had an increased risk of mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.23), but not for (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.84-1.02). Neighborhood factors were associated with surgical treatment patterns and overall mortality in both NHBs and NHWs. Neighborhood socioeconomic factors may only partly explain RCC disparities. - Gachupin, F. C., Lee, B. R., Chipollini, J., Pulling, K. R., Cruz, A., Wong, A. C., Valencia, C. I., Hsu, C.

International journal of environmental research and public health, 19(3). [More info](#more-journal-publication6)American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Hispanic Americans (HA) have higher kidney cancer incidence and mortality rates compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Herein, we describe the disparity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) surgical treatment for AI/AN and HA and the potential association with mortality in Arizona. A total of 5111 stage I RCC cases diagnosed between 2007 and 2016 from the Arizona Cancer Registry were included. Statistical analyses were performed to test the association of race/ethnicity with surgical treatment pattern and overall mortality, adjusting for patients' demographic, healthcare access, and socioeconomic factors. AI/AN were diagnosed 6 years younger than NHW and were more likely to receive radical rather than partial nephrectomy (OR 1.49 95% CI: 1.07-2.07) compared to NHW. Mexican Americans had increased odds of not undergoing surgical treatment (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.08-2.53). Analysis showed that not undergoing surgical treatment and undergoing radical nephrectomy were statistically significantly associated with higher overall mortality (HR 1.82 95% CI: 1.21-2.76 and HR 1.59 95% CI: 1.30-1.95 respectively). Mexican Americans, particularly U.S.-born Mexican Americans, had an increased risk for overall mortality and RCC-specific mortality even after adjusting for neighborhood socioeconomic factors and surgical treatment patterns. Although statistically not significant after adjusting for neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors and surgical treatment patterns, AI/AN had an elevated risk of mortality. - Gachupin, F.

Clinical Study of Aspirin and Zileuton on Biomarkers of Carcinogenesis in Current Smokers. Cancers, of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on lung cancer risk is supported by epidemiologic and preclinical studies. Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, has additive activity with NSAIDs against tobacco carcinogenesis in preclinical models. We hypothesized that cyclooxygenase plus 5-lipoxygenase inhibition would be more effective than a placebo in modulating the nasal epithelium gene signatures of tobacco exposure and lung cancer. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study of low-dose aspirin plus zileuton vs. double placebo in current smokers to compare the modulating effects on nasal gene expression and arachidonic acid metabolism. In total, 63 participants took aspirin 81 mg daily plus zileuton (Zyflo CR) 600 mg BID or the placebo for 12 weeks. Nasal brushes from the baseline, end-of-intervention, and one-week post intervention were profiled via microarray. Aspirin plus zilueton had minimal effects on the modulation of the nasal or bronchial gene expression signatures of smoking, lung cancer, and COPD but favorably modulated a bronchial gene expression signature of squamous dysplasia. Aspirin plus zileuton suppressed urinary leukotriene but not prostaglandin E2, suggesting shunting through the cyclooxygenase pathway when combined with 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Continued investigation of leukotriene inhibitors is needed to confirm these findings, understand the long-term effects on the airway epithelium, and identify the safest, optimally dosed agents. - Ho, K., Hsu, C.

[More info](#more-journal-publication11)Our study assessed the relationship of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) and patient outcomes. We studied patients undergoing V-V ECMO support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between 2009 and 2017 who were reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry. We evaluated survival, major bleeding, renal failure, pulmonary complications, mechanical complications, neurologic complications, infection, and duration of V-V ECMO support. Multivariable regression modeling assessed risk factors for adverse events. Of the 4,636 patients studied, the mean support duration was 12.2 \u00b1 13.7 days. There was a progressive increase in survival after the initiation of V-VECMO, peaking at a survival rate of 73% at 10 days of support. However, a single-day increase in V-V ECMO duration was associated with increased bleeding events (odds ratio [OR] 1.038; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.018; V-V ECMO progressively increases survival for ARDS over the first 10 days of support. Thereafter, rising complications associated with prolonged durations of support result in a progressive decline in survival. - Komenaka, I. K., Hsu, C. H., Ramos, G. M., Nodora, J., & Martinez, M. E.

[More info](#more-journal-publication17)Kidney stone cultures can be beneficial in identifying bacteria not detected in urine, yet how stone cultures are performed among endourologists, under what conditions, and by what laboratory methods remain largely unknown. Stone cultures are not addressed by current clinical guidelines. A comprehensive REDCap electronic survey sought responses from directed (n = 20) and listserv elicited (n = 108) endourologists specializing in kidney stone disease. Questions included which clinical scenarios prompt a stone culture order, how results influence post-operative antibiotics, and what microbiology lab protocols exist at each institution with respect to processing and resulting stone cultures. Logistic regression statistical analysis determined what factors were associated with performing stone cultures. Of 128 unique responses, 11% identified as female and the mean years of practicing was 16 (range 1-46). A specific 'stone culture' order was available to only 50% (64/128) of those surveyed, while 32% (41/128) reported culturing stone by placing a urine culture order. The duration of antibiotics given for a positive stone culture varied, with 4-7 days (46%) and 8-14 days (21%) the most reported. More years in practice was associated with fewer stone cultures ordered, while higher annual volume of percutaneous nephrolithotomy was associated with ordering more stone cultures (p - Wiseman, J.

Journal of robotic surgery. [More info](#more-journal-publication18)Multiple studies have suggested that three-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is both feasible and safe. However, this approach has failed to gain acceptance outside of clinical trials, leaving adopters of this approach vulnerable to medico-legal scrutiny. We hypothesized that the three-port approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is safe and efficient in experienced hands. All LC (including robotic) cases were performed on patients 18 years and older between November 2018 and March 2020. Operations utilizing three ports were compared to those performed using more than three ports. The primary outcomes measured were total operative time, conversion-to-open rate, and the complication rate. A two-sample test was performed to compare operative times, and a Fisher's exact test was used to compare conversion-to-open and complication rates. Linear regression models were used to account for the effect of confounders. 924 total LCs were performed by 30 surgeons in the study period (71 three-port, 853 four or more ports). The mean operative time was 10 min shorter in the three-port group in comparison (64.1 \u00b1 1.4 min vs. 74.4 \u00b1 1.8 min, p - Wiseman, J. E., Morris-Wiseman, L. F., Hsu, C. H., & Riall, T. S.

Data from the 2014-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey were analyzed to estimate the percentages of adults who reported cancer screening in the last 12 months consistent with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for cervical (ages 21-65), breast (ages 50-74), and colorectal cancer (ages 50-75) prior to the pandemic. Cancer screening percentages for 2020 (April-December excluding January-March) were compared to screening percentages for 2014-2019 to begin to look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening percentages for 2020 were decreased from those for 2014-2019 including several underserved racial groups. Decreases in mammography and colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy were higher among American Indian/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, and multiracial participants, but decreases in pap test were also highest among Hispanics, Whites, Asians, and African-Americans/Blacks. Decreases in mammograms among women ages 40-49 were also seen. As the 2020 comparison is conservative, the 2021 decreases in cancer screening are expected to be much greater and are likely to increase cancer disparities substantially. - Dill-Macky, A., Hsu, C.

[More info](#more-journal-publication33)BACKGROUNDThe aberrant activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling circuitry is one of the most frequently dysregulated signaling events in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we conducted a single-arm, open-label phase IIa clinical trial in individuals with oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) to explore the potential of metformin to target PI3K/mTOR signaling for HNSCC prevention.METHODSIndividuals with OPLs, but who were otherwise healthy and without diabetes, underwent pretreatment and posttreatment clinical exam and biopsy. Participants received metformin for 12 weeks (week 1, 500 mg; week 2, 1000 mg; weeks 3-12, 2000 mg daily). Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies, saliva, and blood were obtained for biomarker analysis, including IHC assessment of mTOR signaling and exome sequencing.RESULTSTwenty-three participants were evaluable for response. The clinical response rate (defined as a 50% reduction in lesion size) was 17%. Although lower than the proposed threshold for favorable clinical response, the histological response rate (improvement in histological grade) was 60%, including 17% complete responses and 43% partial responses. Logistic regression analysis revealed that when compared with never smokers, current and former smokers had statistically significantly increased histological responses (P = 0.016). Remarkably, a significant correlation existed between decreased mTOR activity (pS6 IHC staining) in the basal epithelial layers of OPLs and the histological (P = 0.04) and clinical (P = 0.01) responses.CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge this is the first phase II trial of metformin in individuals with OPLs, providing evidence that metformin administration results in encouraging histological responses and mTOR pathway modulation, thus supporting its further investigation as a chemopreventive agent.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT02581137FUNDINGNIH contract HHSN261201200031I, grants R01DE026644 and R01DE026870. - Harhash, A.

[More info](#more-journal-publication36)Falloposcopy is the endoscopic examination of the fallopian tubes, which are challenging to access due to their deep body location, small opening from the uterus, and lumen filled with plicae. We and others have developed endoscopes that are inserted through the uterus guided by a hysteroscope into the tubal ostium. To better understand how to utilize these endoscopes either as standalone devices or in concert with everting delivery balloons, a preliminary study of anatomy and mechanical behavior was performed on porcine and human fallopian tubes. Segments of fallopian tubes from the isthmus, ampulla and infundibulum were inflated with saline either to bursting or held at sub-burst pressures with saline or a saline-filled balloon. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections stained with Masson's trichrome were examined for damage to the mucosa and muscularis. Porcine fallopian tubes tolerated saline pressurization at 15 psi for 1 minute without morphological damage. Balloon inflation to 15 psi caused no apparent damage to the muscle layer or rupture of the fallopian tube, but balloon movement within the tube can denude the mucosal epithelial layer. Human fallopian tubes averaged higher burst pressure values than porcine tubes. Under pressurization, the external tube diameter expanded by minimal to moderate amounts. Human and porcine tissues were similar in histological appearance. These studies suggest that moderate pressurization is acceptable but will not appreciably expand the fallopian tube diameter. The results also indicate that pigs are a reasonable model to study damage from falloscopy as seen in human tissue. - Knobbe, K., Partha, M., Seckeler, M. D., Klewer, S., Hsu, C.

[More info](#more-journal-publication41)Racial/ethnic minority groups have a disproportionate burden of kidney cancer. The objective of this study was to assess if race/ethnicity was associated with a longer surgical wait time (SWT) and upstaging in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic time with a special focus on Hispanic Americans (HAs) and American Indian/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs). Medical records of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who underwent nephrectomy between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed ( = 489). Patients with a prior cancer diagnosis were excluded. SWT was defined as the date of diagnostic imaging examination to date of nephrectomy. Out of a total of 363 patients included, 34.2% were HAs and 8.3% were AIs/ANs. While 49.2% of HA patients experienced a longer SWT (90 days), 36.1% of Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients experienced a longer SWT. Longer SWT had no statistically significant impact on tumor characteristics. Patients with public insurance coverage had increased odds of longer SWT (OR 2.89, 95% CI: 1.53-5.45). Public insurance coverage represented HA and AIs/ANs compared to 56.7% in NHWs. Compared to NHWs, HAs had higher odds for longer SWT in patients with early-stage odds of upstaging compared to NHWs. While a delay in surgical care for early-stage RCC is safe in a general population, it may negatively impact high-risk populations, such as HAs who have a prolonged SWT or choose active surveillance. - Scarritt, T., Hsu, C.

The Feasibility of Tai Chi Exercise as a Beneficial Mind-Body Intervention in a Group of Community-Dwelling Stroke Survivors with Symptoms of Depression. Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM, 2021, 8600443. [More info](#more-journal-publication43)Depression is prevalent among one-third to two-thirds of acute and chronic stroke survivors. Despite the availability of pharmacotherapies and/or psychotherapies, depression persists, even for 5-10 years after stroke, reflecting limited treatment responses and/or adherence to this conventional care. Mind-body interventions are commonly used among adults to ameliorate depressive symptoms. Thus, the feasibility of Tai Chi, alongside conventional care, to manage poststroke depression was investigated using a single-group pre-post intervention design. Recruitment and retention, intervention adherence, safety, acceptability, and fidelity were assessed. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using standardized questionnaires, objective sleep was assessed via a research-grade triaxial accelerometer, and blood samples were taken to measure oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and a neurotrophic growth factor using commercially available kits per manufacturer's protocol. Pre-post intervention changes were assessed using paired -tests. We enrolled stroke survivors ( = 11, mean age = 69.7 \u00b1 9.3) reporting depression symptoms. After the intervention, we observed significant reductions in symptoms of depression (-5.3 \u00b1 5.9, =0.01), anxiety better sleep efficiency (+1.8 1.8, =0.01), less wakefulness after sleep onset =0.04), and less time awake (-9.3 \u00b1 11.6, =0.04). There was a 36% decrease in oxidative stress (=0.02), though no significant changes in the other biomarkers were found (all values >0.05). Tai Chi exercise is a feasible intervention that can be used alongside conventional care to manage poststroke depression, aid in reducing symptoms of anxiety and stress, and improve sleep. - Valencia, C.

Renal Cell Carcinoma Health Disparities in Stage and Mortality among American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanic Americans: Comparison of National Cancer Database and Arizona Cancer Registry Data. Cancers, 13(5). [More info](#more-journal-publication44)Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the top 10 cancers in the United States. This study assessed RCC health disparities in American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) and Hispanic Americans (HAs) focusing on advanced-stage and mortality. RCC patients' data were obtained from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and Arizona Cancer Registry (ACR). Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to ascertain the effect of race/ethnicity on stage and mortality, adjusting for neighborhood socioeconomic factors, rural/urban residence pattern, and other factors. In both data sets, AIs/ANs had significantly increased odds of advanced-stage RCC in the unadjusted model, but not in adjusted models. Mexican Americans had higher odds of advanced-stage compared to non-Hispanic Whites in NCDB (OR 1.22, 1.11-1.35) and ACR (OR 2.02, CI: 1.58-2.58), even after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics. AIs/ANs did not show increased mortality risk in NCDB after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics, while the association remained significant in ACR (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.03-1.72). The great risk of all-cause and RCC-specific mortality was observed in U.S.-born Mexican Americans in Arizona (HR 3.21, 95% disparities in AIs/ANs is partially explained by neighborhood factors, but not in HAs. - Batai, K., Sanderson, P.

A multiple imputation-based sensitivity analysis approach for data subject to missing not at random. Statistics in medicine, 39(26), 3756-3771. [More info](#more-journal-publication53)Missingness mechanism is in theory unverifiable based only on observed data. If there is a suspicion of missing not at random, researchers often perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of various missingness mechanisms. In general, sensitivity analysis approaches require a full specification of the relationship between missing values and missingness probabilities. Such relationship can be specified based on a selection model, a pattern-mixture model or a shared parameter model. Under the selection modeling framework, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach using a nonparametric multiple imputation strategy. The proposed approach only requires specifying the correlation coefficient between missing values and selection (response) probabilities under a selection model. The correlation coefficient is a standardized measure and can be used as a natural sensitivity analysis parameter. The sensitivity analysis involves multiple imputations of missing values, yet the sensitivity parameter is only used to select imputing/donor sets. Hence, the proposed approach might be more robust against misspecifications of the sensitivity parameter. For illustration, the proposed approach is applied to incomplete measurements of level of preoperative Hemoglobin A1c, for patients who had high-grade carotid artery stenosisa and were scheduled for surgery. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. - Kazui, T., Lick, S. D., Hsu, C. H., & Bull, D. A. (2020).

Patients undergoing CABG from January 2008 to December 2016 reported to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: use of BIMA or use of SIMA and propensity matched. To assess the effect of preoperative HbA1c, both groups were further divided into 5 subgroups: patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), or patients with DM and a preoperative HbA1c level in one of four groups (< 7%, 7-9%, 9-11%, or >11%). The postoperative outcomes in both the BIMA and SIMA groups were compared. There were 700,504 and 28,115 patients with measured preoperative HbA1c levels in the SIMA and BIMA groups, respectively. Propensity score matching identified 23,635 comparable patients in each group for analysis. There was no difference in postoperative mortality between the BIMA and SIMA groups (1.3% vs 1.2%). The incidences of sternal wound infection (SWI) patients placement of BIMA vs SIMA were: 0.8% vs 0.4% with 1.0% HbA1c vs 1.5% with HbA1c > 11% (P = 0.01).

Kallikrein 6 protease advances colon tumorigenesis induction of in primary tumors of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and has been associated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor prognosis. We previously established a unique contribution of KLK6 in colon cancer metastasis via a specific network of microRNAs and mRNAs. Here we evaluated the cellular functions of KLK6 protease in Caco-2 colon adenocarcinoma cell line after introduction of the enzymatically active or inactive form of the enzyme. We found that proteolytically active KLK6 increased Caco-2 cells invasiveness and decreased the animal survival in the orthotopic colon cancer model. The active KLK6 induced phosphorylation of SMAD 2/3 proteins leading to the altered expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. KLK6 overexpression also induced the RNA-binding protein LIN28B and high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) transcription factor, two essential regulators of cell invasion and metastasis. In the CRC patients, KLK6 protein levels were elevated in the non-cancerous distant and adjacent tissues, compared to their paired tumor tissues ( < 0.0001 and = 0.0157, respectively). Patients with mutant K-RAS tumors had significantly higher level of KLK6 protein in the luminal surface of non-cancerous distant tissue, compared to the corresponding tissues of the patients with K-RAS wild type tumors ( 0.05). Furthermore, KLK6 and HMGA2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores in patients' tumors and paired adjacent tissues positively correlated (Spearman correlation < 0.01 and = 0.03, respectively). These findings demonstrate the critical function of the KLK6 enzyme in colon cancer progression and its contribution to the signaling network in colon cancer. - Combs, D., Goodwin III, J.

Effect of Intermittent Versus Continuous Low-Dose Aspirin on Nasal Epithelium Gene Expression in Current Smokers: A Randomized, Double-Blinded prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 12(11), 809-820. [More info](#more-journal-publication63)A chemopreventive effect of aspirin (ASA) on lung cancer risk is supported by epidemiologic and preclinical studies. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study in current heavy smokers to compare modulating effects of intermittent versus continuous low-dose ASA on nasal epithelium gene expression and arachidonic acid (ARA) metabolism. Fifty-four participants were randomized to intermittent (ASA 81 mg daily for one week/placebo for one week) or continuous (ASA 81 mg daily) for 12 weeks. Low-dose ASA suppressed urinary prostaglandin E2 13.79 ng/mg creatinine for arms combined, = 0.02), a surrogate of COX-mediated ARA metabolism, but had minimal effects on nasal gene expression of nasal or bronchial gene-expression signatures associated with smoking, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Suppression of urinary PGEM correlated with favorable changes in a smoking-associated gene signature ( < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that ASA intervention led to 1,079 enriched gene sets from the Canonical Pathways within the Molecular Signatures Database. In conclusion, low-dose ASA had minimal effects on known carcinogenesis gene signatures in nasal epithelium of current smokers but results in wide-ranging genomic changes in the nasal epithelium, demonstrating utility of nasal brushings as a surrogate to measure gene-expression responses to chemoprevention. PGEM may serve as a marker for smoking-associated gene-expression changes and systemic inflammation. Future studies should focus on NSAIDs or agent combinations with broader inhibition of pro-inflammatory ARA metabolism to shift gene signatures in an anti-carcinogenic direction. - Gondal, A.

Subtherapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs) occur frequently while on warfarin therapy. An effective anticoagulant bridge strategy may improve the care of these patients. This retrospective review of MCS patients with subtherapeutic INRs compared Native thromboelastography (n-TEG) was used to evaluate anticoagulant effect with coagulation index (CI) as the primary outcome measure. Enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg SC q12hrs or fondaparinux 2.5-5 mg SC daily were compared with an initial UFH rate of 5 units/kg/hr and titrated to stated n-TEG goal range. The anticoagulant groups UFH, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux were found to be statistically similar with regard to frequency in n-TEG goal range, above range (hypercoagulability), or below range (hypocoagulability). Clinical outcomes were similar among groups with three gastrointestinal bleeds in UFH, one in enoxaparin, and one in fondaparinux groups. Device thrombosis occurred in one UFH patient, while UFH and fondaparinux groups had one ischemic cerebrovascular accident event each. These strategies provided comparable n-TEG results and clinical outcomes when compared with intravenous UFH. Low-dose enoxaparin or fondaparinux may provide an alternative bridging option in MCS patients presenting with subtherapeutic INR. - Gondal, A. B., Hsu, C.

Cox regression analysis with missing covariates via nonparametric multiple imputation. Statistical methods in medical research, 962280218772592. [More info](#more-journal-publication81)We consider the situation of estimating Cox regression in which some covariates are subject to missing, and there exists additional information (including observed event time, censoring indicator and fully observed covariates) which may be predictive of the missing covariates. We propose to use two working regression models: one for predicting the missing covariates and the other for predicting the missing probabilities. For each missing covariate observation, these two working models are used to define a nearest neighbor imputing set. This set is then used to non-parametrically impute covariate values for the missing observation. Upon the completion of imputation, Cox regression is performed on the multiply imputed datasets to estimate the regression coefficients. In a simulation study, we compare the nonparametric multiple imputation approach with the augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) method, which directly incorporates the two working models into estimation of Cox regression, and the predictive mean matching imputation (PMM) method. We show that all approaches can reduce bias due to non-ignorable missing mechanism. The proposed nonparametric imputation method is robust to mis-specification of either one of the two working models and robust to mis-specification of the link function of the two working models. In contrast, the PMM method is sensitive to misspecification of the covariates included in imputation. The AIPW method is sensitive to the selection probability. We apply the approaches to a breast cancer dataset from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. - Kohler, L. N., Florea, A., Kelley, C.

Nutrients, 10(12). [More info](#more-journal-publication83)Several studies have investigated the potential role of selenium (Se) in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with disparate findings. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence of any association between Se and T2D. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Approach (PRISMA). Sixteen studies from 15 papers met inclusion criteria defined for this review. Of the 13 observational studies included, 8 demonstrated a statistically significant positive association between concentrations of Se and odds for T2D, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) ranging from 1.52 (1.012.28) to 7.64 (3.3417.46), and a summary odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 2.03 (1.512.72). In contrast, among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of Se, a higher risk of T2D was not observed for those who received Se compared to a placebo (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.951.47). Taken together, the results for the relationship between Se and T2D differ between observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). It remains unclear whether these differences are the result of uncontrolled confounding in the observational studies, or whether there is a modest effect of Se on the risk for T2D that may vary by duration of exposure. Further investigations on the effects of Se on glucose metabolism are needed. - Korovin, L. N., Farrell, T. M., Hsu, C. H., White, M., & Ghaderi, I. (2018).

[More info](#more-journal-publication89)The NSAID sulindac has been successfully used alone or in combination with other agents to suppress colon tumorigenesis in patients with genetic predisposition and also showed its efficacy in prevention of sporadic colon adenomas. At the same time, some experimental and clinical reports suggest that a mutantoncogene may negate sulindac antitumor efficacy. To directly assess sulindac activity at suppressing premalignant lesions carrying K-RAS mutation, we utilized a novel mouse model with an inducible colon-specific expression of the mutantoncogene (). Tumor development and treatment effects were monitored by minimally invasive endoscopic Optical coherence tomography. Expression of the mutantallele accelerated azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis in C57BL/6 mice, a strain otherwise resistant to this carcinogen. Sulindac completely prevented AOM-induced tumor formation inwild-type (wt) animals. In-mutant mice, a 38% reduction in tumor number, an 83% reduction in tumor volume ( 0.01) and an increase in the number of adenoma-free mice (= 0.04) were observed.

Individuals who drop out at the same time point are grouped into the same dropout pattern. We approach extrapolation of the pattern-mixture model by applying multilevel multiple imputation, which imputes missing values while appropriately accounting for the hierarchical data structure found in cluster randomized trials. To assess parameters of interest under various missing data assumptions, imputed values are multiplied by a sensitivity parameter, k, which increases or decreases imputed values. Using simulated data, we show that estimates of parameters of interest can vary widely under differing missing data assumptions. We conduct a sensitivity analysis using real data from a cluster randomized trial by increasing k until the treatment effect inference changes. By performing a sensitivity analysis for missing data, researchers can assess whether certain missing data assumptions are reasonable for their cluster randomized trial. - Habib, S., Khan, K., Hsu, C.

The Science of the to inorganic arsenic (inAs), a potent toxicant, occurs primarily through ingestion of food and water. The efficiency with which it is methylated to mono and dimethyl arsenicals (MMA and DMA) affects toxicity. Folate, vitamins B12 and B6 are required for 1C metabolism, and studies have found that higher levels of these nutrients increase methylation capacity and are associated with protection against adverse health effects from inAs, especially in undernourished populations. Our aim was to determine whether 1C-related nutrients are associated with greater inAs methylation capacity in a general population sample with overall adequate nutrition and low levels of As exposure. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of dietary and blood nutrients to urinary As methylation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004. Outcome variables were the percent of the sum of inAs and methylated As species (inAs+MMA+DMA) excreted as inAs, MMA, and DMA, and the ratio of MMA:DMA. In univariate models, dietary folate, vitamin B6 and protein intake were associated with lower urinary inAs% and greater DMA% in adults (18years), with similar trends in children (6-18). In adjusted models, vitamin B6 intake (p=0.011) and RBC folate (p=0.036) were associated with lower inAs%, while dietary vitamin B12 was associated with higher inAs% (p=0.002) and lower DMA% (p=0.030). Total plasma homocysteine with higher MMA% (p=0.004) and lower DMA% (p=0.003), but not with inAs%; other blood nutrients showed no association with urinary As. Although effect size is small, these findings suggest that 1C nutrients can influence inAs methylation and potentially play an indirect role in reducing toxicity in a general population sample. - Nguyen, M.

Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort. European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP). [More info](#more-journal-publication96)Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue. Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery. Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition. For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 g/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 g/ml, respectively. There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers. We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets. However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms. Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention. - Shweikeh, F., Schwed, A.

Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 9(7), 528-33. [More info](#more-journal-publication105)Prior research strongly implicates gastric acid and bile acids, two major components of the gastroesophageal refluxate, in the development of Barrett's esophagus and its pathogenesis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been shown to protect esophageal cells against oxidative stress induced by cytotoxic bile acids. We conducted a pilot clinical study to evaluate the clinical activity of UDCA in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Twenty-nine patients with Barrett's esophagus received UDCA treatment at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The clinical activity of UDCA was assessed by evaluating changes in gastric bile acid composition and markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), epithelium. The bile acid in gastric fluid were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. At baseline, UDCA (sum of unchanged and glycine/taurine conjugates) accounted for 18.2% of total gastric bile acids. After UDCA intervention, UDCA increased significantly to account for 93.4% of total gastric bile acids (P < 0.0001). The expression of markers of oxidative DNA damage, cell proliferation, and apoptosis was assessed in the Barrett's esophagus biopsies by IHC. The selected tissue biomarkers were unchanged after 6 months of UDCA intervention. We conclude that high-dose UDCA supplementation for 6 months resulted in favorable changes in gastric bile acid composition but did not modulate selected markers of oxidative DNA damage, cell proliferation, and apoptosis article by Brian J.

Double-Blind, Randomized Trial of Alternative Letrozole Dosing Regimens in Postmenopausal Women with Increased Breast Cancer Risk. Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 9(2), 142-8. [More info](#more-journal-publication112)Aromatase inhibitors (AI) profoundly suppress estrogen levels in postmenopausal women and are effective in breast cancer prevention among high-risk postmenopausal women. Unfortunately, AI treatment is associated with undesirable side effects that limit patient acceptance for primary prevention of breast cancer. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to determine whether low and intermittent doses of letrozole can achieve effective estrogen suppression with a more favorable side-effect profile. Overall, 112 postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer were randomized to receive letrozole at 2.5 mg once daily (QD, standard dose arm), 2.5 mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (Q-MWF), 1.0 mg Q-MWF, or 0.25 mg Q-MWF for 24 weeks. Primary endpoint was suppression in serum estradiol levels at the end of letrozole intervention. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum estrone, testosterone, C-telopeptide (marker of bone resorption), lipid profile, and quality-of-life measures (QoL) following treatment. Significant estrogen suppression was observed in all dose arms with an average of 75% to 78% and 86% to 93% reduction in serum estradiol and estrone levels, respectively. There were no differences among dose arms with respect to changes in C-telopeptide levels, lipid profile, adverse events (AE), or QoL measures. We conclude that low and intermittent doses of letrozole are not inferior to standard dose in estrogen suppression and resulted in a similar side-effect profile compared with standard dose. Further studies are needed to determine the feasibility of selecting an effective AI dosing schedule with better tolerability. Cancer Prev AACR. - E. L., Roe, D.

Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift. [More info](#more-journal-publication122)We consider the problem of estimating the marginal mean of an incompletely observed variable and develop a multiple imputation approach. Using fully observed predictors, we first establish two working models: one predicts the missing outcome variable, and the other predicts the probability of missingness. The predictive scores from the two models are used to measure the similarity between the incomplete and observed cases. Based on the predictive scores, we construct a set of kernel weights for the observed cases, with higher weights indicating more similarity. Missing data are imputed by sampling from the observed cases with probability proportional to their kernel weights. The proposed approach can produce reasonable estimates for the marginal mean and has a double robustness property, provided that one of the two working models is correctly specified. It also shows some robustness against misspecification of both models. We demonstrate these patterns in a simulation study. In a real-data example, we analyze the total helicopter response time from injury in the Arizona emergency medical service data. - Hsu, C., Taylor, J. M., & Hu, C. (2015). Analysis of accelerated failure time data with dependent censoring using auxiliary variables via nonparametric multiple imputation. Statistics in medicine, 34(19), 2768-80. [More info](#more-journal-publication123)We consider the situation of estimating the marginal survival distribution from censored data subject to dependent censoring using auxiliary variables. We had previously developed a nonparametric multiple imputation approach. The method used two working proportional hazards (PH) models, one for the event times and the other for the censoring times, to define a nearest neighbor imputing risk set. This risk set was then used to impute failure times for censored observations. Here, we adapt the method to the situation where the event and censoring times follow accelerated failure time models and propose to use the Buckley-James estimator as the two working models. Besides studying the performances of the proposed method, we also compare the proposed method with two popular methods for handling dependent censoring through the use of auxiliary variables, inverse probability of censoring weighted and parametric multiple imputation methods, to shed light on the use of them. In a simulation study with time-independent auxiliary variables, we show that all approaches can reduce bias due to dependent censoring. The proposed method is robust to misspecification of either one of the two working models and their link function. This indicates that a working proportional hazards model is preferred because it is more cumbersome to fit an accelerated failure time model. In contrast, the inverse probability of censoring weighted method is not robust to misspecification of the link function of the censoring time model. The parametric imputation methods rely on the specification of the event time model. The approaches are applied to a prostate cancer dataset. - Kazui, T., Bull, D. A., Hsu, C., Lick, S. D., Lick, S.

[More info](#more-journal-publication128)Arsenic (As) exposure is associated with cancer, lung and cardiovascular disease, yet the mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. Elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels are also associated with these diseases, as well as with exposure to water As. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of dietary components of inorganic As (iAs) intake on serum MMP-9 concentration at differing levels of tap water As. In a cross-sectional study of 214 adults, dietary iAs intake was estimated from 24-h dietary recall interviews using published iAs residue data; drinking and cooking water As intake from water samples and consumption data. Aggregate iAs intake (food plus water) was associated with elevated serum MMP-9 in mixed model regression, with and without adjustment for covariates. In models stratified by tap water As, aggregate intake was a significant positive predictor of serum MMP-9 in subjects exposed to water As10 g/l. Inorganic As from food alone was associated with serum MMP-9 in subjects exposed to tap water As3 g/l. Exposure to iAs from food and water combined, in areas where tap water As concentration is 10 g/l, may contribute to As-induced changes in a biomarker associated with toxicity.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication, 21 January 2015; doi:10.1038/jes.2014.92. - Lane, R.

[More info](#more-journal-publication129)The goal of this study was to determine whether alexithymia, which is characterized by difficulty in recognizing and describing emotions, is associated with impairments in the ability to mentally represent emotional states. We studied 89 outpatients including 29 conversion disorder patients, 30 functional somatic syndrome [e.g. fibromyalgia] patients and 30 medical controls. Groups did not differ on affective or cognitive Theory of Mind (ToM) measures, the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) or the Twenty-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) after adjusting for Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) variables. Across all patients, LEAS but not TAS-20 correlated positively with affective and cognitive ToM measures after adjusting for PANAS scores. Impairments in ToM functioning influence LEAS performance but not TAS-20 scores. These findings support the distinction between a milder \"anomia\" form of alexithymia associated with impaired emotion naming and a more severe \"agnosia\" form associated with impaired mental representation of emotion. - LeGendre-McGhee, S., Rice, P.

Time-serial Assessment of Drug Combination Interventions in a Mouse Model of Colorectal Carcinogenesis Using Optical Coherence Tomography. Cancer modality that enables time-serial assessment of adenoma development in the mouse model of colorectal cancer. In this study, OCT was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions with the experimental antitumor agent -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) [chemotherapy (CT)] of colon tumorigenesis. Biological endpoints for drug interventions included OCT-generated tumor number and tumor burden. Immunochistochemistry studied with polymerase chain reaction-based technique. We demonstrated that OCT imaging significantly correlated with histological analysis of both tumor number and tumor burden for all experimental groups (P < 0.0001), but allows more accurate and full characterization of tumor number and burden growth rate because of its time-serial, nondestructive nature. DFMO alone or in combination with sulindac suppressed both the tumor number and tumor burden growth rate in the CP setting because of DFMO-mediated decrease in cell proliferation (Ki-67, P < 0.001) and K-RAS mutations frequency (P = 0.04). In the CT setting, sulindac alone and DFMO/sulindac combination were effective in reducing tumor number, but not tumor burden growth rate. A decrease in COX-2 staining in DFMO/sulindac CT groups (COX-2, P < 0.01) confirmed the treatment effect. Use of nondestructive OCT enabled repeated, quantitative evaluation of tumor number and burden, allowing changes in these parameters to be measured during CP and as a result of CT. In conclusion, OCT is a robust minimally invasive method for monitoring colorectal cancer disease and effectiveness of therapies in mouse models. - Lee, K. S., Lee, J.

Colorectal adenoma stem-like cell populations: associations with adenoma characteristics Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, 6(11). stem cells have tumor-initiation and tumor-maintenance capabilities. Stem-like cells are present in colorectal adenomas, but their relationship to adenoma pathology and patient characteristics, including metachronous development of an additional adenoma (\"recurrence\"), has not been studied extensively. We evaluated the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1A1 (ALDH1A1), a putative stem cell marker, in baseline adenomas from the placebo arm of chemoprevention trial participants with colonoscopic follow-up. An exploratory set of 20 baseline adenomas was analyzed by ALDH1A1 immunohistochemistry with morphometry, and a replication set of 89 adenomas from 76 high-risk participants was evaluated by computerized image analysis. ALDH1A1-labeling indices (ALI) were similar across patient characteristics and in advanced and nonadvanced adenomas. There was a trend toward higher ALIs in adenomas occurring in the right than left colon (P = 0.09). ALIs of synchronous adenomas were correlated (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.67). Participants in both sample sets who developed a metachronous adenoma had significantly higher ALIs in their baseline adenoma than participants who remained adenoma free. In the replication set, the adjusted odds for metachronous adenoma increased 1.46 for each 10% increase in ALIs (P = 0.03). A best-fit algorithm-based cutoff point of 22.4% had specificity of 75.0% and positive predictive value of 70.0% for metachronous adenoma development. A larger population of ALDH1A1-expressing cells in an adenoma is associated with a higher risk for metachronous adenoma, independent of adenoma size or histopathology. If confirmed, ALDH1A1 has potential as a novel biomarker in risk assessment and as a potential stem cell target for chemoprevention. - Burgess, J. L., Harris, R. B., Hartz, V., Hsu, C., O'Rourke, M.

Initiatives to reduce such disparities have often focused on expanding health insurance coverage for vulnerable populations. Based on our analysis of 2010 data from the National Health Interview Survey, we found that race is a much greater factor than insurance status in accounting for disparities in access to health services. Expanding health insurance through reform initiatives such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may have relatively little impact on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in the US. - Hsu, P. -.

Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology. [More info](#more-journal-publication151)The relative contribution of dietary arsenic (As) to aggregate daily exposure has not been well-characterized, especially in relation to the current EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 p.p.b. for As in drinking water. Our objectives were to: (1) model exposure to inorganic and total As among non-seafood eaters using subject-specific data, (2) compare the contribution of food, drinking and cooking water to estimated aggregate exposure in households with variable background tap water As levels, and (3) describe the upper distribution of potential dose at different thresholds of tap water As. Dietary As intake was modeled in regional study populations and NHANES 2003-2004 using dietary records in conjunction with published food As residue data. Water As was measured in the regional studies. Among subjects exposed to tap water As >10 p.p.b., aggregate inorganic exposure was 24.5-26.1 g/day, with approximately 30% of intake from food. Among subjects living in homes with tap water As 10, 5 or 3 p.p.b., aggregate inorganic As exposure was 8.6-11.8 g/day, with 54-85% of intake from food. Median inorganic As potential dose was 0.42-0.50 g/kg BW/day in subjects exposed to tap water As >10 p.p.b. and less than half that among subjects exposed to tap water As 10 p.p.b. The majority of inorganic and total As exposure is attributable to diet in subjects with tap water As - Kurzius-Spencer, M., O'Rourke, M. K., Hsu, C., Hartz, V., Harris, R. B., & Burgess, J. L. (2013). Measured versus modeled dietary arsenic and relation to urinary arsenic excretion and total exposure. Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology, 23(4). [More info](#more-journal-publication152)Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) in food and water is a significant public health problem. Person-specific aggregate exposure is difficult to collect and modeling based on limited food As residue databases is of uncertain reliability. Two cross-sectional population exposure studies, the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey-Arizona and Arizona Border Survey, had a combined total of 252 subjects with diet, water, and urinary As data. Total As was measured in 24-h duplicate diet samples and modeled using 24-h diet diaries in conjunction with several published food surveys of As. Two-stage regression was used to assess the effects of dietary As on urinary total As (uAs): (1) generalized linear mixed models of uAs above versus below the limit of detection (LOD); and (2) restricted models limited to those subjects with uAs>LOD, using bootstrap sampling and mixed models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, current smoking, and As intake from drinking and cooking water. In restricted models, measured and modeled estimates were significant predictors of uAs. Modeled dietary As based on Total Diet Study mean residues greatly underestimated the dietary intake. In households with tap water As 10 p.p.b., over 93% of total arsenic exposure was attributable to diet. - Miller, J. A., Lang, J. E., Ley, M., Nagle, R., Hsu, C., Thompson, P.

Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.), 6(6). [More info](#more-journal-publication153)Limonene is a bioactive food component found in citrus peel oil that has shown chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities in preclinical studies. We conducted an open-label pilot clinical study to determine the human breast tissue disposition of limonene and its associated bioactivity. We recruited 43 women with newly diagnosed operable breast cancer electing to undergo surgical excision to take 2 grams of limonene daily for two to six weeks before surgery. Blood and breast tissue were collected to determine drug/metabolite concentrations and limonene-induced changes in systemic and tissue biomarkers of breast cancer risk or carcinogenesis. Limonene was found to preferentially concentrate in the breast tissue, reaching high tissue concentration (mean = 41.3 g/g tissue), whereas the major active circulating metabolite, perillic acid, did not concentrate in the breast tissue. Limonene intervention resulted in a 22% reduction in cyclin D1 expression (P = 0.002) in tumor tissue but minimal changes in tissue Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. No significant changes (IL-6) levels were observed following limonene intervention. There was a small but statistically significant postintervention increase in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. We conclude that limonene distributed extensively to human breast tissue and reduced breast tumor cyclin D1 expression that may lead to cell-cycle arrest and reduced cell proliferation. Furthermore, placebo-controlled clinical trials and translational research are warranted to establish limonene's role for breast cancer prevention or treatment. - Miller, J. A., Thompson, P.

Anaheim, CA: Western Institute of Nursing. [More info](#more-presentation14)Background: Many patients evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in emergency departments (EDs) experience ongoing or recurrent symptoms after discharge, regardless of their ultimate medical diagnosis. A comprehensive understanding of post-ED symptom trajectories is lacking.Aim: To identify common trajectories of symptom severity in the six months after an ED visit for potential ACS.Methods: This was a secondary data analysis from a study conducted in five U.S. EDs. Patients (n=1002) who had abnormal electrocardiogram or biomarker testing and were identified by the triage nurse as potentially having ACS were enrolled. Symptom severity was assessed in the hospital and 30 days and six months post-discharge using the 13-item ACS Symptom Checklist. Severity of the eight most commonly reported symptoms (chest pressure, chest discomfort, unusual fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, upper back pain, and shoulder pain) was modeled across the three study time points using growth mixture modeling. Models with increasing numbers of classes were compared, and final model selection was based on a combination of interpretability, theoretical justification, and statistical fit indices. Results: The sample was 62.6% male with a mean age of 60.17 years, and 57.1% ruled-out for ACS. Between two and four distinct trajectory classes were identified for each symptom. Identified individual nature of symptom trajectories can contribute to patient-centered, rather than disease-centered, care. Further research is needed to verify the existence of multiple symptoms trajectories in diverse populations and to assess the antecedents and consequences of individual symptom trajectories. - Knight, E.
