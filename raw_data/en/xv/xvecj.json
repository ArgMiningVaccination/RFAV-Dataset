The committee recommended that people reduce fat and cholesterol consumption, increase intake of fruits and vegetables and eat protein in moderation. The committee also advised people to balance their food intake with physical activity; either avoid or greatly restrict alcohol use; maintain adequate calcium intake by meeting the RDA; avoid taking dietary supplements, especially in excess of the RDA in any one day; and drink ... Volume 12, Issue #2 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL NIXES SUPPLEMENTS, SUPPORTS FLUORIDATION In the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date of potential health risks and benefits stemming from diet, a National Research Council (NRC) committee has concluded that the U.S. public could substantially reduce its risk of heart disease, cancer and many other chronic diseases through specific changes in eating habits. The committee recommended that people reduce fat and cholesterol consumption, increase intake of fruits and vegetables and eat protein in moderation. The committee also advised people to balance their food intake with physical activity; either avoid or greatly restrict alcohol use; maintain adequate calcium intake by meeting the RDA; avoid taking dietary supplements, especially in excess of the RDA in any one day; and drink fluoridated water to prevent tooth decay. Copies of the committee's report will become available July 1, 1989 for $49.95 (prepaid) from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave, N.W., Washington, DC 20418. Comment: The NRC report provides a weapon against the misinformation fostered by organized quackery. The promotion of dietary supplements is a major forms of quackery today. Health foods stores derive as much as 50% of their income from this source; multilevel marketers focus on selling supplements; dubious \"nutritionists\" and nonscientific health care providers depend heavily upon income from supplement sales; and, mega-vitamin \"therapies\" are inappropriately promoted for AIDS, cancer, colds & flu, diabetes, heart disease, mental retardation, psychological stress, and many other human disorders. The other way the NRC report strikes at quackery is by recommending that people drink fluoridated water. Health pseudoscientists attack and retard the implementation of fluoridation. Interestingly, fluoridation is a form of nutritional supplementation. Fluoride is a trace element which is below par in most natural diets. By ingesting adequate fluoride during the critical years that teeth are forming (birth to 6 yrs-old) teeth are made harder and more resistant to decay. Water fluoridation is the cheapest and most effective way to get fluoride into the diet. PSYCHIC SURGEON ARRESTED IN WASHINGTON STATE A page-one story in The Spokesman-Review Spokane Chronicle (2/5/89) tells of 44-year-old waitress Gloria Cooper's recovery from \"pain and fatigue\" following the apparent removal of \"tumors\" from her stomach, heart and ears by Placido W. Palitayan a visiting psychic surgeon from the Philippines. Cooper is said to be but one of \"probably more than 1,000 people...who have come to Colville (Washington) to be treated...\" Jan Cox, 50, owner of King Cole's Restaurant has been offering Palitayan's services for the past six years. Cox claims that another psychic surgeon treated her husband's heart condition several years ago. He survived for six years before dying of a heart attack and Cox is convinced that psychic surgery prolonged his life. It is reported that about 130 people had been scheduled for psychic surgery over two days when Stevens County authorities raided the house of Charles and Dorothy Garvey in which the operations were taking place. Palitayan, Cox, and two others were booked on charges of theft and the unlicensed practice of medicine. A bucket with purported blood and tumors removed from patients was found to contain tissue from a bovine animal. Charles Garvey defended psychic surgery by stating that all of the people involved were \"consenting adults\" who should be allowed to choose for themselves-an argument that can be used to justify drug abuse, prostitution, gambling, as well as quackery. Note: Information from NCAHF's files indicates that the above case does not involve the same psychic surgeon arrested in California in 1987. His name was \"Brother\" Joe Bulgarin. It was yet another psychic surgeon, Gary Magno, who was arrested in Arizona in 1986. The psychic surgery scams seem to be a growing phenomenon. For a complete expose of the psychic surgery scam see Flim Flam, by James Randi (Prometheus Books, 1982). UNDERSTANDING DIFFICULT PATIENTS (I.E., GEEZERS) Part of thwarting quackery involves good communication between health professionals and difficult patients who, for one reason or another, seem to resent educated people. \"The assessment and treatment of geezers\" (JAMA, 259:1228-1129, 1988) by psychologist Loren Pankratz, PhD and Psychiatrist Lial Kofoed, MD, offers a rare and badly needed insight into understanding and dealing with eccentric and often difficult patients. Geezers are likely to be survivors of the Great Depression with little formal education who value life experiences, in which they are rich, over formal education. They are unimpressed with \"ologies\" and often suffer from \"hardening of the categories!\" They may fabricate or withhold information for various reasons, talk down to women and much more. This rare gem of reading offers useful information and tools on how to improve the art of patient care in easy-to-read fashion. JAPANESE COMPANY ACQUIRES SHAKLEE CORP. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan has purchased the Shaklee Corporation for about $395 million, according to a report in The Tribune (Oakland, CA, 3/14/89). The company was founded in 1956 by Forrest C. Shaklee, an Iowa-born chiropractor, and had sales of $627 million in 1988. Shaklee's Japanese unit contributed 28 percent of the company's sales and 48 percent of its earnings. Shaklee has about 6,000 direct-sales representatives in the US, according to the report. IRIDOLOGY FAILS TESTS OF RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY A study carried out in the Netherlands sought to determine the ability of five \"leading\" iridologists to observe the presence of inflamed gall bladder disease in 39 patients vs 39 controls of the same sex and age. Stereo color slides were presented of the right eye and presented in random order. The iridologists were unable to perform any better than chance in their ability to recognize those with the disease (a test of validity); and, exhibited an inter-performer agreement consistency of 60% which was only slightly higher than chance (a test of reliability). (Knipschild, British Medical Journal, 297:1578-1581, 1988.) Note: Tests of validity determine the accuracy of a procedure. This is the best type of scientific test. Tests of reliability measure consistency, but may still be invalid. For instance, in the above study, several of the iridologists may have seen a meaningless blip in the irises they examined and erroneously used it as an indicator of disease. This would explain why they were able to perform slightly above chance on inter-performer consistency. However, unless the blip really had clinical validity, it merely indicates that there was something in the irises that most of them could see. BOOK FOR COMBATING ANTIFLUORIDATIONISTS The American Oral Health Institute (AOHI) has published a 2nd edition of the 224-page book Abuse of the Scientific Literature in an Antifluoridation Pamphlet. The book painstakingly critiques the newer antifluoridation pamphlet entitled \"Lifesavers Guide to Fluoridation,\" by John Yiamouyannis, PhD, who is probably the world's leading antifluoridation activist. The book may be purchased or obtained free with a $25 individual membership in the AOHI. Write, AOHI, P.O. Box 151528, Columbus, OH 43215-8528. Addendum: Congratulations and kudos to public health professionals in Arizona, many of whom are NCAHF members, for their recent victory in fluoridating Phoenix. STUDY REVEALS POTENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSTIC ILLUSIONS A research project conducted at Life Chiropractic College-West helps explain how well-intended clinicians may fool themselves with tests that only provide information on reliability, not validity. Robert Jansen, PhD and Dale Nansel, PhD, who are researchers at the college performed a \"Monte Carlo\" experiment in order to determine chance concordance rates for multiple test scenarios often encountered in chiropractic diagnosis. In practice, this might involve employing several unvalidated tests on specific vertebral segments to see how many would agree that a problem exists. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that if four diagnostics tests are performed on each patient, each test implicating on average three vertebral segments with the acceptance of a plus or minus one segment margin of error, the chances that any three out of the four will agree is a whopping 89%! Although these findings should shock chiropractors who commonly use unvalidated diagnostic or screening procedures, there is a lesson in it for clinicians in every field of health care to understand the difference between reliability and validity and work very hard on assuring the latter. (Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, 11:355-360, 1988.) METHODS FOR ASSESSING ORAL MERCURY VAPOR QUESTIONED Claims that mercury emissions from dental fillings may be harmful are based largely on the amount of mercury vapor alleged to exist in the mouth during chewing. Efforts to replicate the work of researchers claiming to have found excessive mercury vapors found that the methodology couldn't be correct because the intake volumes of air reported were larger than the capacity of the mouth. Two separate efforts independently concluded that the mercury release from amalgams was 16 times less than claimed. (Berglund et al. J Dental Research, 67:1235-1242, 1988.) IOWA ATTORNEY GENERAL OBTAINS SETTLEMENT In the Sept-Oct NCAHF Newsletter we reported that Iowa Attorney General Thomas Miller had filed a number of complaints against diet products in his state. A settlement has been obtained from Consumer Direct, Inc. of Canton, Ohio, making over 4600 Iowans eligible for refunds of money company also has been prevented by court order from selling diet products in Iowa. Although the defendants did not admit any wrongdoing, they did also agree to pay $15,000 toward consumer education efforts in Iowa and $5,000 for investigational costs. Miller said that \"Iowans lose millions of dollars a year on phony diet products that raise their hopes, fail to work, and sometimes threaten their health.\" He estimated that Americans spend $1-3 billion a year on fraudulent diet products. Miller said that the danger signs for phony diet products include: - The promise of a scientific breakthrough, often called an \"amazing breakthrough\" or \"accidental discovery.\" - The promise that weight loss will be effortless. Ads will promise you can \"eat all you want\" and fat will \"melt off\", \"burn off\" or \"flush out\". - The promise that weight loss will be fast, promising \"dramatic results\", or \"massive weight loss\". (Press release 3/10/89; Contact Bill Roach (515)281-5678.) CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is now attaching the name \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" (CFS) to: newly acquired, constant or recurrent tiredness, with a minimum of designated symptoms from a list of 22 subjective symptoms experienced, certain documented medical findings and the exclusion of other clinical disorders. CFS is of interest to NCAHF because it sounds much like a variety of conditions commonly misdiagnosed by fringe medical practitioners (eg, food allergies, brain allergy, hypoglycemia, dental amalgam toxicity, yeast infection, TMJ problems, environmental sensitivity, and so forth (many of these conditions and the tendency toward erroneous self-application are described by Susan Ince in her article \"Disease of the month\" published in Savvy Woman, February, 1989). Stress seems to play a major role. A discussion of this malady and a list of the diagnostic criteria appeared in Health News, a publication of the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, February, 1989 (7:(1):1-5). CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AND DEPRESSION A study of 100 adults who were treated at a Fatigue Clinic found that in two-thirds the symptoms were attributable to depression, panic disorder, social phobia or other related mental problems. Chronic Epstein-Barr virus was found in 15 patients but did not appear to cause fatigue symptoms (Manu, et al., Annals of Internal Medicine, 148:2213, 1988). CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AND THE YEAST CONNECTION One hundred consecutive patients with a chief complaint of chronic fatigue were evaluated in a specialty clinic setting at the University of Connecticut Health Center. A complete history was obtained from each patient, plus a 168-item review of symptoms and a complete physical examination were performed. Eight patients believed that their fatigue was due to chronic candidiasis. Of these eight, seven had psychiatric diagnoses that were judged to underlie their fatigue. Of the remaining 92 patients, 59 had underlying psychiatric diagnoses. The researchers were unable to find physical, historical or laboratory differences between chronic fatigue patients who believed that they had the yeast connection. The authors note that patients self-diagnosed as having the yeast connection will only infrequently relinquish their illness. (Renfro et al. The American Journal of Medicine, 86:165-168, 1989.) SAFETY OF VITAMIN A Benedich and Langseth present a review of the value and hazards of vitamin A in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (49:358-371, 1989). Readers familiar with the toxicity of this vitamin will be struck by the apologetic tone of this monograph and omissions of adverse reactions to vitamin A published elsewhere. It is worthy of note that one of the authors is a Hoffman-LaRoche employee-a company heavily involved in the promotion of dietary supplements. Victor Herbert has responded to the article with a letter to the editor detailing omissions and significant facts that reveal that the article is biased in favor of Hoffman-LaRoche's financial interest. It is not known at this time if Dr. Herbert's letter will be published. NCAHF will supply copies for $1 and a stamped, self-addressed, business-sized envelope. BAD HEALTH FOOD STORE ADVICE A news writer and a dietitian teamed up to survey several California health food stores to determine the kind of advice they would be given on important health matters. On the question about the advisability of a 16-year-old to take dolomite as a calcium supplement, 5 of 9 clerks incorrectly said that dolomite is OK or safe. In fact, the FDA has warned consumers-especially pregnant women and growing children that both dolomite and bone meal are sometimes contaminated with lead. None recommended inexpensive alternatives or good food sources of calcium. When asked: \"A friend's blood pressure is 200. What should he do?\" 6 of 9 clerks failed to recommend that he see a doctor. The worst recommendation was that he take 1000 mg of vitamin C to build up his immune system! The third question asked involved \"seeing flashing lights and halos around lights at night\"-the symptoms of glaucoma. In this case, 6 of 9 clerks correctly recommended seeing a physician. One recommended 25,000 units of vitamin A! (Fritz, \"Wheat germ, rice flour and nutritional baloney,\" The Health & Nutrition Newsletter, Winter, 1988/89.) LECITHIN AND CHOLESTEROL Knuiman, Beynen and Katan review 24 studies on the effect of supplemental lecithin on serum cholesterol. Most of the studies lacked appropriate control groups, had a small sample size, or had other confounding dietary changes. Only four trials made attempts to balance fatty acid intakes of experimental and control groups. There was no evidence for a specific effect of lecithin on serum cholesterol independent of its linoleic acid content or secondary changes in food intake (Am J Clin Nutr, 49:266-268, 1989). QUACKERY COMES CHEAP IN NORTH CAROLINA Gregory E. Caplinger, who claims to be a naturopath, was arrested in November, 1988, and charged with four counts of practicing medicine without a license. During a search of his clinic agents seized some 23 framed certificates, one of which was a privilege license from the North Carolina Board of Naturopathic Physicians, a non-existent group. Other certificates included the \"Caribbean International Prize in Medicine,\" \"British Guild was once named \"Doctor of the Year\" by JFK College), and the American Nutrimedical Association-all unaccredited. Undaunted, Caplinger reopened his office the very next day. Apparently, Caplinger had little fear of North Carolina's laws against unlicensed medical practice which classifies a violation as a misdemeanor with a $100 fine! Caplinger continued practicing until mid-February when he suddenly packed up and left town. NCAHF's source suggests that an investigation by the IRS may have prompted his hasty withdrawal. Charges are still pending against Caplinger, but he cannot be located at this time. Activists hope to bring about legislative reforms that will make it more difficult to practice quackery in North Carolina. *NCAHF President William Jarvis is also a member of this \"guild\"- it came with his $50 correspondence school naturopathic diploma in 1976. SPECIAL REPORT ON FOOD SAFETY The entire November, 1988, edition of the FDA Consumer is a very timely special report on food safety. Copies are available from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (HFI-40), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. IS THERE A CONSPIRACY BEHIND ALL OF THE FOOD SCARES? The growing number of strident, unfounded attacks on the food supply system may be more than just a coincidence. NCAHF has tracked political food faddism for many years. Several attempts to get an Organic Farming Bill through Congress seem to have been replaced with a coalition called Americans for Safe Foods. Now we find politically oriented organizations manipulating the media with food terrorist tactics. All of this seems too well orchestrated to be mere coincidence and too well-financed to be based upon mere altruism. Is there an organic foods marketing effort driving these events? NCAHF hopes that some good investigative journalists are also wondering. BOOK DISCREDITS HEALTH FOODS Health or Hoax? The Truth About Health Foods and Diets (Prometheus Books, 1986) was written by Arnold E. Bender, PhD, DSc, retired professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of London and head of the Department of Food Science and Nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College, London. Although Dr. Bender's prospective is on health foods in the United Kingdom, there are few if any differences between these phenomena there and in North America. The book's style is for laymen, but health professionals will also find it useful because of the insight it provides into the British perspective on these problems. Available from Prometheus Books, 700 East Amherst Street, Bufflao, NY 14215. IMMUNITY AND DEPRESSION Psychoimmunology, or the idea that one's mental state significantly affects the immune system, is one of the popular medical ideas of our time. A study of 91 patients with unipolar major depressive disorder and matched controls failed to find any differences in mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, lymphocyte subsets, and natural killer cell activity. There were, however, significant age-related differences between the depressed patients and controls in mitogen responses and in the number of T4 lymphocytes. Controls showed increases in these immune factors with advancing age but depressed patients did not. The researchers concluded that \"altered immunity does not appear to be a specific biological correlate of major depressive disorder but may occur in subgroups of depressed patients. (Schleifer, et al. Archives of General Psychiatry, 46:81-87, 1989.) DUBIOUS HEALTH ASSESSMENTS NCAHF president William Jarvis, PhD, describes a number of unproven and invalid methods currently used to convince unwary consumers that they have special nutritional needs, in the February, 1989, issue of Nutrition & the MD (pp.1-3). Included are the cytotoxic test, yeast test, live cell analysis, Amalgameter, muscle-strength testing, iridology, herbal crystallization analysis, and how they are enhanced by the style of the practitioners. The style is suitable for patient education. MAGICAL CURES FOR TREATING LEARNING DISABILITIES Larry B. Silver, MD, reviews the problem of learning disabilities and the vulnerability of parents to exploitation by promoters of magical cures. Dr. Silver first describes the generally accepted therapies of special education, medication (the psychostimulants), and psychological therapies. He then describes the controversial therapies by categories. Neurophysiological Retraining techniques include \"patterning\" which is the Doman-Delacato method; \"Optometric Visual Training,\" which involves two different approaches advocated by separate groups of optometrists. Vestibular Dysfunction theories include serious investigations which remain unproven and strange approaches such as chiropractor Carl Ferreri's Neural Organizational Technique which Silver describes in detail. Lastly Silver reviews Orthomolecular Medicine under which he includes megavitamins, trace elements, hypoglycemia, food additives and preservatives (Feingold's theory), and refined sugars. Silver has written this exceptional article in a very readable style, and provides substantive information on both the theories and claims of proponents and their lack of adequate data. (J of Learning Disabilities, 20:498-504, 1987. MANNER METABOLIC THERAPY Despite the sudden death of Harold Manner in November, 1988, his dubious cancer clinic still is in operation and several hundred of his trainees are still practicing. Jeff South attended a Manner Seminar and reports on Manner's theories and treatment regimen in the December, 1988 issue of Nutrition Forum (vol 5;61-67). This article provides an excellent basic reference source on dubious methods of cancer care. A MEDICAL VIEW OF MIRACULOUS HEALING Verna Wright, MD presents an excellent critique of faith healing from the perspective of a Christian physician. This is the kind of reading that may effectively reach the type of people who need the information the most-the faithful. Dr. Wright explains common sources of error employed by people who may believe they have experienced miraculous healing. She notes that doctors can mislead patients unintentionally by the language they use. What an MD refers to as \"miraculous\" refers merely to better than average results, not a super-natural event. A patient's perception of his illness can be the source of confusion. There are significant problems associated with evaluating healing, and there are many mistaken diagnoses which can confound people. Dr. Wright points out the variability of the natural courses that diseases may take and the psychological aspects of healing. She then describes the methodology of a popular public faith healer and points out his use of hypnosis and the lack of medical evidence for alleged healing miracles. She also presents critical analyses of faith healing, including examples of fraud. In her final segment, Wright explains the various dangers associated with depending upon faith healing-which she says are not only damaging but often disastrous. The 16-page document is published in the UK by Covenanter Press, Box 48, Strathpine North, Q.4500. MATO KM & KM Matol Km and Km are products of Matol Botanical International of Montreal, Canada, being multilevel marketed across the USA. Promotional literature claims that Matol Km can purify blood, improve digestion, aid hair growth, help people sleep better, and more. The company claims that Matol Km is \"a rich exotic blend of ingredients selected by Dr. Karl Jurak during his extensive research,\" and that the 14 herbal ingredients \"have been synergistically combined, thus obtaining the optimal value from each individual plant.\" Promotional literature spins a yarn about how Karl Jurak, PhD, obsessively studied the effect of plant substances on his own blood until he discovered the marvelous formula for Matol Km. The result is a herbal compound consumers are asked to accept on faith as the answer to a wide variety of health problems. In 1986 the FDA issued an Import Alert for Matol Km on the basis that it was \"...violative with the meaning of 801(a)(3) in that it appears to be a new drug without an approved new drug application ...\" (Import Alert No.:66-25, dated 4/17/86) directing that shipments of Matol Km be detained. A letter dated 6/30/88 from the Detroit District Director of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration sought information on how bottles of Matol Km found in the USA were being brought into the country. Km the companion product of Matol Km, may be legally imported. Km's main ingredient is potassium. The recommended dosage is one tablespoon (15 ml) twice daily, or 30 ml. Labeling states that 30 ml Km supplies 585 mg potassium. One bottle of Km contains 946 ml (1 qt) and sells for $32.85 ($.0347/ml) meaning that 585 mg potassium via Km costs $1.04; 237 ml (1 cup) of orange juice has 496 mg potassium and a medium banana supplies 440 mg potassium. Both orange juice and bananas are cheaper sources of potassium and more desirable nutritionally. Km apparently contains the same herbs as Matol Km, plus cascara sagrada. Specific amounts are not provided on labels, and the company would not disclose amounts upon inquiry. Some of Km's herbs are potentially toxic: - Chamomile root: Allergic effects similar to ragweed - Celery seed: Diuretic - Sarsaparilla root: Laxative, diuretic - Angelica root: - Horehound root: Heart rhythm disturbances - Licorice root: Headaches, high blood pressure, heart failure - Senega root: Expectorant, stomach upset - Honest Herbal; Rosengarten, Spices (from: Cox, The Health & Nutrition Newsletter, Winter 1988/89) ACSH CONDEMNS NRDC'S CONTENTION THAT PESTICIDE RESIDUES POSE CANCER THREAT The American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), in a February 23, 1989 press release, vehemently rejected the conclusions of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to the effect that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) role is inadequate in protecting public health and that pesticide residues pose \"intolerable risks\" to children. ACSH Executive Director Elizabeth Whelan, DSc, says: \"We find the NRDC statements totally irresponsible. We deplore their attempt to raise anxieties about the safety of the American food supply, particularly where they take aim at something we are all deeply concerned about-the health of our children.\" The ACSH presented five rejoinders to the NRDC report which are paraphrased below with added comments by NCAHF in parenthesis: - The NRDC report is not a scientific document in that it has not received the approval of an external panel of qualified scientists. - The NRDC claim that EPA standards on allowable maximum allowable residues are inadequate is unfounded. EPA's standards are based upon a safety margin of 100-1,000 which is more than sufficient to protect the health of children and adults. (The safety margin is the dose per body weight at which no harmful effects occur to susceptible experimental animals divided t by 100-1000.) - (The NRDC wrongly concludes that designating a pesticide as a \"carcinogen\" means that it will cause cancer in humans. In fact, such designation is based exclusively upon animal experiments-generally involving mice and rats (at abnormally high dosages). Although the NRDC report uses the terms \"carcinogen\" and \"cancer causing agent\" liberally, it never specifies the animal species or dosage levels involved. Scientists have long ago rejected the simplistic notion that \"if it causes cancer in laboratory animals at any dose, we must assume it causes cancer in humans.\" - The NRDC report assumes that \"carcinogens\" are exclusively of synthetic origin failing to recognize the omnipresence of naturally-occurring carcinogens. The NRDC report targets only the residues of man-made pesticides when naturally-occurring carcinogens occur at levels 10,000 times higher. - The NRDC report wrongly presumes that the mere fact that something is \"detectable\" makes it a danger. In reality, modern technology has the ability to detect infinitesimal levels of chemicals. (Scientists generally recognize a threshold below which no real risk exists.) ACSH rejects the NRDC report and calls upon the nation's scientific community to step forward and do likewise. \"In an age of enormous public health challenges such as cigarette smoking and AIDS, we find the NRDC guilty of nothing short of 'public health malpractice' in pointing to fruits and vegetables as so-called causes of cancer.\" Whelan concluded. (Note: When NCAHF first learned of the NRDC report, we took it seriously since it involved a serious public health matter. However, the more we learned the more skeptical we became. The tactics were familiar. This was not a scientific report but a public relations event complete with well-intended but unqualified movie star fronting the effort. We still withheld criticism until we were able to see the NRDC Executive Summary of the report. We now believe that the ACSH assessment is valid and the NRDC report is to be discredited.) HAVE THE FOOD TERRORISTS GONE TOO FAR? NCAHF has condemned the terrorism inherent in food faddism for years knowing how easily people can be panicked into irrational, self-destructive behavior. Quacks have long used food misinformation and irrational fears of food to promote various diet cures. More recently we have seen the far-reaching economic harm of food faddism. American beef has been rejected by Europeans out of unfounded fears of harmless amounts of hormone residues which are actually non-existent in most of the products. The NRDC's dubious attack on apples needlessly frightened consumers and harmed many growers. The FDA's reaction to adulterated Chilean grapes sent the wrong signal to terrorists who now know how to bring an economic system to its knees. Food terrorists need only to create the perception of a problem to accomplish their purposes. What will be the effect on the public at large of this multiple dose of fright? Will it lead to a revolution in \"organic farming\" as food faddists hope, or will there be a backlash? Some may recall the infamous Amchitka Island incident of the early 1970s. Environmental extremists campaigned stridently against the detonation of an atomic device on the small Alaskan island warning that the explosion could \"crack the earth,\" activate the Pacific Ocean's \"ring of fire\" intercontinental volcanic system, or at least cause the San Andreas Fault to convulse. The Amchitka hysteria attracted national attention and reached a major crescendo, but when the explosion occurred nothing happened. Observers noted that the failure of the event to produce a predicted catastrophe resulted in a ten-year setback for the credibility of environmental movement. This kind of a backlash could happen again in this carefully orchestrated attack on food safety. It may be that environmental extremism can thrive only among a segment of the population prone to emotionalism. When the extremists finally get the attention of mainstream Americans, hard-nosed realism generally prevails. In the case of food safety, the present system is sound and can stand close scrutiny. The realists have no illusions-only the zealots who believe that the sky is falling are in danger of losing their imaginary worldviews. Unfortunately, such backlash could be harmful to other segments of society by desensitizing them to real environmental dangers (ie, the \"boy who cried wolf\" syndrome). People may come to minimize justified warnings about the hazards of tobacco, drug or alcohol use; or, worthwhile lifestyle changes wrongly placing them in the same category as overstatements about food safety. NCAHF's definition and discussion of \"food terrorism\" appeared in the Jan-Feb, 1988 newsletter and is available for $1 upon request.

In the historical development of medicine, there are many references to the practice of bonesetting by both qualified and unqualified practitioners. (In using the term \"unqualified,\" we refer to those who take up the practice of healing without having had any formal training in the accepted medical procedures of the day.) In some of the early hospitals, bonesetting was the duty of a few members of certain religious orders. These manipulations were no doubt performed with various religious incantations to their respective Gods. One of these religious bonesetters, Friar Moulton, of the order of St. Augustine, wrote a book entitled the Compleat Bonesetter, which was revised in 1656 by Robert Turner and which is presently in the library of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It is interesting to note that Turner, in his introduction to the book, mentioned that the book was intended to be a guide for \"the use of those Godly Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are industrious for their talent God has given them, in helping their poor sick neighbors.\" This seems to indicate that bonesetting was a practice commonly employed in the homes of England in the 17th century, and, curiously enough, primarily by women. One of the most famous lay bonesetters in the history of bonesetting was a woman: Sally Mapp, the daughter of an English bonesetter of the 18th century. In addition to the use of manipulation as a method of setting fractures, reducing dislocations, and restoring mobility to an injured or diseased joint, there is considerable evidence that many ancient cults and individuals attempted to treat disease by ceremoniously manipulating or popping the joints. This was especially true among those groups and civilizations that routinely employed massage in their treatment methods. The ancient Chinese were experts at massage. (In China today, however, the practice of massage has been relegated to the duties of blind and old women.) During the Neolithic period (the latter part of the Stone Age), massage was part of the culture of coastal inhabitants of the Mediterranean races, of India, up the Pacific coast of China, and of the inhabitants along the coast of Mexico and Peru [1]. The art of massage and bonesetting are too closely allied to assume that those who practiced massage did not apply forceful movement and pressure to the joints-especially when the joints seemed to be disturbed in their functions. We cannot, of course, attempt to give a complete history on the origin and ancient use of joint manipulation and massage, since such information in its entirety is not readily available and is not entirely within the scope of this book. Only a few examples will be necessary to demonstrate the ancient nature of a physical treatment that is obviously as old as the human race itself. Some claim that the American Indians practiced a form of spinal manipulation (for centuries) that is similar to the ancient and present-day forms of spinal \"bonesetting.\" It is well known that general bonesetting was skillfully practiced by Indian tribes all over the continent, particularly the Sioux Indians, the Winnebagos, the Creeks of the southeastern United States, groups of the north Pacific Coast, and certain Brazilian tribes. (3-G) One author relates the story of having witnessed an Indian hunter reduce a dislocation in his own hip after catching his leg in a tree. Since it would seem to be a natural tendency for man to attempt to \"replace\" a joint that was obviously out of its normal position, such has probably occurred from time immemorial notwithstanding man's ignorance. Claudius Galen, in his 2nd-century work, On the Natural Faculties, wrote of Amazonian women who purposely dislocated the hips of some of their male children in order to compel them to undertake certain types of work that an able-bodied man would normally refuse to do. When Spanish conqueror Hernando Cortez invaded Mexico in the 16th century, Aztec doctors were \"concerting the bones,\" or manipulating the joints, as an essential requirement of the more qualified doctor's duties. Trying to trace the origin of joint manipulation and massage would probably be quite impossible, for both have undoubtedly existed in one form or another since the beginning of man. It is a natural tendency for one to massage and manipulate an aching muscle or limb. Everyone, at some time or another, has felt the urge to throw back his shoulders and relieve the binding of spinal fatigue. It is not too much to assume that primitive man devised methods of accomplishing the instinctive tendency to massage and manipulate his fatigued and aching muscles and joints in order to maintain a desired flexibility. I can recall seeing pictures of a primitive native tribe giving exhibitions of one of their favorite sports whereby practiced natives climbed atop a high perch and then proceeded to dive head-first onto a padded area on the ground. If any of these daring sportsmen suffered ill-effects from their feat, they submitted to the manipulations of a female bonesetter who quickly \"jerked out the kinks.\" Most of us have known individuals who, without ever having seen a spinal manipulation performed, were able to \"crack\" their own spines. We have all had the experience of inadvertently snapping our joints while luxuriously stretching our fatigued frames. Although primitive man may have interpreted these sounds to be some mysterious spiritual phenomena, the more modern man began to assume that \"little bones\" were simply snapping back-into-place-or out-of place. Ancient Babylonian healers stroked the patient seven times (a magic number) in order to rid the body of a demon of sickness. When pain was present, the healer placed the head of the patient lower than his feet and kneaded or struck the back while repeating the incantation \"It shall be good.\" No doubt, this manipulation, employed to drive evil spirits out of the body, occasionally caused the spine to snap-a sound that was probably often interpreted as the sudden exit of an unwanted spirit. The sense of well-being associated with mechanical treatment of the body's structures probably gave such treatment priority consideration in the limited armamentarium of ancient physicians who did not possess today's knowledge of specific treatment for disease. In modern medical care, massage and manipulation play important parts in the treatment and rehabilitation of crippled and bedridden patients. In keeping with ignorance and human nature, however, such treatment is still the \"panacea\" of various cults that have not changed their ancient methods of treatment in order to keep pace with the developments of medical science. The tremendous psychological influence of \"popping bones back-into-place\" has been a potent factor in maintaining such practice as a general treatment for disease-hiding the real value of such treatment under a fog of ignorance. In addition, the theory of a \"bone-out-of-place,\" interfering with nerve or blood supply, was beautifully simple and logical to the uninitiated mind; so much so that an inadequate basis for placing limits upon the theory also served as a cover over any real reason why the theory should have any value at all. Today, those who promote the use of spinal manipulation as a supreme treatment for disease confuse the picture by contending that medical science recognizes the claims of such treatment when a physician, or other practitioner, prescribes manipulation for a binding joint, a herniated intervertebral disc, or a selected condition that is actually related to a spinal disorder or a structural derangement. Actually, the treatment of joint conditions as specific entities, by scientific manipulation, does not, in any way, validate the use of such treatment as the most important treatment for disease. As we shall see, the use of scientific manipulation has been part of legitimate medical practice for centuries, while, likewise, many cults and laymen have used the treatment without recognizing or exercising any limitations in its application. In any event, the relationship of the body's structures to disease is being carefully studied and recorded in scientific publications-notwithstanding the extravagant claims of those who believe excessively in that approach to the treatment of disease, or the dubiousness of those who are confirmed skeptics. My father, who grew up in Czechoslovakia, told me that, in his homeland, families had used spinal manipulation in the home for centuries. As a child, he was regularly commissioned to walk barefoot up and down the spine of his father. Following a day in the fields, laboring under the pull of the earth's gravity, this, no doubt, was a beneficial and relaxing form of treatment. Some \"professional spinal manipulators\" of that day trained small bears to walk up and down a man's spine, and offered such services for a fee. The additional weight of the bear no doubt \"popped\" the bones more readily than many were able to do by other means-although probably not without considerable risk to the patient. In Hawaii today, in Japan, and in a few other countries, masseurs still practice a crude form of spinal manipulation-handed down from generation to generation-by walking over the patient's back while holding to an overhead bar. In the Netherlands Indies, babies born feet-first on the island of Nias are still believed to have special talents for manipulating the joints. The Ancient Egyptians left scrolls describing methods of treating fractures, dislocations, and injuries resulting from falls or blows. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, for example, described a method of setting the collarbone as follows: If thou examinest a man having a break in his collarbone ... thou shouldst place him prostrate on his back, with something folded between his two shoulder blades; thou shouldst spread out his two shoulders in order to stretch apart his collarbone until that break falls into place [2]. While a joint that is only partially misplaced or subluxated can often recover without any special treatment, joints that have been dislocated obviously cannot always recover without special manipulative treatment. Recognizing this, ancient physicians have probably always attempted to replace those joints they thought were out of socket. This also resulted in the manipulation of many joints that were not actually dislocated. As the techniques of joint manipulation were passed down through the ages, however, the physician began to manipulate more specifically for the dislocated joint or fractured bone, while lay bonesetters began to employ the manipulations for a wide variety of conditions . . . thus obscuring the value of the treatment for specific conditions other than actual dislocations. The extreme and sharp division of the bonesetters' activities from those of the physician-and the value found between these extremes-is essentially the basis for this text. German physicians report that some forms of manipulation resembling modern chiropractic manipulations still persist in the folk medicine of Germany. It was stated that, in addition, such treatment was once part of the official medicine of Germany, and that, although it was forgotten over the years, it is now being reclaimed by the physician-for what value it has-and incorporated into the practice of medicine. Cato the elder, a Roman statesman (234-149 BCE) practiced bonesetting during the time of the Roman republic. In his De Re Rustica, we note that he reduced dislocations while reciting incantation: \"Haut hanat ista pista sista damiate damnaustra.\" This fearful sounding invocation no doubt sounded like the last rites to many a frail individual submitting a painfully dislocated joint to Cato's manipulations. During the time of Cato, Roman physicians were few and poorly trained. The practice of medicine for a fee was not a dignified profession in warlike Rome, and the head of each family was more or less compelled to look after his own. There was a God for every disease, and most Romans depended upon these Gods to help them through their illnesses. The Greeks, on the other hand, were organizers of culture. There were many good physicians in Greece, the most notable of whom was to be Hippocrates. Modern medicine is said to have originated in Greek medicine. Some of the Greek physicians moved into the virgin territory of Rome and started a practice; many of them, however, were quacks who simply hung out signs and solicited patients \u2014 treating them with any method at their disposal. Cato, the most tyrannically influential man in Rome, spoke out against the use of physicians, especially Greek physicians, advising his followers that they had \"got on for six-hundred years without physicians\" and that there was no need for them now. Thus, while Cato's advice may have saved some from the ministrations of the many quack physicians migrating to Rome from Greece, his advice also delayed the acceptance of high-quality Greek medicine so badly needed by the Roman citizens. No doubt Cato's influence had much to do with the manner of treatment used in the homes of Rome. One of his favorite treatments, in addition to bonesetting performed with incantations, was that of applying cabbage to the body, both internally and externally. Fearful of quack physicians, and under the influence of Cato \"the bonesetter,\" many Roman families continued to employ their old methods of treatment \"with the help of their Gods.\" Eventually, however, Greek medicine came to be accepted in Rome, and physicians were appointed to fill positions in the cities under the auspices of the Roman government. But the advance of Greek medicine was soon halted; for after the Roman Empire fell and Greek medicine deteriorated, rational medicine was again replaced by superstition, and the influence of theology crushed all traces of the advanced medicine of ancient Greece. There were centuries of struggle between science and religion before the teachings of Hippocrates and other Greek physicians were resurrected. Before the reign of Hippocrates, Aesculapius, an ancient Greek physician (often referred to as \"the first physician\"), supposedly employed methods of treatment such as bonesetting. Priests, under the direction of Aesculapius, conducted sleep cures in elaborately constructed temples. Aesculapius himself would advise patients under treatment as they lay with their eyes closed. This was probably a very powerful and effective form of autosuggestion. While the patients slept in the temple, the sacred serpents of healing were supposed to appear and lick their lesions, thus curing them of their diseases. Before patients left the temple, they read testimonials and accounts recorded on temple tablets by other patients who had supposedly suffered similar diseases but who had been cured of their afflictions by the temple treatment. This phase of Aesculapius' treatment was obviously a form of suggestion and hocus-pocus, but the treatment became very popular nevertheless. The very atmosphere of the beautiful temples undoubtedly had a beneficial effect upon the minds of those who went there for treatment. Not all of the intelligent Greeks were fooled by this type of ministration, however, for many recognized the falsehoods of the \"sleep cure\" and the \"healing serpents.\" As a result, the temples of Aesculapius gradually began to include the use of special baths, exercises, and other forms of treatment, of which, it is suspected, bonesetting was a part. Today, interestingly enough, more than 2,000 years after the time of Aesculapius, there are still some practitioners who are exercising unreasonable faith in the efficacy of single or obsolete methods of treatment, and who are being forced by time and consumer intelligence to add additional methods of treatment to their procedure. This is particularly true among those who practice spinal manipulation as a sovereign method of treating disease. Many of these practitioners still prescribe a \"rest treatment\" following \"bone adjustment\" \u2014 placing the patient upon a couch in a quiet room and asking him to remain there half-an-hour or more so that the treatment \"will be more effective.\" In many cases, especially with the nervous patient, the rest and suggestion of such a procedure are probably more beneficial than the actual treatment. Much mythology surrounds the story of Aesculapius, so much so that some doubt that he actually existed. After his death he was made a God of Medicine and was worshipped in Grecian temples. The religious followers of Aesculapius continued to practice the .,sleep cure\" and other forms of cult healing, while his more scientific descendants followed more progressive methods of healing \u2014 culminating in modern medical science. Today, the symbol of Aesculapius \u2014 two serpents twined on a staff (the caduceus) \u2014 remains as the symbol of modern medicine. It was not until the influence of Hippocrates prevailed, however, that religious superstition was separated from the practice of medicine. Hippocrates (460 B.C. - 375 BCE), the greatest of the Greek physicians, is known today as \"the father of medicine.\" He left many volumes of work on the observation and treatment of disease. Many of his descriptions of disease have been changed but little. In the treatment of his patients, Hippocrates recommended such simple measures as rest, sunlight, exercise, and diet. Not using an excessive amount of drugs, he altered the environment contributing to sickness and treated the patient as a whole; he laid the foundation for the practice of modern, rational medicine. Hippocrates completed at least three works on the bones and joints, these three of which were entitled: On Fractures; On the Articulations; and On Setting Joints by Leverage. The aphorism \"look well to the spine for the cause of disease\" was reported to have been written by Hippocrates. He apparently recognized the existence of symptoms that coursed over the spinal nerves making their exist near diseased vertebrae, as well as certain paralytic symptoms caused by severe injuries to the spinal column. In spite of the fact that little was known of the correct anatomy in the time of Hippocrates, Hippocrates himself made amazingly accurate diagnoses and devised commendably skillful methods of manipulating- the joints. Many of his methods of reducing dislocated limbs are similar or much the same as methods used today. With practiced observation and clinical art, Hippocrates examined the joints in a manner that compensated for his imperfect understanding of the actual anatomy. \"A dislocation may be recognized by the following symptoms,\" he wrote in his treatise, On the Articulations. \"Since the parts of a man's body are proportionate to one another, as the arms and the legs, the sound should always be compared with the unsound, and the unsound with the sound, not paying regard to the joints of other individuals (for one person's joints are more prominent than another's) , but looking to those of the patient, to ascertain whether the sound joint be unlike the unsound.\" [3] Although many early chiropractors claimed that the founder of chiropractic was the first to recognize the fact that subluxations (displacements that are not luxations or dislocations,) occur in the body's joints, especially in the spine, we note with considerable interest that Hippocrates himself recognized the difference between subluxated and luxated joints. In his work On the Articulations, for example, he advised fellow physicians that \". . . luxations and subluxations take place in different degrees, being sometimes greater and sometimes less . . . but when the bone has slipped, or been displaced to a less extent, it is easier to reduce such cases than the other.\" [3] Thus, we learn from Hippocratic writings that physicians more than 2,000 years ago recognized various degrees of displacement in the spinal joints and attempted correction accordingly. In reading the work of Hippocrates, we gather that a good many physicians of his time were attempting to correct spinal disorders, many of whom apparently were ignorantly or intentionally taking credit for correction of \"spinal dislocations\" that were actually subluxations, strains, and other less serious conditions. In noting Hippocrates' impatience with such practitioners, many of whom, he said, \"are ignorant, and profit by their ignorance, for they obtain credit from those about them,\" he might be astonished to learn that human nature has changed but little, or none, in this time remote from his own observations. For today, charlatans still falsely obtain credit from those about them in the eternal perpetuation of quackery. Strangely enough, Hippocrates' admonitions concerning improper interpretation of spinal treatment are as applicable today as they were when they were first spoken. Although Hippocrates was quite unaware of the cause in most cases, he did note that \"humps\" in the spinal column, especially when they were accompanied with \"tubercules in the lungs,\" were quite impossible to correct. \"The vertebrae of the spine when contracted into a hump behind from disease, for the most part cannot be remedied, more especially when the gibbosity [hump] is above the attachment of the diaphragm to the spine.\" Today, of course, physicians recognize some of these \"humps\" as being tuberculous infection of the thoracic vertebrae, a condition that should not be treated forcefully under any circumstances. In fact, unrecognized tuberculous joint disease, ultimately resulting in a deterioration of the infected bone, has become the bugaboo of every conscientious joint manipulator, whose treatment, when applied in such conditions, could result in complete destruction of the forcefully moved joint. It was also an opinion of Hippocrates that the sudden appearance of gross deviations in the spine, following severe injuries or falls, were also incorrectable in many instances, probably as a result of compression fracture of one or more vertebrae, or dislocation of a spinal articulation. \"When the spine protrudes backward, in consequence of a fall,\" he advised, \"it seldom happens that one succeeds in straightening it.\" Since most dislocations of the spine, with the possible exception of atlanto-occipital (the skull and Ist vertebra) or atlanto-axial (Ist and 2nd vertebrae) dislocation, are associated with bone \u2014 fracture and tearing of the spinal ligaments, modern orthopedic surgery now plays an important role in the reduction of vertebral dislocations, thus removing pressure upon the spinal cord. In many types of spinal injury, however, even in compression fracture of a vertebra, spinal traction or spinal extension, and other conservative measures, often provide correction without resort to the use of surgery. As far back as the latter part of the 12th century, Gilbertus Anglicus made practical suggestions for correction \u2014 without the use of surgery \u2014 of a \"broken neck\" when it involved dislocation of the atlas-axis articulation. He suggested that the patient be placed upon his back on the floor so that the surgeon, passing a strip of cloth under the patient's chin, could place his feet upon the patient's shoulders and reduce the dislocation by exerting heavy traction upon the patient's neck. His work, entitled Compendium, also prescribed treatment for many other types of dislocations, along with a description of conditions contemporary with his own lifetime \u2014 approximately 1170 to 1230. Since spinal surgery, as we know it today, was not part of the armamentarium of Hippocrates, this great physician was compelled to select for treatment only those cases he thought could benefit without further unnecessary injury to the patient. One of the most popular methods of treating spinal injuries among the contemporaries of Hippocrates was a method of \"succussion,\" that is, tying the patient outstretched upon a ladder and shaking him vertically so that the weight of the body could stretch the spine in a corrective manner and reduce existing \"dislocations.\" Although Hippocrates described this method of treatment in his writings he used it sparingly, probably because, as we shall see, there were better ways known to adjust the spine, and because \"succussion\" was a treatment routinely employed by the quacks of his time. In his treatise, On the Articulations, he explained: Wherefore succussion on a ladder has never straightened anybody, as far as I know, but it is principally practiced by those physicians who seek to astonish the mob \u2014 for to such persons, if they see a man suspended or thrown down, or the like; and they always extol such practices, and never give themselves any concern whatever bad or good. But the physicians who follow such practices, as far as I have known them, are all stupid. The device, however, is an old one, and I give great praise to him who first invented this, and any other mechanical contrivance which is according to nature. For neither would I despair, but that if succussion were properly gone about, the spine, in certain cases, might be thereby rectified. But, indeed, for my own part, I have been ashamed to treat all such cases in this way, because such modes of procedure are generally practiced by charlatans. In this interesting statement by Hippocrates, we find an analogy more than 2,000 years old that might appropriately describe a situation existing today in regard to medical interpretation of chiropractic activity. For example, while there are a great many medical practitioners who see values in the use of spinal manipulation, when it is \"properly gone about,\" many qualified physicians hesitate to prescribe or use certain manipulative procedures that have so long been employed by medically unqualified practitioners. This peculiar situation will be greatly clarified in the closing chapters of this book. In spite of the fact that Hippocrates favored somewhat different methods in treatment of the spine (to be described later), writers often attribute ancient use and origin of succussion on a ladder to the originality of Hippocrates who, as we have shown, stated that the practice was in use many years before his own time. Misinterpretation of the Hippocratic writings is often brought about by the fact that these writings are among the oldest in medical literature, thus leading many persons to believe that everything Hippocrates wrote was quite original. Actually, much of what he wrote, regarding various treatment methods, was an accumulation of knowledge and ideas passed down through centuries of unrecorded medical practice. In any event, Hippocrates described the practice of succussion on a ladder as follows: The ladder is to be padded with leather lined cushions, laid across, and well secured to one another, to a somewhat greater extent, both in length and breadth, than the space which the man's body will occupy; he is then to be laid on the ladder upon his back, and the feet, at the ankles, are to be fastened, at no great distance from one another, to the ladder, with some firm but soft band; and he is further to be secured, in like manner, both above and below the knee, and also at the nates [buttocks); and at the groins and chest loose shawls are to be put round in such a fashion as not to interfere with the effect of succussion; and his arms are to be fastened along his sides to his own body, and not to the ladder. When you have arranged these matters thus, you must hoist up the ladder, either to a high tower or to the gable end of a house; but the place where you make the succussion should be well instructed, so that they may let go their hold equally to the same extent, and suddenly, and that the ladder may neither tumble to the ground on either side, nor they themselves fall forward. But, if the ladder be let go from a tower, or the mast of a ship, fastened into the ground with its cordage, it will be better, so that the ropes run upon a pulley or axle-tree. But it is disagreeable even to enlarge upon these matters; and yet, by the contrivances now described, the proper succussion may be made. These matters should be thus arranged, if recourse is to be had at all to succussion on a ladder; for it is disgraceful in every art, and more especially in medicine, after much trouble, much display, and much talk, to do no good after all [3]. When the \"hump,\" or other disturbance, was \"lower down\" in the spine, the ladder was dropped vertically from a height, with the patient bound to it in a \"feet-first\" position, so that when the bottom of the ladder struck the pavement the effect was much like that of the jar experienced by a parachutist. When the disturbance was higher up in the spine, or in the neck, the patient was placed upon the ladder in an \"up-side-down\" position, so that the force of gravity, suddenly multiplied when the ladder struck the pavement, could stretch the suspended spine. As we noted earlier, Hippocrates was not enthusiastic about the use of the ladder in treatment of spinal disorders. For the most part, he seemed to favor methods requiring controlled traction (applied from each end of the body) combined with specific corrective movements applied directly to the involved joints. For example, in the treatment of spinal curvatures, he recommended that the patient be placed face-down upon a bench \"covered with robes, or any thing else which is soft, but does not yield much,\" with straps placed under the arm pits and across the chest, and around the knees and ankles, so that traction (\"extension\") could be applied from both ends of the bench while the correction was being made. ... the physician, or some person who is strong, and not uninstructed, should apply the palm of one hand to the hump, and then, having laid the other hand upon the former, he should make pressure, attending whether this force should be applied directly downward, or toward the head, or toward the hips. This method of applying force is particularly safe; and it is also sale for a person to sit upon the hump while the extension is made, and raising himself up, to let himself fall again upon the patient. And there is nothing to prevent a person from placing a foot on the hump, and supporting his weight on it, and making gentle pressure; one of the men who is practiced in the palestra would be a proper person for doing this in a suitable manner [3]. Here we have evidence of the use of spinal manipulation by medical practitioners hundreds of years before the birth of Christ, indicating that such practices, were probably commonly used many hundreds of years before the first written evidence indicating the use of such. The method above, as described by Hippocrates, offers a practical technique of spinal correction that has changed but little in modern orthopedic practice. (Modern orthopedic surgeons still employ combinations of traction and manipulation in the reduction of certain types of vertebral fractures not corrected by suspension or extension of the spine. \"The majority of vertebral fractures may be reduced by suspension without manual manipulation at the point of fracture. Manipulative reduction under anesthesia is indicated only when ordinary suspension does not result in complete disappearance of the kyphos and should be done only by surgeons with experience.\" [4]) In principle, in fact, it has not changed at all. There are many chiropractic and osteopathic manipulations that are still quite similar in technique.. Hippocrates described another method of spinal correction that he considered to be the \"most powerful of the mechanical means.\" Essentially, it was performed by placing heavy padding over the area of the spine to be treated (while the patient was face-down and under traction) and then ramming the padded area with a wooden beam guided in direction by an overlying, slotted, wooden plank. No doubt the spine responded to such forceful thrusts with resounding \"pops\" \u2014 much like the \"popping\" one hears today when witnessing or experiencing certain osteopathic and chiropractic manipulations. Reminiscent of this ancient method of adjusting the spine, it is interesting to note that one chiropractic college \u2014 only a few years ago \u2014 devised a method of spinal adjusting employing the use of a mallet and a rubber-tipped driving rod; the rod was placed against the spinous process of the offending vertebra and then tapped by the mallet in a corrective direction. This method did not prove to be popular among chiropractors, however, and it was soon forgotten. Another method described by Hippocrates, with which he himself had little success, but which was a less drastic method of adjusting the spine, was that of placing the patient on his back upon a deflated air bladder, and then inflating the bladder while traction was being applied from either end of the spine. Hippocrates complained that this method was rather ineffectual because the patient kept \"rolling off\" the expanding bladder. Although modem orthopedic measures sometimes employ this principle of spinal correction by applying turn-buckle corsets about the patient's trunk, it would appear that the ancient method of inflating an air bladder under a spine held fast on either end, with the patient placed deep within a trough to prevent movement from side to side, would actually be desirable in cases that would not permit the roughness of physical contact with solid objects. There was one other method commonly used by the contemporaries of Hippocrates in an effort to make corrections in the spine. This was the application of suction cups to the spine so that vertebrae that have \"protruded forward\" could be \"drawn back\" into their proper positions. Considering belief in the efficacy of this method to be an error of judgment, Hippocrates looked upon use of the suction cups as a method without any value whatsoever. \". . . Displacements forward are of a fatal and injurious nature,\" he said, \"but ... displacements backward, for the most part, do not prove fatal, nor occasion retention of urine nor torpor [paralysis] of the limbs, for they do not stretch the ducts [nerves?] leading toward the intestines, nor occasion obstruction of the same; but displacements forward produce both these bad effects, and many others in addition. And truly they are more apt to lose the power of their legs and arms, to have torpor of the body, and retention of urine, who experience no displacement either forward or backward, but merely a violent concussion along the spine, while those who have displacement backward are least subject to these symptoms.\" [3] Thus, it appears that Hippocrates, who recognized spinal dislocation largely by clinical signs, was quite selective in the application of spinal treatment measures, since he believed that efforts to reduce the more rare spinal dislocation were often both futile and dangerous. Under such circumstances, it seems that the greater part of successful spinal \"succussion\" experienced in ancient medical practice probably stemmed from correction of spinal subluxations and other such disorders. The fact that mechanical treatment of the spine was both popular and prevalent in ancient medical practice is indicated by Hippocrates' hesitancy to describe \"other modes of succussion\" in which he had little or no confidence. \"I could tell of other modes of succussion than those formerly described, which one might fancy would be more applicable in such an affection [spinal],\" he wrote in On the Articulations, \"but I have no great confidence in them, and therefore I do not describe them.\" Since very little was known about the human body 400 years before the birth of Christ, the genius of Hippocrates was forced to start literally from \"scratch.\" As a result, many of his theories and techniques were naturally quite crude when compared with present-day knowledge and skills. Certain of his methods of setting the joints of the spine, for example, may have been a shocking experience to some of those who underwent his treatment. Although Hippocrates seldom used the ladder method of \"succussion\" in treatment of the spine, he did recommend that certain patients with dislocated vertebrae be subjected to this method of treatment. Ambroise Pare, the famous French surgeon of the 16th century, in noting such recommendations in the literature of Hippocrates, wrote: In outward dislocation of the vertebrae Hippocrates commands to bind the man straight on a ladder, the arms and legs tied and bound, then after having raised the ladder to the top of a tower or ridge of a house, with a great cable in a pulley, let the patient fall like lead on the firm pavement, which Hippocrates said was done in his time. But I do not teach any such way of giving the strappado to men, but I show the surgeon in my works, the method of reducing them safely and without great pain [5]. Very likely, Pare attempted to press the dislocated vertebrae into place with his hands while the patient's spine was being placed under traction, much like methods that had already been described by Hippocrates himself. As already pointed out by Hippocrates, however, a severe injury would be required to dislocate a vertebra (often resulting in paralysis), and not all of these could be reduced by traction or manipulation. \"Cutting upon the patient,\" or surgery, would be required to correct such injuries among patients who, in years past, simply died of their injuries. Probably a great many of the \"dislocations\" that were mechanically replaced by Hippocrates and Pare were actually subluxations, or vertebrae that were only partially dislocated. Ancient Egyptian physicians used a method similar to the ladder method described by Hippocrates in attempts to reduce spinal fractures and dislocations. One wrote that those patients with spinal fractures not accompanied with paralysis could be helped by tying the patient's feet to one end of a ladder and then turning the ladder and the patient upside down, shaking the ladder in order to straighten the patient's spine [6]. If, however, the patient was paralyzed (recognized today as indicating severe spinal damage with nerve injury), the doctor was advised not to disturb the patient with such treatment lest his reputation be ruined by the patient's failure to recover. Undoubtedly, many of the less severe spinal \"dislocations\" treated by Egyptian physicians were, in reality, subluxations and other less serious conditions of the spine. Pare was one of the first surgeons to break away from many erroneous concepts of Hippocrates and Claudius Galen (two of the greatest physicians in the history of ancient medicine), whose works had bound the medical profession for centuries. Pare was responsible for a departure in ways from many detrimental and crude surgical techniques that had been handed down over the centuries without question. The trials and tribulations of medical progress went on, resulting in an ever-changing and ever-better medical practice, but human ignorance maintained many practices and cults unchanged from the most ancient times.... As continued ignorance followed a path parallel to continued progress, the scope of medical science expanded. Claudius Galen, born about 500 years after the death of Hippocrates, gave the first correct anatomical description of the spinal column and its articulations. It was he who divided the spinal column into cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions, designating the correct number of vertebrae. Galen's teachings on fractures and dislocations far surpassed those of Hippocrates. Although Galen died in the year 200 A.D., his authority was almost undisputed until the 16th century. It was Andreas Vesalius who first recorded the correct anatomy of the entire human body with publication of his work, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, in 1543 \u2014 based on actual dissection of the human cadaver. By the turn of the 18th century, when correct anatomy was common knowledge to every qualified medical practitioner, and medical science was still on the threshold of better days, many unorthodox practitioners were enjoying much popularity around the world. \"Crazy\" Sally Mapp, for example, was touring London from her home in Epsom, where she was paid to reside, \"setting bones and curing disease.\" Sally Mapp was the daughter of an English bonesetter, whose technique of practice had been handed down through the centuries almost exclusively through family contacts. In 1736, the Gentlemen's Magazine wrote of Sally Mapp: . . . The attention of the public has been taken off from the wonder working of Mr. Ward to a strolling woman now at Epsom who calls herself \"crazy Sal\"; and had performed cures in bonesetting to admiration, and occasioned so great a resort that the town offered her 100 guineas to continue there a year [5]. Joshua \"Spot\" Ward (so named because of a birthmark on his face) and many other practitioners were busy dispensing nostrum pills, \"laying on their hands,\" conveying \"magnetic healing power,\" \"setting bones,\" and fabricating hundreds of worthless methods of treating disease-most of which seemed to enjoy considerable popularity, even among the nobility and the literate. While medical science was making considerable progress in its methods of treatment, the public was still many years behind in knowledge of what was contained in the books of medical universities. Although quackery ran rampant in the 18th century, in bonesetting and in every other conceivable approach appealing to human credulity, qualified practitioners were busy making contributions in the treatment of bones and joints through the field of orthopedics. Dr. John Hunter, for example, a qualified medical contemporary of \"Crazy Sal,\" was busy teaching the value of movement of joints after injury in order to prevent stiffness and adhesions. There is no doubt that many bonesetters, such as Sally Mapp, actually did accomplish some good by breaking down adhesions in some of the joints they manipulated, even though they manipulated, without sufficient knowledge of the joints, tuberculous and infected joints alike with disastrous results. While John Hunter would have recognized the existence of adhesions in a joint that might have benefited from manipulation, as opposed to the use of such treatment in the presence of a disease process, the bonesetters always manipulated for a \"bone-out-of-place,\" regardless of the patient's condition. Essentially, this is still the difference between the practice of the qualified and the unqualified manipulator. Sir James Paget, a famous surgeon and authority on bone diseases in the 19th century, was one of the qualified practitioners who observed that there was actually some value in many of the manipulations performed by the bonesetter; for in a lecture entitled \"Cases That Bonesetters Cure,\" published in the British Medical Journal, January 5, 1867, he stated: Few of you are likely to practice without having a bone-setter for a rival; and if he can cure a case which you have failed to cure, his fortune may be made and yours marred.... Learn, then, to imitate what is good and avoid what is bad in the practice of bone-setters. (9-F) From this statement by Dr. Paget, we get an idea of the prevalence of bonesetters who practiced during the year of that lecture. Probably, in 1867, when few specific remedies for disease were known, and public ignorance was quite pronounced, the spectacular practice of the untrained bonesetter posed a real economic threat to the more conservative and legitimate physician. Many of the early bonesetters, having little knowledge of the anatomy of the bones and joints, frequently adjusted \"a little bone back-into-place\" where there was, in fact, no joint at all. Up until the 16th century, when Vesalius gave a correct anatomy of the entire human body, the numbers of bones in the human frame were given in widely varying figures, which usually included a \"nucleus bone,\" generally known as the \"bone of Luz,\" from which it was believed that the body would be resurrected. The Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans believed that the coccyx (tail bone) was the \"resurrection bone\" because it seemed to be the most indestructible of the bones. Others believed that the sacrum was the \"regeneration bone,\" or the bone from which the body was to be reborn. Hippocrates counted only 91 bones in the body (111 including the fingernails). Later physicians, by boiling the flesh from the bones of executed young persons, counted as many as 252 bones. This excessive number was due to the fact that many of the bones in a young frame still present growth-centers, thus dividing what was actually one bone into two or more. There are 206 bones in the mature human skeleton. Although qualified medical practitioners had access to the correct anatomy of the body after the time of Vesalius (of the spinal column after the work of Galen), lay bonesetters continued to manipulate under false impressions of human anatomy. Like \"cutting for the stone,\" much of the bonesetter's treatment was applied to imaginary lesions. In the area of a disturbance, the tissues were simply manipulated under the false belief that a little bone was being put back into place. Many manipulations upon joints for what were supposedly \"dislocations,\" or \"bones-out-of-place,\" were more often performed upon real and imaginary conditions short of actual dislocations. The pain caused by partial dislocation or subluxation of a joint was probably always attributed to alleged dislocations. No doubt, however, the bonesetter treated both imaginary and real \"bones-out-of-place\" with both tragic and beneficial results. Much of the value found in the bonesetter's practice was yet to be widely employed in medical practice, even though several prominent medical practitioners had published descriptions of the use and the limitations of manipulative treatment. There is much literature in old medical writings on the subject of reducing dislocated and partially dislocated joints. Although qualified medical practitioners did not dwell upon the treatment of such imaginary processes as \"a-little-bone-out-of-place,\" there is no doubt that \"subluxated\" joints were treated in the same manner as those that were actually dislocated, since the symptoms are similar and the difference in displacement only one of degree. In 1871, Wharton Hood, M.D., published a treatise (On Bonesetting) after observing the methods used by a contemporary bonesetter. Hood, who discovered that there was a great deal of value in manipulating certain joint conditions in addition to those that presented actual displacement, published a series of articles in a British journal explaining the methods of bonesetting he had learned from Robert Hutton, a well-known bonesetter in London. In describing his own findings, Hood stated: The whole mystery of \"bone-setting,\" precisely what it could do and where it was injurious, was laid open to the medical profession in the plainest language [7]. In the history of medical orthopedics, there are many other practitioners who championed more and better use of joint manipulation in medical practice. Because of the ignorant beliefs prevalent among those who practiced bonesetting exclusively, however, many members of the medical profession were slow in recognizing the real value or manipulation in correcting joints stiffened by adhesions and other correctable disorders. Even today, as a result of the efforts of spinal manipulators to cure all or most disease by manipulating the spinal joints (correcting a \"bone-out-of-place\"), the stigma upon manipulative treatment remains to a great degree. In spite of the fact that joint manipulation is now recognized as an important branch of orthopedic work, many physicians, in observing the doctrines and the practice of non-medical practitioners who employ manipulation, refuse to consider the value of manipulation as defined by qualified medical authority-even though treating a sacroiliac condition by manipulation, for example, is quite remote from treating a case of appendicitis by the same treatment. There were apparently a large number of bonesetters practicing many years before the professions of osteopathy and chiropractic appeared on the horizon. Although the early history of bonesetting (as practiced among the ranks of laymen and as promoted by medical men) seems to come predominantly from England, it is a peculiar fact that the nonmedical professions stressing joint manipulation as a sovereign method of treating disease today exist almost entirely in America. There are no nonmedical chiropractic schools, for example, outside the boundaries of the United States. Canada has one chiropractic college that has been approved by the National Chiropractic Association. Although bonesetters once existed in large numbers in England (while America was being plagued by magnetic healers, faith healers, mind-cure practitioners, and so forth), the practice of bonesetting in osteopathy and chiropractic eventually became illegal in that country. According to Hill and Clegg (What Is Osteopathy), osteopathy, attempting to \"erect a new theory of health and disease on an imaginary pathology and unproved hypothesis,\" was refused recognition in England in 1937. Today, many fine publications on joint manipulation come from the pens of orthopedic specialists in England. It was not until 1874, under the teachings of Andrew Taylor Still, in the United States, that the art of bonesetting was organized into an independent professional practice that attempted to uniformly treat disease according to basic principles and a specific theory in competition with medical practice. As we shall note in a later chapter, however, the practice of osteopathy has branched out into the field of medicine and is, today, essentially the practice of medicine. The original tenets of osteopathy were based upon the belief that misplaced or maladjusted joints interfered with the nerve and blood supply, causing disease, and that it was only necessary to manipulate the joints to cure this disease. Twenty-one years after osteopathy was founded, D. D. Palmer, a magnetic healer of Davenport, Iowa, announced his \"discovery\" of chiropractic. It seems, however, that there was little or no difference between the practice of osteopathy and chiropractic, both being merely terminological adaptions of the bonesetting that was then becoming very popular in America. While the osteopaths and chiropractors in America conveyed some value in their treatments, and originated certain uses and techniques of joint manipulation that were later recognized to be of some value, the employment and development of joint manipulation in medical quarters was to be unnecessarily delayed by the activities of these two cults that contended that all disease was the result of misplaced joints interfering with blood and nerve supply. However, some contend that the activities of the osteopath and the chiropractor speeded the recognition of manipulative therapy in the treatment of certain conditions other than dislocated or stiffened joints. As it stands today, pure bonesetting, as a general treatment for disease, is found only in some little-changed chiropractic colleges. Along with a slow recognition of joint manipulation (in medical specialties) in America, a situation, relative to the existence of the profession of chiropractic, has developed that is quite worthy of study. Chiropractors, for the most part, have not limited themselves to values of manipulation as known by medical science, but rather continue in their efforts to treat disease. In our analysis of the situation, we shall attempt to determine, to some degree, whether the existence of the chiropractor as a physician is based upon values unrecognized by medical science or upon public ignorance . . . irrespective of what chiropractic might become in the future. As we have stated elsewhere, there are probably many good chiropractors who limit their activities according to the standards of medical science rather than according to the tenets of the chiropractic creed. Whether chiropractic becomes a practice cooperative with medical science as the specific values of manipulation become more widely known, or whether its doctrine will weigh it into the depths of oblivion, is a subject for much speculation. Although much of the metaphysical concept was removed from the practice of bonesetting in the theory of osteopathy and chiropractic, an equally erroneous concept was established that was better suited to the changing times. While the chiropractic theory seems to have been patterned after the osteopathic premise, it is interesting to note that the founder of osteopathy claims to have originated the practice according to \"divine inspiration\" from the \"God of Nature.\" \"God is the Father of osteopathy,\" said Still, \"and I am not ashamed of the child of His mind.\" Still's apocalyptic style of describing the origin and purpose of the practice of osteopathy provided an irresistible attraction to thousands of excessively religious Americans; thus, the practice of osteopathy was a guaranteed success. As in the days of Sally Mapp, the treatment appeared to be quite successful in a great many conditions because of the unrecognized effects of suggestive therapy. Even today, many careless and poorly-trained practitioners fail to distinguish the nervous and psychosomatic conditions (commonly called \"functional\" conditions) from physical diseases so that treatment may be properly evaluated. Fifty years ago, before medical science had uncovered many specific causes and cures for human ailments, probably one treatment was as good as another if neither was of much value. As a result, many incompetent healers, bonesetters included, became real competitors of the medical physician in the treatment of disease. As medical science progressed, however, the physician's practice changed and enlarged to include the latest skills and knowledge, while the cults remained limited by their creeds. Factually, the claims and scope of each \"panacea\" were narrowed as science advanced \u2014 although new facts were and still are slowly assimilated by an apathetic public. Those who were educated 50 years ago labored under many delusions that have since been expelled in modern education. The present-day scientific student begins with an entirely different concept than did those who, years ago, did not have access to today's accumulated volumes of knowledge. True cultism hinges primarily from ignorance of this source of knowledge. Inasmuch as the practice of early osteopathy \u2014 and later chiropractic \u2014 was opposed to the practice of medicine, the practice became quite popular among those who were excessively religious and who objected to the methods and practice of medicine. In addition, the simple theories of the spinal manipulators appealed to an ignorance that greatly prevailed in the 19th century and that still extends into the 20th century \u2014 an ignorance of the progress and the scientific principles of modern medical science. Although the theory of osteopathy \u2014 that misaligned bones interfered with blood and nerve supply, causing disease \u2014 might actually have been original with its founder, there is much evidence to indicate that manipulation of the joints as a treatment for disease had been used for quite some time in America before the conception of the osteopathic doctrine, especially in some religious groups that practiced faith healing by the \"laying on of hands,\" In the middle of the 19th century, for example, the Mormon leader, Joseph Smith, Jr., practiced faith healing employing the use of bonesetting. One of his elders advertised to \"set bones through faith in Christ,\" stating that, \"while commanding the bones, they come together, making a noise like the crushing of an old basket.\" Only the joints of the spine can be made to give out with such sounds as the \"crushing of an old basket.\" Obviously, the laying on of hands in this faith-healing procedure was performed with considerable force. It probably amounted to nothing more or less than the chiropractor's adjustment of the spine as it is used today. Smith and his \"manipulators\" failed as healers, however, when Asiatic Cholera broke out among his followers. No doubt, today's \"manipulators\" \u2014 those who contend that adjustment of the joints is superior to the practice of medicine in the treatment of disease \u2014 would also fail in the treatment of such disease if given an opportunity to administer to an epidemic and try out their theories. Fortunately, however, medical science has effectively curbed most of the epidemic-type diseases, and when they do occur, effective means are usually available to prevent their spread. In the history of medicine, comparatively little is said about the use of bonesetting in the treatment of disease, primarily, I believe, because such practices were used by lay and religious groups more often than by medical practitioners who left records of their activities. Although there is an abundance of literature on \"setting the bones\" in ancient and recent medical writings, such treatment was reserved primarily for the treatment of actual joint disturbances. In religious and lay groups, on the other hand, bonesetting and the laying on of hands was a practice routinely performed, often with incantations, on many real and imaginary conditions alike in an effort to obtain some mysterious effect or result according to an all-inclusive though highly unlikely theory. As in the case of Joseph Smith, who set bones \"through faith in Christ,\" and \"Crazy Sally Mapp,\" who \"performed cures in bonesetting to admiration,\" many lay bonesetters inadvertently did some good \u2014 and a great deal of harm \u2014 while manipulating for quite another reason. Undoubtedly, the activities of many of these unqualified practitioners uncovered certain values in the use of manipulation that were soon recognized by medical science, although manipulation of the joints in the treatment of joint conditions per se was nothing new in medical practice. In many underdeveloped parts of the world, where qualified doctors are scarce and disease prevalent, bonesetters and other practitioners of folk medicine still command great popularity. In a 1961 Saturday Evening Post article, for example, Dr. Allan M. McKelvie, of the Orthopedic Letters Club Overseas Project, stated that: \"When OLCOP alumni get together nowadays, there is always one point of agreement \u2014 the scourge of the Middle East is 'The Bonesetter.' Apparently his profession goes back into the mists of history and sometimes is handed down from father to son. In cities he is of ten a butcher by trade. After business hours his patients come to the stable yard to have their ailments treated. Barbers and undertakers also ply this medicine-man trade.\" (Post, July 22, 1961) In the Holy Bible, there are many references to the \"laying on of hands\" as a treatment for disease. Although such 'cures were obviously those of faith, and not necessarily the results of manipulation, a few modern-day spinal manipulators have interpreted such references to imply that \"Jesus Christ was a chiropractor.\" Interestingly enough, in addition to the treatment of disease, there is at least one example in the Bible of the correction of an apparent back condition by the \"laying on of hands.\" We note in St. Luke, Chapter 13, verse 11-13: And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, \"Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.\" And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. Thus, under some religious interpretations, some bonesetters were simply carrying out the performance of the only treatment Jesus Christ considered worthwhile \u2014 that of \"laying on of hands.\" We do not have the space to consider all the forms of bonesetting and cultism that preceded the cultivation of scientific manipulative therapy. We have, however, cited sufficient example to construct the barest outline of the antiquity of joint manipulation. In our discussion of the status of chiropractic and its differences with medical science, we will explore the mystery of the chiropractor's treatment and the bonesetter's success \u2014 giving credit where I feel credit is due and discredit where such is due. There are an endless array of qualified medical references describing the use of scientific manipulative procedures, many of which were written in the early part of the 19th century. We cannot, of course, mention more than a few of these. Most of our examples will be drawn from the very latest writings of qualified orthopedic authorities. Today, cultism (in bonesetting) and medical science still run on opposite tracks, each, of course, in opposition to the other. Although bonesetters have increased in numbers through the development of osteopathy and chiropractic, much of their future existence seems to depend upon the addition of accepted medical procedures to a practice that must be hidden with explanations, borrowed accomplishments, and personality courses. While certain factions of those who practice manipulative therapy (treating disease in competition with medical practice) seem to be undergoing an evolution for the better, there are equal numbers who still believe that joint manipulation (removing nerve interference) is the superior therapy in the treatment of disease and who cling tenaciously to their tenets and to their inheritance.

Based on the information submitted to us, we make the following additional determination regarding this research: (1) Subject 129 began enzyme treatment in the study 11 weeks after undergoing biopsy of the pancreatic tumor, which was inconsistent with the inclusion criteria stipulated in the institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol that subjects begin treatment within 8 weeks of pancreatic tumor biopsy. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) require that the IRB review and approve all proposed changes in a research activity, during the period for which IRB approval has already been given, prior to initiation of such changes, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. We note that we made the same determination for subject 113 in our letter of February 25, 2008. We determine that the enrollment of subjects 113 and 129 did not meet all eligibility criteria and represented a change in the research activity that was implemented without IRB approval. We would like to summarize and clarify previous determinations that we have made regarding this case: (2) We noted in our February 25, 2008 letter that Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) found that for 40 of 62 subjects it appeared that informed consent was not documented with a signed written consent form prior to the initiation of research activities involving human subjects (e.g., receipt and analysis of identifiable private information and pathology tissue specimens, or completion of rating forms or patient diary entries), although it was documented prior to the subjects undergoing other research interventions dictated by the protocol. HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.117(a) require that informed consent be documented by use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and that is signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless the IRB waives this requirement. We determined that the informed consent for the 40 of 62 subjects referenced by CUMC was not documented prior to the start of research activities, nor was the requirement for documentation waived by the CUMC IRB for subjects in this study. Included in this count of 40 subjects were subjects 131 and 133 for whom there was an allegation that a consent form had never been signed. The complainant alleged that this failure to ever having the subject sign a consent form had been documented in a meeting with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on March 20, 2006. The NCI minutes for this meeting stated, \"Number of subjects in the enzyme arm and missing consent forms: The Columbia staff investigated this issue. Two consent forms from subjects entered in the enzyme arm are missing. Their follow-up into this issue revealed that there are notes in both subjects' medical charts indicating that they were consented and in at least one of these cases, it is recalled that the patient requested to take the consent form with them and planned to return it. It appears that both of these patients 'walked off' with their forms. The IRB was informed of this and as both charts note that subjects were consented, the IRB left it up to the investigators to decide about inclusion of the data. The investigators conducted statistical analyses both with and without these two subjects and there is no effect on statistical conclusions.\" We therefore can not prove the allegation that consent forms were never signed by subjects 131 and 133; however, we maintain our original determination that both of these subjects were among the 40 of 62 subjects engaged in research activities prior to the documentation of their signed informed consent in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.117(a). Corrective Action: We note that the CUMC IRB met with the principal investigator and he has acknowledged the non-compliance with the requirements of 45 CFR part 46 in this case with regard to the timing of the documentation of informed consent for 40 of 62 subjects. We also note that the principal investigator has committed to seeking documented informed consent prior to the initiation of any research activities or IRB review and approval for waiver of the requirements for documenting informed consent as appropriate under 45 CFR 46.117 in the future. We note that CUMC has cooperated fully with our evaluation of this matter. We acknowledge that CUMC has instituted a comprehensive educational training program for ethical conduct of human-subjects research. We also acknowledge the CUMC IRB collaboration with both OHRP and private resources to further develop content for education training materials. We find that the education programs described in your April 4, 2008 response adequately address the above determinations and are appropriate under the CUMC FWA. (3) The complainant alleged that subject 133 was enrolled in the enzyme arm of the study beyond the allowable 8-week post-biopsy period stipulated in the IRB-approved protocol, in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii). The information submitted to us indicates that subject 133 was classified as not enrolled. It appears that the principal investigator did obtain identifiable private information about subject 133 prior to providing documented informed consent as stated in (2) above; however, we found no evidence proving that subject 133 was improperly enrolled in the enzyme treatment research arm of the protocol beyond the 8-week period following the subject's diagnostic biopsy as was alleged. We therefore determine that there is no proven violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) regarding this allegation. (4) The complainant alleged that a minimum of 72 subjects were to be enrolled under the IRB-approved protocol, but that the study was terminated with only 62 enrolled subjects, in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii). CUMC reported that the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for this protocol recommended that the study be terminated before it reached its full enrollment of 72 subjects. At its September 30, 2005 meeting, the DSMC recommended that the study be terminated due to predetermined stopping criteria. This information was submitted to the CUMC IRB on October 17, 2005, and the study termination was approved by the IRB. Termination of the study in response to the DSMC recommendation was appropriate. We therefore determine that there is no proven violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) regarding this allegation. (5) The complainant alleged that while patients who could not eat adequately at the time of enrollment were to be excluded under the IRB-approved protocol, study subjects 103, 114, 118, 121, 127, 131, 132, and 147 were enrolled even though they could not eat adequately at the time of enrollment, in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii). CUMC provided excerpts and copies from research medical records that stated that \"appetite\" or \"eating\" was adequate for these subjects at the time of enrollment. We therefore determine that there is no proven violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46. 103(b)(4)(iii) regarding this allegation. (6) The complainant alleged that while patients who lived alone were to be excluded under the IRB-approved protocol, subject 111 was enrolled even though she lived alone, in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii). Review of the study record found that the subject disclosed that she lived with her son at study entry. Subject 111's self-assessment (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer) questionnaire rated her perception of emotional support from her family with the highest mark. Ten days prior to her death a research chart note stated that her social support had not been what she had indicated at the time of her entry into the study. At the same time period however, there were other records of conversations with the subject's son and daughter regarding the subject's medications and preparation for hospice care. We therefore determine that there is no proven violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) regarding this allegation. (7) The complainant alleged that while patients with significant histories of psychiatric illness were to be excluded under the IRB-approved protocol, subjects with significant histories of psychiatric illnesses were included in the study, in violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii). We note that the protocol exclusion criteria stated that a subject may be included if they have \"No serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or intensive treatment (e.g. serious infection).\" Based on our review of the provided material, it appeared that subjects with previous histories of psychiatric illnesses were properly evaluated for their ability to cooperate with the protocol and provide informed consent. We therefore determine that there is no proven violation of HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) regarding this allegation. As a result, there should be no need for further involvement of OHRP in this matter. Of course, we must be notified should new information be identified which might alter this determination. We appreciate the continued commitment of your institution to the protection of human research subjects. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions. | | Sincerely, Paul J.

HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.117(a) require that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and that is signed by the subject, or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless the IRB waives this requirement. We determine that the informed consent for the 40 of 62 subjects referenced by CUMC was not documented prior to the start of research activities, nor was the requirement for documentation waived by the CUMC IRB for subjects in this study. Required Action: Please provide us with a corrective action plan that addresses the above determinations by March 21, 2008. If you need assistance in developing a corrective action plan, please feel free to contact us. We appreciate the continued commitment of your institution to the protection of human research subjects. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions. | | Sincerely, Paul J.

Results include erythema (reddening of the skin due to capillary expansion), edema (excessive fluid accumulation in tissue spaces), and ecchymoses (purple discoloration of the skin due to rupture of blood vessels). The above description relates to fire cupping (the fire cupping method), which has several forms. Other forms of cupping include the acupuncture cupping method, the air pumping cupping method, and the water cupping method. curanderismo (curanderismo healing system): Mexican-American \"healing\" tradition. It encompasses acupuncture and homeopathy. Its theory posits natural and supernatural sources of illness; alleged supernatural sources include evil spirits and brujos (practitioners of antisocial magic). The word curanderismo derives from the Spanish verb anthroposophy. The purported design of eurhythmy is \"direct\" expression of a rhythm that pervades \"Nature.\" Proponents describe the art as a visual form of speech and music. Curative eurhythmy allegedly causes the inward conveyance of a \"harmonizing process\" that influences diseased organs, the \"astral body,\" \"etheric body.\" Cymatics: \"The science of wave phenomena\"; an alleged means of restoring health advanced by Sir Peter Guy Manners, M.D., D.O., Ph.D. (see \"cymatic therapy\"). Its postulate is that life is sound, and illness is any deviation in its \"pattern.\" Apparently, the word \"Cymatics\" refers to both cymatic therapy and the \"science\" behind cymatic therapy (cymatic medicine): Form of \"vibrational bioenergetics medicine\" developed by Sir Peter Guy Manners, M.D., D.O., Ph.D., of England. It is an acupressure-like method wherein devices send \"beneficial\" sound through the skin. This sound purportedly reestablishes \"healthy resonance\" in \"unhealthy\" tissues. Cymatics theory posits acupuncture meridians and holds that \"life is sound\" and that every part of the body vibrates at a unique audible are no health concerns about the components of composite resins, glass ionomers, and other nonamalgam materials.](https://quackwatch.org/dental/hg/myths210/) Dental Watch Home Page Amalgam \u2014 Resurrection and Redemption Part 2: The Medical Mythology of Anti-Amalgam Michael J.

Amalgam \u2014 Resurrection and Redemption Part 2: The Medical Mythology of Anti-Amalgam Michael J. Wahl, D.D.S. Myth #10: There are no health concerns about the components of composite resins, glass ionomers, and other nonamalgam materials. Fact #10: Although they appear safe and effective, there are health concerns warranting further study about the components of composite resins, glass ionomers, and other nonamalgam materials. Since many anti-amalgamists consider mercury released from dental amalgams to be unsafe, they recommend the use of \"nontoxic\" nonamalgam alternatives, most commonly composite resins. One group of anti-amalgamists stated, \"It would seem that now is the time for dentistry to use composite (polymeric and ceramic) alternatives and discard the metal alchemy bestowed on its profession from a less enlightened era.\" [1] But Mackert stated: A frequent claim by the anti-amalgamists is that \"no research has shown that dental amalgam is safe,\" yet the same charge can be leveled against composites and other dental materials. No material can ever be judged \"safe\" with any kind of finality, because new biological evaluation techniques are always being developed, and previously unanticipated adverse effects are continually being discovered for all materials [2]. Just as amalgam fillings release mercury, so composite resin restorations have been shown to leach between 14 and 22 separate potentially hazardous compounds, including study of 35 identifiable dental resin composite monomers/additives of commercial composite resin composites (Table 1), investigators found nine severely or moderately cytotoxic components [4]. Other studies have also shown composite resin components to be cytotoxic (causing damage or destruction of cells). [5-15] Several studies have shown that dentin bonding agents and their components are mutagenic (cause mutations in new generations). [16-19] Wataha et al stated, \"the components of resin composites are hazardous in that they all cause significant toxicity in direct contact with fibroblasts.\" [20] Table 1. Components of Resin Composites Abbreviation Wiley-Liss, Inc., a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adapted from Geurtsen W et al [4] Resin composite components have been shown to cause immunosupression or immunostimulation [21] and to inhibit DNA [22] and RNA synthesis [23]. Resin composite restorative material was shown to be more cytotoxic than amalgam in a comparative in vitro study [24]. Various resin components of dentin bonding agents have been shown to suppress the mitochondrial acitivty of macrophages [25]. Various composite restorative materials implanted into animals have been shown to cause inflammatory responses, including an increase in lymphocytic infiltration as well as fibroblasts and epithelioid cells [26]. There have been several reports of allergy to composite resins and their ingredients [27-31]. It has been suggested that composite resins may be a cause of hand eczema and skin symptoms in dentists [32]. Vinyl, latex, and modified latex gloves are permeable to several resin composite materials [33]. Some resin monomers have been shown to encourage the growth of cariogenic microorganisms [34]. Resin composites [35], sealants [36], and glass ionomers [37] have been shown to release formaldehyde, a possible carcinogen [38]. One dentist, commenting on the fact that some anti-amalgamists describe composite resins as \"mercury-free fillings,\" has called amalgam restorations \"formaldehyde-free resins contain the initiator benzoyl peroxide [40], which has been shown to be carcinogenic in many studies [41-43]. There is even concern that there may be environmental harm from the waste in dental offices using composite resin filling materials [44]. Glass ionomer cements have been shown to inhibit macromolecular synthesis [23]. In a review of the side-effects of dental ceramics, Mackert reported that ceramic dental restorations may cause silica granulomas and often contain radioactive fluorescing agents, both of which may cause systemic effects [45]. Even gold can be allergenic [46]. One study showed that the gold itself in gold foil restorations, and not the condensation of the gold foil, caused hemorrhage, destruction of odontoblasts, and inflammation of the pulp [47]. Most reviews have concluded that composite restorative materials are safe [48-51], but there is far more knowledge about dental amalgam than there is about composite resin and glass ionomer filling materials [52]. After extensively reviewing the toxicity of non-amalgam filling materials, Schmalz concluded, \"it is not possible to rank dental filling materials in respect to their biocompatibility, and it is evident that biocompatibility must be considered to the same extent for both amalgams and commonly used or recommended alternative fillings materials.\" [53] Conclusions Amalgam restorations release small quantities of mercury, but apparently not enough to cause systemic health problems. Mercury from dental amalgam fillings cannot be linked to kidney damage, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, other central nervous system diseases, \"amalgam disease,\" mental disorders, damage to the immune system, increases in antibiotic resistance, or harmful reproductive effects. Dentists occupationally exposed to mercury from the placement and/or removal of amalgam fillings have not been shown to have harmful reproductive or other systemic health effects, provided proper mercury hygiene is used. Just as with amalgam, although they appear safe, there have been health concerns raised about alternative filling materials, including about composite resin. Dentists, physicians, dental assistants, and patients can be confident that based on the available scientific evidence, amalgam remains a safe and effective filling material.
