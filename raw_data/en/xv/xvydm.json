In the past several weeks of covering the new global coronavirus outbreak, the Red Queen has certainly been running around my mind. Whenever a new virus emerges in the human species, scientists rush to quickly understand its unique structure and, hopefully, devise a vaccine to counteract, or at least contain, it. In this issue's cover story, Simon Makin describes what researchers know so far about the structure of coronaviruses and what tools we may have to disable them (see \" How Coronaviruses Cause Infection\u2014from Colds to Deadly Pneumonia \"). As case num - bers pile up in this country and others, epidemiologists must work swiftly.

Calling an Illness \"Psychosomatic\" Doesn't Mean It's Imaginary Recent experiments have begun mapping the neuronal connections between mind and body like never before 3SECOND BAY STUDIOSInvisible Ink Could Reveal Whether Kids Have Been Vaccinated The technology embeds immuniza - tion records into a child's skin Keeping track of vaccinations remains a major challenge in the developing world, and even in many developed countries paperwork gets lost and parents forget whether their child is up to date. Now a group of Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology researchers has developed a novel way to address this problem: embed- ding the record directly into the skin. Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but eas- ily seen with a special cell-phone fil- ter combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin. The dye would be expected to last up to five years, according to tests on pig and rat skin and human skin in a dish. The system\u2014which has not yet been tested in children\u2014would pro- vide quick and easy access to vacci- nation history, avoid the risk of cleri- cal errors and add little to the cost or risk of the procedure, according to the study, published last December in Science Translational Medicine. \"Especially in developing countries where medical records may not be as complete or as accessible, there can be value in having medical infor- mation directly associated with a person,\" says Mark Prausnitz, a bio- engineering professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new study. Such a system of recording medical infor- mation must be extremely discreet and acceptable to the person whose health information is being recorded and to his or her family, he says. \"This, I think, is a pretty interesting way to accomplish those goals.\" The research, conducted by M.I.T. bioengineers Robert Langer and Ana Jaklenec and their colleagues, uses a NEWS M.I.T. engineers have developed a way to store medical information under the skin, using a quantum dot dye that is delivered, along with a vaccine, by a microneedle patch. The dye, which is invisible to the naked eye, can be read later using a specially adapted smartphone. 4patch of tiny needles called micronee- dles to provide an effective vaccina- tion without a teeth-clenching jab. Microneedles are embedded in a Band-Aid-like device that is placed on the skin; a skilled nurse or technician is not required. Vaccines delivered with microneedles also may not need to be refrigerated, reducing both the cost and the difficulty of delivery, Langer and Jaklenec say. Delivering the dye required the researchers to find something that was safe and that would last long enough to be useful. \"That's really the biggest challenge that we over-came in the project,\" Jaklenec says, adding that the team tested a num- ber of off-the-shelf dyes that could be used in the body but did not find any that endured when exposed to sunlight. The team ended up using a technology called quantum dots, tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light, which were originally devel- oped to label cells during research. The dye has been shown to be safe in humans. The approach raises some privacy concerns, says Prausnitz, who helped invent microneedle technol- ogy and directs Georgia Tech's Cen-ter for Drug Design, Development and Delivery. \"There may be other concerns that patients have about being 'tattooed,' carrying around per- sonal medical information on their bodies or other aspects of this unfa- miliar approach to storing medical records,\" he says. \"Different people and different cultures will probably feel differently about having an invis- ible medical tattoo.\" When people were still vaccinated for smallpox, which has since been eradicated worldwide, they got a visi- ble scar on their arm from the shot that made it easy to identify who had been vaccinated and who had not, Jaklenec says. \"But obviously we didn't want to give people a scar,\" she says, noting that her team was look - ing for an identifier that would be invisible to the naked eye. The researchers also wanted to avoid technologies that would raise even more privacy concerns, such as iris scans and databases with names and identifiable data, she says. The work was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and came about because of a direct request from Microsoft founder and philan- thropist Bill Gates himself, who has been supporting efforts to wipe out diseases such as polio and measles across the world, Jaklenec says. \"If we don't have good data, it's really dif- ficult to eradicate disease,\" she says. The researchers hope to add more detailed information to the dots, such as the date of vaccination. Along with them, the team eventually wants to inject sensors that could also potentially be used to track aspects of health such as insulin levels in dia- betics, Jaklenec says.NEWS A close-up microscope image of the microneedle array, which could deliver quantum dots into skin (left).

MCHUGH ET AL., SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE (2019) 5This approach is likely to be one of many trying to solve the problem of storing individuals' medical infor- mation, says Ruchit Nagar, a fourth- year student at Harvard Medical School, who also was not involved in the new study. He runs a company called Khushi Baby that is also try- ing to create a system for tracking such information, including vaccina- tion history, in the developing world. Working in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, Nagar and his team have devised a necklace, resembling one worn locally, that compresses, encrypts and pass- word-protects medical information.

But Nagar acknowl- edges the possible concerns all such technology poses. \"Messaging and cultural appropriateness need to be considered,\" he says. \u2014Karen WeintraubVirus Spread by Shrews Linked to Human Deaths from Mysterious Brain Infections The pathogen has been newly identified in eight cases of encephalitis in Germany over the past 20 years Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) causes a bizarre and deadly neuro- logical infection in horses, sheep and other domesticated mammals in parts of Germany, Switzerland, Liech- tenstein and Austria. Borna disease was named after a city in eastern Germany where it once killed numerous horses in the late 19th century. Infected animals have been known to engage in strange behav- iors such as smashing their heads into things and \"pipe smoking\"\u2014an informal term for when animals are eating hay and suddenly stop chew- ing mid-mouthful, with the uneaten portion protruding like a pipe. But the disease does not appear to spread between horses; they are thought to acquire it from shrews, which can live in hay and secrete or excrete fluids containing the virus. About 14 years ago researchers identified the bicolored white-toothed shrew as a reservoir host\u2014an organ- ism in which a virus replicates but does not usually cause illness\u2014for BoDV-1. Horses and sheep are con- sidered \"dead-end hosts\" that cannot spread the pathogen. For decades, scientists had debated whether the virus is zoonotic, or capable of jump- ing from animals to humans. Several studies even suggested that it might be present in people with psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizo- phrenia and bipolar disorder. It was later shown, however, that the viral RNA sequences detected in these studies were likely the result of labo- ratory contamination, and research on human infections subsided. But in 2015 a related type of bor- navirus found in exotic squirrels was implicated in at least four human deaths. Then, between 2018 and 2019, scientists detected the classi- cal bornavirus, BoDV-1, in five peo-NEWS GETTY IMAGES Bicolored white-toothed shrew in its natural environment 6ple in Germany who suffered serious or fatal encephalitis (brain inflamma- tion caused by infection)\u2014three of whom were recipients of organ transplants and were taking drugs to suppress their immune system. Now, in a study published in January in Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers have reported eight addi- tional cases of BoDV-1 infection in humans who died of encephalitis. The pathogen appears to have flown under the radar for decades, but the researchers say doctors should be considering it a potential cause in such deaths. \"We now have eight more cases, and these provide additional material for a better understanding of the dis- ease,\" says Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany, who was co-senior author of the new study and also was part of the team that reported the squir- rel bornavirus infections. The find- ings confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encepha- litis. \"But the risk is, to our opinion, pretty low,\" Beer says. Beer and his colleagues analyzed postmortem brain tissue from 56 patients in southeastern Germany's state of Bavaria between 1999 and 2019. The samples were tested for genetic material from BoDV-1, which the researchers verified by additional testing for antibodies to it. Seven out of nine patients who died of enceph- alitis of unknown cause at one diag- nostic center later tested positive for the virus (one of these cases had been reported previously). An addi- tional two cases with positive tests were also included in the analysis. The results confirmed that the virus had caused eight new enceph- alitis cases; two of the patients were immune-compromised individuals who had received organ transplants, and six were not. Because other recipients of organs from the same donor did not test positive for the virus, researchers think the transplant recipients who died from the virus probably acquired it because they were immune-compromised, not from the donor. The patients suffered symptoms including headache, fever and confusion that later progressed to coma and ultimately death. All of the patients lived in rural areas and worked or spent a lot of time outside. Most had also been around cats, which are known to catch shrews and sometimes pre sent them to their owners. Beer and his team hypothesize that the patients were exposed to BoDV-1 this way or perhaps by inhaling dust containing dried shrew urine. Future research will be needed to determine the exact infection route, he says. Once in a human or horse host, the virus is thought to cross the blood- brain barrier into the central nervous system, where it triggers the host's immune system to attack brain tissue. \"It's not the virus killing the brain cell or nerve tissue,\" Beer explains. \"It's the [host's] own immune system recog- nizing the infection and starting to kill parts of brain.\" There is no known treatment for the disease, but researchers are exploring whether antivirals such as ribavirin\u2014which has been shown to kill a range of bornaviruses in cells grown in a dish and in animal stud- ies\u2014could be effective in treating BoDV-1 infections in humans. Beer and his colleagues have plans to test newer antivirals against the virus in animal studies. \"I think it's an excellent paper,\" says Norbert Nowotny, a professor of virology at the University of Veter- inary Medicine, Vienna, who was not involved in the new study but was part of the group that discovered shrews were a reservoir host for the virus. \"This Borna disease is really a strange disease\u2014it's not like a flu,\" he adds, noting that it does not cause epidemics. \"It's a single-ani- mal disease, and it seems to be the same in humans.\" The virus itself is somewhat unusual in that it has a very short genome and makes only a few pro- teins. It does not seem to infect many individuals\u2014but when it does, it kills them very efficiently. Numer- ous other zoonotic viruses infect many people but are seldom deadly. Previous research has found that humans and most mammals actually have bornavirus sequences in their genomes, which may help organisms protect themselves against infection, some hypothesize. Fortunately, the virus does not appear to be transmitted between humans. \"I think we are all happy that this is not a virus that can spread easily,\" Beer says. But in light of these new findings, doctors should consider BoDV-1 as a possi- ble cause of encephalitis in areas where it has been known to infect humans and horses. \u2014Tanya LewisNEWS 7Bacteria \"Tolerant\" of One Antibiotic Are More Likely to Develop Resistance Even combination therapies do not prevent such pathogens from becoming resistant One way to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance has been to use multiple drugs. Give patients two antibiotics, the thinking goes, and even if the microbes are resistant to one of them, the other will work. But a new study suggests that drug combinations can actually speed the development of resistance. In a paper published in January in Science, Israeli researchers showed that when a patient develops toler- ance to a single antibiotic in a combi- nation\u2014meaning it kills bacteria more slowly\u2014outright resistance to the second drug becomes more likely. Previous work by the same team and others had already shown the same effect in a lab dish: they found that slowing the killing rate can lead to resistance such that the bacteria continue to grow even in the pres-ence of an antibiotic. But this was the first study to demonstrate the process in people, according to its senior author Nathalie Balaban, a biophysicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The study, although small, reveals a major threat to the way doctors currently think about combination antibiotics, says Ramanan Laxmina- rayan, director of the Center for Dis- ease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the work. \"Our entire approach to antibiotics is going to have to be rethought,\" says Laxmina- rayan, who is also a senior research scholar at Princeton University. \"We can't do this 'give to everybody and kumbaya' [approach], which is what we're following now.\" Clinicians tend not to focus on tol- erance, because it may not have much impact in the short term. \"Their own patients are [probably] going to be treatable,\" Laxminarayan says, although the killing action of the anti- biotic may kick in more slowly. \"It's really a public health problem, not a clinical problem\" for a single patient. \"We agree that judicious use and proper antimicrobial stewardship is critical to preserving the longevity of our antibiotics,\" say Andrew Berti, an assistant professor at Wayne State University's Eugene Applebaum Col- lege of Pharmacy and Health Sci- ences, and Elizabeth Hirsch, an assis- tant professor at the University of Minnesota's College of Pharmacy. Neither Berti nor Hirsch was involved in the study, but they co-wrote a related Perspectives piece in the same issue of Science. \"However,\" they say, \"in the absence of a rapid, validated means to determine antibi- otic tolerance, we continue to see a clear role for combination antibiotic therapy in cases of documented staphylococcal infection, [where such] combinations maintain their ability to suppress resistance development against typical, nontolerant bacteria.\" Every year in the U.S. more than 35,000 people die, and more than 2.8 million get sick, from antibiot- ic-resistant infections, according to 8NEWS KARI LOUNATMAA GETTY IMAGESColored transmission electron micrograph of a deadly cluster of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria.the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The challenge is that tolerance cannot be measured in the clinic, so doctors cannot tell whether a patient has developed it. This will not make much difference in an otherwise healthy person who just needs a little help to fight off an infection, Balaban says. But it could be life-threatening in an already weakened patient with a blood infection. Balaban and her colleagues at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Israel looked at the evolution of potentially deadly methicillin-resis- tant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in two patients with blood infections that lasted for more than two weeks even though they were on antibiot- ics. One patient was first put on the antibiotic vancomycin. After four days rifampicin was added to that person's regimen. Then, from day eight to day 14, vancomycin was replaced with daptomycin. When the team tested bacteria taken from the patient, the microbes that had developed tolerance against vancomycin were also killed more slowly by daptomycin. And the combination of rifampicin and dapto-mycin was not any more effective than the single agent. The researchers also showed that such resistance develops in some other dangerous bacteria and with other antibiotic combinations. They next plan to study whether the effect occurs in more types of bacteria, Bal- aban says, and to examine antibiotic combinations that could effectively treat life-threatening infections with- out promoting resistance. Theoretically, the second drug in a combination is expected to kill any of the microbes left alive by the first antibiotic. But the new study demon- strated that when a patient is already tolerant to the first drug, adding a second one spurs resistance by pro- moting the reproduction of bacteria that were not killed immediately. As a patient's serum level of anti- biotic drops between daily doses, the bacteria that \"went to sleep\" in the presence of the drug can reawaken and reproduce enough to evolve re- sistance, Berti says. Hirsch says the new study's major contribution was finding in patients what had already been seen in the lab. Berti agrees: \"It's been assumed for a long time,\" he says. \"This is the first time it's been shown\" definitively in patients.Balaban says the same evolution- ary processes involved in the devel- opment of antibiotic tolerance and resistance are likely to be at play in cancer as well and might be used to inform treatment. Tumor cells might become tolerant of chemotherapy first and then develop resistance that spreads to other drugs. She does not plan to conduct such research herself, however. The new study points to the need for a laboratory test to detect whether the bacteria infecting a patient are tolerant of the planned antibiotic treatment before starting therapy, says Bruce Levin, a biology professor at Emory University. Levin, an evolu- tionary biologist who studies infec- tious disease and drug treatment and was not involved in the study, adds that he was intrigued and impressed by the results. The ques- tion is, he says, \"Will this study serve as a warning, [and] will people respond to it? Or will it be just another academic exercise?\" Editor's Note (1/13/20): This arti- cle was updated to include addi- tional comments from Andrew Berti and Elizabeth Hirsch on the use of combination antibiotic therapy. \u2014Karen WeintraubWhat's in Kale (or a Pear) That Seems to Lower Alzheimer's Risk? Particular antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may lower chances of getting the disease A number of studies in recent years have shown that clean living\u2014exer- cise, sleep, a Mediterranean diet\u2014low- ers one's prospect of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Some of these rec- ommendations sound a little like a parent's entreaty to a child to eat the daily apple or finish broccoli left on a plate. What does it really mean, though, to say that eating greens or berries diminishes risk? How much do such changes lower your chances of Alzheimer's? And which specific chemicals help to ward off the most common type of dementia? A study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center, published in January in Neurology, tries to pin down some specifics\u2014and in doing so, it demonstrates the benefits of using dietary measures to stay cog- nitively intact. The team took 921 NEWS 910participants without dementia from Rush's Memory and Aging Project, a large ongoing study that began more than 20 years ago. The recruits, who had a mean age of 81, were tracked for an average of six years. Study members who followed a regimen with the highest flavonol levels\u2014the top fifth\u2014had a 48 per- cent lower risk of receiving an Alz- heimer's diagnosis than those in the bottom quintile. (Flavonols are a class of antioxidant and anti-inflam- matory molecules found in foods.) As the study progressed, 28 people in the top flavanol group of 186 study members, or 15 percent, went on to develop Alzheimer's. Meanwhile 54 of the 182 participants in the lowest quintile, or 30 percent, received such a diagnosis. The study's takeaway is that \"a healthy diet that contains vari- ous fruits and vegetables is critical for continued health\u2014but especially brain health,\" says Thomas M. Hol- land of Rush, who led the research. In the paper, the researchers dug deeper into the issue, analyzing the risk reduction for the four flavonols surveyed: isorhamnetin, kaempferol, myricetin and quercetin. who ingested the most isorhamnetin-rich foods\u2014pears, olive oil, wine and tomato sauce\u2014 achieved a 38 percent risk reduction compared with members in the low- est quintile. Kale, beans, tea, spinach and broccoli were the sources of the most kaempferol, which furnished a 51 percent drop in risk. Tea, wine, kale, oranges and tomatoes provided lots of myricetin, along with a 38 percent lower Alzheimer's incidence. Toma- toes, kale, apples and tea are loaded with quercetin, but no health benefit was registered for that flavonol. The biochemical composition of flavonols (part of a larger antioxidant class known as flavonoids) appears to enable them to quell inflammation and to scavenge free radicals in the blood and the gut to help prevent cellular damage. \"This study adds to our understanding of which ele- ments of a healthy diet may be important in reducing dementia risk,\" says Keith Fargo, director of scien- tific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association, who was not involved in the new paper. \"At this point,\" he adds, \"people should not put too much stock in specific nutrients\u2014including subsets of flavonols\u2014for reducing dementia risk until more research is done. Rather they should focus on eating an overall healthy diet.\" Also, getting your kaempferol from kale may be better than searching online for a supplement that contains the molecule. \"There's a multitude of vitamins, minerals, and bioactive sub- stances in individual foods that you may not get if you're taking multiple supplements,\" Holland says. The Neurology study did not include a control group, so it was not able to establish a cause-and-effect relation- ship between dietary patterns and lowered risk. Future investigations also need to look at a more diverse group. Most of the new paper's partic- ipants were highly motivated, white and well educated, and three quarters were women. The senior author of the study was Martha Clare Morris, who developed a diet called the Mediterranean-DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper- tension) Intervention for Neurodegen- erative Delay, or MIND, which has been linked to lower Alzheimer's risk. Morris is now heading an effort to do a randomized controlled trial to con- firm, with hard evidence, whether this diet really does serve as a preventive measure. When the results are in, it might actually be possible to counter jokes about kale with real data. \u2014Gary StixNEWS RON LEVINE GETTY IMAGESAre Human Body Temperatures Cooling Down? A new study finds that they have dropped on average over the past century and a half It is one of those facts of life that we learn early and don't forget: normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. But a new study in eLife argues that that number is outdated. The figure was probably accurate in 1851, when German doctor Carl Rein- hold August Wunderlich found it to be the average armpit temperature of 25,000 patients. Times have changed, though, according to the recent paper: the average American now seems to run more than a degree F lower. Stanford University researchers looked at data from Civil War sol- diers and veterans and from two more recent cohorts to confirm that body temperatures among American men averaged around 98.6 degrees F back then but have steadily fallen over time and that temperatures among women have fallen as well. Their data reveal an average for men and women of 97.5 degrees F. The study suggests that in the process of altering our surroundings, we have also altered ourselves, says senior author Julie Parsonnet of Stanford. \"We've changed in height, weight\u2014and we're colder,\" she says. \"I don't really know what [the new measurements] mean in terms of health, but they're telling us some- thing. They're telling us that we are changing and that what we've done in the last 150 years has made us change in ways we haven't before.\" The researchers did not determine the cause of the apparent tempera- ture drop, but Parsonnet thinks it could be a combination of factors, including warmer clothing, indoor temperature controls, a more seden- tary way of life and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014a decline in infectious diseases. She notes that people today are much less likely to have infections such as tuberculosis, syphilis and gum disease. In places like the U.S., people also spend more time in what scientists call the thermoneutral zone\u2014an environment of climate-controlled temperatures that make it unneces- sary to rev up the metabolic system to stay warm or to cool off, she says. That perpetually 72-degree-F office may feel cold to some, but it does not stress out the human body the way it would to spend the night in a 40-degree-F cave. It is unclear whether those who live closer to the way people did in the 1800s\u2014with more infection or less climate con- trol\u2014have higher body temperatures. Research on the Tsiman\u00e9, indige- nous people who live in lowland Bolivia, suggests that infections can boost average body temperature. A 2016 paper showed that responses to infection accounted for about 10 percent of resting metabolism in that population and that lower metab- olism was associated with slightly lower body temperature, says Michael Gurven, an anthropologist at the Uni- versity of California, Santa Barbara, who conducted that study but was not involved in the new one. Yet even in healthy members of the Tsiman\u00e9 population, temperatures appear to have dropped between 2004 and 2018, he adds\u2014a phenomenon he plans to investigate further.

For two decades research has debunked the benchmark, set way back in 1868, yet it persists. One important ramification, says Jonathan S. Hausmann, a rheumatologist at Boston Children's Hospital, who led the latest study, is to redefine fever. Most doctors use 100.4 \u00b0F or higher, but if \"normal\" is lower, then the fever threshold should be, too. It also should vary with the daily pattern and be tailored to each individual, Hausmann says: \"A child at 99.0 \u00b0F at 4 a.m. may be highly abnormal but at 4 p.m. could be within normal limits.\" A B C 12metabolism and body temperature. And she hopes to explore that con- nection more in the future. For the eLife study, she and her colleagues compared temperatures from three different data sets: a total of 83,900 measurements from the Union Army Veterans of the Civil War (UAVCW) cohort collected between 1862 and 1930; 15,301 measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) collected between 1971 and 1975; and 578,222 measurements from the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) collected between 2007 and 2017. Figures for women were not available from the earliest data set but were collected from the two later cohorts, and the research showed that body temperature for men and women decreased steadily across the time periods. Philip Mackowiak, an emeritus professor of medicine at the Univer- sity of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study, says data from as far back as the Civil War are inherently suspect. \"That's not to say that what [the new study] found is not valid. It could be, but you just don't know,\" he says, because there are so many variables that could not be controlled for in the data set, such as whether sol- diers and veterans were healthy when tested, where the thermometer was placed and what kind of instru- ment was used. Even Wunderlich's established 1851 result is questionable, Macko- wiak says, because although he had a large database of patients, it is hard to know whether he measured temperature consistently or how he analyzed such a volume of informa- tion long before the invention of computers. And \"the body is com- posed of a whole host of tempera- tures,\" Mackowiak adds. The liver is the hottest part, and the surface of the skin is the coldest. Plus, he says, \"there's no 'normal' temperature; there's a range of temperatures,\" with people running hotter later in the day than they do in the morning. Women also have higher tempera- tures on average than men, in part because their temperatures rise with ovulation. Parsonnet agrees that the Civil War data set has some limitations, such as where caregivers took the temperatures and whether they were careful or simply filled in 98.6 degrees F because that is what they knew normal temperature was sup- posed to be. Those concerns were tempered, she says, by the fact that she and her team found a similar annual drop in temperature between the 1970s cohort and the current one. The effect was still present when they looked at soldiers' and veterans' year of birth rather than when the temperature was obtained, suggesting that the type of ther- mometer or the caregiver's attitude could not explain the change. And within the data set, the researchers found the expected variation by age, weight and height, suggesting that the values were not random. Even with the data's limitations, the findings are compelling, according to Frank R\u00fchli, founding chair and direc- tor of the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, who says he reviewed the paper for eLife but was not involved in the research. \"Human body temperature data going back that far\u2014roughly 150 years\u2014is very interesting,\" he says. \"It allows us to see short-term alterations of physiological traits in humans, which is quite rare.\" All the experts agree on one thing: a fever is still a fever. Lowering the average for normal body tempera- ture does not mean that the stan- dard for a fever\u2014generally consid- ered to be higher than 100 degrees F for adults\u2014should be changed, Mackowiak says. \"Temperature can be helpful in determining whether or not you're ill and, based on its level, how ill you might be,\" he says. For patients, a bacterial infection plus a lower-than-normal temperature could be an even more ominous sign than one higher than normal, he says. A rise or fall in temperature can also indicate whether you are getting better or how you are responding to medication, he adds, though \"how you feel is the most important thing.\" The new study probably should not change the definition of fever, R\u00fchli says. \"But the variety of what is looked at as being normal should probably be adjusted.\" \u2014 Karen WeintraubNEWS \"We've changed in height, weight\u2014and \u2014Julie Parsonnet 13The outbreak of a novel coronavirus raises questions about how such pathogens evolve and what makes infections mild or severe By Simon Makin GETTY IMAGES How Coronaviruses Cause Infection\u2014 from Colds to Deadly Pneumonia 14THE 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (2019-nCoV) behind the ongoing outbreak\u2014which the World Health Organization has declared an inter- national public health emergency\u2014was named after the family of viruses it belongs to. The term \"coronavirus\" may have initially been unfamiliar to many, but most everyone has encountered milder forms of such viruses, of which four strains cause about a fifth of com- mon cold cases. Other types cause diseases that are endemic in certain animal populations. But until less than two decades ago, all known human varieties caused illness so mild that coronavirus research was something of a backwater. That all changed in 2003 when the pathogen behind the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in China was identified as a coronavirus. \"Everybody in the field was shocked,\" says microbiologist Susan Weiss of the University of Pennsylvania. \"People started really caring about this group of viruses.\" That outbreak is believed to have started when a coronavirus jumped from animals\u2014most likely civet cats\u2014to humans, resulting in a type of disease called a zoonosis. These viruses' propen - sity for such jumps was underlined in 2012 when a differ - ent virus jumped from camels to humans, causing MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). That illness has killed 858 people to date, primarily in Saudi Arabia, rep- resenting approximately 34 percent of those infected. SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus almost certainly all originated in bats. The most recent analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome found that it shares 96 percent of its RNA with a coronavirus previously identified in a specific bat species in China. \"These viruses have been floating around in bats for a long time\" without sickening the ani -mals, says microbiologist Stanley Perlman of the Univer- sity of Iowa. But there were no bats being sold at the ani- mal market in Wuhan, China, where the current outbreak is thought to have begun, suggesting that an intermedi - ate host species was likely involved. This situation seems to be a common feature of these outbreaks. Such hosts may increase the viruses' genetic diversity by facilitating more or different mutations. But what is a coronavirus? What determines whether, when and how it jumps to humans and how infectious it will be? And what makes the difference between a case of the sniffles and a deadly disease? In the years since these viruses first emerged as a severe global health threat, researchers have been studying their molecular biology in an effort to answer such questions. ANATOMY OF A CORONAVIRUS Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, which means that their genome consists of a strand of RNA (rather than DNA) and that each viral par -ticle is wrapped in a protein \"envelope.\" Viruses all do basically the same thing: invade a cell and co-opt some of its components to make many copies of themselves, which then infect other cells. But RNA replication typi - cally lacks the error-correction mechanisms cells employ when copying DNA, so RNA viruses make mistakes during replication. Coronaviruses have the longest genomes of any RNA virus\u2014consisting of 30,000 letters, or bases\u2014 and the more material a pathogen copies, the more oppor - tunities there are for mistakes. The upshot is that these viruses mutate very rapidly. Some of these mutations may confer new properties, such as the ability to infect new cell types\u2014or even new species. A coronavirus particle consists of four structural pro - teins: nucleocapsid, envelope, membrane and spike. The nucleocapsid forms the genetic core, encapsulated in a ball formed by the envelope and membrane proteins. The spike protein forms club-shaped protrusions that stick out all over the ball, making it resemble a crown or the sun's corona\u2014hence the name. These protrusions bind to receptors on host cells, determining the cell types\u2014and thus the range of species\u2014that the virus can infect. The major difference between coronaviruses that cause a cold and those that cause a severe illness is that the for - mer primarily infect the upper respiratory tract (the nose and throat), whereas the latter thrive in the lower respi- ratory tract (the lungs) and can lead to pneumonia. The SARS virus binds to a receptor called ACE2, and MERS binds to one called DPP4\u2014both are found in lung cells, among other places. Differences in the distribution of Simon Makin is a freelance science writer based in London. 15these receptors in tissues and organs may account for dif - ferences between the two diseases, such as the fact that MERS is deadlier than SARS and features more promi - nent gastrointestinal symptoms. MERS is not hugely infectious, however, which may also be a receptor-related trait. \"DPP4 is expressed [highly] in the lower bronchi [airways leading into the lungs], so you have to have a large number of viruses coming in, because our airways are very good at filtering out pathogens,\" says virologist Christine Tait-Burkard of the University of Edinburgh. \"You need prolonged, intense exposure [to reach the lungs], which is why we see people who work closely with camels getting sick.\" Conversely, because pathogens can get in and out of the upper airways more readily, viruses that replicate there are more infectious. In addition, \"the ability to replicate in different temperatures makes a big difference, because the upper respiratory tract is cooler,\" Tait-Burkard says. \"If the virus is more stable at those temperatures, it doesn't go to the lower respiratory tract.\" The lower airways are also a more biochemically and immunologically hostile environment, she adds. Analysis of 2019-nCoV strongly suggests that the new virus, like SARS, uses ACE2 to gain entry to cells. This observation would fit with the fact that it appears, so far, to be less deadly than MERS (the cur - rent estimated mortality rate for the new coronavirus is about 2 percent, but that figure may change as the out - break unfolds and more cases are detected). The picture quickly becomes complex, though, because viruses that use the same receptor can result in drasti - cally different illnesses. One human coronavirus called NL63 binds to the same receptor as SARS but only causes upper respiratory infections, whereas SARS primarily infects the lower respiratory tract. \"Why that is, we don't know,\" Perlman says. Another curiosity is that the ACE2 receptor is prevalent in the heart, but SARS does not infect heart cells. \"That was a clear indication that other receptors, or co-receptors, are also involved,\" says molec- ular biologist Burtram Fielding of the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. The virus binding to a receptor is only the first step in the cell-entry process. When a virus binds to a host cell, the two start morphing together, and other viral proteins may bind to other recep - tors. \"For the efficiency of entry, it's not just the one main receptor,\" Fielding says. \"There could be others as well.\" IMMUNE SYSTEM ARMS RACE Another important feature of coronaviruses is their \"accessory\" proteins, which appear to be involved in evad - ing the host's innate immune response\u2014the body's front line of defense. The response is initiated when a cell detects an invader and releases proteins called interfer- ons, which interfere with the pathogen's replication. The interferons trigger cascades of antiviral activity, from shutting down host protein synthesis to inducing cell death. Unfortunately, most of these processes are also bad for the host. \"A lot of the disease that's caused is actually the immune reaction\u2014inflammation\u2014and destructive things induced by viruses,\" Weiss says. \"That will also determine how virulent a virus is: how much of a destruc - tive immune response does it induce, as opposed to just a protective one?\" This aspect is also why underlying medical conditions are so important. Most of the people who have died from the new coronavirus so far \"had comorbidities, like autoimmune diseases, or secondary infections, which can become much more prevalent once our innate immune systems are busy fighting a virus,\" Tait-Burkard says. \"That's why the important thing is to treat people for comorbidities and give them antibiotics to stop bacterial infections taking hold.\" Of course, the immune response's purpose is to elimi - nate invaders, so viruses possess countermeasures. This trait seems to be what differs most among various coro- naviruses. \"These viruses are closely related, but they have different accessory proteins,\" Weiss says, adding that they \"have evolved to shut down various aspects of that [innate immune] response.\" Some researchers think bats harbor coronaviruses because they do not mount the intense immune response humans do. \"A lot of the sig - naling molecules that alert our immune system are sup- pressed in bats, so they don't get sick,\" Tait-Burkard says. Rather than reacting, bats maintain a constant low-level response, which may contribute to the viruses' evolution. \"[Bats] have a constant expression of interferons, which selects for viruses that are good at evading that response,\" Tait-Burkard says. \"So bats are very good selection vessels for viruses that are very good at hiding.\" Accessory proteins are far from fully understood, how- ever. \"They can be taken out of some viruses without any effect on the ability of the virus to grow,\" Perlman says. \"You would think: if you had a protein that was key for countering the immune response, if you took it out, the immune response would win\u2014and it's not necessarily so.\" Some researchers believe accessory proteins influence how deadly coronaviruses are. There have been studies with SARS in which removing an accessory protein did not change the virus's replication efficiency but did make it less pathogenic. \"Lots of virus would still be made, but it seemed to be less harmful,\" Fielding says. Coronaviruses do possess some ability to correct genetic errors, but it neglects certain regions of their genome, Tait-Burkard says. Consequently, two sections in particu- lar are especially prone to mutations: those that encode the spike protein, and accessory protein regions. \"In those two areas, coronaviruses allow a lot of mistakes, which drives their evolution, because they manage to bind to new receptors and evade the immune response of new systems,\" Tait-Burkard says, \"which is why coronaviruses are so good at jumping from species to species.\" Related Video 16GETTY IMAGESFrom online journal clubs to \"tweetorials\" to conference updates, social media is changing the dissemination and discussion of biomedicine By Nicole W etsman 17How Twitter Is Changing Medical ResearchEsther Choo only had a few thousand followers on twitter before August 2017. Choo, an emergency physician at the Oregon Health & Science University, interacted mostly with other doctors. But when she tweeted one day about the racism she had endured while practicing medicine, her posts went viral\u2014and her follower count shot up to 20,000 almost overnight. Now she has nearly 80,000 followers. \"The professional benefits have been so concrete,\" Choo says. Twitter, for her, has helped her meet new profes - sional colleagues and friends and has offered opportu - nities for advocacy around racial and gender equity in medicine. \"It's hard to imagine what my career would be like without it.\" As a high-profile physician on the platform, Choo (@choo_ek) is an outlier in the medical community in terms of her number of followers\u2014but she is part of a large and growing community of doctors and scientists who use Twitter as part of their professional lives. A Nature survey conducted in 2014 found that 13 percent of scientists use Twitter, and in 2017 an analysis published in PLoS One identified over 45,000 scientists with accounts. Most scientists and physicians do not reach as wide an audience as Choo does, but they find that it has been helpful for their careers. \"Twitter lowers the boundaries of our institutional silos,\" says spe - cialist at the Duke University School of Medicine, who started a Twitter-based journal club for residents. It also helps level the scientific playing field, says Janet Han (@netta_doc), a cardiologist with the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles, and an author on papers about social media in medicine. \"Anybody can be on Twit - ter,\" she says, from first-year students to department chairs. \"Anyone can interact with anyone.\" The platform is also fundamentally reshaping the way scientists and academic physicians can discover, discuss and share research. It is not an extracurricular endeavor to those who participate\u2014it is a critical communication tool, says Vinay Prasad (@VPrasadMDMPH), a hema- tologist-oncologist at Oregon Health & Science Univer - sity and an active Twitter user with over 30,000 follow - ers. But that change comes with growing pains, and everyone from individuals to major institutions is strug- gling to figure out the best way to incorporate social media into traditional metrics around achievements. \"It's probably one of the most disruptive\u2014and net beneficial\u2014 things that has happened in academic medicine,\" Prasad says.IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS Before Twitter, researchers had limited ways to respond to and critique new research in their field. They could write a letter to the editor or an opinion piece in a journal, but that response would be published only if editors of that journal agreed to it. Even if it was published, it would often not appear for weeks. They could conduct their own experiments and publish their own papers, but that ave - nue is also subject to the same gatekeeping and time restrictions. Blogs allow self-publishing, but it is hard to direct people to them, and the PubMed Commons\u2014which offered a way for researchers to comment directly on arti - cles\u2014never caught on and was discontinued in 2018. Twitter sidesteps those roadblocks and allows conver- sations about new papers to happen immediately and publicly, says Jordan Gauthier (@drjgauthier), a fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. \"On the day of publication, people can react to it,\" says Gauthier, an active Twitter user with around 2,000 followers. Comments on Twitter remove the journal from the equation, allow anyone to discuss scholarship and have high visibility, Prasad says: \"It's a tremendous democra- tization of critique of science.\" The open platform allows for the possibility that some of the criticism or comments might be inaccurate, he adds. \"But I trust that the com- munity is smart enough to draw attention to what is accurate. Inaccurate comments don't get the same retweets.\" Sometimes feedback given on Twitter can be more pointed and critical than what might be given in person Nicole Wetsman is based in New York. 18or in a formal op-ed. \"You can see sharks gathering around a paper to tear it apart,\" Gauthier says. But while they can bite, the trend might help push the quality of research. \"I think about it\u2014am I going to get panned by one of the statisticians online?\" he says. \"Maybe it's driv- ing excellence and improving methods and asking peo - ple to think about what the community in the field thinks, rather than just in your own office.\" GOING CLUBBING Online discussion of papers is sometimes facilitated by Twitter journal clubs. Journal clubs, where researchers get together and critically examine new papers or pieces of literature, are important forums for the exchange of ideas and continuing education. But they traditionally happen in person, and participants are usually limited by location. On Twitter, however, journal clubs can expand beyond those boundaries. Udani, for example, started one for anesthesia residents. Anesthesiologists are often isolated, but using Twitter to talk about papers exposes them to approaches from all over the world. \"It's a change to the traditional journal club, which is a bit outdated,\" he says. A formal analysis of the educational potential of Twit- ter journal clubs, centered on a medical-radiation jour - nal club, concluded that the flexibility and accessibility of the digital environment offer benefits that in-person clubs do not\u2014including the opportunity for more peo - ple to observe without pressure to participate, global engagement and fewer hierarchies based on seniority. In this particular journal club\u2014the #MedRadJClub meet- ing\u2014one hour of conversation could have up to 245 par- ticipants and 4,559 tweets, the analysis showed. Twitter can offer a second chance for papers that might not have been accepted in high-impact journals, says Sha - ronne Hayes (@SharonneHayes), cardiologist and founder of the Women's Heart Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She was the senior author on a 2017 paper that found, for the first time, that female doc - tors were significantly less likely to be introduced with the professional title \"Doctor\" than were their male col- leagues during grand rounds, when clinicians describe patient cases to other physicians\u2014male physicians intro - duced their female colleagues using formal titles only around half the time. The team submitted their results to three high-impact journals but were rejected. \"The main sense I got from reviewers was that they didn't think [the findings] were actually a thing,\" Hayes says. The paper was eventually published in a lower-im - pact women's health journal, but she pushed the paper out on social media and wrote a blog post describing the find- ings. That helped the paper reach a wider audience even out of a less widely read journal. \"As a result, my co-au - thors have been quoted in Time and the Washington Post. \" The scientific community is still trying to figure out how to integrate social media into traditional bench - marks of success. Hayes herself says that the number of retweets and likes a paper gets should not be a surrogate for the value of the science itself. UPENDING POWER STRUCTURES Social media offers an alternative to traditional power structures in science and research, which give high-im - pact journals, tenured professors and prestigious insti - tutions the most weight. On Twitter, people who do not have tenure, who have more limited publications to their name or who are early in their career have opportunities to demonstrate their expertise. But displays of knowl - edge on social media, rather than in traditional forums such as journals, are sometimes criticized as less rele - vant or rigorous. In 2014 a researcher created a metric called the \"Kardashian index \" to measure scientists' Twit - ter followings against the number of citations their papers receive\u2014with the implication that some had Twit -ter \"celebrity\" status that was not grounded in academic success and therefore was not justified. The index was broadly criticized, including by those who took issue with the idea that citations are the most important metric of scientific expertise\u2014which penal - izes junior researchers, for example, who will automati- cally have a lower citation count. \"It's critical of people who seek to communicate more broadly, as if that's a bad thing,\" Prasad says. Choo says that mentality has faded within the scientific community. \"A few years ago it was a very different land - scape,\" she says. \"You don't hear much anymore that you're wasting your time on Twitter and should be writing a paper.\" Some institutions are starting to consider social media activity in hiring and promotion decisions, which is a positive step, says Eric Topol (@EricTopol), a cardiolo - gist and geneticist at the Scripps Research Institute and a high-profile figure (with over 177,000 followers) in sci- entific Twitter. \"Increasingly, this is going to be the way the science community does exchange ideas, and it com- plements the typical story of a person's citations,\" he says. However, it should be included in only a small way, says Hayes. \"Being popular should not be the reason someone becomes a full professor.\" Organizations have to grapple with how much weight they give social media use and how they determine what types of usage are relevant to a person's scientific work. \"We need to systematize the way we assess validity,\" Hayes says. \"It's still a bit of a Wild West out there.\" Choo did not initially think that social media should be incorporated into career-advancement decisions, but she's been won over. \"I was sold on the quality and rigor of some of the educational information people are put - ting out on social media. People do tweetorials, which are really rigorous. It's incredible medical education.\" Choo says, however, that rigorous, quantitative measures need to be developed to assess people's social media use. 19ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE With so many conversations about science and medicine happening on Twitter, people who do not use it at all are missing out on an important forum for conversations about science and medicine, Hayes says. They do not have to be as active as Prasad or Choo\u2014or even tweet at all\u2014but they should keep an eye on the discussion. \"I think it has reached the point where academic physicians for sure should have a presence, if nothing else, just so they can see what's going on. It's like reading journals,\" she says. \"You can't put your head in the sand. It's another source of information.\" People who resist often have common concerns, includ - ing the brevity of tweets and the time it takes away from other work. Reshma Jagsi (@reshmajagsi), deputy chair in the department of radiation oncology at the Univer - sity of Michigan, shared many of those concerns before she started using Twitter this summer. \"I was a Twitter resister,\" she says. She saw her concerns upended quickly, noting that threading tweets and linking out to articles allow for robust conversations. Social media can eat up a lot of time, but it is possible to use it productively and in moderation. Good science, Choo says, often takes time and space, so time manage- ment is key. \"Some days I can get really caught up in it,\" she says. \"I definitely do think you need safeguards in place to make sure you're staying productive.\" Sorting through the volume of information on Twitter and identifying the best ways to use it can take time as well. Ignoring it entirely is not the right solution to that problem, however, and it is possible to see a slice of the information even if someone cannot see everything, Jagsi says. \"The sorting of the wheat from the chaff is, so far, worth it.\" This article is reproduced with permission and was first published in Nature on December 9, 2019. 20 As the first clinical trial results trickle in, researchers look ahead to more sophisticated medical applications for genome editing By Heidi Ledford QUEST TO USE CRISPR AGAINST DISEASE GAINS GROUND A scanning electron microscope image of a sickle-cell red blood cell. GETTY IMAGES 21The prospect of using the popular genome-editing tool CRISPR to treat a host of diseases in people is moving closer to reality. Medical applications of CRISPR-Cas9 had a banner year in 2019. The first results trickled in from trials test- ing the tool in people, and more trials launched. In the coming years researchers will be looking ahead to more sophisticated applications of CRISPR genome editing that could lay the foundation for treating an array of dis - eases from blood disorders to hereditary blindness. But although the results of clinical trials of CRISPR genome editing so far have been promising, researchers say that it is still too soon to know whether the technique will be safe or effective in the clinic. \"There's been a lot of appropriate caution in applying this to treating people,\" says Edward Stadtmauer, an oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadel-phia. \"But I think we're starting to see some of the results of that work.\" It has been only seven years since researchers discov- ered that a molecular defense system called CRISPR- Cas9, which microbes use to fend off viruses and other invaders, could be harnessed to rewrite human genes. Since then gene editing has attracted attention for its potential to modify embryos\u2014an application that is eth- ically and legally fraught if those embryos are destined to become human beings. But in parallel, scientists have been testing CRISPR's much less controversial ability to disable or correct problematic genes in other cells in order to treat a host of diseases. In 2016 Chinese researchers announced that they had treated the first person with a CRISPR-Cas9 therapy designed to fight cancer. In cells extracted from a partic- ipant's blood, the researchers disabled the gene that codes for a protein called PD-1, which holds the immune system in check but can shield cancer cells in the pro - cess. The scientists then reinjected the cells. By 2019 the U.S. government's clinicaltrials.gov data - base listed more than a dozen active studies testing CRISPR-Cas9 as a treatment for a range of diseases from cancer to HIV and blood disorders. So far too few people have been treated in these trials for any firm conclusions to be drawn about the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 therapies or how well they work. Prelim - inary results from two trials\u2014one in which gene-edited blood cells were transplanted into a man to treat HIV infection and one in which they were transplanted into three people to treat some forms of cancer\u2014showed no signs of clinical improvement. SIGNS OF PROGRESS In both cases the transplanted cells flourished in the bone marrow of recipients without any serious safety concerns, but they did not produce a clear medical ben- efit. In the man treated for HIV, the researchers attempted to use CRISPR to disable a protein that many strains of HIV use to enter cells. But only 5 percent of the trans - planted cells were edited\u2014not enough to cure disease, the researchers reported in September. The study has been placed on hold while researchers explore ways to boost that percentage, says Hongkui Deng, a stem-cell researcher at Peking University in Beijing and a lead author of the work. There are early hints that another trial might meet with more success. CRISPR Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Mass., have treated two people with the genetic disorders sickle-cell anemia and -thalassemia. Both deplete oxygen-carrying hemo- globin molecules in the blood; the idea is to use CRISPR to disable a gene that otherwise shuts off production of another form of hemoglobin. Early results suggest that the treatment might have eased some symptoms of the disorders, but the participants will need to be followed for a longer period to be sure. Other researchers are already itching to move beyond editing cells in a dish. The challenge is in finding ways to transport the gene-editing machinery to where it is Heidi Ledford works for Nature magazine. 22needed in the body, says John Leon - ard, chief executive of Intellia Thera- peutics, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass., that is focused on CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. \"The delivery approach is so important.\" Last July the pharmaceutical com - panies Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Mass., and Aller - gan in Dublin launched a trial to treat the genetic disor- der Leber congenital amaurosis 10, which can cause blindness, by editing eye cells. Researchers will inject into the eye a virus containing DNA that encodes the CRISPR genome-editing machinery, bypassing the need to guide those tools through the bloodstream to the spe- cific tissues. The virus will be responsible for carrying the genome-editing tools into cells. It is the first trial to attempt CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing inside the body, and early results could be reported this year. That would be a landmark moment for the field and could pave the way for future trials targeting other organs, says Charles Gersbach, a bioengineer at Duke University in Durham, N.C. But he and others say that they hope researchers will eventually move away from using viruses to shuttle genome-editing machinery into cells. Deactivated viruses can still sometimes provoke immune responses and can carry only a limited amount of DNA. SHRINK TO FIT What's more, some gene-editing tools are currently too large to fit inside commonly used gene-therapy viruses, says chemical biologist Andrew Anzalone at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. These include the souped-up CRISPR systems called prime editors that were first reported in late 2019 and which might prove to be more precise and controllable than CRISPR-Cas9.Intellia is looking for a way around the viruses. The company has part - nered with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis to develop fatty nanoparticles that can protect genome-editing mol - ecules as they travel through the bloodstream but also can pass through the membranes of target cells. These particles tend to accumulate in the liver, and researchers are working to develop particles that infil- trate other tissues, such as muscle or the brain. But for now Intellia will focus on liver diseases, says Leonard, and the company plans to launch its first trial of the tech - nology this year. \"It's crawl before you walk, so to speak,\" he says.

As of this writing the disease has spread to more than 100 countries, including more than 300 confirmed cases in the U.S. But in some ways, outbreaks such as this should come as no surprise. Deforestation and the sale of live wild animals or bushmeat, such as bats and monkeys, make the emergence of new viruses inevitable, and population growth, dense urbaniza- Visitors to the Temple of Heaven, Beijing, during the outbreak in January 2020.Seth Berkley is CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

What is surprising is that, although we are better able to respond to such threats than ever before, we are still not fully prepared. Screening at airports is likely to be of limited use in preventing its further spread, but we now at least have the ability to rapidly identify and genetically sequence new pathogens, to help minimize the time it takes to develop treatments and vaccines. We also have mechanisms in place, such as through the Coalition for Epidemic Pre- paredness and Innovation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to help stimulate the development of vaccines and make them available quickly once we have them. But despite this, our ability to swiftly detect threats in the first place is seriously wanting, and that is worrying. Infectious disease knows no borders, so when it comes to controlling outbreaks, timing is every- thing. The speed with which this outbreak was identified and communicated and the fact that 2019-nCoV has been genetically sequenced are positive steps, and there is more than one vac- cine now already in development. But even though vaccines for coronaviruses are far simpler to develop than those for diseases such as malaria and HIV, it will still be months before the first clinical trials take place and at least a year before a vaccine could possibly be available for use. As context, the Ebola vaccine Ervebo, which is now being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of the fastest vaccines to get regulatory approval, and that took five years. That is why it is so important to detect threats as early as possible, before they spread, and why good disease surveillance is so important. Infectious disease surveillance networks already exist across the globe to do precisely this. They can, however, be highly porous and of vary- ing effectiveness. In some ways we are lucky that 2019-nCoV emerged in China, where there exists a strong public health system. During the West Africa Ebola epidemic, it took three months before the very first case, patient zero, was con- firmed by a laboratory, because that community was outside of an efficient disease surveillance network. Also, new threats are more common than perhaps most people realize. Since 1940 more than 330 emerging infectious diseases have been identified. If deforestation and the unregulated sale of bushmeat continue, then we should expect to see more. Deforestation runs the risk of exposing human- ity to as yet unencountered viruses\u2014often through contact with wild animals such as bats, exotic canine species and monkeys or with vec- tors such as mosquitoes\u2014increasing the risk of outbreaks of both new and existing diseases. Indeed, genetic analysis of 2019-nCoV suggests that it most likely came from a bat. With 2019-nCoV, the third new severe out- break of novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, we still do not have enough information to know how virulent it is\u2014but with a rising death toll, we have to be worried. We also do not know how easily it can be transmitted from human to human, although we now have confirmation that this is occurring. Nor do we know exactly where it originated. It is possible that the first transmission of the virus from animal to human took place at a market in Wuhan where live wild animals were sold. But if other people were infected in rural areas before the infected animal was brought to market, that means that with good surveillance it might have been possible to detect the threat before it reached densely populated areas. There are no guaranteed solutions to ensure that infectious diseases are always detected early, before they reach densely populated areas. But we do have one cost-effective way of widening the net: increased government investment in pri- mary health care, particularly in lower-income countries. Primary health care is typically the first point of contact people have with medical and health services when they get sick and so is ideal for early detection of diseases. But in many parts of the world it is still very limited or even nonexis- tent. Even in middle-income countries, where health care provision can be relatively good, there can exist large clusters of communities that are missing out. When it comes to new emerging Opinion There are no guaranteed solutions to ensure infectious diseases are always detected early, before they reach densely populated areas. 25infectious diseases, people in rural areas, those close to forests and those consuming bushmeat are our biggest concern, because these are essentially our underserved blind spots. National immunization programs can help change that. With 90 percent of the world's chil- dren now receiving at least one routine vaccina- tion, childhood immunization already has a larger reach than any other medical intervention. In addition to this, immunization provides an impetus for other vital health components that not only are essential to vaccination but can help strengthen primary health care. These include supply chains, trained health workers, data systems and, crucially, disease surveillance and in some cases basic laboratory testing. Extending routine immunization systems to that last 10 percent not only will make those communities healthier and save lives but also will put in place the basics of a health care warn- ing system. No matter how we achieve it, primary health care must be strengthened at a global level to reach every community if we are to widen the surveillance and response net and be fully pre- pared for these kinds of outbreaks. Until we have a resilient and universal primary health care sys- tem, we will be leaving some communities out. And when the next emerging infectious disease strikes, that may simply not be enough.

It refers to the patients they will be taking care of. But perhaps it should also refer to themselves. As a psychologist embedded in the depart- ment of pediatrics at a major medical center, I have worked closely with pediatric residents since 1995. In addition to meeting with first-year residents during the first week of orientation, I facilitate a monthly support group where resi- dents have protected time to share concerns in a nonthreatening, confidential environment. These monthly groups have spurred many positive changes, including trying to ensure that rotations with the most demanding sched- ules are now staggered with rotations that have less demanding schedules. Yet many health care professionals do not often discuss a major occupational hazard in medical training: the high suicide rate among medical students, residents and physicians. The rates of death by suicide in the general public in the U.S. are increasing. The National Institute of Mental Health reported in 2017 that suicide was the 10th leading cause of death for males and the 14th for females. It was the sec- ond leading cause of death for young people aged 10 to 34, a common age bracket for medical students and residents. Compared with those among the general popu- lation, however, the rates of death by suicide are much higher in physicians, especially physicians who are women. In the U.S. an estimated 300 to 400 medical students, residents and practicing physicians die by suicide annually . Physician deaths impact not only the families and friends of the doctors who end their lives but also thousands of patients, nurses, support staff and others. In January 2019 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education sent out an e-com- GETTY IMAGESJeannie Aschkenasy is a clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at Rush University Children's Hospital and is a Public Voices fellow through the OpEd Project.Opinion Opinion munication to members wishing everyone a \"joy- ous, happy and healthy New Year.\" The note also included a reminder that the third quarter of the academic year, beginning in January, is the sec- ond highest period of risk for resident and fellow suicide. For 2020, the third quarter for the academic year begins shortly. Recognizing that physicians are at increased risk for burnout and depression, the council introduced new standards and, in their updated Common Program Requirements, defined \"well-being\" of physicians to include that they \"retain the joy in medicine while managing their own real-life stresses.\" The ACGME guide states: \"Residents and fac- are at risk for burnout and depres- sion. Programs, in partnership with their Spon- soring Institutions, have the same responsibility to address well-being as other aspects of resident competence.\" Historically there have been many mixed mes- sages in residency training, noting that it is insuf- ficient to provide a wellness curriculum without including, as I wrote about the problem in 1992, \"the larger working environment ... involving the hospital and/or training programs, and the con- stantly changing health care system.\" Medical schools, residency training programs and hospitals throughout the country are imple- menting \"wellness initiatives\" of varying degrees. And many medically affiliated organizations have programs dedicated to addressing wellness, such as the American Medical Association's Steps For- ward: Preventing Physician Burnout, the Mayo Clinic's Program on Physician Well-Being, Stan- ford's WellMD, and the Pediatric Resident Burn- out-Resilience Study Consortium. Indeed, many of the concerns and challenges of residency\u2014debt, moving to a new location, time management, impostor syndrome\u2014have not changed over the past two decades. Many con- cerns have intensified, however, such as the demands of electronic record keeping, the increased burden of non-MD chores such as insurance pre-authorizations, and the intrusion of 24-7 access. The American Academy of Pediatrics empha- sizes the need to address the social-emotional lives of physicians, as well as the need to help them sustain their work-life balance and avoid burnout. In 2015 six institutions founded the 2016-2019 Pediatric Resident Burnout-Resil- ience Study Consortium. The World Health Organization defines burnout as an \"occupational phenomenon.\" According to the WHO, burnout is a \"syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed\" and refers specifically to the occupational or workplace con- text and not to experiences in other [personal] areas of life.\" Some leading institutions are addressing and recognizing the need to address the issues of burnout and work-life balance at the institutional level. In 2017, moving from the Mayo Clinic to Stanford Medicine, physician Tait Shanafelt became the first chief wellness officer at a U.S. academic medical center. At my own institution, in December 2018, physician Bryant Adibe moved to Rush University Medical Center as its first chief wellness officer. To reduce rates of burnout at Rush University Children's Hospital, a four-week wellness rotation was launched in 2017 for the second year of training. Many were skeptical about this four- week rotation, yet the most salient component of this rotation provides residents with the time to schedule appointments with their own health care providers, in addition to covering their peers, so that they too may schedule health care appoint- ments. Residents are also encouraged to eat healthy meals, exercise, check in with the staff psychologist, catch up on sleep and socialize with friends and family. Prior to the launch of the four-week wellness rotation in 2017, the burnout rate reported by Rush's second-year pediatric and internal medi- cine/pediatric, or med/peds, residents was 80 percent. In 2018 residents reported that rates of burnout fell from 80 percent to 30 percent, and they remained there in 2019. To be sure, a four-week wellness rotation is not the answer to the epidemic of physician burnout, depression and suicide. But it is a start. Burnout is a symptom; it is not the problem. Medical students and physicians need time to engage in self-care activities and seek mental health assistance without jeopardizing their license, reputation and ability to practice medicine. Yes, residents learn that to be ethical doctors, they must first do no harm. They can also learn to first help themselves. 28THE BODY Calling an Illness \"Psychosomatic\" Doesn't Mean It's Imaginary Recent experiments have begun mapping the neuronal connections between mind and body like never before Placebo effects, exercise highs, getting sick when you're stressed out\u2014the popular press and the scientific literature alike are replete with examples of how the mind or mental processes influence our health and well-being. This \"mind-body connection\" is essential for nor- mal organ function and also is viewed as the basis for psychosomatic disorders. Yet the concept that our thoughts can influence the function of a vari- ety of organ systems is often viewed with some skepticism, in part because it has lacked a firm biological basis. That's changing. We are now starting to provide the scientific evidence to reveal the important dynamic between our brains and our bodies. And in the process we are learning how the brains of primates are different from those of other ani- mals\u2014a reality that has important implications for research into the causes and treatment of neurological disorders. The connection between the central nervous system and internal organs is mediated by sym- pathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) subdivisions of the autonomic nervous system. We know a great deal about the neural connections that link autonomic output from centers in the brain stem and spinal cord to specific organs. Yet the neural circuits that link higher brain function and central sites, such as the cerebral cortex, to autonomic output and organ function have not been clearly defined. That's because JUAN GARTNER GETTY IMAGES 29Richard Dum is a research associate professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh.

Our research team has overcome this chal- lenge by using neurotropic viruses, which specifi- cally target neurons, as transneuronal tracers. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences we recently described using a rabies virus tracer to reveal the areas of the cerebral cortex that influence the adrenal medulla of the monkey and rat, as well as rabies transport from the kidney in the rat. In our nonhuman primate studies we injected the rabies tracer into the adrenal medulla, a gland at the top of the kidney, and tracked its path back to brain regions involved in movement, cognition and mood. These cortical areas represent key nodes in a \"stress and depression connectome.\" In the rat, descending influences over the adrenal medulla, as well as the kidney, originate largely from cortical motor areas. In fact, the cortical areas that are the major source of cognitive con- trol in the monkey appear to be absent in the rat. Thus the mind-body connection in primates is more widespread and complex than that in rats. These observations provide a new perspective on the neuroanatomical organization of the corti- cal influences over the sympathetic nervous sys- tem. The power of transneuronal tracing with rabies virus is that it reveals the entire extent of the cortical influence over this system. In this way it identifies the potential origins of the elusive \"central commands\" from the cerebral cortex. This general experimental paradigm is one that can be applied to reveal multisynaptic circuits in a wide variety of networks. For example, rabies tracer injections into limb muscles can reveal the networks involved in the voluntary control of movement; tracer injections into laryngeal mus- cles can reveal the central circuits responsible for vocalization; tracer injections into the heart and stomach can reveal circuits responsible for the central control over the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems; and tracer injections into the spleen can reveal the central neural cir- cuits that influence immune function. The adrenal medulla can be considered as our \"first responder\" in situations requiring fight or flight. Thus one might expect the input to it to be highly conserved across species. Indeed, the cortical motor areas are a major source of input to the adrenal medulla in both the rat and the monkey. But here the similarities end. The primary motor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex and a single secondary motor area account for about 93 percent of the cortical input to the adre- nal medulla in the rat. In contrast, the monkey's adrenal medulla receives input not only from cor- tical motor areas (about 53 percent) but also from cortical areas involved in cognition and affect (about 35 percent). Furthermore, in the monkey the adrenal medulla receives substantial input from motor areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere that don't exist in the rat. Thus the monkey's adrenal medulla is the target of output from a broader set of cortical areas and is influenced by a more diverse set of behaviors. Each network found in the monkey has a human equivalent. Taken together, these observations suggest that nonhu- man primate models are essential for examining the influences of higher-order aspects of move- ment, cognition and mood on sympathetic function. Modern medicine has generally viewed the concept of psychosomatic disease with suspicion. This attitude is partly the result of a lack of infor- mation about the neural networks that connect the \"mind,\" conceptually associated with bral cortex, with autonomic and endocrine organs. As a conse- quence, some definitions of psychosomatic disorders include dismissive descriptions such as \"all in the mind,\" \"irrational\" or \"subconscious.\" Our findings should correct this perspective because they provide a concrete neural substrate for cortical areas involved in movement, cognition and affect to influence a major sympathetic effector, the adrenal medulla. We suggest the adoption of the view reflected in the dialogue at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, where Harry says, \"Tell me one last thing, is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Professor Dumbledore replies, \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" Opinion 30Health & Medici ne Acting Editor in Chief: Curtis Brainard Senior Editor, Collections: Andrea Gawrylewski Chief Features Editor : Seth Fletcher Chief News Editor: Dean Visser Chief Opinion Editor : Michael D.
