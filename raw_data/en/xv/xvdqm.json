Rimadyl is a brand name for the generic veterinary equivalent drug [carprofen](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l9KzB/pubref:akc-org/ar:ea-carprofen-rimadyl-for-dogs/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fcarprofen-generic-caplets-dogs%2Fdp%2F321964). Carprofen belongs to a group of drugs called NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs act to reduce inflammation in dogs with fewer negative side effects than steroids, making them more suitable than steroids for long-term use. Carprofen for dogs is safer for use than human NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or [aspirin](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/aspirin-for-dogs/), which is why it is one of the more commonly prescribed veterinary canine painkillers. This is also why it is never a good idea to treat your dog with medications from your own medicine cabinet, as many [human medications can be poisonous for dogs](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/the-10-human-medications-most-dangerous-to-dogs/).
