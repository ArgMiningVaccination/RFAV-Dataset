The entire contents of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An effective prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine is needed to eradicate the HIV/AIDS pandemic but designing such a vaccine is a challenge. Despite many advances in vaccine technology and approaches to generate both humoral and cellular immune responses, major phase-II and -III vaccine trials against HIV/AIDS have resulted in only moderate successes. The modest achievement of the phase-III RV144 prime-boost trial in Thailand re-emphasized the importance of generating robust humoral and cellular responses against HIV. While antibody-directed approaches are being pursued by some groups, others are attempting to develop vaccines targeting cell-mediated immunity, since evidence show CTLs to be important for the control of HIV replication. Phase-I and -IIa multi-epitope vaccine trials have already been conducted with vaccine immunogens consisting of known CTL epitopes conserved across HIV subtypes, but have so far fallen short of inducing robust and consistent anti-HIV CTL responses. Thus, a need remains in the art for an effective vaccine against HIV. Domestic cats are subject to infection by several retroviruses, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), type C feline syncytia-forming virus (FeSFV). Of these, FeLV is the most significant pathogen, causing diverse symptoms including lymphoreticular and myeloid neoplasms, anemias, immune-mediated disorders, and an immunodeficiency syndrome that is similar to human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Recently, a particular replication-defective FeLV mutant, designated FeLV-AIDS, has been more particularly associated with immunosuppressive properties. The discovery of feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (now designated as feline immunodeficiency virus, FIV) was first reported in Pedersen et al. (1987). Characteristics of FIV have been reported in Yamamoto et al. (1988a); Yamamoto et al. (1988b); and Ackley et al. (1990). Seroepidemiologic data have shown that infection by FIV is indigenous to domestic and wild felines throughout the world. A wide variety of symptoms are associated with infection by FIV, including abortion, alopecia, hallmark of domestic cats infected with FIV is a chronic and progressive depletion of feline CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, a reduction in the CD4:CD8 cell ratio and, in some cases, an increase in CD8-bearing lymphocytes. Cloning and sequence analysis of FIV has been reported in Olmsted et al. (1989a); Olmsted et al. (1989b); and Talbott et al. (1989). Hosie and Jarrett (1990) described the serological response of cats infected with FIV. FIV virus subtypes can be classified according to immunotype based on the level of cross-neutralizing antibodies elicited by each strain (Murphy and Kingsbury, 1990). Recently, viruses have been classified into subtypes according to genotype based on nucleotide sequence homology. Although HIV and FIV is based genotype et al., 1994; Rigby et al., 1993; and Louwagie et al., 1993), little is known about the correlation between the genotype and immunotype of subtypes. FIV viral isolates have been classified into five FIV subtypes: A, B, C, D, and E (Kakinuma et al., 1995; Yamamoto et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2010). Infectious isolates and infectious molecular clones have been described for all FIV subtypes except for subtypes C and E (Sodora et al., 1994). Subtype C FIV has originally been identified from cellular DNA of cats from Canada (Sodora et al., 1994; Rigby et al., 1993; Kakinuma et al., 1995). Examples of FIV strains identified in the art include (subtype of the strain is shown in parenthesis) Petaluma (A), Dixon (A), UK8 (A), Dutch113 (A), Dutch19K UK2 (B), CABCpbar03C (C), CABCpbar07C (C), (D), Fukuoka (D), LP3 (E), LP20 (E), and LP24 (E). The commercial release of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is not imminent even after completion of four major phase IIB-III vaccine trials against HIV/AIDS (Saunders et al. (2012)). Our limited understanding about the mechanisms of vaccine protection (Plotkin (2008)) and the identity of the protective viral epitopes (Mothe et al. (2011); Koff (2010)) further hampers the development of an effective vaccine. Initial studies focused on antibody-based vaccine designs with an emphasis on generating broadly virus neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) (Stamatatos (2012)). However, two phase-III vaccine trials using envelope (Env) immunogens failed (Flynn et al. (2005); Pitisuttithum et al. (2006)). Subsequent focus was placed on the T-cell-based vaccines that generate protective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against global HIV-1 isolates (Buchbinder et al. (2008)). The CMI responses, essential for an effective vaccine, most likely include cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activities that specifically target HIV-1 infected cells (Ogg et al. (1998); Walker et al. (1988); Belyakov et al. (2012)). Unlike NAb epitopes which reside exclusively on the Env proteins, the selection of specific vaccine epitopes for the development of T-cell-based vaccines is more difficult to achieve. A vast number of CTL-associated epitopes can be found to span the whole length of most HIV proteins (Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database, hiv-web.lanl.gov/content/immunology/maps/maps.html) (Llano et al. (2009)). The goal to develop T-cell-based vaccines is challenged by the capacity of the virus to evade antiviral immunity through mutation(s) for resistance (Li et al. (2011); Leslie et al. (2004)). A recent phase III trial consisting of priming with a gag-pr-gp41-gp120 canarypox vectored vaccine and boosting with Env gp120 induced both humoral immunity and CMI and conferred a modest overall efficacy (Rerks-Ngarm et al. (2009)). However, phase I and II vaccine trials consisting of cross-subtype conserved CTL-associated peptide epitopes (2012a); Hanke et al. (2007); Salmon-Ceron et al. (2010)). Therefore, a thorough selection of potent anti-HIV T cell-associated epitopes, which are conserved among HIV-1 subtypes and do not mutate without negatively affecting viral fitness (Troyer et al. (2009); Goulder et al. (2008); Rolland et al. (2007)), would be valuable for an effective HIV-1 vaccine. One approach is to select conserved, non-mutable CTL epitopes on essential viral structural proteins or enzymes that also persist on the older subgenuses of the lentivirinae which have survived evolutionary pressure (Yamamoto et al. (2010)). Such an approach was successfully used in the development of the initial smallpox vaccines (Jenner (1798)). In line with this strategy, the recognition of conserved epitopes on other lentivirus species has been made by the PBMC from HIV-1 positive (HIV+) humans (Balla-Jhagjhoorsingh et al. (1999)), HIV-2 vaccinated and SIV-challenged non-human primates (Walther-Jallow et al. (2001)), and HIV-1 p24-vaccinated and FIV-challenged cats (Abbott et al. (2011); Coleman et al. (2005)). The viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT), is one of the most conserved viral proteins by possessing the lowest entropy value among the HIV-1 proteins from various subtypes (Yusim et al. (2002)) and contains many CTL-associated epitopes (Walker et al. (1988)). The RT proteins of HIV-1 and FIV also share the highest degree of identity in their amino acid (aa) sequences (Yamamoto et al. (2010)). The current studies were undertaken to identify the conserved CTL-associated epitopes on FIV and HIV-1 RT proteins. The major objective of such studies is to identify evolutionarily-conserved CMI epitopes that may be more resistant to mutation, and thus useful in the development of an effective, T-cell-based HIV-1 vaccine.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention concerns methods and materials for inducing an immune response in an animal or person against an immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV, SIV, or FIV.

Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Patent and Trademark Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. Seven peptides were used to develop seven multiple antigenic peptide Fp14-4), and FRT7-2) contained at least MAP2 the peptide in by having additional \"L (leucine in red)\". The peptide sequence of MAP2v is the actual viral sequence. The FIV peptides derived from p24 and reverse transcriptase were first described in Roff et al. (2015) and Sanou et al. (2013), respectively. The majority of the MAPs and their corresponding peptide(s) in Groups 1 and 2 induced high CD8+ T-cell proliferation after 3\u00d7MAP vaccinations. However, those MAPs with only 2\u00d7 vaccinations generally induced low responses except for the reasonably high CD8+ T-cell proliferation induced by MAP5 and its peptide induced less IFN and IL2 productions than MAP2 and maybe a better vaccine immunogen. Results from our previous conventional FIV vaccine trials performed under corporate contracts showed a correlation of high IFN responses with no protection (Pu and Yamamoto, personal communique). Note that cat OLM from Group 1 (fifth red bar for each stimulant) induced the most IFN and IL2 productions to MAPs and their peptide(s), and it was one of the first two cats to be FIV infected along with the 4 of 6 non-vaccinated control cats. When the individual cats in Group 1 were evaluated for % CD8+ T-cell CFSElow over % highest CD8/CD4 response ratio of 111.75 followed by FRT7-1/FRT7-2 (ratio of 11), FRT3-3/FRT3-4 (ratio of 9), and Fp14-3/Fp14-4 (ratio of 4.8). Moreover, Fp9-3 and FRT7-1/7-2 induced no response, most IFN production. The high CD8/CD4 T-cell response ratio may CD8+ induction of CD4+ T-cell activation. Activated CD4+ T cells have higher levels of activation marker CD134 which is the cellular receptor for FIV (Weinberg, 2002; Shimojima et al., 2004). Activated CD4+ T cells will allow proviral integration which is required for lentiviral replication (Yamamoto, 2008; Levy, 2007). Furthermore, IFN can enhance in vitro and in vivo FIV or AIDS virus replication (Tanabe and Yamamoto, 2001; Yamamoto et al., 1986; Yamamoto, 2009). Thus, an proliferation, and minimal IFN production will be an ideal vaccine peptide. Based on these data shown and described here, MAP4 with peptide Fp9-3 is the best vaccine immunogen and 39-101 epitopes contemplated within the scope of the invention. SEQ ID NO:38 is an example of a linker sequence that can be used to link peptides of the present invention (RVKR).DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject invention concerns methods and materials for providing an immune response in an animal or person against an immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV, SIV, or FIV.

The subject invention also concerns polynucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence of epitopes of the invention. The subject invention also concerns vaccines and immunogenic compositions comprising one or more antigens and/or immunogens that comprise or encode evolutionarily conserved epitopes of the present invention. The vaccine or immunogenic compositions of the subject invention also encompass recombinant viral vector-based or polynucleotide constructs that may comprise a nucleic acid encoding a peptide or protein comprising an evolutionarily conserved epitope of the present invention or encoding a chimeric polypeptide of the present invention. Examples of epitopes contemplated within the scope of the invention include peptides or proteins comprising the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 37 or SEQ ID NO:39 to 101, independently or any possible combination thereof, or an amino acid sequence shown in any of the examples, figures or tables of the subject application, or an immunogenic fragment or variant of the amino acid sequence.

In another embodiment, a peptide or protein of the invention can comprise two or more amino acid sequences of any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 37 or SEQ ID NOs:39 to 101, or an immunogenic fragment or variant thereof. Any suitable viral vector that can be used to prepare a recombinant vector/virus construct is contemplated for use with the subject invention. For example, viral vectors derived from adenovirus, avipox, herpesvirus, vaccinia, canarypox, entomopox, swinepox, West Nile virus and others known in the art can be used with the compositions and methods of the present invention. Recombinant polynucleotide vectors that encode and express components can be constructed using standard genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In addition, the various vaccine compositions described herein can be used separately and in combination with each other. For example, primary immunizations of an animal may use recombinant vector-based constructs, having single or multiple strain components, followed by secondary boosts with vaccine compositions comprising inactivated virus or inactivated virus-infected cell lines. Other immunization protocols with the vaccine compositions of the invention are apparent to persons skilled in the art and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. The subject invention also concerns compositions comprising epitopes and/or chimeric polypeptides of the invention, or polynucleotides encoding them. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises a pharmaceutically or biologically acceptable carrier, diluent, and/or adjuvant. The subject invention also concerns expression constructs comprising one or more polynucleotides of the invention. Expression constructs of the invention will also generally include regulatory elements that are functional in the intended host cell in which the expression construct is to be expressed. Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art can select regulatory elements for use in, for example, bacterial host cells, yeast host cells, plant host cells, insect host cells, mammalian host cells, and human host cells. Regulatory elements include promoters, transcription termination sequences, translation termination sequences, enhancers, and polyadenylation elements. As used herein, the term \"expression construct\" refers to a combination of nucleic acid sequences that provides for transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid sequence. As used herein, the term \"operably linked\" refers to a juxtaposition of the components described wherein the components are in a relationship that permits them to function in their intended manner. In general, operably linked components are in contiguous relation. An expression construct of the invention can comprise a promoter sequence operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding a peptide of the invention. Promoters can be incorporated into a polynucleotide using standard techniques known in the art. Multiple copies of promoters or multiple promoters can be used in an expression construct of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, a promoter can be positioned about the same distance from the transcription start site as it is from the transcription start site in its natural genetic environment. Some variation in this distance is permitted without substantial decrease in promoter activity. A transcription start site is typically included in the expression construct. For expression in animal cells, an expression construct of the invention can comprise suitable promoters that can drive transcription of the polynucleotide sequence. If the cells are mammalian cells, then promoters such as, for example, actin promoter, metallothionein promoter, NF-kappaB promoter, EGR promoter, SRE promoter, IL-2 promoter, NFAT promoter, osteocalcin promoter, SV40 early promoter and Lck promoter, BMP5 promoter, TRP-1 promoter, murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter, STAT promoter, or an immunoglobulin promoter can be used in the expression construct. Expression constructs of the invention may optionally contain a transcription termination sequence, a translation termination sequence, signal peptide sequence, and/or enhancer elements. Transcription termination regions can typically be obtained from the 3 untranslated region of a eukaryotic or viral gene sequence. Transcription termination sequences can be positioned downstream of a coding sequence to provide for efficient termination. Signal peptides are a group of short amino terminal sequences that encode information responsible for the relocation of an operably linked peptide to a wide range of post-translational cellular destinations, ranging from a specific organelle compartment to sites of protein action and the extracellular environment. Targeting a peptide to an intended cellular and/or extracellular destination through the use of operably linked signal peptide sequence is contemplated for use with the immunogens of the invention. Chemical enhancers are cis-acting elements that increase gene transcription and can also be included in the expression construct. Chemical enhancer elements are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter enhancer element and the SV40 enhancer element. DNA sequences which direct polyadenylation of the mRNA encoded by the structural gene can also be included in the expression construct. Unique restriction enzyme sites can be included at the 5 and 3 ends of the expression construct to allow for insertion into a polynucleotide vector. As used herein, the term \"vector\" refers to any genetic element, including for example, plasmids, cosmids, chromosomes, phage, virus, and the like, which is capable of replication when associated with proper control elements and which can transfer polynucleotide sequences between cells. Vectors contain a nucleotide sequence that permits the vector to replicate in a selected host cell. A number of vectors are available for expression and/or cloning, and include, but are not limited to, pBR322, pUC series, M13 series, and pBLUESCRIPT vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Polynucleotides, vectors, and expression constructs of the invention can be introduced in vivo via lipofection (DNA transfection via liposomes prepared from 1987). Synthetic cationic lipids (LIPOFECTIN, Invitrogen Corp., La Jolla, Calif.) can be used to prepare liposomes to encapsulate a polynucleotide, vector, or expression construct of the invention. A polynucleotide, vector, or expression construct of the invention can also be introduced as naked DNA using methods known in the art, such as transfection, microinjection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, and by biolistic methods. The subject invention also concerns methods for enhancing infection and/or activating latent infection of an immunodeficiency virus, such as FIV, SIV, or HIV, in a person or animal, or in cells obtained from a person or animal. In one embodiment, the person or animal has a latent infection of HIV or FIV. In another embodiment, the method comprises infecting or exposing the animal to the virus. In one embodiment, one or more peptides, or a composition or a MAP construct comprising the one or more peptides, of the invention that enhances viral infection is administered to the person or animal. In a specific embodiment, a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:28, 30, or 36 is administered to a feline animal that is infected with, or will subsequently be infected with FIV. As used herein, the terms \"nucleic acid\" and \"polynucleotide sequence\" refer to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer in either single- or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise limited, would encompass known analogs of natural nucleotides that can function in a similar manner as naturally-occurring nucleotides. The polynucleotide sequences include both the DNA strand sequence that is transcribed into RNA and the RNA sequence that is translated into protein. The polynucleotide sequences include both full-length sequences as well as shorter sequences derived from the full-length sequences. It is understood that a particular polynucleotide sequence includes the degenerate codons of the native sequence or sequences which may be introduced to provide codon preference in a specific host cell. The polynucleotide sequences falling within the scope of the subject invention further include sequences which specifically hybridize with the exemplified sequences. The polynucleotide includes both the sense and antisense strands as either individual strands or in the duplex. The methods of the present invention contemplate a primary immunization with an antigen, immunogen, peptide, polypeptide, polynucleotide, vaccine, and/or composition of the invention. Subsequent or secondary immunizations are also contemplated within the scope of the subject methods. The antigen, immunogen, peptide, polypeptide, polynucleotide, vaccine, and/or composition used for secondary immunizations can be the same as or vary from that used for primary immunization. For example, primary immunizations of an animal may use recombinant vector-based HIV, FIV, or SIV constructs, having single or multiple strain components, followed by secondary boosts with compositions comprising HIV-, FIV-, or SIV-infected cell lines, or HIV, FIV, or SIV polypeptides, or cell free HIV or SIV virus, also having single or multiple strain components. Primary immunizations can also use an HIV, FIV, and/or SIV DNA vaccine. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector construct is used for the primary immunization, whereas a protein, or protein plus recombinant vector construct, subunit vaccine composition is used for secondary boosts. Other immunization protocols with the vaccine compositions of the invention are apparent to persons skilled in the art and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. The subject invention also concerns antibodies, or an antigen binding fragment thereof, that bind to epitopes of the invention. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention binds specifically to an HIV protein, e.g., an HIV MA protein. In another embodiment, an antibody of the invention binds specifically to an FIV protein, e.g., an FIV MA protein. In a further embodiment, an antibody of the invention binds specifically to both an HIV and an FIV protein, i.e., the antibody cross-reacts with an epitope that is present on both an HIV and an FIV protein, such as a MA protein. The subject invention also concerns the epitopes recognized by an antibody of the invention. The antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal in form. The antibodies can be derived from any animal capable of producing antibodies to the epitopes, and include, for example, human, ape, monkey, mouse, rat, goat, sheep, pig, cow, and feline animals. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention are non-human antibodies that have been \"humanized\" using standard procedures known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,762; 6,180,370; and 6,407,213. An antibody that is contemplated for use in the present invention can be in any of a variety of forms, including a whole immunoglobulin, an antibody fragment such as Fv, Fab, and similar fragments, as well as a single chain antibody that includes the variable domain complementarity determining regions (CDR), and similar forms, all of which fall under the broad term \"antibody,\" as used herein. The term \"antibody fragment\" refers to a portion of a full-length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab, F(ab)2 and Fv fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called the Fab fragment, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, so-called for its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields an F(ab)2 fragment that has two antigen binding fragments, which are capable of cross-linking antigen, and a residual other fragment (which is termed pFc). Additional fragments can include diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. As used herein, \"antigen binding fragment\" with respect to antibodies, refers to, for example, Fv, F(ab) and F(ab)2 fragments. Antibody fragments can retain an ability to selectively bind with the antigen or analyte are contemplated within the scope of the invention and include: (1) Fab is the fragment of an antibody that contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule. A Fab fragment can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain. (2) Fab is the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain. Two Fab fragments are obtained per antibody molecule. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. (3) (Fab)2 is the fragment of an antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction. F(ab)2 is a dimer of two Fab fragments held together by two disulfide bonds. (4) Fv is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in a tight, non-covalent association (VH-VL dimer). It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. (5) Single chain antibody (\"SCA\"), defined as a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain (VL), the variable region of the heavy chain (VH), linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule. Such single chain antibodies are also referred to as \"single-chain Fv\" or \"sFv\" antibody fragments. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains that enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv fragments, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, N.Y., pp. 269 315 (1994). Antibodies within the scope of the invention can be of any isotype, including IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD, and IgM. IgG isotype antibodies can further subdivided into IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subtypes. IgA antibodies can be further subdivided into IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes. Antibodies to be used in the subject invention can be genus or species specific to a target cell. Antibodies of the invention can be prepared using standard techniques known in the art. Antibodies useful in the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using standard methods known in the art (Kohler et al., 1975). The subject invention also concerns hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. Peptide and/or polypeptide antigens and immunogens of the present invention can also be provided in the form of a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) construct, with or without lypophylic attachment to each peptide string. The preparation of MAP constructs has been described in Tam (1988) and Kowalczyk et al. (2010). MAP constructs utilize a core matrix of lysine residues onto which multiple copies of an immunogen (e.g., a peptide) are synthesized (Posnett et al., 1988). In one embodiment, MAP constructs of the invention can comprise one or more fatty acids attached to the core matrix. The fatty acid can comprise from about 4 to about 48 or more carbon atoms, and can be saturated and/or unsaturated. In a specific embodiment, the fatty acid is palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid). Multiple MAP constructs, each containing the same or different immunogens, can be prepared and administered in a vaccine composition in accordance with methods of the present invention. In one embodiment, the same or different peptides are linked end to end. The same or different peptides can be linked directly to each other (i.e., without a linker sequence) or they can be linked via a linker moiety such as a short amino acid sequence (e.g., a furin-sensitive linker), examples of which include, but are not limited to, peptides comprising SEQ ID NO:38. In one embodiment, a MAP construct is provided with and/or administered with one or more adjuvants. In one embodiment, a MAP of the invention comprises one or more peptides that comprise the amino acid sequences of one or more of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 37 or SEQ ID NOs:39 to 101, or an immunogenic fragment or variant thereof. Natural, recombinant or synthetic peptides and polypeptides of immunodeficiency viral proteins, and peptide fragments thereof, can also be used as vaccine compositions according to the subject methods. Procedures for preparing peptides and polypeptides are well known in the art. For example, peptides and polypeptides can be synthesized using solid-phase synthesis methods (Merrifield, 1963). Peptides and polypeptides can also be produced using recombinant DNA techniques wherein a polynucleotide molecule encoding a protein or peptide is expressed in a host cell, such as bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cell lines, and the expressed protein or peptide purified using standard techniques of the art. According to the methods of the subject invention, the antigenic, immunogenic, and vaccine compositions described herein can be administered to susceptible hosts in an effective amount and manner to induce an immune response and/or protective immunity against subsequent challenge or infection of the host by FIV, SIV, or HIV. The immunogens are typically administered parenterally, by injection, for example, either subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally, or intramuscularly, or by oral or nasal administration, or any combination of such routes of administration. Usually, the immunogens are administered to a host animal at least two times, with an interval of one or more weeks between each administration. However, other regimens for the initial and booster administrations of the immunogens are contemplated, and may depend on the judgment of the practitioner and the particular host animal being treated. Antigens, immunogens, and vaccines that can be used in accordance with the present invention can be provided with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or diluent. Compounds and compositions useful in the subject invention can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations are described in detail in a number of sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. For example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science by E.W. Martin, Easton Pa., Mack Publishing Company, 19th ed., 1995, describes formulations which can be used in connection with the subject invention. In general, the compositions of the subject invention will be formulated such that an effective amount of an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine is combined with a suitable carrier in order to facilitate effective administration of the composition. The compositions used in the present methods can also be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, powders, liquid solutions or suspension, suppositories, injectable and infusible solutions, and sprays. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. The compositions also preferably include conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents which are known to those skilled in the art. Examples of carriers or diluents for use with the subject peptidomimetics include, but are not limited to, water, saline, oils including mineral oil, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, gelatin, stearate, dextrose, cellulose, sugars, glycerol, alumina, starch, and equivalent carriers and diluents, or mixtures of any of these. Formulations of an immunogen of the invention can also comprise suspension agents, protectants, lubricants, buffers, preservatives, and stabilizers. To provide for the administration of such dosages for the desired therapeutic treatment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will advantageously comprise between about 0.1% and 45%, and especially, 1 and 15% by weight of the antigen, antigens, immunogen or immunogens based on the weight of the total composition including carrier or diluent. The antigenic, immunogenic, and vaccine compositions of the subject invention can be prepared by procedures well known in the art. For example, the antigens, immunogens, or vaccines are typically prepared as injectables, e.g., liquid solutions or suspensions. The antigens, immunogens, or vaccines are administered in a manner that is compatible with dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective and immunogenic in the recipient. The optimal dosages and administration patterns for a particular antigen, immunogen, or vaccine formulation can be readily determined by a person skilled in the art. Virus and cells in an antigenic, immunogenic, or vaccine formulation may be inactivated or attenuated using methods known in the art. The amount of cell-free whole or partial virus in a dose will usually be in the range from about 0.1 mg to about 5 mg, and more usually being from about 0.2 mg to about 2 mg. The dosage for formulations comprising virus-infected cell lines will usually contain from about 106 to about 108 cells per dose, and more usually from about 5\u00d7106 to about 7.5\u00d7107 cells per dose. The amount of protein or peptide immunogen in a dose for a feline animal can vary from about 0.1 g to 10000 g, or about 1 g to 5000 g, or about 10 g to 1000 g, or about 25 g to 750 g, or about 50 g to 500 g, or 100 g to 250 g, depending upon the size, age, etc., of the animal receiving the dose. In one embodiment, an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine of the invention is provided with one or more adjuvants that increase the person or animal's immune response against the antigen or immunogen. Antigen, immunogens, and vaccines of the invention can be provided with and/or administered with any suitable adjuvant or adjuvants known in the art. In one embodiment, the adjuvant is one that helps induce a strong cellular immune response. Adjuvants that can be used in the antigen and immunogen formulations of the invention include threonyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (Byars et al., 1987), Ribi adjuvant system components (Corixa Corp., Seattle, Wash.) including the cell wall skeleton (CWS) component, Freund's complete, and Freund's incomplete adjuvants, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), such as from E. coli, or a combination thereof. A variety of other adjuvants suitable for use with the methods and vaccines of the subject invention, such as alum, aluminum hydroxide, and saponin are well known in the art and are contemplated for use with the subject invention. Cytokines (-IFN, GM-CSF, CSF, been used as adjuvants and/or supplements to vaccine compositions and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. One or more different cytokines and lymphokines can be included in a composition comprising an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine of the invention. In one embodiment, an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine of the invention is administered to an animal in combination with the lymphokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) optionally in combination with another adjuvant. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention is the use of the lymphokine interleukin-18 (11-18) as part of an adjuvant composition. In one embodiment, an adjuvant composition used with the subject invention comprises a combination of 11-12 and IL-15, or IL-15 and 11-15, and 11-18. The cytokine selected is of a species that has biological activity in the animal receiving the antigen or immunogen. For example, if the animal is a cat, then the cytokine can be a human cytokine or a feline cytokine, e.g., feline IL-12, feline IL-15, feline IL-18, etc. Abbreviations of FIV strains used herein are shown below in Table 1: Antigens, immunogens, and vaccines of the invention are typically administered parenterally, by injection, for example, either subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally, or intramuscularly. Other suitable modes of administration include oral or nasal administration. Usually, the antigens, immunogens, and vaccines are administered to a human or animal at least two times, with an interval of one or more weeks between each administration. However, other regimens for the initial and booster administrations of the antigens, immunogens, and vaccines are contemplated, and may depend on the judgment of the practitioner and the patient being treated. Antigenic, immunogenic, and vaccine compositions of the subject invention can be prepared by procedures well known in the art. For example, the antigens, immunogens, and vaccines are typically prepared as injectables, e.g., liquid solutions or suspensions. The antigens, immunogens, and vaccines are administered in a manner that is compatible with dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective and immunogenic in the recipient. The optimal dosages and administration patterns for a particular antigen, immunogen, and vaccine formulation can be readily determined by a person skilled in the art. Antigens, immunogens, and vaccines that can be used in accordance with the present invention can be provided with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or diluent. In one embodiment, an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine of the invention is provided with one or more adjuvants that increase the human or animal's immune response against the antigen or immunogen. Antigens, immunogens, and vaccines of the invention can be provided with and/or administered with any suitable adjuvant or adjuvants known in the art. The peptides contemplated in the subject invention include the specific peptides exemplified herein as well as equivalent peptides which may be, for example, somewhat longer or shorter than the peptides exemplified herein. For example, using the teachings provided herein, a person skilled in the art could readily make peptides having from 1 to about 15 or more amino acids added to, or 1 to 10 amino acids removed from, either or both ends of the disclosed peptides using standard techniques known in the art. Any added amino acids can be different or the same as the corresponding amino acids of the full-length protein from which the peptide is derived. The skilled artisan, having the benefit of the teachings disclosed in the subject application, could easily determine whether a longer or shorter peptide retained the immunogenic activity of the specific peptides exemplified herein. Substitution of amino acids other than those specifically exemplified or naturally present in a peptide of the invention are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention. For example, non-natural amino acids can be substituted for the amino acids of a peptide, so long as the peptide having the substituted amino acids retains substantially the same immunogenic activity as the peptide in which amino acids have not been substituted. Examples of non-natural amino acids include, but are not as -methyl amino acids, C-methyl amino acids, N-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogues in general. Non-natural amino acids also include amino acids having derivatized side groups. Furthermore, any of the amino acids in the protein can be of the D (dextrorotary) form or L (levorotary) form. Amino acids can be generally categorized in the following classes: non-polar, uncharged polar, basic, and acidic. Conservative substitutions whereby a peptide of the present invention having an amino acid of one class is replaced with another amino acid of the same class fall within the scope of the subject invention so long as the peptide having the substitution still retains substantially the same antigenic or immunogenic activity as the peptide that does not have the substitution. Table 2 below provides a listing of examples of amino acids belonging to each class. Polynucleotides encoding a specifically exemplified peptide or polypeptide of the invention, or a shorter or longer peptide or polypeptide, or a peptide having one or more amino acid substitutions in the sequence are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. The subject invention also concerns variants of the polynucleotides of the present invention that encode a peptide of the invention. Variant sequences include those sequences wherein one or more nucleotides of the sequence have been substituted, deleted, and/or inserted. The nucleotides that can be substituted for natural nucleotides of DNA have a base moiety that can include, but is not limited to, inosine, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, hypoxanthine, 1-methylguanine, moiety of the nucleotide in a sequence can also be modified and includes, but is not limited to, arabinose, xylulose, and hexose. In addition, the and uracil bases of the nucleotides be modified with acetyl, methyl, and/or thio groups. Sequences containing nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be prepared and tested using standard techniques known in the art. Fragments and variants of a peptide or a polypeptide of the present invention can be generated as described herein and tested for the presence of immunogenic activity using standard techniques known in the art. Polynucleotides, peptides, and polypeptides contemplated within the scope of the subject invention can also be defined in terms of more particular identity and/or similarity ranges with those sequences of the invention specifically exemplified herein. The sequence identity will typically be greater than 60%, preferably greater than 75%, more preferably greater than 80%, even more preferably greater than 90%, and can be greater than 95%. The identity and/or similarity of a sequence can be 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% as compared to a sequence exemplified herein. Unless otherwise specified, as used herein percent sequence identity and/or similarity of two sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990), modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. (1990). BLAST searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain sequences with the desired percent sequence identity. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be used as described in Altschul et al. (1997). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (NBLAST and XBLAST) can be used. See Worldwide Website: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Factors affecting the preferred dosage regimen may include, for example, the age, weight, sex, diet, activity, lung size, and condition of the subject; the route of administration; the efficacy, safety, and duration-of-immunity profiles of the particular vaccine used; whether a delivery system is used; and whether the vaccine is administered as part of a drug and/or vaccine combination. Thus, the dosage actually employed can vary for specific animals, and, therefore, can deviate from the typical dosages set forth above. Determining such dosage adjustments is generally within the skill of those in the art using conventional means. It should further be noted that live attenuated viruses are generally self-propagating; thus, the specific amount of such a virus administered is not necessarily critical. It is contemplated that an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine of the invention may be administered to the patient a single time; or, alternatively, two or more times over days, weeks, months, or years. In some embodiments, the vaccine is administered at least two times. In some such embodiments, for example, the vaccine is administered twice, with the second dose (e.g., the booster) being administered at least about 2 weeks after the first. In some embodiments, the vaccine is administered twice, with the second dose being administered no greater than 8 weeks after the first. In some embodiments, the second dose is administered at from about 2 weeks to about 4 years after the first dose, from about 2 to about 8 weeks after the first dose, or from about 3 to about 4 weeks after the first dose. In some embodiments, the second dose is administered about 4 weeks after the first dose. In the above embodiments, the first and subsequent dosages may vary, such as, for example, in amount and/or form. Often, however, the dosages are the same as to amount and form. When only a single dose is administered, the amount of antigen, immunogen, or vaccine in that dose alone generally comprises a therapeutically effective amount of the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine. When, however, more than one dose is administered, the amounts of antigen, immunogen, or vaccine in those doses together may constitute a therapeutically effective amount. In some embodiments, the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine is administered before the recipient is infected with virus. In such embodiments, the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may, for example, be administered to prevent, reduce the risk of, or delay the onset of one or more (typically two or more) clinical symptoms. In some embodiments, the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine is administered after the recipient is infected with virus. In such embodiments, the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may, for example, ameliorate, suppress, or eradicate the virus or one or more (typically two or more) clinical symptoms. It is contemplated that the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may be administered via the patient's drinking water and/or food. It is further contemplated that the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may be administered in the form of a treat or toy. \"Parenteral administration\" includes subcutaneous injections, submucosal injections, intravenous intrasternal injections, injections, infusion. Injectable preparations (e.g., sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions) can be formulated according to the known art using suitable excipients, such as vehicles, solvents, dispersing, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and/or suspending agents. These typically include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, oil, benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 1,3-butanediol, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride bland fixed oils (e.g., synthetic mono- diglycerides), acids glycol, and/or polyethylene glycols. Excipients also may include small amounts of other auxiliary substances, such as pH buffering agents. The antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may include one or more excipients that enhance a patient's immune response (which may include an antibody response, cellular response, or both), thereby increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Use of such excipients (or \"adjuvants\") may be particularly beneficial when using an inactivated vaccine. The adjuvant(s) may be a substance that has a direct (e.g., cytokine or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (\"BCG\")) or indirect effect (liposomes) on cells of the patient's immune system. Examples of often suitable adjuvants include oils (e.g., mineral oils), metallic salts (e.g., aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate), bacterial components (e.g., bacterial liposaccharides, Freund's adjuvants, and/or MDP), plant components (e.g., Quil A), and/or one or more substances that have a carrier effect (e.g., bentonite, latex particles, liposomes, and/or Quil A, ISCOM). It should be recognized that this invention encompasses antigens, immunogens, and vaccines that comprise an adjuvant(s), as well as antigens, immunogens, and vaccines that do not comprise any adjuvant. It is contemplated that the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine may be freeze-dried (or otherwise reduced in liquid volume) for storage, and then reconstituted in a liquid before or at the time of administration. Such reconstitution may be achieved using, for example, vaccine-grade water. The present invention further comprises kits that are suitable for use in performing the methods described above. The kit comprises a dosage form comprising an antigen, immunogen, or vaccine described above. The kit also comprises at least one additional component, and, typically, instructions for using the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine with the additional component(s). The additional component(s) may, for example, be one or more additional ingredients (such as, for example, one or more of the excipients discussed above, food, and/or a treat) that can be mixed with the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine before or during administration. The additional component(s) may alternatively (or additionally) comprise one or more apparatuses for administering the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine to the patient. Such an apparatus may be, for example, a syringe, inhaler, nebulizer, pipette, forceps, or any medically acceptable delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the apparatus is suitable for subcutaneous administration of the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine. In some embodiments, the apparatus is suitable for intranasal administration of the antigen, immunogen, or vaccine. Other excipients and modes of administration known in the pharmaceutical or biologics arts also may be used. The subject invention also concerns methods for determining whether an animal, such as a feline animal, has been vaccinated against FIV with an FIV vaccine of the present invention, or is infected by FIV or has been infected by FIV. In one embodiment, a biological sample, such as a blood or serum sample, is obtained from a feline animal, and the sample is assayed to determine whether the animal has antibodies that bind specifically to HIV antigens. Epitopes of an HIV protein that are only recognized by HIV antibodies and that are not recognized by FIV antibodies can be used in the subject invention. All patents, patent applications, provisional applications, and publications referred to or cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety, including all figures and tables, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the explicit teachings of this specification. Following are examples that illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.Example 1\u2014Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy of Multiple Antigenic Peptides Against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Although recent developments in vaccine prophylaxis against HIV/AIDS have advanced our knowledge of protective immunity [1-3], the introduction of a safe and effective vaccine for worldwide distribution is not imminent. Research in vaccine development has been prolific, however only three candidates to date have reached large scale Phase III clinical trials (IAVI Clinical Trial Database; see Worldwide Website: iavireport.org/Trials-Database/Pages/default.aspx, accessed 29 Feb. 2015). The most successful Phase-III trial, RV144, reduced the risk of HIV infection by 31.2% overall with minimal protection of 3.7% in the high-risk group [4]. The vaccinated subjects who were negative for HIV had higher levels of IgG antibodies to HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) region at the V1V2 loop but not IgA antibodies to Env or to the V2 region of the envelope were also detected in the vaccinees [6]. The continuously evolving viral antigens and the overwhelming antigenic variation in the HIV Env may require vaccine approach that would activate both humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses [4-10] as well as a novel method to selectively target antigenic regions of the virus. These regions must be conserved between viral subtypes, more resistant to mutations, and induce potent antiviral immunity. Functional studies have confirmed the presence of conserved lentiviral CD8+ CTL and CD4+ T helper (TH) cell within feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) [11] and core protein p24 [12]. These epitopes are recognized by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T cells from HIV-1 positive (HIV+) human subjects (RT and p24) and FIV-vaccinated cats (p24). Rather than focusing only on HIV subtypes, these promising results support a strategic paradigm for the discovery of functionally crucial epitopes that are present within lentiviruses of different species which can induce potent and persistent antiviral immune responses. The importance of inducing T-cell immunity in a lentiviral vaccine is demonstrated by the development of the commercially available dual-subtype FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax\u00ae FIV) that was released in 2002 [13]. Similar to HIV, FIV is a lentivirus that infects CD4+ T cells and causes immunodeficiency disease in its natural host [13,14]. As a result, FIV infection and disease progression in domestic cats, the natural host, is an important animal model for the development of a HIV vaccine [14]. Both commercial and prototype FIV vaccines confer protection against homologous and closely-related strains (tier-1 and some tier-2) by (NAb) and anti-FIV T-cell immunity [13,15]. However, the prototype vaccine confers greater protection against heterologous tier-2 and tier-3 viruses correlating to greater anti-FIV T-cell immunity than the commercial vaccine [13,15]. The broad efficacy of the anti-FIV T-cell immunity observed with prototype vaccine [13,15,16] and the correlation of CD4+ T-cell activity to Env V2 peptides to HIV protected individuals from the HIV vaccine RV144 trial [5] further underscores the importance of developing T cell-based HIV and FIV vaccines [6,13]. Developing modalities capable of targeting specific regions of viruses is becoming increasingly important in lentiviral vaccinology [17-20]. Synthetic oligomeric peptides presented in branched chain configuration as dendrimers or multiple antigenic peptides (MAP) have been used to selectively and effectively target epitopes for cancer [21,22], infectious disease [23,24], autoimmune disease [25,26], and have more recently been utilized to refine NAb-based HIV and SIV vaccines [27,28]. In order to develop a T cell-based vaccine, MAPs targeting previously identified antigenic regions of p24 [12] and RT [11] were evaluated in specific pathogen free (SPF) cats primed once with prototype FIV vaccine and boosted four to six times with lentiviral MAPs. The immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of MAP-based FIV vaccines were evaluated using the FIV-cat model. Materials and Methods Animals. 15 SPF cats were bred by the Laboratory of Comparative Immunology & Retrovirology in collaboration with Animal Care Services at the University of Florida. Age-matched cats of both sexes were distributed into four groups (Table 5). The animal work was performed according to the policy and protocols approved by IACUC. Prime-Boost Vaccines. A prototype dual-subtype FIV was administered one time as a priming dose. The prototype vaccine, modeled after the commercial dual-subtype FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax\u00ae FIV) [13], consists of 300 inactivated virus (IWV) FIV-Petaluma and IWV FIV-Shizuoka (600 g IWV total) formulated in 1.20 mL of FD-1 (oil-in-water) adjuvant with 4 g of recombinant feline IL12 (rFeIL12) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). MAPs were produced by LifeTein LLC (Hillsborough, N.J.). MAPs were formulated on a lysine backbone with four identical branches of either FIV p24 (Fp) or RT (FRT) peptide(s) on the first backbone on the amino-end and contain palmitic acid (CH3(CH2)14COOH) third lysine on the carboxyl-end ( Immunization and Challenge. Eight SPF cats were primed 1\u00d7 with prototype dual-subtype FIV vaccine (IWV) [13] and MAP1b (peptide Fp14-1), and/or MAP2 (peptides FRT3-3/FRT3-4) 5). Immunizations consisted of 1\u00d7 priming using subcutaneous (SC, 500 g g IWV) routes followed 4-6 wk later with 4\u00d7-6\u00d7 boosts using MAPs (150 g per MAP SC plus 50 g per MAP ID) at 3-12 wk intervals. SC immunization volume consisted of 1 mL (500 g) of IWV for priming and 0.75 mL MAP (150 g single MAP or 300 g MAP1+2) for boosting, with ID immunization consisting of 0.1 mL/site (50 g/site IWV) or 0.125 mL/site (25 g/site single MAP or 50 g MAP1+2) immunized at two sites. Cats were challenged intravenously at 6 wk post last boost with 15\u00d750% cat infectious dose (15 CID50) of in vivo-derived subtype-B pathogenic FIVFC1 [13]. Three IWV-primed cats (Group 3) and four PBS-immunized cats (Group 4) were used as controls (Table 5). IFN and IL2 ELISpot Analyses. IFN and IL2 ELISpot feline IFN and IL2 ELISpot kits (R&D Systems, Cat# SEL764 and SEL1890) as described [31]. The threshold is defined as 50 spot forming units (SFU) per 1\u00d7106 PBMC when counted with MVS ELISpot Reader (MVS Pacific, LLC). Each result is an average of the duplicate samples after subtraction of the average value of the media controls. T-Cell and CD4/CD8 Phenotype Analyses. Carboxyfluorescein to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, N.Y.) and processed using a previously described modification [11,12]. The modification consisted of 2.5\u00d7105 CFSE-labeled feline PBMC stimulated for 5 days (37\u00b0 C., CO2) with 4 g/mL peptide (FBS)). consisted of 3-5 overlapping peptides of 4 g/mL each. The antibodies used for flow cytometry based proliferation analysis consisted of murine anti-feline (Fe) CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb Yorihiro Nishimura and Takayuki Miyazawa; described in [32]) described in [33]) with secondary goat anti-mouse IgG2a-PE/CY7 (Southern Biotech, Cat#1080-17). The anti-B220-APC MAb for feline B cells (SouthernBiotech, Cat#1665-11) and previously described MAbs for CFSE FACS phenotyping. Both BD LSRII and FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). The final value for each sample was derived after subtraction of the average value of the media controls using a positive threshold of 1 CFSElow. Monitoring of FIV Infection and Anti-FIV Antibodies. FIV infection was determined by virus isolation from PBMC collected during the study and at study termination. Bone marrow (BM) and lymph nodes (LN) were collected at the termination of the study. BM aspiration and LN biopsy were collected for the protected cat (SBA) for continuous monitoring. FIV infection was detected by RT assay of the culture fluid harvested 2\u00d7 per wk for 4 wk as well as BM and LN) virus load was monitored from 14 weeks post-challenge (wpc) to 47 wpc and was determined from 2-4 time-points. Virus load assay consisted of 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 PBMC from each challenged cat co-cultured in quadruplicate with 2.5\u00d7105 feeder PBMC from an uninfected SPF cat for 2 wk in 1 mL total of culture media (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2). The PBMC were resuspended in fresh culture media every 3-4 days over 2 wk and the collected fluid evaluated for FIV titer by RT assay. Four cats (OCA, OCF, 5HS, DVC) were terminated at 9-14 wpc to evaluate their tissues for pathogenic FIVFC1-induced pathology during early infection and at a time point too early to determine viral set point. To avoid detection of vaccine antibodies to p24 and RT, post-challenge sera were evaluated for infection-induced FIV antibodies by ELISA ng/well (TM, aa 694-705: QELGCNQNQFFC (SEQ ID as previously described [36,37]. The positive threshold for anti-TM antibodies was set at 0.2 O.D. The post-vaccination sera immediately before challenge were evaluated for NAb titer to FIVPet and FIVFC1 by NAb assay as previously described [13]. The post-vaccination/pre-challenge sera were tested for antibodies to vaccine peptides by ELISA using each peptide as substrate and by FIV immunoblot with mini-blot modification as previously described [36]. All ELISA thresholds were set at twice the average of the individual serum from 15-20 SPF cats. Cytokine and Cytoxin mRNAs of Cat SBA. The PBMC from cat SBA at 61 wpc or 14 wk after post-challenge MAP1/MAP2 boost, and 7-8 hours (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2) in the presence of each individual peptide or MAP before harvesting for RT-PCR. Tested peptides and MAPs consisted of: peptide/MAP combination 1 (P1: 5 g/mL each 5% FBS and (GrzA), GrzB RT-PCR as previously described [16]. The sequences of the primer set for the feline cytokines and cytotoxins are shown in Table 6 with respective accession number(s) of the complete or partial sequence from which they were derived. Multiple accession numbers represent 100% conservation observed at the primer pair sequences and in the size of the amplified product. The amplified sequences were sequenced by Eruofins MWG Operon LLC (Louiville, Ky.) and determined to be the correct sequence for the corresponding cytokine or cytotoxin. FIV Enhancement and Suppression Analysis. FIV viral enhancement or suppression was determined using a 48-well modification of the method described for detecting FIV enhancing activity of IFN and PBMC an uninfected of MAP1, MAP2, FRT3-4, or negative control peptide Hp15-1 in a final volume of 1 mL/well. MAP1c four branched chains of concanavalin A (ConA) at 4 g/mL was used as an infection enhancing control. Six hours after the culturing with peptide, MAP, or ConA, varying dilutions of FIVFC1 were added to the wells. Seventy-two hours later the cells were re-cultured in fresh culture media with ConA-stimulated autologous PBMC (0.25-0.5\u00d7106) using the same amount of corresponding peptide, MAP, ConA or media. On Day 7, 10, and 13 of culture, 0.5 mL of culture fluid was collected and 0.5 mL of fresh media added to maintain a consistent volume. The harvested culture samples were analyzed for FIV titer using the previously described RT assay [13,34]. The results are shown as the end-point dilution titer from two studies using PBMC from different SPF donors. Statistical analysis. The statistically significant differences between the end-point dilution titers of the peptide or MAP culture samples and either the virus control samples or specific MAP culture samples were calculated using a paired Student t-test with a two-tailed distribution (SigmaPlot version 11.0). Statistical comparisons between pre and post-vaccination(s) were similarly performed. The comparison was considered statistically significant when p<0.05. Results Humoral Immunogenicity of MAP Boosts. Three weeks post IWV priming, antibody responses were detected against p24 but not RT ( CMI and T-Cell Immunogenicity of MAP Boosts. Strong T-cell proliferation ( Between peptides Fp4-3 and Fp14-1, the highest magnitude and frequency of responses to peptide Fp4-3 were observed with CD4+ T-cell proliferation, whereas the highest magnitude but low frequency (37%) of responses were observed with CD8+ T-cell proliferation to peptide Fp14-1 ( In general, all peptides induced substantial IFN responses at high magnitude and frequency ( Challenge Efficacy of Prime-Boost Immunization. Upon challenge, 1 of 4 cats (SBA) in MAP-vaccinated Group 1 was FIV negative by virus isolation and proviral PCR and was negative for virus specific FIV antibodies (Table 5; Interestingly, post-challenge anti-TM antibodies showed enhanced TM antibody titers at 3 wpc in two Group-3 cats (5HS and OLK) and one Group-2 cat (DVD) ( The 1\u00d7-prime Group 3 showed a slight enhancement in virus isolation, early CD4+ T-cell loss, and high early anti-TM antibody titers in 2 of 3 cats by 3 wpc (Table 5, The Effect of Vaccine Peptides in the Fully Protected Cat. Ideally, the CTL-associated cytotoxin mRNA analysis would have been performed prior to FIV challenge in all cats and although a delay in infection and lower viral load in vaccinated cats were an anticipated outcome, we did not expect any cat to confer complete protection. Consequently, after performing peptide-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine (IFN and IL2) production analyses, these cats were challenged and evaluated for infection and terminated for tissue. Only one protected cat SBA was not terminated and subsequently monitored over 1 year for infection and post-challenge boost immunity. To test the possibility of Fp4-3 peptide decreasing the protective potential of the other peptides, the fully protected cat was boosted at 47 wpc with MAP1 plus MAP2. At 14 wk to a combination of Fp14-1/FRT3-3/FRT3-4 peptides, MAP1b and MAP2. The Fp4-3 stimulation induced high IFN mRNA levels to Fp4-3 that were comparable to SEA stimulation and low IL2 and GrzA mRNA levels but no detectable levels of Fp4-3-specific perforin or GrzB in the PBMC ( In comparison, stimulation with the Fp14-1/FRT3-3/FRT3-4/MAP1b+2 combination induced high mRNA production of IL2 and CTL-cytotoxins perforin and GrzA but minimal production of IFN and no production of GrzB. Non-vaccinated SPF cats had no production of cytokines or cytotoxins upon stimulation with any peptide/MAP combination. More importantly, GrzB production to SEA stimulation is extremely low in cat SBA compared to those of SPF cats. Thus, current findings suggest that perforin and GrzA but not IFN, predominantly induced by the Fp14-1/FRT3-3/FRT3-4 combination and may have mediated CMI activity against FIV in the only protected cat SBA. In contrast, peptide Fp4-3 induced minimal CTL-associated cytotoxin production but induced mainly IFN which may be more broadly pro-inflammatory. The Direct Effect of Vaccine Peptides in In Vitro FIV Infection. The profile of the response of the protected cat as well as potential enhancement of infection in Group 3 prompted the evaluation of viral enhancing and suppressive effects of p24 and RT peptides on FIV infection. Peptide Fp4-3 and MAP1 significantly enhanced FIV infection but Fp14-1 and MAP1b had no effect ( Due to the minimal protection conferred by groups containing high levels of MAP1, particularly those containing Fp4-3, the stimulatory effect of various combinations of MAP1, MAP2, and MAP1b were evaluated using viral enhancement/suppression assays. Treatment with MAP1 plus MAP2 (MAP1+2) combination resulted in a significantly higher viral infection compared to the untreated control (p<0.001) and with an overall level of virus expressed between that of the individual MAP1 and MAP2 ( The combination of MAP2 plus MAP1b without peptide Fp4-3 had no FIV enhancing activity but also showed no FIV suppressive activity of MAP2. Palmitic acid was attached to all MAPs (Pam-MAPs) to enhance its adjuvant activity by stimulating toll like receptor (TLR) and to enhance the uptake of the MAP by antigen presenting cells [17]. Thus, the loss of suppressive activity may be the outcome of having too much TLR activation caused by the additive effect of palmitic acid on both MAP1b and MAP2 in the 1-mL culture system. The current in vitro observation may explain why 6\u00d7MAP boosts in Group 2 were less effective than 4\u00d7MAP boosts in Group 1. The over stimulation of TLR by palmitic acid may have resulted in more non-specific stimulation which decreased or negated the potential protective efficacy. Future studies will balance Pam-MAP with MAP alone or MAP conjugated to Tat that has only cell penetrating activity [41]. Discussion To date, the best clinical vaccine trial (RV144) against HIV-1 used a prime-boost approach consisting of 2\u00d7 canarypox virus (ALVAC) vectored HIV-1 gag/pr/env immunizations in with recombinant (AIDSVAX) [4]. cell vaccine (ICV) conferred 100% protection against challenge and 100% partial-to-full protection against heterologous challenge [42]. In current study, cats were primed with the prototype IWV and boosted with a combination of MAP vaccine formulations containing three T-cell epitope peptides conserved among lentiviruses in vaccine (IWV) has been reported to induce more T-cell immunity and confer more protection against tier-2 and -3 viruses than the commercial FIV vaccine [13,15,16]. This pilot study was designed to generate and evaluate anti-FIV T-cell immunity using the prime boost model and to evaluate the safety of Pam-MAP and not expected to confer significant protection. However the vaccine designed proved efficacious with the limited peptide repertoire and conferred 75% partial-to-full protection in MAP-vaccine Group 1 (Table 5). The most innovative feature of the current study was the use of selected FIV peptides in the MAP formulations. FIV p24 peptide Fp14-1 MAP1 and RT reported conserved recognized and HIV+ human subjects (FRT3-3, FRT3-4) [11,12] and have significant aa sequence conservation with other AIDS lentiviruses (Table 7). In studies with HIV+ subjects, these peptides and their peptide-pools (Fp14 and FRT3) induced moderate IFN responses and of CTL-like cytotoxins in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as strong CD8+ T-cell proliferation [11,12]. In prototype FIV-vaccinated cats, peptide Fp14-1 and the Fp14 pool induced high magnitude and frequency of proliferation in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but peptides FRT3-3 and FRT3-4 induced only low magnitude and frequency of response (Pu and Yamamoto, pers. comm.). The low frequency of response to FRT3-3 and FRT3-4 was anticipated due to the low amount of FIV RT protein present in the IWV vaccine compared to the p24 protein [43]. In the current study, Map2 immunization with a high concentration of overlapping FRT3-3/FRT3-4 peptides resulted in a high magnitude and frequency of CD8+ T-cell proliferation and IFN production to peptide Fp14-1, MAP1 contained peptide Fp4-3 which may contributed to the lower T-cell responses to Fp14-1 ( Protection due to enhanced immunity against FRT3-3/3-4 and minimal response to Fp4-3 is supported by the post-challenge immunity of cat SBA after a single post-challenge MAP1/MAP2 boost. Fp4-3 stimulation induced high levels of IFN mRNA expression and moderate expression of IL2 and GrzA, whereas the Fp14-1, FRT3-3, and FRT3-4 without a major production of CTL-associated cytotoxins. It has been reported that IFN response alone without cytotoxin production does not generate strong CTL activity against HIV-1 [45,46]. More importantly, IFN has been reported to be a key inflammatory cytokine produced during early stage of HIV-1 infection which can augment infection and result in a higher viral set point [47,48]. Furthermore, IFN has been reported to directly enhance the in vitro infection of both HIV-1 and FIV in primary PBMC from HIV human subjects and FIV cats [37,49]. Therefore, the in vitro enhancement of FIV infection with Fp4-3 stimulation ( In addition to the use of conserved lentiviral T-cell epitope peptides, the protective efficacy observed in Group 1 may be attributed to the use of MAP with FD-1 adjuvant including rFeIL12. The addition of rFeIL12 to the prototype FIV vaccine has been reported to enhance the efficacy against heterologous FIV isolates more than vaccine formulated only in FD-1 adjuvant [13]. In addition, peptide presented using MAP has been reported to augment the immunity to the peptide more than an equivalent amount of the peptide alone in the same adjuvant [21,50]. Lipidation including palmitoylation of MAP has been reported to further enhance the peptide specific responses by triggering TLRs and transport of peptides into the cells [17,51-53] as well as decrease the toxicity of MAP caused by free amino groups [51]. MAPs using NAb epitope-targeted peptides induced high levels of NAbs against HIV-1 [26,27]. Also, a MAP targeting Th2 epitopes has been used in combination with a MAP targeting the V3 NAb epitope to augment NAb titers [27]. In contrast, T-cell epitope-based vaccine designs consisting of pDNA, modified vaccinia virus vector, and multiple chain peptides with or without lipidation have been tested in Phase-I trials without major success (reviewed in [54]). However, MAP based on T-cell epitopes of tumor antigens induced antitumor CTLs and showed therapeutic efficacy [22,55]. The agonist/antagonist activity of peptides inducing FIV-specific CTL activity was likely a significant factor in MAP1/MAP2-vaccinated cats. Anti-HIV agonist/antagonist peptides on HIV-1 matrix and p24 have been reported for HLA-B8 or HLA-B27 restricted CTLs [19]. changes or COOH-end truncation.) The FIV counterpart of these defined agonist/antagonist peptides of anti-HIV CTLs do not overlap with the FIV enhancer (Fp4-3 and FRT3-3) or suppressor (FRT3-4) peptides in current study. FRT3-3/FRT3-4 are overlapping peptides recognized by HIV+ subjects [11], whereas PP16/PG13 is an agonist/antagonist pair recognized by a CTL clone derived from an HIV+ subject [18]. It is important to note however that both PP16/PG13 and FRT3-3/FRT3-4 pairs can be an outcome of differential cellular cleavage which should be considered in peptide selection and vaccine design. Through careful selection and screening of conserved lentiviral epitopes, the current study is the first to demonstrate the use of a T-cell epitope based MAP to induce CTL-associated and polyfunctional T-cell activities that conferred partial-to-full protection against FIV. All information regarding MAP Vaccine Study 1 is in the manuscript except for the specific information on the selection of the FIV peptide epitopes. The peptide selection is described below with summary data in Tables 9 and 10. Selection of FIV Peptides with Epitopes Inducing T-Cell Activity The selection of the epitopes for HIV-1 and FIV vaccines were based on the ability of the T cells from both HIV-1 positive (HIV+) human subjects and FIV-vaccinated cats to recognize viral epitopes that are conserved between FIV and HIV-1. Note that peptide epitope is the smallest amino acid (aa) sequence that can stimulate T cells to exert their effector activities. In current study, the peptide-specific immunological activities of the CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells were evaluated to identify the induce strong anti-HIV and anti-FIV effector activities are being selected as vaccine immunogens. The overlapping peptide pools of FIV and HIV-1 structural and enzyme proteins were used to stimulate the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) and the T cells from HIV+ subjects as previously described for epitope mapping of HIV-1 and FIV p24 and reverse transcriptase (RT) (Sanou et al., 2013; Roff et al., 2015). The individual peptides in those peptide pools with positive responses to either interferon- (IFN) production and/or T-cell proliferation were determined analysis and CFSE-based CD3+CD4+ and 2013; Roff et al., 2015). Besides viral p24 and RT proteins, the identical approach was used to identify anti-HIV/FIV T-cell epitopes on viral matrix (MA), nucleocapsid (NC), protease RNAase, integrase (IN), surface envelope (SU Env), and transmembrane envelope (TM Env) ( Concurrently, the overlapping peptide pools of FIV structural/enzyme proteins were used to stimulate PBMC and T cells from FIV-vaccinated cats. These cats were vaccinated with prototype dual-subtype FIV vaccine which was the prototype to our commercial FIV vaccine (Coleman et al., 2014). The feline assays (Example 1) equivalent to those of human assays (Sanou et al., 2013; Roff et al., 2015) were used except for ICS analysis. In place of ICS for cytolysin/cytotoxins, IL2 ELISpot analysis was performed. Subsequently, the individual peptides in those peptide pools with positive responses were further tested with the same analyses system. The results for FIV-vaccinated cats included IFN and IL2 productions and CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cell proliferation (Table 9, the second set of results). Subsequently, the in silico human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analyses were performed on those peptides reactive to either T cells from HIV+ subjects and/or vaccinated cats. The algorithms used were NetMHC 3.2 server for HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) [see Worldwide Website: (HLA-DRB1) Worldwide Website: cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII/], and NetCTL (CTL) [see Worldwide Website: cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL/] (Table 9, the third set of results). These in silico analyses determined the reactivity of the selected FIV peptides to the peptide-binding pockets of the HLA and feline leukocyte antigen (FLA, feline counterpart of HLA) allelic proteins called allotypes. It is well established that CD4+ T cells recognize viral peptides in context to the HLA class II on antigen presenting cells or infected target cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. In contrast, CD8+ T cells recognize viral peptides bound to the HLA class I on infected target cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Thus, the HLA/FLA alleles/allotypes expressed in the individual host will determine which viral peptide epitopes can be recognized by the host's immune system to eliminate the viral infection. Unless the host is homozygous at the allelic site, each individual will possess two different alleles each from HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. algorithms for HLA class-II DQ and DP are still in infancy and will not be used or discussed in current study. Similar to humans, domestic cats have three FLA class-I loci with each locus providing two FLA alleles from each chromosomal strand. In contrast, cats have 2-3 loci of FLA class-II DRB1 but lack the gene for DQ or lack complete DP allele. Therefore, the viral epitopes, which are recognized by the most common HLA class-I and -II allotypes prevalent in the host population, are considered to be more effective at inducing effector activities against viral infection than the less common HLA alleles/allotypes. Domestic cats use FLA alleles/allotypes that resemble HLA alleles/allotypes at peptide-binding pocket. Cats possess FLA alleles resembling supertype A3 (75% of 60 alleles identified had Thus, FIV with activities and resembling HLA supertypes A3 and B27 will protect more population of cats than those reacting to supertypes A1, A26, and B8. Lastly, the selected FIV peptides were tested for their potential to enhance or suppress in vitro FIV infection. This assay is called enhancer/suppressor (E/S) analysis of FIV infection (Table 9, last set of results). This feline assay (Example 1) is similar to the human assay described for E/S of HIV-1 infection (Roff et al., 2015) and differs by the use of uninfected cat PBMC and FIV inoculum in place of human PBMC and HIV-1 inoculum. Selection of FIV Peptides for MAP Vaccine Trials in Cats MAP Vaccine Study 1. The Pilot MAP Vaccine Study 1 was predominantly based on the data from preliminary immune analyses of PBMC and T cells of FIV-vaccinated cats in manuscript (Example 1) and the two publications with similar data using human cells (Sanou et al., 2013; Roff et al., 2015). These publications show PBMC and T cells from HIV+ subjects are cross-reactive to the selected FIV peptides. Those FIV peptides with responder frequencies of >25% in the CD8+ T-cell proliferation and in the cytolysin/cytotoxin or IL2 production, and with no FIV enhancing potential, were selected for vaccine study in laboratory cats. In addition, the FIV peptides with epitopes reactive to multiple or key HLA/FLA allotypes and common on both HIV-1 and FIV were further selected. The selected peptides were synthesized into a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) formulation and used as vaccine immunogens in the ongoing MAP Vaccine Study 2 ( MAP Vaccine Study 2. The selection of vaccine peptides were also based on the results from MAP Vaccine Study 1 (see Example 1) which determined that peptide Fp4-3 was not beneficial as vaccine immunogen, and may in fact enhance FIV infection and negate the protective efficacy of overlapping FRT3-3/FRT3-4 peptides. The E/S assay also demonstrated the FIV enhancing activity of Fp4-3 ( In the cat Group 1 (n=5) with the largest number of MAPs, a total of six peptides (i.e., six MAPs) were used as vaccine immunogens with three of these peptides having natural overlap of two peptide epitopes (Fp14-3/Fp14-4, FRT3-3/FRT3-4, and FRT7-1/FRT7-2) ( Summary of Pilot MAP Vaccine Study 1 In the pilot study, three FIV peptides were formulated into three MAP formulations mixed in FD-1 adjuvant (Fort Dodge Animal Health) (oil-in-water) (Coleman et al., 2014) and used as a combined MAP vaccine. One MAP contained single peptide epitope (Fp14-1). Each of the two remaining peptides or MAPs contained two clearly defined T-cell epitopes (FRT3-3/FRT3-4, Fp4-3/Fp14-1). In the in vitro analyses, induced predominantly CD4+ T-cell proliferation and moderate IFN production with minimal IL2 production (Table 9). Similarly, peptide Fp14-1 had slightly more responder frequency in CD4+ than in the T-cell proliferation This peptide had a high responder frequency of IL2 production (62.5%) and only a low frequency of IFN production (12.5%). In contrast, overlapping FRT3-3/FRT3-4 peptide in MAP2 and its individual peptides induced substantial responder frequency in CD8+ T-cell proliferation (44.4%) but nil-to-moderate the proliferation (0%-33.3%) (Table 9). MAP2 induced high IL2 production which was slightly higher than IFN production. Both FRT3-3 and FRT3-4 induced moderate frequency of IL2 but only FRT3-4 induced moderate frequency of IFN with only minimal frequency with FRT3-3. A total of four peptide epitopes that induced either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell immunity conferred complete production in 1 of 4 in Group 1 and 2 of 4 with partial protection. Partial protection consisted of a delay in FIV infection, a slower loss of CD4+ T-cell counts, and/or a lower virus load compared to Groups 3 and 4. Group 1 had no immunization with MAP1b (Fp14-1) and less immunizations with MAP1 (Fp4-3/Fp14-1) or and MAP2 (FRT3-3/FRT3-4) than Group 2 which had no protected cats. No protection was observed in Group 3 with a single prototype FIV vaccine immunization and the control Group 4 with PBS placebo. Although the numbers of animals in each group were small, six major findings were made from this study. First, boosts with MAP vaccination containing four T-cell epitopes can confer partial-to-complete protection (Group 1). Second, including epitopes that induce predominantly CD4+ T-cell proliferation (Fp4-3 and Fp14-1) may not enhance protection but may decrease the efficacy of the protective epitopes. Third, the epitopes that induced CD8+ T-cell responses appeared to be important for protection. Fourth, MAP vaccine can be safely administered in domestic cats. Fifth, this is the first report to demonstrate two epitopes Fp14-3 and FRT3-3 which enhanced in vitro FIV infection. Furthermore, an overlap of the enhancing epitope (FRT3-3) with FIV suppressive epitope (FRT3-4) blocked the and resulted in FIV-suppressive activity. Sixth, single priming with prototype FIV vaccine conferred no protection but instead enhanced FIV infection. Findings 2 and 3 must be further verified by additional studies which either consist of epitopes that only induce CD8+ T-cell activity (e.g., FRT3-3/FRT3-4) or that only induce CD4+ T-cell activity (e.g., Fp4-3 and Fp14-1). In the MAP Vaccine Study 2 described below, FIV epitopes that induced predominantly CD8+ T-cell activity were formulated into MAPs, and the combined MAP vaccine was immunized in cats and tested for prophylactic efficacy against FIV challenge. Update on the Ongoing MAP Vaccine Study 2 In the MAP Vaccine Study 2, FIV epitopes with predominant CD8+ T-cell inducing activity were combined together as peptide epitopes of FIV structure/enzyme proteins. Each MAP was separately mixed with adjuvant supplemented with feline IL12 (FeIL12) as performed in pilot MAP study and refrigerated 10-20 hours before combining as a single vaccine for immunization. Seventeen age-matched specific-pathogen-free cats were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n=5) was primed with prototype FIV vaccine and boosted 3\u00d7 with combined MAP vaccine. Group 2 (n=6) had no priming and was vaccinated 3\u00d7 with combined MAP vaccine. Group 3 (n=6) were divided equally into two groups and immunized with either PBS or PBS in adjuvant supplemented with FeIL12. The duration of the interval between vaccinations varied between 4-5 wk and the interval between the last vaccination and FIV challenge was 5 wk for Group 1 and 6 wk for Groups 2 and 3. Identical to the pilot MAP vaccine study, the cats were immunized SC and ID. However, the total amount of MAP was different from the previous study. The dose of each vaccination for Groups 1 and 2 are shown in As expected, the FIV-specific immunity of the vaccinated cats after second MAP vaccination showed predominantly CD8+ T-cell proliferation and substantial IFN production by the PBMC but minimal IL2 production. However, after the third MAP vaccination, substantially higher CD8+ T-cell proliferation and more CD4+ T-cell proliferation were observed. Similar to the results from the previous pilot study, higher responder frequencies were observed with CD8+ T-cell proliferation than CD4+ T-cell proliferation ( Future Studies on HIV-1 Vaccine Development Table 10 demonstrates that HIV-1 counterpart peptides of the cross-reactive FIV peptide epitopes also stimulate substantial HIV-specific immune responses in the PBMC and T cells from HIV+ subjects. This observation suggests that the cross-reactive FIV epitopes and their counterpart HIV epitopes are relatively conserved. This may also indicate that that the amino acid (aa) of the epitope sequence may not be significantly changed because changes in such sequence will negatively affect the viral fitness of both HIV-1 and FIV. The HIV/FIV counterpart epitopes at the aa residues that bind to the HLA/FLA allotypes may be relatively conserved or have more synonomous aa changes. Our study purposely selected T-cell epitopes on HIV/FIV structural and enzyme proteins since these proteins more likely affect the viral fitness more than the accessory proteins (Vpr, Vpu, Nef). Furthermore, FIV viruses do not have Vpr, Vpu, or Nef, and yet commercial FIV vaccine without these accessory genes was successfully developed (Sidney et al., 2008). Thus, HIV counterpart epitope peptides of the viral structure/enzyme proteins may be useful as immunogens for T-cell based HIV-1 vaccine. In the MAP Vaccine Studies 1 and 2, the FIV peptides which stimulate HIV/FIV-specific T-cell activities were used instead of counterpart HIV peptides in cats. Although no data are shown on the reactivity of counterpart HIV peptides, both the PBMC and the T cells from FIV-vaccinated cats had either low or no responses to the counterpart HIV peptide pools unlike the high responses to both FIV peptide pool and its individual peptide(s) in the pool. A possible reason for this observation is that the T cells were from vaccinated cats instead from FIV-infected cats. The prototype FIV vaccine is inactivated dual-subtype whole viruses and may not process the vaccine proteins in the similar manner as those that occur during infection. PBMC and T cells from HIV+ human subjects were used since even partially effective HIV-1 vaccine (i.e., vaccine with 40% efficacy) is not available. Nevertheless, the use of T cells from HIV+ subjects will be important by providing more direct information regarding the potential of these conserved HIV/FIV epitopes to serve as immunogens for HIV vaccine needed in the immunotherapy of HIV+ subjects. Such T-cell based HIV-1 vaccine is important in the effort to achieve a cure for HIV infection when used in combination with ART and drug(s) (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, cytokines that activate JAK/STAT transducers, and activators of JAK/STAT signaling pathway) for activating latent HIV infection (McIlroy, 2013). Hence, the use of peptide Fp4-3, which enhanced FIV infection, may be useful in activating latent FIV infection. Counterpart HIV peptide of Fp4-3 and other HIV peptides are currently being evaluated for its potential to enhance HIV-1 infection. Similar to our MAP vaccine studies, counterpart HIV-1 epitope peptides will be first used as immunogens for HIV-1 vaccine in HLA-transgenic mice for immunogenicity and humanized mice for vaccine immunity and efficacy against HIV-1 challenge. The cross-reactive FIV epitope peptides will be considered only if the counterpart HIV peptides induce far less responses than the FIV peptides with the T cells from HIV+ subjects. Selection of HIV-1 Peptides with Epitopes Inducing T-Cell Activity The selection procedure of HIV-1 peptides is similar to those used for evaluating FIV peptides. Since our goal is to develop HIV vaccine for human use, the HIV peptides (Table 10) counterpart of the cross-reactive FIV peptides shown in Table 9 were tested with PBMC and T cells from HIV+ subjects. The immune functions analyzed were human IFN production by ELISpot, cytolysin/cytotoxin production by ICS, and CFSE-based proliferation of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells from HIV+ subjects (Table 10, the first set of results). In addition, the Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) database was used to identify the HLA allele(s) of the HIV epitope sequence with CTL activity that can exist within the sequence of the conserved counterpart HIV peptide (Table 9, LANL CTL). The bold HLA class-I supertypes and the are those on the \"Optimal CD8+ CTL Epitopes\" list and those without bold for potential CTL epitope. Only HLA-A and HLA-B has been classified into groups called supertypes based on the similarity in the peptides binding to the pockets of the HLA allotypes (Sidney et al., 2008). The HLA class II such as HLA-DRB1 has yet to be fully classified into supertypes, and therefore the 4-digit resolution nomenclatures for the HLA-DRB1 alleles are shown. The preliminary data shown in Table 10 demonstrate HIV-1 peptides Hp14-1, Hp14-2, Hp14-3, HRT3-3, HRT3-4, and Fp14-3, Fp14-4, FRT3-3, FT3-4, and FRT3-5, respectively in Table 9. These HIV-1 peptides and counterpart FIV peptides induce CD8+ T-cell proliferation and cytolysin/cytotoxin expression in a high number of HIV+ subjects. These HIV-1 peptides will be further tested for enhancer and suppressor activity in the in vitro HIV-1 infection using uninfected human PBMC with different HLA alleles. Our goals are to complete Table 10, select a large number of HIV-1 peptides from those in Table 10, and to test as vaccine immunogens in the HLA-transgenic mice and humanized mice. The Use of HLA Analyses to Further Select the Conserved HIV-1 Peptides from Table 10 Since a large majority of these HIV-1 peptides in Table 10 is conserved among many HIV-1 subtypes (subtypes A, B, C, and D) (Tables 11 and 12), there is a strong likelihood of these peptides being useful as vaccine immunogens in highly HIV-1 endemic countries and regions with HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C and D. More importantly, HIV-1 subtype C is the major subtype circulating globally followed by subtypes B and A (Taylor et al., 2008). The next important aspect of these HIV epitopes is whether the predominant HLA supertypes and alleles of the populations in the HIV endemic regions are the same as or similar to the HLA supertypes or alleles/allotypes which recognize these peptide epitopes (Table 10). The most frequently observed HLA supertypes for HIV counterpart peptides in Table 10 (under CTL in bold) are B27 and A3 followed by B7 and B44. Except for B27, three of these supertypes are highly prevalent in African Americans and Caucasians in U.S. (Table 13). In contrast, supertype B27 ranks 6th-8th position out of 10 positions (Table 13). Further improvements can be made on these peptides by adding 1-2 aa identical to those on HIV at the amino-end or carboxyl-end to increase its binding potential for those HLA prevalent in the population. For example, isoleucine which is on the amino-end of the viral peptide HPR1 sequence was added in order for the peptide to bind to A3 and A2 (Table 10). In addition, the aa at the sites where the peptide contact peptide-binding pocket of the HLA allotype can be changed to increase affinity and provide more stronger antiviral immune responses. These improvements can be tested using HLA-transgenic mice and humanized mice. Animals and Immunization. Specific pathogen free (SPF) cats at the age of 8 weeks were purchased from Liberty Laboratories or bred at University of Florida. The SPF cats were distributed into groups as shown in CD8+ T-Cell Proliferation. Carboxyfluorescein the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen-Fisher, Carlsbad, Calif.) and processed as previously described (Roff et al. (2015)) using the following modifications: anti-feline CD3 antibody ((clone NZM1), a generous gift from T. Miyazawa (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan)) in combination with APC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG3 (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.), PE-conjugated anti-feline CD4 antibody (Southern Biotech), and anti-feline CD8 antibody (gift from N. Gengozian, University of Tennessee (Gengozian et al. (1997))) in combination with PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2b (Southern Biotech) to detect the proliferation of feline CD3+CD4+ T cells and feline CD3+CD4+ T cells. All results shown in the figures ( IFN and IL2 Production Response. The feline IFN and L2 ELISpot analyses of PBMC to FIV MAPs and peptides were performed as previously described (Abbott et al. (2012)) using feline IFN modular kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) and feline IL2 modular kit (R&D Systems). All results shown in the figures ( mRNA analyses were performed using PBMC from all cats as previously described (Aranyos et al. (2016); Omori et al. (2004)). The following modifications were made PCR amplification cycle of 35 for all cytokine mRNAs and perforin mRNA and 45 for granzymes A and B mRNAs. All results shown in the Introduction The goals of Multiple Antigenic Peptide (MAP) Trial 2 were to determine: 1) the immunogenicity of the MAP vaccine using four MAPs that provided the best immunogenicity in previous MAP Trial 1 and 2) the route of vaccination that induces the best immunogenicity to the peptide(s) composing the individual MAPs. All specific pathogen free (SPF) cats were vaccinated with MAP vaccine composed of 100 g of each MAPs resulting in a total amount of 400 g per vaccine dose, which was much lower than the total amount in the previous MAP Trial 1 by close to half. The four MAPs used in MAP Trial 2 are shown in the order of most immunogenic on the left to the least immunogenic on the right ( MAP consisted of palmitic acid (Pam) on the carboxyl-end of the lysine (K) backbone with two lysine branches on the amino-end of the MAP, and each lysine branch is attached to two identical FIV peptides resulting in four identical FIV peptides per MAP ( The vaccination routes tested were subcutaneous (SQ; Vaccine Group 1) and intradermal (ID; Vaccine Group 2) vaccinations ( Vaccine Groups 1 and 2 consisted of seven SPF cats each (n=7, Immunogenicity Analyses Over Time Base on previous MAP Trial 1, current Trial 2 evaluated the immunogenicity at 6 weeks post-2nd vaccination ( The second parameter evaluated was the ability of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinated and control cats to produce IL2 and interferon- (IFN) proteins in responses to FIV MAPs and peptides ( Lastly, the third parameter evaluated was the ability of PBMC from vaccinated and control cats at 6 weeks in responses to FIV MAPs and peptides ( The average result of all control cats was subtracted from each immunogenicity result of the vaccinated cats shown in the figure ( Vaccine-Induced proliferation responses increased in frequency (total number of MAP and peptide bars) and magnitude (height of each MAP or peptide bar) with additional vaccination ( In previous Trial 1, the FIV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation responses were substantially greater than FIV-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation responses (data not shown but provided in previous submission). In current Trial 2, CD4+ T-cell proliferation responses were greater than FIV-specific CD8+ ( Overall, strong CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell proliferation responses were observed by the 3rd vaccination in current Trial 2. Importantly, CD4+ T-cell proliferation responses more than CD8+ T-cell proliferation responses were observed in responses to FIV MAPs and peptides. Vaccine-Induced IL2 and IFN Production. The highest frequency of IL2 responses to FIV MAPs and peptides were observed in PBMC from vaccinated cats at 6 weeks post-2nd vaccination than those from 6 weeks post-3rd vaccination ( Similar to the time at the highest frequency of IL2 responses above, the highest frequency of IFN responses to FIV MAPs and peptides were observed in the PBMC from MAP-vaccinated cats at 6 weeks post-2rd vaccination than those at 6 weeks post-3rd vaccination ( Overall, the most consistent observation is the frequency of IL2 responses from PBMC from SQ vaccinated cats did not substantially differ from those from ID vaccinated cats over the different time(s) post-vaccination. In contrary, IFN responses were detected mostly in PBMC from ID vaccinated cats. Vaccine-Induced mRNA Expressions of Cytokine, Perforin, and Granzymes A and B. Preliminary cytokine/perforin/granzyme mRNA analyses demonstrate that the combination of peptides FRT3-3, FRT3-4, and overlap FRT3-3/4 induce the most mRNA expression of IFN, IL2, TNF, and GrzA and an extremely low level of perforin in PBMC from one SQ MAP-vaccinated cat ( Table 15. Selection of T-cell epitopes on FIV based on anti-lentiviral immunogenicity, feline leukocyte antigen (FLA) interaction, and lentiviral aa sequence conservation. The immunogenicity results of 22 FIV peptides as determined from over 220 FIV peptides tested are shown in this table. All of these peptides had substantially high aa sequence conservation with counterpart HIV-1 sequence. The list includes those FIV peptides, which generally induced the most CD8+ T-cell proliferation response and a moderate-to-high IFN and IL2 production in the T cells or PBMC from 6-10 FIV-vaccinated cats. In addition, these peptides were also analyzed for IFN production, CD4+ and CD8+ PBMC or T cells from 8-30 HIV+ human subjects. The frequency of responders is based on the individual responses of the vaccinated cats or HIV+ human subjects after subtraction of the average of the responses of PBMC or T cells from 6-8 non-vaccinated cats or 8-20 HIV-negative human subjects. Those FIV peptides that are not from p24 or RT have extremely low responses since the HIV+ subjects used were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) which causes lower HIV-specific immune responses. The threshold for positive IFN and IL2 ELISpot responses is 50 spot-forming units (SFU) The threshold staining (ICS) is 0.2%. The frequency of responders is shown as the percentage of the number of responders equal to or above the threshold level over the total tested and as follows: 0%-1.4% The nine FIV peptides in black were used in the current MAP vaccine trial, whereas the 13 peptides in blue were not used. The four FIV peptides (FRT3-3, FRT3-4, Fp4-3, Fp14-1) in red box were used in pilot MAP vaccine study. The MAPs and their corresponding peptide(s) were also tested for their ability to enhance or suppress in vitro FIV infection of feline PBMC (E/S of peptides and E/S of MAP). The ideal T-cell based FIV vaccine should contain vaccine peptides that induce high levels of CD8+ T-cell proliferation responses along with high levels of cytolysin/cytotoxin mRNAs which include the induction of antiviral CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Those FIV peptides that stimulate high levels of CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN production in contrast may enhance FIV infection based on the following reasons. Activated CD4+ T cells with higher expression of FIV receptor (CD134 or OX40 is also activation marker) are more susceptible to FIV infection (Weinberg, 2002; Shimojima et al., 2004) Furthermore, IFN enhances in vitro FIV infection of PBMC (Tanabe and Yamamoto, 2001). The ideal CD8+ T cell-inducing vaccine peptides should have high sequence conservation with all AIDS lentiviruses at a sequence site where viral fitness is greatly affected with any major mutations. These FIV peptides were analyzed for reactivity to human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Previously we have determined that cats' MHC or feline leukocyte antigen (FLA) molecules have binding pockets similar to HLA. The bolded HLA alleles have similar peptide binding pockets as FLA. Net-MHC3.4 server defines peptides that bind to HLA class I allotypes. Net-CTL1.2 defines peptides that have potential to bind to and induce CD8+ CTL activity. Net-MHC2.2 defines peptides that bind to HLA class II (HLA-DRB) allotypes. The in silico analyses indicate that the nine peptides used in current MAP vaccine trial have one or more epitopes with high potential to bind to FLA. Consequently, these peptides have a high potential to be immunogenic based also on the in silico algorithm as well as demonstrated by the biological activity shown under immunogenicity induced by PBMC or T cells from FIV-vaccinated cats. Table 16. Selection of T-cell epitopes on HIV-1 based on anti-lentiviral immunogenicity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) interaction, and lentiviral aa sequence conservation. The counterpart HIV-1 peptides of the FIV peptides were also tested for immunogenicity using PBMC and T cells from HIV+ human subjects. All of these HIV-1 peptides had substantially high aa sequence conservation with counterpart FIV sequence. Those HIV-1 peptides that are not from p24 or RT have extremely low responses since these are the results from HIV+ subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV+ subject on ART generally have lower HIV-specific immune responses as previously reported (McIlroy, 2013; Shan et al., 2012) and as shown in this table. The HRT7-1 and HRT7-2 were also tested with cells from HIV+ subjects on ART. The threshold for positive IFN ELISpot response is 75 spot-forming units (SFU) per 106 threshold B) cells (CyCD4) and CD8+ T cells (CyCD8) is 0.2%. The frequency of responders is shown as the percentage of the responders equal to or above the threshold level over the total tested and as nine HIV-1 peptides in black are the counterpart FIV peptides used in the current MAP vaccine trial, whereas the 13 peptides in blue were not. Since these HIV-1 peptides are counterpart of the lentivirally conserved FIV peptides from Table 17. Efficacy of the MAP vaccines against pathogenic FIV challenge at 15 median cat infectious dose (15CID50). As of to date at 12 wk post-challenge (wpc), Groups 1 and 2 have protection rates of 60% and 50%, respectively when no protection was observed in control Group 3. At the same challenge dose (15 CID50) in the previous pilot MAP vaccine study, the last control cats became infected at 12 wpc which is at the same time as the current MAP Vaccine Trial I. Since the natural FIV transmission dose is 2 CID50 (Yamamoto, 2009), the previous and the current challenge dose is 12.5\u00d7 the natural transmission dose. More important, the challenge FIVFC1 virus is a pathogenic strain which is resistant to virus neutralizing antibodies induced by the commercial dual-subtype FIV vaccine (Coleman et al., 2014). Table 18. Summary of the total immune responses to vaccine peptides observed with each vaccinated cat. The total CD8+ T-cell proliferation responses, the total CD4+ T-cell proliferation, and the cumulative CD8+ T-cell/CD4+ T-cell response ratio to all vaccine peptides have been added and presented (top three rows). The percentages (%) of peptides with CD8+ T-cell proliferation and CD4+ T-cell proliferation are shown followed by the % of peptides with CD8+ T-cell proliferation over the % of peptides with CD4+ T-cell proliferation when the analyses consisted of a total of 11 peptides (middle three rows). The total IFN response and the total IL2 response in SFU/106 PBMC to all vaccine peptides are shown for each vaccinated cat (last two rows). Those cats in Group 1 (DV4, OLM) and Group 2 (DU5, DX1, OLL) in red are infected and the values in red suggest the potential reason for lack of protection of these cats. The two cats from Group 1 that became infected at 6 wpc are cats DVA and OLM. These cats have the highest IFN and IL2 productions and the two lowest CD8 T-Cell/CD4 T-cell response ratios. The two cats from Group 2 that became infected at 9 wpc are DU5 and DX1, and one cat OLL became infected at 12 wpc. These cats had the three highest IFN and IL2 productions but only DU5 and OLL had the two lowest CD8 T-cell/CD4 T-cell response ratio. Instead cat DX1 had the second highest CD8/CD4 T-cell response ratio but it also had the highest number (45%) of vaccine peptides inducing CD4+ T-cell proliferation. Except for the CD4/CD8 T-cell response ratio in DX1, the current results at 12 wpc indicate that protection are observed in vaccinated cats with high CD8/CD4 T-cell response ratio and low levels of IFN and IL2 productions. The protected cats in Group 1 (DU1, DY2, EA4) and Group 2 (BFA, DU4, DX5) will be monitored for additional 6 wk to demonstrate either complete protection or delay in protection. To confirm complete protection, all cats must be negative for FIV infection not only in PBMC but also in thymus, bone marrow, and lymph node cells and all should be negative for infection-induced FIV antibodies. Table 19. Vaccine peptides with sequence conservation for FIV subtypes A-E. Each peptide in the MAPs was analyzed for amino acid (aa) sequence conservation among all five FIV subtypes (A,B,C,D,E). The symbols between two peptide sequences represent: identical aa (*); closely similar aa (:); moderately similar aa (.); and red aa residue has no similarity with the corresponding aa residue on FIV (A,B,C,D,E). Polymerase sequence for FIV subtype E peptide Fp9-3 of identity among all five FIV subtypes evaluated and thus an excellent vaccine peptide. The peptide with the next highest aa identity and similarity is FRT7-1/FRT7-2 of MAP5 followed by Fp14-3/Fp14-4 of MAP3 and then FRT3-3/FRT3-4 of MAP2v. In conclusion, all of the FIV peptides in the top four MAPs have high aa identity and similarity which suggest that they are highly conserved and will be an outstanding vaccine peptides. Tables 20A-20D. The amino acid sequence conservation of the FIV vaccine peptides and corresponding counterpart HIV-1 peptides. The four best FIV peptides for vaccine against FIV are also recognized by T cells from HIV+ human subjects. The two best vaccine peptides from MAP Vaccine Trial I are peptide Fp9-3 (Table 20A) have the similarity (53%) and identity (13%) to counterpart HIV-1 peptide sequence (Table 20A), this peptide is consistently detected at high magnitude by CD8+ T cells from HIV+ human subjects. The FIV overlapping peptide FRT7-1/FRT7-2 has the next lowest similarity (65%) and identity (55%) to HIV-1 (Table 20B). The other two FIV overlapping peptides Fp14-3/Fp14-4 (Table 20C) and FRT3-3/FRT3-4 (Table 20D) have a substantial aa sequence similarity (75% in Table 20C and 80% in Table 20D) and moderate-to-substantial aa sequence identities (31-37% in Table 20C; 70% in Table 20D) with the counterpart HIV-1 peptide sequences. Such sequence conservation also exists with counterpart SIV peptide sequences. Thus, the sequence conservation suggests that these FIV and counterpart HIV-1 peptide sequences more likely are resistant to mutation due to any major mutation can affect the fitness of the virus, and therefore they may serve as an outstanding vaccine immunogen. The lentiviral sequence conservation also demonstrates that the sequence conserved sections are difficult to determine by comparing the counterpart HIV-1 and SIV sequences since their sequences are much more similar to each other than to the FIV sequence. Thus, the use of FIV sequences in comparison to the counterpart HIV-1 and SIV sequences more readily determines the evolutionarily conserved or lentivirally conserved sequence sections on the viral proteins. - U.S. Pat.
