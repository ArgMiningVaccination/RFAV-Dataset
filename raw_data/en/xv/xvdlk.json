Sense combines this technique with the lost remedy from Empress Cixi, to brighten and smooth the skin. 90 minsempress dowager cixi facial The health of the imperial family in the Forbidden City was of paramount importance and many practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine settled in Beijing. T echniques such as tui na, acupuncture and cupping were specialties founded and refined in this city. Beijing was well-known for its \"pat therapy\" massage which used velvet satchels of sand and artisan-carved wooden implements to stimulate the body and improve blood flow. The treatment helped to detox and revitalize the body by stimulating acupressure points to relieve physical fatigue.

Concubines had strong black shining hair well into their 70s.
