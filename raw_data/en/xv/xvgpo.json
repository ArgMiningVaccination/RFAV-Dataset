Abstract BACKGROUND\u2014Memory performance in older persons can reflect genetic influences on cognitive function and dementing processes. We aimed to identify genetic contributions to verbal declarative memory in a community setting. METHODS\u2014We conducted genome-wide association studies for paragraph or word list delayed recall in 19 cohorts from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, comprising 29,076 dementia-and stroke-free individuals of European descent, aged 45 years. Replication of suggestive associations (p < 5 \u00d7 106) was sought in 10,617 participants of European descent, 3811 African-Americans, and 1561 young adults. RESULTS\u2014rs4420638, near APOE, was associated with poorer delayed recall performance in discovery (p = 5.57 \u00d7 1010) and replication cohorts (p = 5.65 \u00d7 108). This association was stronger for paragraph than word list delayed recall and in the oldest persons. Two associations with specific tests, in subsets of the total sample, reached genome-wide significance in combined analyses of discovery and replication (rs11074779 [HS3ST4], p = 3.11 \u00d7 108, and rs6813517 [SPOCK3], p = 2.58 \u00d7 108) near genes involved in immune response. A genetic score combining 58 independent suggestive memory risk variants was associated with increasing Alzheimer disease pathology in 725 autopsy samples. Association of memory risk loci with gene expression in 138 human hippocampus samples showed cis-associations with WDR48 and CLDN5, both related to ubiquitin metabolism. CONCLUSIONS\u2014This largest study to date exploring the genetics of memory function in ~ 40,000 older individuals revealed genome-wide associations and suggested an involvement of immune and ubiquitin Keywords Alzheimer disease; Dementia; St\u00e9phanie Debette, M.D., Ph.D., Boston University School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Framingham Heart Study, 72 East Concord Street, B-622, Boston, MA 02118-2526; sdebette@bu.edu.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe ability to form and retrieve memories is one of the most fundamental and complex aspects of human cognition. Decline in memory performance is a prominent marker of cognitive decline that occurs in late life and is one of the earliest signs of dementia (1,2). Verbal declarative memory, the conscious recall of information that can be retrieved verbally, can be measured using word list and paragraph recall tests. The delayed recall performance of these tests is a powerful predictor of Alzheimer disease (AD) (3). Cognitive ability and memory performance were shown to be highly heritable (4-7). However, few consistent genetic associations have been described, mostly assessed by candidate gene association studies (8,9). Three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of verbal declarative memory, on overlapping samples of 333 to 1073 young adults in their twenties, have identified associations of genetic variants in the KIBRA and CTNNBL1 genes with delayed recall (10,11). No GWAS of verbal declarative memory delayed recall performance has been performed in older individuals to our knowledge. Genetic determinants of verbal declarative memory are likely to differ between young and old individuals, although some may be shared across age groups (4). In young adults, developmental genes determining the neural networks required for learning, storage, and retrieval or genes involved in the molecular mechanisms of memory storage ( 12) could be expected to harbor most susceptibility variants. In older individuals, variants in genes involved in brain aging and neurodegenerative disease may be more likely revealed (13). Our aim was to identify genetic variants associated with memory performance in late middle-aged and older individuals. We conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for delayed recall performance in tests of verbal declarative memory in 29,076 older community-based individuals and sought replication and extension of findings in 13,998 independent older participants (10,617 of European descent and 3381 African-Americans) and 1561 young adults. METHODS AND MATERIALS GWAS Study Population Analyses were performed in 19 population-based cohorts participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium (Section 2, Table S1 in Supplement 1). All subjects were aged 45 years and dementia and stroke free at cognitive assessment. The study population comprised 29,076 participants of European ancestry, including 6674 participants with paragraph recall and 24,604 participants with word list recall tests. Each cohort secured approval from institutional review boards, and all participants provided written informed consent for study participation, cognitive testing, and use of DNA for genetic research. None of these studies have previously published GWAS for delayed recall performance in tests of verbal declarative memory. Memory Tests Participants were administered one or both types of verbal declarative memory tests: word list delayed recall (WL-dr) and paragraph delayed recall (PAR-dr). WL-dr comprised tests using visually or verbally presented word lists, with or without semantic relatedness between Debette et al. Page 2 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe words; PAR-dr comprised tests using one or two verbally presented stories (Figure 1; Table S2 in Supplement 1). Participants were asked to remember as many words or paragraph elements as possible after a specified delay interval, preceded by an immediate recall task (Section 3 in Supplement 1). We decided a priori to run both global meta- analyses combining all tests and meta-analyses combining similar tests. Indeed, different memory tests may involve partly distinct neural networks and mechanisms (Section 3 in Supplement 1). Meta-analyses thus comprised a combination of all measures of delayed recall (ALL-dr; n = 29,076), PAR-dr (n = 6674), WL-dr (n = 24,604), and various subtypes of WL-dr tests, including Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease delayed recall (CERAD-dr, n = 4,274), Delayed Word Recall Test (n = 9,188), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT-dr, n = 4,274), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-dr, n = 2,950), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (n = 331) (Figure 1). Genotyping and Imputation The consortium was formed after the individual studies had finalized their GWAS platforms; hence, the studies included used different platforms. Genotyping platforms are described in Table S4 in Supplement 1. Imputation to nonmonomorphic, autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the HapMap CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection) panel was performed with standard quality control filters (Section 4, Tables S5 and S6 in Supplement 1). APOE- genotypes are not available on the GWAS arrays; however, APOE had been genotyped separately in most cohorts. Discovery GWAS Within each cohort, a linear regression model was used to evaluate the association of raw scores for delayed recall (number of words or story elements recalled) with the number of minor alleles (0 to 2) at each SNP. Analyses were adjusted for age and sex and, if relevant, study site, familial structure, and population substructure (Section 5 in Supplement 1). We additionally adjusted for educational achievement (Table S1 in Supplement 1) in a secondary model only, as this could weaken associations with developmental genes that may impact educational attainment. We undertook meta-analyses with METAL (14) using inverse-variance weighted meta- analysis to combine GWAS for the same memory test and effective sample size weighted meta-analysis to combine GWAS for nonidentical memory tests (Section 5 in Supplement 1). Effective sample size weighted meta-analysis is recommended when the dependent variable is measured on different scales between cohorts and does not yield any directly comparable effect estimate. For each SNP, the Z statistic was weighted by the effective sample size (product of the sample size and the ratio of the empirically observed dosage variance to the expected binomial dosage variance for imputed SNPs). A combined estimate was obtained by summing the weighted Z statistics and dividing by the summed weights. Genomic control was used to remove residual population stratification within cohorts and in the meta-analysis.Debette et al. Page 3 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptReplication and Extension We sought to replicate our strongest association signals (p < 5 \u00d7 106) in seven independent population-based cohorts including 10,617 participants of European descent. We also attempted to extend our findings to 3811 individuals of African-American ancestry and to 1561 young adults in their twenties (Section 2, Table S1 in Supplement 1; for genotyping methods, Section 4, Tables S4-S6 in Supplement 1). Functional Annotation Expression Quantitative Trait Loci\u2014We analyzed the association of suggestive memory risk loci from the discovery GWAS (p < 5 \u00d7 106) with hippocampus cell line whole-genome gene expression profiles. This information was derived from 138 human premortem hippocampus samples (15). Exploratory p value thresholds of .05 were used for cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (distance between SNP and probe < 2 Mb) and 104 for trans-eQTLs (Section 6 in Supplement 1). Pathway Analysis\u2014Pathway analyses were carried out using the core analysis function of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, California). We performed gene-based tests for association based on results from the PAR- dr and WL-dr discovery GWAS, using the Versatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS) software (16). The full list of genes and gene-based p values generated by VEGAS was uploaded into IPA for use as a reference set (16,965 genes were available for the PAR-dr analysis and 16,953 for the WL-dr analysis). From this list, p value cutoffs of . 01 or .05 were used to identify IPA focus molecules (Section 7 in Supplement 1). Networks generated by IPA provide insight into the molecular interactions of the focus molecules, independent of any predictions of biological function. For this analysis only, direct interactions were used, that is, where there is physical contact between the two molecules. The network building algorithm ranks focus molecules by interconnectedness (the number of triangular connections with other pairs of genes). The top molecule is taken as a seed gene and additional focus molecules are added, prioritizing those that have the most overlap with the existing network. The default IPA network size of 35 nodes was used (Section 7 in Supplement 1). Association with AD Pathology We examined the relation of memory risk alleles and a memory genetic score with AD pathology (intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques) in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 725; Section 8 in Supplement 1) (17). The memory genetic score comprised all independent SNPs (R2 < .25) associated with memory performance at p < 5 \u00d7 106 (Section 9 in Supplement 1). Briefly, each participant was assigned a score value, determined by summing up the number of copies (or imputed dosage) of each memory risk allele; each SNP in the score was weighted by the corresponding Z score from the memory GWAS meta-analysis.Debette et al. Page 4 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptCandidate Genes APOE Locus\u2014Because APOE4 is the major known genetic risk factor for AD, we explored its association with memory performance in discovery and replication studies where this genotype was available (n = 33,403 for WL-dr, n = 13,170 for PAR-dr), comparing APOE4 carriers with noncarriers. Secondary analyses stratified on the cohort's mean age ( 65 versus < 65) were run. Published Memory and AD Risk Alleles\u2014In the discovery GWAS, we tested whether memory performance was associated with published memory susceptibility SNPs and confirmed AD risk variants other than APOE4; Bonferroni correction for the number of independent SNPs (R2 < .25) (18) tested was used, corresponding to significance thresholds of p < .0029 (= .05/17) for memory risk variants and p < .0025 (= .05/20) for AD risk variants available in HapMap (Tables S11 and S12 in Supplement 2). For published memory risk variants, we extracted gene-based p values [obtained with VEGAS (16)] for genes closest to these variant SNPs (p threshold < .0036 [.05/14 genes]). We also constructed a genetic risk score comprising AD risk variants from 20 independent AD risk loci (19) to estimate the joint effect of these SNPs on memory performance (Section 10 in Supplement 1) (20). RESULTS GWAS of Verbal Declarative Memory GWAS meta-analyses of verbal declarative memory comprised in total 29,076 participants (mean age 63.6 \u00b1 7.0 years, 56.0% women; see Table S1 in Supplement 1 for detailed demographic characteristics). Quantile-quantile plots showed no evidence of spurious inflation of p values or significant population stratification (Figure S1 in Supplement 1). Genome-wide plots of p values for SNPs against their genomic position are shown in Figure S2 in Supplement 1. For replication, 10,617 participants (72.8 \u00b1 5.4 years, 78.3% women) were available. Two loci reached genome-wide significance (Tables 1 and 2): on (rs4420638, p = 9.69 \u00d7 109) with CVLT-dr. The SNPs on chromosome 19q12 are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with APOE 4 and are known to be associated with an increased risk of AD. They were significantly replicated (p = 5.65 \u00d7 108 for rs4420638). In the combined discovery and replication sample, rs4420638 explained approximately 1% of the variance in paragraph delayed recall performance (Table S13 in Supplement 1). Although the direction of effect was consistent, the chromosome 5q11 locus was not confirmed in the replication sample. In total, 174 SNPs reached a suggestive p value (p < 5 \u00d7 106) in at least one GWAS meta- analysis (Table S7 in Supplement 2), representing 58 independent loci (R2 < .25). The association between RAVLT-dr and rs11074779 (chromosome 16p12, near HS3ST4) was replicated (p = 1.08 \u00d7 103) and reached genome-wide significance when combining discovery and replication cohorts (p = 3.11 \u00d7 108; Figure 2, Table 3). Association of CERAD-dr with rs6813517 (chromosome 4q32.3, near SPOCK3) was significant in an Debette et al. Page 5 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAfrican-American extension sample (p = .020) and reached genome-wide significance when combining with the discovery GWAS (p = 2.58 \u00d7 108; Figure 2, Table 4). No European replication sample was available for CERAD-dr. Three additional SNPs were replicated at p < .05 with effects in the same direction, without reaching genome-wide significance (Tables 1 and 2): rs9528384 (chromosome (chromosome 5q23) with CVLT-dr. The above findings were not significant in a sample of 1561 young adults (22.3 \u00b1 3.4 years, 69.1% women; Table S7 in Supplement 2). APOE and Delayed Performance The APOE locus (i.e., APOE4 and GWAS SNPs in LD) significant associations with PAR-dr, while associations with WL-dr were much less significant (p > 5 \u00d7 106), despite a larger sample size (Tables 1 and 5). When restricting analyses to older cohorts (mean age 65), associations of APOE4 with memory performance were significantly strengthened (p = 1.22 \u00d7 105 and p = 2.64 \u00d7 103 for difference with WL-dr and PAR-dr in young cohorts), still reaching weaker significance levels for WL-dr (p = 6.25 \u00d7 1011) than for PAR-dr (p = 3.84 \u00d7 1020). This remained true when restricting analyses to studies where the same participants underwent both tests of WL-dr (p = 1.34 \u00d7 1017) and PAR-dr (p = 6.80 \u00d7 107). Associations of APOE4 with memory performance were substantially weakened after adjustment for the most significant GWAS proxy (rs4420638), suggesting no additional independent signal at this locus (Table 5). There was a nominally significant interaction of APOE 4 carrier status with rs11074779 in association with RAVLT (p = .02) but not with other SNPs reaching genome-wide significance in the GWAS or in the combined analysis of discovery and follow-up cohorts; APOE 4 non-carriers had slightly higher effect estimates for the association of rs11074779 with RAVLT compared with APOE 4 carriers (Table S8 in Supplement 1). Functional Annotation Hippocampal eQTL\u2014Among associations of suggestive memory risk variants with RNA expression in the human hippocampus (Table S9 in Supplement 2), the most significant cis- associations included rs2280630 (PAR-dr, p[eQTL] WDR48, encoding a ubiquitin-specific protease associated protein belonging to a family of deubiquitinating enzymes, and rs5747035 (RAVLT-dr, p[eQTL] = 7.63 \u00d7 103) with CLDN5, encoding a membranal tight junction protein that plays a critical role in determining the permeability of endothelial barriers and whose degradation is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (21). Associations of rs2280630 and rs5747035 with PAR-dr and RAVLT-dr were in the same direction as in the discovery GWAS in the follow-up studies but did not reach significance (p = .058 and .19; Tables 1 and 3). Pathway Analysis\u2014The networks reaching the highest score, i.e., the lowest chance of randomly finding the selected number of focus molecules in a network of the selected size, are shown in Figure S3 in Supplement 1. In the PAR-dr pathway analysis using a gene- based p value cutoff of .01, the top three networks and networks 5 and 6 (ordered by decreasing scores, respectively, of 33, 28, 26, 25, 24, 21) all included Ubiquitin C (UBC) as Debette et al. Page 6 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripta central hub. UBC was also a central hub in networks 3, 4, 5, and 6 (respective scores 27, 26, 23, and 23) of the WL-dr pathway analysis using a gene-based p value cutoff of .01. When using a gene-based p value cutoff of .05, several PAR-dr and WL-dr networks also included UBC as a central hub. As UBC has a large number (n = 8332) of directly related molecules, we calculated whether there are more UBC interactions in the whole focus molecule set than would be expected by chance, given the number of UBC interactions in the reference set, using the hypergeometric distribution test. The latter suggested that this over-representation was not due to chance (Table S10 in Supplement 1). Association with AD Pathology The APOE locus and four intronic SNPs in LD within the KIAA1797 gene on chromosome 9 were associated with increasing amyloid plaque burden and neurofibrillary tangle density (false discovery rate-corrected p value < .05; Table S11 in Supplement 2). The memory genetic score, combining 58 independent variants associated with memory at p < 5 \u00d7 106, was significantly associated with increasing amyloid plaque burden (effect estimate [] \u00b1 SE: .0103 \u00b1 the APOE locus from the score, the association was still significant neurofibrillary tangle density ( \u00b1 SE: .0079 \u00b1 .0036, p = .027). Candidate Gene Analysis Published Memory Risk Variants\u2014None of the SNPs previously reported to be associated with memory performance, mostly in young cohorts, reached a statistically significant level of association after correction for multiple testing in our middle-aged to older samples (Table S12 in Supplement 1). Published Risk Variants for AD\u2014Except for APOE, none of the AD risk loci were significantly associated with memory performance individually (Table S14 in Supplement 1). However, an AD genetic risk score was significantly associated with worse performance on WL-dr, CERAD-dr, ALL-dr, and PAR-dr; the latter two associations remained significant after removing the APOE locus from the AD genetic risk score (Table S15 in Supplement 1). DISCUSSION Principal Findings In this first GWAS of verbal declarative memory in almost 30,000 older nondemented community adults, we observed a genome-wide significant association of the APOE locus with poorer memory performance, especially for paragraph delayed recall. Two additional associations in subsets of the total sample and for specific tests, i.e., of rs11074779 near HS3ST4 with RAVLT-dr and of rs6813517 near SPOCK3 with CERAD-dr, were replicated and reached genome-wide significance after combining discovery and replication samples. Results were overall similar with and without education adjustment. Associations with the APOE locus tended to be slightly more significant in the education-adjusted model, whereas SNPs near genes involved in neuronal development and synaptic function were more Debette et al. Page 7 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsignificantly associated without education adjustment, in line with the hypothesis that effects of developmental genes may be masked by correcting for educational achievement (22). In the Context of the Literature and Putative Mechanisms Although APOE4 is a well-established risk factor for AD, its association with memory performance is controversial (9,23); some studies on relatively small samples have suggested an age-dependent detrimental effect of APOE4 on memory performance (24) and even a protective effect in young adults (25). The present findings confirm a highly significant association of APOE4 with poorer memory performance in the oldest cohorts, while the association did not reach or barely reached significance in the young and middle- aged cohorts, both in European and African-American samples. Whereas this age-dependent effect could be partly ascribed to the higher prevalence of subclinical AD with increasing age, APOE4 could also influence cognitive aging independently of the mechanisms underlying AD (13). The much stronger detrimental effect of APOE4 on PAR-dr than on WL-dr is intriguing. Word list and story listening tasks were shown to activate different brain regions, with unequal involvement of the right hemisphere (26,27), and performance on these tests is significantly but not very strongly correlated (Table S3 in Supplement 1). Our data suggest that PAR-dr may perhaps better capture APOE4-related decline in memory performance than WL-dr. More broadly, these discrepancies have important implications when planning future genetic studies of cognition as they highlight how distinct memory tasks are (even when focusing on delayed recall performance) and potentially also in the context of ongoing and proposed preventive trials for cognitive decline or dementia targeting APOE4 carriers; our results suggest that paragraph delayed recall tests might be a more suitable end point for these studies (28). Even after excluding APOE, AD genetic risk loci were associated, in aggregate, with poorer delayed recall performance. This may suggest that, even in nondemented older adults, diminished performance in verbal declarative memory may be partly mediated by early preclinical neurodegenerative processes. This was further supported by the association of the memory genetic score with a larger burden of AD pathology, which suggests that, in combination, memory risk loci distinct from the known AD risk loci also contribute to AD pathology. However, taken individually, apart from APOE, none of the memory risk variants reaching genome-wide significance in the combined discovery and replication sample were known AD risk variants or were associated with AD pathology, indicating that other mechanisms may be modulating memory performance in older dementia-free individuals. We did not confirm previously reported associations with memory performance; however, previous studies were conducted mostly in young adults and did not focus exclusively on the delayed recall component of memory. The association of rs11074779 with RAVLT-dr was replicated and reached genome-wide significance in the combined analysis of European discovery and replication samples. Rs11074779 is located at 302 kilobase from HS3ST4, which is strongly expressed in the hippocampus and is thought to play a role in herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 pathogenesis (29); it is brain (herpes simplex encephalitis) preferentially affects the hippocampus and can result in profound memory loss. Further, Debette et al. Page 8 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAD-related plaques and tangles were shown to be enriched in HSV-1 binding proteins (30), and although controversial, a possible role of HSV-1 has been suggested in AD occurrence (31-33). The association of rs6813517 with CERAD-dr was significant in an African- American extension cohort and reached genome-wide significance in the combined analysis of discovery and extension samples. Rs6813517 is located at 367 kilobase from SPOCK3, encoding a member of a novel family of calcium-binding proteoglycan proteins, which is strongly expressed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Another variant near SPOCK3 (rs13111850, R2 = .003 with rs6813517) was recently found to be associated with variations in cytokine secretion in response to smallpox vaccine (34). Interestingly, an immune system dysfunction has been suggested in AD based on findings from recent AD GWAS and genome-wide pathway analyses ( 19,35-37). Functional prediction analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology suggest that HS3ST4 is implicated in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter receptor activity, while SPOCK3 appears to be involved in regulation of action potential in neurons, neurotransmitter uptake, and memory (http://genenetwork.nl). Two suggestive intergenic semaphorin 5A [SEMA5A]) reached nominal significance in the replication analysis. PCDH20 belongs to the subfamily of nonclustered protocadherins, which likely contribute to the establishment and remodeling of selective synaptic connections and to the maintenance and plasticity of adult hippocampal circuitry (38). SEMA5A belongs to the semaphorin family, which is involved in axonal guidance during neural development ( 39) and has been associated with autism (40). In the pathway analyses, a larger proportion of genes appeared to bind polyubiquitin C than predicted by chance, and several eQTL associations with genes involved in ubiquitin metabolism were observed. Converging evidence suggests a major role of impaired protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system in neurodegenerative disorders including AD (41,42). Ubiquitination was also demonstrated to facilitate hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory storage by modulating CPEB3 activity and CPEB3- dependent protein synthesis and synapse formation (43). Strengths and Limitations Strengths of this study include the large sample size and the diversity of populations studied. We provide a wide array of functional analyses including assessments of shared genetic variation with AD pathology and hippocampal gene expression analyses. The main limitation is the absence of replicated genome-wide significant findings in the discovery cohort apart from the APOE locus, despite the very large sample size and despite substantial heritability of verbal semantic memory delayed recall, with heritability estimates ranging between h2 = .30 and h2 = .52 (p < 1.20 \u00d7 104) in participating studies and in the literature (Section 11 in Supplement 1). Different tests have been performed across cohorts to quantify verbal memory performance: we attempted to harmonize tests by close examination of each test selected for inclusion and performed test-specific meta-analyses, although this implied smaller sample sizes, thereby reducing statistical power. This has likely reduced our ability to detect genetic associations and suggests that efforts should be made in the future to collectively define cognitive testing protocols across various large population-based samples. Age differences between discovery and follow-up studies may have reduced our Debette et al. Page 9 Biol Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptability to replicate findings; sensitivity analyses performed in the discovery cohorts on the top loci showed that associations were slightly strengthened when focusing on a more narrow age range (Table S16 in Supplement 1). The absence of association of our top loci with memory performance in the extension cohort of young adults, although we had relatively limited power for this analysis (Table S16 in Supplement 1), also supports that genetic risk loci for memory performance may differ according to age. The intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of mechanisms influencing memory performance is a major challenge in deciphering the genetics of human verbal memory (28). Cognitive tests are influenced by medication, anxiety, and mood, inducing variance in the verbal memory phenotype that is not attributable to genetic variation, possibly hampering power to detect genetic susceptibility variants for memory performance (44). Moreover, effect sizes for quantitative traits are often small and may require larger sample sizes to be detected. As our aim was to identify genetic variants associated with memory performance in older community persons and not to study genetic determinants of memory performance in a selected sample of cognitively high-functioning individuals, we did not exclude participants in the low range of cognitive performance who may have been categorized as having mild cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological test results. Conclusion and Implications In conclusion, in a large sample of older community-dwelling adults, the APOE locus was associated with weaker verbal memory performance, especially in those above age 65 years. Two additional genome-wide associations, near HS3ST4 and SPOCK3, were identified and other putative modulators of memory performance were revealed by a pathway approach and hippocampal gene expression analyses, warranting further exploration in independent cohorts. The differential associations according to memory test characteristics and age should be accounted for in future studies. Finally, exploring other types of genetic variation, including rare variants and epigenetic modifications, will be crucial to decipher the full spectrum of memory heritability.
