Refer to the BCCDC website for reporting guidelines.1 Events can be reported even when there is no certainty of a causal association. Refer to the Data Notes section at the end of this report for additional information on the source data. Summary The COVID -19 vaccines demonstrated safety in clinical trials prior to authorization for worldwide use.2-4 During post -marketing surveillance, larger numbers of individuals are vaccinated, and this allows for detection of rare events u ndetected in clinical trials. Among reports in BC, anaphylaxis and allergic events are the most frequently reported events following all of the COVID -19 vaccines. About half of the cases managed as anaphylaxis had lower level of diagnostic certainty and m ay reflect events such as anxiety or pre -syncopal (fainting) events managed as anaphylaxis out of an abundance of caution. In association with the mRNA vaccines, myocarditis and pericarditis were first recognized in Israel and the USA in young adults and adolescents, and have now also been seen in other countries including Canada and in BC reports.5-9 There have been six reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) reported in BC to date, of which 5 were associated with the adenovirus vector vaccines. This syndrome was identified in March 2021 in Europe in association with the AstraZeneca vaccine and also in the US with the Janssen vaccine, with a small number of cases accumulating in Canada associated with use of the adenovirus vector vaccin es. The rate of occurrence has been estimated at about 1 in 67,000 recipients following the first dose and 1 in 500,000 following the second dose.8,10,11 Background AEFIs are reportable by health care providers to the local medical health officer under the regulations of the Public Health Act. Detailed reporting guidelines are available in the BC Immunization Manual .12 When an AEFI report is received at a local public health unit, it is further reviewed and investigated, and then reported in the public health information system aligned with the immunization registry which contains the in formation about the vaccine(s) administered on a specific date. Recommendations for further assessment and future doses are made by the medical health officer or designated public health professional. Expected side effects such as pain, redness, and swelli ng at the injection site which are commonly observed with many vaccines are not reportable as AEFI unless these meet specific severity thresholds. Prepared on 2023 -01-05 2 AEFI reports are further investigated provincially with particular focus on serious AEFI and detection of po tential safety signals (e.g., clusters of events, event rates occurring at a higher than expected frequency compared to background rates, or rare events with previously unknown association with vaccination). Additionally, BC submits AEFI reports to the Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System where additional review and analy sis for potential safety signals is performed at the national level.13 The Public Health Agency of Canada also produces a weekly COVID -19 AEFI report .14 Definitions 1. Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) - Any untoward medical event following immunization that is temporally (i.e., occurs within a biologically plausible timeframe after receipt of vaccine) but not necessarily causally associated.15 2. Serious AEFI - For the purpos e of this report, a serious AEFI is one that resulted in hospitalization or a prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability/incapacity, or death. Key Findings As of December 31, 2022, there have been 14,013,312 COVID -19 vaccine doses administered i n BC and 6,101 COVID -19 AEFI reports (43.5 reports per 100,000 doses administered) 478 reports (7.8%) met the serious definition, for a rate of 3.4 per 100,000 doses administered The most frequently reported events were other allergic event, anaesthesia/pa raesthesia, and injection site pain/swelling/redness Other events have been less frequently reported and are detailed below Prepared on 2023 -01-05 3 . Summary of AEFI Reports Figure 1: Adverse event reports following receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine by week of vaccination, BC, Dec. 13, 2020 - Dec. 31, 2022 (N=6,101) COVID -19 vaccinations of British Columbians began the week of December 13, 2020, and up to and including December 31, 2022, a total of 14,013,312 doses have been administered. During this period, there have been 6,101 AEFI reports following a COVID -19 vaccine, for a reporting rate of 43.5 reports per 100,000 doses administered (Table 1). Reports are delayed beyond the week of vaccination because of time to onset that varies by event and associated time to receive, inves tigate and process a report for submission. Weekly report counts, especially for recent weeks, are expected to increase over time as these are submitted, but Figure 1 shows that reports have declined as the immunization campaign has progressed, even as the doses administered have continued to increase. This is because the AEFI reporting rates associated with second, third, and fourth doses of COVID -19 vaccines administered have been substantially lower than the rate associated with the first dose.

Summary of Reported Events A single AEFI report may contain one or more adverse events. Reported events are temporally associated with vaccination (i.e., occur after vaccination within a biologically plausible timeframe) but not necessarily causally associated. The 6,101 AEFI reports received up to December 31, 2022 contained a total of 7,769 adverse events for a ratio of 1.3 events per COVID -19 AEFI report. The most frequently reported events were other allergic events (e.g., allergic rash, hives, pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms), anaesthesia/paraesthesia, and events managed as anaphylaxis (Figure 2). Prepared on 2023 -01-05 6 Figure 2: Adverse events f ollowing receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine, British Columbia, Dec. 13, 2020 - Dec. 31, 2022 (N=7,769) Event Descriptions Four hundred sixty -four reports were received for events managed as anaphylaxis (i.e., the client received epinephrine for a suspected an aphylactic reaction). Of these, 255 (55%) met the Brighton Collaboration definition for anaphylaxis with diagnostic certainty levels of 1, 2, or 3.16 Many events managed as anaphylaxis have features more compatible with anxiety or vasovagal syncope/pre -syncopal (fainting) events. Seventy -five reports of cellulitis were received. Although most of these reports specified that antibiotics were provided, many appeared to represent a delayed onset local inflammatory reaction rather than cellulitis.17 None of these reports were confirmed by microbial testing , therefore none meet criteria for level 1 of the Brighton case definition . Four hundred seventy -eight reports (7.8%), including some of the events described above, were considered serious (refer to serious AEFI definition above). Of these, 448 individuals were admitted to hospi tal, including 2.8 % of cases reported as anaphylaxis. Prepared on 2023 -01-05 7 Two hundred and six reports contained a diagnosed neurological event. One hundred and twelve individuals experienced Bell's palsy within 30 days following COVID -19 vaccination. Six individuals were admitted to hospital and diagnosed with transverse myelitis, including one with a history of multiple sclerosis. An additional five individuals were reported as having transverse myelitis, however, one was unconfirmed by diagnostic imaging, one had a workup inconsistent with transverse myelitis, and another was referred to a speciali st for further investigation. Fifty -eight individuals were reported with seizures ( 19% of whom were hospitalized). Four individuals were admitted to hospital for an intracerebral hemorrhage, including one with encephalopathy. Six additional individuals dev eloped encephalitis or encephalopathy: one encephalitis was presumed to be viral in nature; one encephalopathy was attributed to a workplace toxin exposure; one individual with multiple chronic neurologic conditions developed encephalopathy presumed to be unrelated to the vaccine; two individuals with several comorbidities and encephalopathy made a spontaneous and full recovery within days, without a specific cause identified; one encephalitis was attributed to a new onset autoimmune condition diagnosed aft er receipt of vaccine. One individual was hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. There were fourteen reports for individuals hospitalized with Guillain -Barre Syndrome (GBS), now all discharged. Five of these reports followed AstraZeneca vaccine, six followed Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty, and three followed Moderna Spikevax. GBS cases following COVID -19 vaccines have been identified in Canada and internationally, but rarely.14,18,19 Death is reportable as an adverse event when it occurs within 30 days of vaccina tion and no other clear cause of death has been established.12 Readers will note that some of the reported deaths described below appear to have a clear cause of death unrelated to the vaccine. Death may also be recorded as the outcome of a specific report able event. Twenty serious AEFI reports were received f or individuals (median age: 78 years) who died within 30 days o f receiving a COVID -19 vaccine. For five of the deaths, vaccination was not considered to be a contributing factor by the health care pro vider who attended and investigated the death and considered th e individuals' medical history. One death occurred in a long term care resident following deterioration with reduction in oral intake, without a clear underl ying cause of death identified. In six individuals, death was the outcome of cardiac arrest. Four of these were elderly individuals with underlying medical conditions; one had cardiac risk factors and was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction, and one had severe coronary artery disease th at predated vaccine administration. Two deaths occurred in elderly individuals following a stroke and hospital admission. Both had previous history of stroke along with other medical conditions. One death occurred in an individual with metastatic cancer wh o had been hospitalized for complications of thrombo cytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Prepared on 2023 -01-05 8 One death occurred in an elderly individual who suffered from multiple serious comorbidities. Investigation revealed the death was due to natural causes unrelated to the vaccine, but occurring in temporal as sociation with vaccine receipt. One death occurred in an elderly individual with multiple comorbidities, whose health was declining before vaccine administration. One death occurred in an individual due to septic shock un related to the vaccine. Two deaths occurred in elderly individuals due to underlying cardiac compr omise unrelated to the vaccine. 'Other serious or unexpected' events: Some events may be reported as an \"other serious or unexpected\" event when these do not have their own discrete event on the provincial AEFI report form. These are outlined in this section; some of these events have been described above in the serious even ts section. Amongst these events, 190 were for various thrombotic/ thromboembolic conditions. These included 40 strokes ( 90% cerebral venous sinus deep vein thromboses, and nine superficial vein thromboses. None of these events met the TTS criteria as none were associated with new onset thrombocytopenia.10,11 One \"other serious\" report was received for an individual with capillary leak syndrome with onset five weeks after AstraZeneca vaccine. Capillary leak syndrome is a very rare condition now recognized as potentially associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. By June 2021 only six cases had been identified in Europe following over 78 m illion doses of AstraZeneca vaccine administered.20 Health Canada issued an advisory for this condition and its association with AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccines.21 There have been six non -fatal confirmed cases of TTS reported in BC to date, four of whom were adults aged 30 -49 and two were aged 60 -69 years. The first had onset four days after receipt of the AstraZeneca vaccine with a low platelet count found upon presentation for care, and a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The second case had abdominal sym ptoms that progressed the week after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, with a diagnosis of abdominal venous thrombus and thrombocytopenia. The third case also had symptoms develop in the week after AstraZeneca vaccine. Upon presentation to care, thrombocy topenia was detected. The individual was assessed for possible TTS, and identification of an abdominal venous thrombus was made in hospital. All three of these individuals followed the first dose of AstraZeneca and had a positive anti -platelet factor 4 ant ibody test. The fourth individual suffered a stroke a week after the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Thrombocytopenia was identified in hospital; the anti -platelet factor 4 antibody test was negative. The fifth individual met the Brighton Collabora tion criteria for TTS level 1 -H because they had received heparin; this case also tested negative for the anti -platelet factor 4 antibody test. The sixth individual had onset 10 days after receipt of Janssen vaccine with a diagnosis of portal vein thrombos is; TTS was confirmed with anti -platelet factor 4 antibody testing. Prepared on 2023 -01-05 9 Five serious AEFI reports in the 5 -11 year age group have been reported. The first was for a new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus in a child with a strong familial history of this condition. Diabetes mellitus has not been shown to be associated with COVID -19 vac cines. People with diabetes are encouraged to get vaccinated because they are at higher risk of developing more severe COVID - 19.22 The second was for hospitalization due to immune thrombocytopenia purpura in a child recovering from an illness compatible wi th a viral respiratory infection before vaccination. Their platelet counts recovered and they were discharged from hospital. The third was for hospitalization following myo/pericarditis; this child was discharged with full resolution of symptoms. The fourt h was for hospitalization following prolonged fever that coincided with a diagnosis of pneumonia; this child was treated and discharged. The fifth was a hospitalization for bloody stools that were attributed to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. One seri ous AEFI report in the 6 months to 5 years age group has been reported. This was for hospitalization following febrile seizures . The temporal relationship of the seizure was more in keeping with a viral illness that onset after vaccine receipt, rather than with vaccine receipt. This child was discharged home after full resolution . There have been 231 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis. Sixty -eight individuals were diagnosed with myocarditis, 106 with pericarditis, and 57 with myopericarditis. Ages ranged from 10 to 95 with a median of 35 years, and 153 (66%) were male. Ninety -seven had received Moderna Spikevax, 126 received Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty, one received Comirnaty Pediatric, and seven received AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/Verity COVISHI ELD. One hundred and five of these events occurred after a second dose (47 Moderna Spikevax, 56 Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty, 1 AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/Verity COVISHIELD). Twenty -one occurred after a third dose (16 Mod erna Spikevax and 5 Pfizer - BioNTech Comirnaty), and one occurred after a fourth dose of Moderna. Some had alternate explanations including rheumatic diseases, a genetic syndrome associated with cardiac disorders, or viral infection. Sixty (out of 68) of th e myocarditis cases met the diagnostic criteria for level 1, 2, or 3 of the Brighton Collaboration case definition. Forty -eight (out of 106) pericarditis cases met the diagnostic criteria for level 1, 2, or 3 of the Brighton Collaboration case definition. Twenty -five (out of 57) myopericarditis cases met the diagnostic criteria for level 1, 2, or 3 of the Brighton Collaboration case definition for both myocarditis and pericarditis.23 These conditions have been seen in association with the mRNA vaccines in several countries including the US and UK as well as in Canada, especially in adolescent and young adult males and with the 2nd dose.5-7,14,24 In previous reports (September 29, 2022 through November 24, 2022), this child was erroneously described in the 5 -11 year old age group instead of the 6 months to 5 years age group .

Only AEFIs reported and doses administered up to December 31, 2022 were included in this report. Any AEFI report with a status of \"Does not meet reporting criteria\" or \"Disregard - Entered in error\" was excluded. Delays exist between the time an AEFI occurs, is reported to public health, and is entered into Panorama. As AEFI investigations progress, there may be changes to the data, or reports ma y be removed from analysis if events upon review are deemed not reportable (e.g., expected local reaction). This may lead to some fluctuations in AEFI counts and rates in subsequent reporting periods. Prepared on 2023 -01-05 17 . References 1. BC Centre for Disease Control.
