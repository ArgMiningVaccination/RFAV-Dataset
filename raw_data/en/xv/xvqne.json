The skin can be a portal of entryfor fungal infection when the epithelial barrier is breached orit can be a site for disseminated, systemic fungal disease.Canine and feline skin and hair coats can be transiently con-taminated with a large variety of saprophytic fungi from theenvironment some of which can cause opportunistic infec-tions. 1,2 The diagnosis of a fungal infection must be made based on isolation of the organism from affected tissues andvisualization of tissue invasion by organisms with compatiblemorphology. 3 Actual mycologic pathogens of the skin can be divided based on what layers of the skin, hair coat or clawsthey infect. Supercial can also cause subcutaneous le-sions of the skin. This paper will review the etiology,prevalence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatmentfor the two most infection with one or more of the fungal species in the infect animals are divided into 3 or 4groups based on their natural habitat. Geophilic dermato-phytes are normally soil inhabitants. The most common geo-philic dermatophyte to infect dogs or cats is Microsporum gypseum. Zoophilic dermatophytes are adapted to living on animals and are rarely found in the soil. The most commonzoophilic dermatophyte to infect dogs and cats is . Sylvatic dermatophytes are zoophilic dermato- not infect hair shafts). 1,2 An- throphilic dermatophytes are adapted to living on humansand do not survive in the soil and can be a cause of reversezoonosis when dogs or cats acquire the infection from in-fected humans. T. tonsurans was the most commonly isolated dermatophyte from human patients in the United States inthe mid 1990s. 4 The most common fungal organisms identied in the dog or cat with dermatophytosis are M. canis ,M. gypseum , and T. mentagrophytes . These fungal organisms are adapted to colo- nize hair and the cornied layers of the skin where they candigest keratin protein for their nutrition. Most animals mustcontact a minimum infective dose of dermatophyte spores tohave an infection establish. This dose will vary with eachindividual animal's overall health status.

These predisposing factors include stress, poor nu- trition, debilitating disease, compromised immune status, oryoung age. 1 Prevalence Dermatophytosis is more common in cats than in dogs butthe reported prevalence in a population varies considerablywith geographic location, particularly between different con-tinents. Several studies have cited the prevalence of dermato-phytosis in dogs and cats, presenting to North Americanveterinary clinics for skin disease, to be 0.26 to 5.6%. 1 The reported prevalence of dermatophytosis is higher in areaswith a warm, humid climate. When healthy pet cats in NorthAmerica were microbiologically sampled the prevalence ofdermatophytosis was very rare. 5 North American studies in which shelter cats were similarly sampled (using a tooth-brush technique) found a higher prevalence of dermato-phytes within a shelter population of cats. Pathogenic der-matophytes were cultured in 5.5 to 19% of all shelter catsdepending on the geographical region. 6,7 M. canis , speci - cally, was found in 4 and 5% of cats but only in those geo-graphical areas with a humid and warm climate. Of particularnote is that 90 to 100% of the shelter cats that culturedpositive in these studies were lesion free. 6,7 Cats infected with FeLV or FIV did not have an increased incidence of isolationof M. canis compared with noninfected cats 8 in one study but immunosuppression is a risk factor for the development ofdermatophytosis. Cats positive for these retroviruses didhave more diverse fungal organisms isolated from their haircoats. 8 Persian and Himalayan cats and Yorkshire terriers appear to be predisposed to M. canis dermatophytosis.1 Clinical Dermatophytosis in dogs often results in localized lesionsmost commonly on the face, feet, or tail. Dogs are more likelyto present with the classical circular alopecia with scale andcrust and follicular papules and pustules (Fig. 1). T. menta- grophytes infection often results in much more dramatic clin- ical scaling, crusting and even scarring (Fig. 2). A kerion is alocalized inflammatory lesion that results from the host's in-flammatory response a It nodular lesion of furunculosis drainingstulae or a distal extremity. M. gypseum and T. mentagrophytes are the most common organisms to result in kerions. 1 Dermatophytosis lesions in cats are more pleomorphic. Classic lesions include one or more areas of partial alopeciawith scaling and crusting most commonly on the head orforelimbs. Lesions may be hyperpigmented. 2,9 Dermatophyt - osis can also result in lesions that resemble miliary dermatitisor focal, pruritic lesions that resemble eosinophilicplaques. 1,9 Long haired cats may present with a complaint of a poor hair coat or excessive shedding as infected hairs areprone to breakage. 9 Kerions are uncommon in cats but Per - sian and Himalayan cats can develop subcutaneous nodularlesions caused by dermatophyes called These lesions are often exudative ordraining and coalescing nodules (Fig. 3). Visible tissue grainsmay be associated with these lesions. Systemic lesions ofdermatophytic pseudomycetomas have also been reported ina Persian cat. 10 Diagnosis Dermatophytosis in dogs and cats is common but is oftenmisdiagnosed, particularly in dogs. Occasionally the diagno-sis is never considered but more frequently animals are in-correctly given the presumptive diagnosis based solely on theappearance of visible, circular skin lesions. This can result insome animals receiving unnecessary therapy with antifungaldrugs. This is concerning when the drugs being prescribedare expensive or capable of causing serious side effects andwhen the misdiagnosis results in delays in determining theactual cause of the animal's skin lesions. The clinical appearance of skin lesions is unreliable as the sole criteria to diagnose dermatophytosis. A Wood's lampexamination can be helpful in some cases but it is also not a Figure 1 Multifocal, well demarcated areas of alopecia because of M. canis dermatophytosis in a terrier cross dog. Scaling and follicular papules are present along the lesional borders. (Color version of gure is available online.) Figure 2 Dermatophytosis caused by T. mentagrophytes . There is marked alopecia, erythema, scaling, and crusting involving the headand extremities. Scarring is also evident. The dog had been treatedwith systemic glucocorticoids before the diagnosis of dermatophyt-osis with resultant temporal muscle atrophy. (Color version of g-ure is available online.)Mycologic disorders of the skin 129reliable as the sole criteria for diagnosing dermatophytosis. If true positive, apple green, fluorescence tracking along the hair shaft is documented on a Wood's lamp examination theninfection with M. canis is likely. However only 50% of M. canis infections will fluoresce and most other dermatophyte species affecting dogs and cats do not fluoresce. A negativeWood's lamp examination does not rule out dermatophyto-sis. False positive results can occur if sebum or topical oint-ments are present and the \"glow\" produced from them ismisinterpreted as positive fluorescence from M. canis . Micro- scopic examination of hairs plucked from a suspected patientcan be visualized for evidence of fungal hyphae or spores.This is facilitated by the addition of a clearing agent, either10% potassium hydroxide KOH or chlorphenolac, to the hairsample. However, this is also not a reliable method to screenfor dermatophytosis as false negative results will result ifunaffected hairs are examined. Dermatophytosis can be diag-nosed via a skin biopsy but fungal culture is a more sensitivediagnostic tool. Histopathology may demonstrate the pres-ence of spores and hyphae within intrafollicular hair shaftswith variable amounts of follicular inflammation. A periodicacid-Schiff stain will highlight dermatophytes a magentacolor. Biopsy samples of skin or claws are very useful indiagnosing kerions, pseudomycetomas and fungal paro-nychia as obtaining a positive culture of the organism is moredifcult in these infections because of the limited numbers oforganisms. 1,9 The denitive diagnosis of dermatophytosis is made via culture and identication of the organism. Culture samplescan be obtained from hairs plucked from suspicious lesionsseen clinically or with a Wood's lamp. A sterile toothbrushcan be used to sample lesions or the entire suspect animal'shair coat. Dermatophyte test medium (DTM) or Sabouraud'sdextrose agar are the most commonly used culture media. Toevaluate for the growth of a dermatophyte versus a sapro-phytic fungus the following key points should be considered:1. Dermatophyte colonies are white or off-white in color but never brown, green or mixed colors 2. DTM will turn red when the colony is rst visible. If the color change occurs several days after visible colony growth it is more likely to be a saprophytic fungus 3. All suspicious colonies should be conrmed as a par- ticular species via microscopic evaluation. Using clearacetate tape fungal elements can be harvested by touch-ing the top of the colony with the tape and examiningthe macroconidia under a microscope. Culture samples should be incubated at 24 to 27\u00b0C as a recent study suggest that incubation at room temperaturemay result in false negative culture results. 11 Treatment Most healthy animals will resolve their dermatophyte infec-tion within 3 months without treatment. This occurs as theinfected hairs enter the telogen phase or as an inflammatoryresponse against the fungal organism develops in the animal.However, dermatophytosis is a highly contagious and zoo-notic disease and affected animals should be treated particu-larly in multiple animal households or in homes with youngchildren or with immunocompromised or geriatric individ-uals. One of the challenges in treating feline dermatophytosisis the fact that some cats can be chronic carriers with subclin-ical yet active disease that results in the production of fungalspores and environmental contamination. Many uninfectedanimals can transiently carry infective spores yet have no Figure 4 The exacerbation of dermatophytosis on a cat's ventral abdomen after hair was shaved for an ovariohysterectomy. The cat had no lesions at the time of surgery but by the time of sutureremoval multifocal, coalescing, erythematous papules, and plaqueswith scaling of skin biopsies and fun-gal culture conrmed infection with M. canis .

There are yellow granular tissue grains evident onthe surface of some lesions.130 C.A. Outerbridgeactive infection so these animals act only as fomites. Der- matophytosis can be both frustrating and challenging tomanage, particularly if the infection involves a population ofanimals since some infected cats may have no clinical lesionsand the clinical lesions in affected cats are variable. If there isa lot of movement of a population of animals within thepremises (eg, an animal shelter environment) the extent ofenvironmental contamination and the possibility of widertransmission increases. The systemic medications that areused to treat dermatophytosis can be expensive and the ani-mal may require monitoring with laboratory tests to evaluatefor adverse side effects. Animals that are housed in groups notonly increase the risk of possible transmission but also in-crease the overall expense of therapy as all contact animalswill need to be treated if dermatophytosis is diagnosed. It isdifcult to have one single recommended therapeutic strat-egy for treating dermatophytosis as the situations may varywidely. General principles should be established. The follow-ing strategies should be employed whenever possible in treat-ing dermatophytosis. 1. Examine and culture all contact animals.2. Systemic therapy for all animals with positive cultures (infected) and topical therapy with lime sulfur of allinfected or contact animals. 3. Environmental decontamination. Topical therapy has long been advocated for the treatment of dermatophytosis. However numerous studies have shown that topical therapies alone are not as effective as systemictherapy. 12 The most important benet from topical therapy is to kill infective spores on the cat or dog and limit spread ofthis material into the environment. There have been severalstudies evaluating the efcacy of various topical therapiesand lime sulfur and enilconazole are the two most effectiveantifungal topical therapies and should be applied twiceweekly. 1,9,12 Chlorhexidene alone and povidone iodine are ineffective against infective spores and hairs and are nolonger recommended for use. 9 Topical therapy should be used, whenever permissible, in conjunction with systemictherapy. Clipping the entire hair coat has been advocated in treating dermatophytosis. Clipping will remove infective material andmake topical therapy easier. However, the clipped hair if nothandled appropriately can worsen environmental contami-nation. Animals can have lesions spread and worsen, ifclipped too closely (Fig. 4). The usefulness of clipping maydepend on individual situations; long haired animals shouldbe clipped and all cats in an affected Persian cattery should beclipped. Systemic antifungal therapy has been shown to decrease both the duration and severity of feline dermatophytosis. 1,9,12 Systemic therapy is of most benet to treat the clinical signsin an individual cat or dog. It will not contain the contagiousspread of dermatophytosis within a group of animals; othermanagement practices are also needed. Griseofulvin, itracon-azole, and terbinane are all effective systemic antifungaltherapies for dermatophytosis. 9 Griseofulvin is fungistatic oral drug that interferes with nucleic acid synthesis and withspindle microtubules in the metaphase of mitosis. 1,9,12 ultramicrosize (5-10 mg/kg q 24 hours in divided treat-ments) and the dose depends on the formulation being used.The drug needs to be administered with food to enhanceabsorption. There are a number of possible adverse side ef-fects with this drug. Vomiting, diminished appetite, and di-arrhea are the most common adverse effects seen with theadministration of griseofulvin. It is a known teratogen andshould never be given to pregnant animals and it is recom-mended that its use be avoided in breeding males. Myelosup-pression is not common but is a known side effect and pa-tients should have complete blood cell counts performed tomonitor for leukopenia. This side effect is more common tooccur in FIV positive cats, so retroviral status should bechecked before initiating therapy with griseofulvin. Ketoconazole is an imidazole that inhibits ergosterol syn- thesis in the fungal cell wall affecting the permeability of thefungal cell wall. It is not used typically to treat feline M. canis infections as up to 25% of systemically treated cats developedadverse side effects; diminished appetite, vomiting, diarrhea,and hepatotoxicity. 12 Ketoconazole can be used to treat dogs with dermatophytosis at a dose of 10 mg/kg orally once perday. 1 Itraconazole is a triazole antifungal that inhibits ergos - terol synthesis. It can be used in both dogs and cats to treatdermatophytosis at a dose of 10 mg/kg once orally per day. Itis now considered the drug of choice for treating feline der-matophytosis as adverse reactions are uncommon and in ex-perimental models it is equal or superior to griseofulvin. 13,14 However, the expense of itraconazole can be prohibitive.There are now a number of protocols that utilize the medi-cation in a pulse or cycle fashion. 9 Fluconazole is an oral, water soluble triazole that has been used to treat a variety offungal infections including dermatophytosis. A generic ofthis drug is now available and it is likely that there will befuture clinical trials treating dermatophytosis with this drug.Terbinane is allylamine antifungal that interferes with er-gosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squaleneepoxidase and has specic activity against dermatophytes. Ithas been used in both cats and dogs at dosages of 30 to 40mg/kg per day. Terbinane is well tolerated by both dogs andcats. It may be possible to administer this medication in apulse or cycle therapy fashion. 9,14 Lufenuron is a benzoylphe - nylurea drug that is used as a flea control product as it dis-rupts chitin synthesis in the insect. As chitin is a componentof the fungal cell wall it has been proposed as a systemictherapy for dermatophytosis, A retrospective study proposedthat lufenuron was protective against dermatophytosis andthe same investigators reported successful therapeutic re-sponse with this drug. 15 There is conflicting evidence in the literature as to how efcacious this therapy actually is. Recentscientic studies suggest that pretreatment with lufenuronbefore either experimental or natural exposure to M. canis was not protective. 16,17 Lufenuron is an extremely safe, well- tolerated drug. The current recommended dose is 100 to 120mg/kg to be administered with food. In the original reportaffected animals received a single dose. However, as lufenu-ron has failed to resolve all cases of dermatophytosis, morefrequent dosing intervals have been proposed. The most ef-fective dosing regime and assessment of the true efcacy ofthis medication for treating dermatophytosis is still in ques-tion and it is not recommended as a therapy for dermatophyt-osis. 9,14 Topical and systemic therapy should be continued untilMycologic disorders of the skin 131serial negative cultures have been obtained. The rst culture should be obtained 4 weeks after initiating therapy and 2negative cultures: 2 weeks apart for individual cat house-holds or 3 negative cultures 2 weeks apart are desirable inmultiple cat house holds. 14 If cultures can not be performed then treatment should be continued for 2 to 4 weeks after resolution of all clinical signs. Typically treatment is often for6 to 10 weeks. Environmental decontamination is very important in pre- venting spread of infection to other animals or re-infection.However, environmental decontamination is extremely dif-cult, if not impossible, to accomplish in some environments.It should be assumed that environmental contamination withM. canis spores is widespread and that uninfected cats may transport spores on their hair coats. The best agents for dis-infection continue to be debated. Studies have evaluated theefcacy of many antifungal disinfectants. When contami-nated surfaces were cultured after a single application of adisinfectant only undiluted bleach (100% elimination), a1:10 dilution of bleach (22% elimination) and enilconazole(33% elimination) had efcacy with a one time surface appli-cation. 18 An environment with infected cats within it will need to be treated repetitively as the cats will continue to shedinfective hair and spores. Furnace lters, fabric pet beds, andblankets should be replaced or discarded. The environmentcan also be problematic to disinfect if there is lots of fabric orcarpet used to cover surfaces. Carpets and furniture can besteam cleaned and this will decrease but not eliminate allspores. There are commercial dermatophyte vaccines for cats, cat- tle, and foxes. In cats they have not shown the same efcacyas in cattle. There is no evidence that the feline vaccine offersany protection against dermatophytosis. In clinical trials, catsgiven the vaccine had a decrease in the size of their lesions butdid not resolve their infection any sooner than unvaccinatedcats. 9,13 Malassezia Dermatitis Etiology The genus Malassezia is known to include six lipid dependent species ( M. furfur ,M. symbodialis ,M. slooae ,M. globusa ,M. obtusa ,M. restricta ) and one lipid independent species M. pachydermatitis .19,20 There have also been recent reports of three new lipid dependent species which include M. equi ,M. dermatis , and M. nana .21 Malassezia species are identied based on differences in their morphologic, ultrastructuraland molecular characteristics along with colony appearanceand biochemical properties. 20 M. pachydermatis is a normal commensal inhabitant of the skin and external ear canal indogs and cats. In dogs the lipid dependent species M. furfur and M. sympodialis have also been isolated. 20 In cats the lipid dependent species M. symbodialis ,M. globusa ,M. furfur , and M. nana have also been identied.19,21 Malassezia organisms may cause dermatitis as a result of inflammatory or hyper-sensitivity reactions by the host animal to yeast antigens orproducts. Most dogs with Malassezia dermatitis have concur- rent with allergic dermatitis often haveincreased numbers of Malassezia colonizing their skin and when treated appropriately with antifungal therapies boththe overall appearance of the skin and the level of pruritus will improve. The diagnosis of generalized Malassezia infec- tion in a cat is strongly linked to concurrent, serious, systemicdisease: diabetes mellitus, positive Malassezia is a commensal organism that has been isolated from the skin, ear canals, anal sacs and mucosal surfaces ofhealthy dogs and cats. 19 It becomes a pathogen when there are sufcient predisposing factors existing for a particularanimal. Most predisposing factors alter either the cutaneousmicroenvironment or the host animal's immune system. In-creased humidity in the cutaneous microenvironment pro-motes yeast growth and offers an explanation for the preva-lence of Malassezia dermatitis in ear canals and intertriginousareas. 19 Malassezia dermatitis is also more common in warm, humid climates and times of the year.21 Disturbances in the amount or composition of surface lipids in the skin can alsopromote yeast growth. These alterations in lipid can occur inresponse to hormonal changes, cornication disturbances,nutritional disturbances, and the presence of bacteriallipases. 19,21 The epidermal barrier is an important component of an animal's innate immune system. The cellular and lipidstructure of the stratum corneum protects the skin from in-fection. If this barrier is disrupted then secondary bacterialand yeast infections can occur. There are a large number ofcutaneous and systemic diseases that can compromise theintegrity of this barrier function. Allergic dermatitis and ec-toparasitic diseases are very common predisposing causes externa as they resultant flammation and pruritus with self trauma disturbing the nor-mal epithelial barrier. Endocrinopthies and metabolic dis-eases alter surface immune responsespredisposing to secondary Malassezia infections. Malassezia dermatitis is much more common in dogs than in Cer-tain breeds appear predisposed. Normal basset pachydermatitis than other breeds of dogs. 21 Other breeds with apparent predisposition include West Highland white terriers, cocker spaniels, dachs-hunds, Shih Tzus, and English setters. 19,21 The administration of antibiotics has been documented to promote Candida fungal overgrowth in humans but the evi- dence for secondary Malassezia overgrowth in dogs receiving antibiotics is lacking.19 Clinical Skin lesions resulting from Malassezia dermatitis may be lo- calized or generalized. Localized lesions most commonly in-volve the external ear canal, interdigital skin, ventral surface is oftengreasy or exudative and affected dogs may have a malodor-ous, musty smell. Chronic lesions are often thickened, li-chenied, and hyperpigmented with a halo of erythema (Fig.5). Lesions are variably pruritic. It is likely that those individ-uals with intense pruritus associated with their Malassezia dermatitis may have a di- agnosed based on cytologic documentation of increased numbers of the yeast organisms. Cytologic samples can beobtained from performing supercial skin scrapings, directlyplacing a glass slide onto lesional skin, rubbing a cotton swabon the skin surface of interest or repetitively pressing clearacetate tape to lesional skin (tape stripping). Each methodhas advantages and disadvantages based on the ease of sam-pling a given area with a given technique. Clear acetate tapeimpressions are often the most versatile as they can accessdifcult areas (between toes or around eyes) and are equallyeffective for moist and dry lesions. Cotton swabs are bestused for obtaining cytologic samples from ear canals. Cyto-logic samples are placed on a glass slide, heat xed andstained (Diff-Quick or methylene blue). Acetate tape prepa-rations are not heat xed and are stained only with the purplestain from the Diff Quick or methylene blue and applied to aglass slide sticky side down. Slides are examined under oilimmersion (1000 /H11003magnication) looking for the presence of round to oval, monopolar budding yeasts often adhering tokeratinocytes. 1,21 A small number of organisms may be iden - tied in cytological samples from normal animals. The num-ber of organisms that must be present to be pathogenic is notwell dened and the nding of one yeast organism per oilimmersion eld in the animal with compatible clinical signsshould be considered signicant. 21 Malassezia organisms can be cultured but as they are normal commensal organismsinterpreting a positive culture must be made in context withclinical signs and history. Culturing is rarely indicated asorganisms if present should be visualized on cytology.Malassezia organisms can be seen on histopathology of skin biopsies. The organisms are typically visualized within thestratum corneum and/or the follicular infundibulum. 19 The stratum corneum is often disturbed or lost during processingof a skin biopsy and consequently histopathology is not asensitive test for diagnosing Malassezia dermatitis. Treatment Treatment for Malassezia dermatitis involves the use of topi- cal therapy with or without concurrent systemic therapy.Topical therapies that can be used ceptible to topical azoles. There are numerous commercialshampoos, leave-on lotions, sprays, and wipes that utilize theabove listed topical agents. In chronic or generalized casessystemic therapy with one of the azole antifungals may benecessary. Ketoconazole is administered at 5 to 10 mg/kgorally once every 24 hours for 3 to 4 weeks. 19Itraconazole has been reported to be equally effective at 5 mg/kg onceorally every 24 hours for 21 days compared with 5 mg/kgorally per day for 2 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks. 23 Fluconazole has activity against Malassezia in humans. With the availability of generic fluconazole, treatment for Malasse- ziawith this drug in dogs and cats is likely to become com- mon. Griseofulvin has no activity against Malassezia . Identi- cation of underlying predisposing factors should also bepursued whenever appropriate to diminish recurrence of in-fection. If relapses are common or predisposing factors can-not be controlled, routine topical therapy or pulse oral med-ications may be utilized. 1,21 Conclusion Dermatophytosis and Malassezia dermatitis are the most common cutaneous fungal infections in dogs and cats. Bothinfections can occur in association with other skin diseasessuch as allergic dermatitis or cornication disturbances. Theycan also occur in association with underlying systemic dis-ease such as endocrine disorders or neoplasia. Diagnosis isbased on compatible clinical signs and demonstration of theorganism on fungal culture, histopathology, or cytology.Both topical and systemic therapy are utilized in the manage-ment of these cutaneous fungal infections typically with goodsuccess provided predisposing factors are identied and fordermatophytosis that the environment is not a source of re-infection.
