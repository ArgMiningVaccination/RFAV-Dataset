Many homeopathic allergy medications are marketed to be natural, safe, and effective. Some individuals with allergic rhinitis may elect to use homeopathic medications for the treatment and management of their symptoms because of the possible adverse effects associated with traditional allergy medications or due to contraindications associated with certain medical conditions. According to the National Center for Homeopathy, the treatment of allergies with homeopathic medications has been researched extensively, and studies have proved them to be very effective.1 Many homeopathic allergy medications are marketed to be natural, safe, and effective without causing drowsiness or other adverse effects.1,2 Research suggests that homeopathic treatment for allergies may be ideal because this type of therapy acts as an immunoregulator or immunomodulator, possibly regulating or reviving the immune system.2 In some cases, clinicians may recommend the combination of homeopathic medication with other prescription or nonprescription medications when warranted.1 Results of clinical studies show that steroids is the only class of drugs that can interfere with the pharmacologic effects of homeopathic treatment.2 Patients currently using steroid medications, including oral, topical, and inhaled, should always discuss this issue with the primary health care provider prior to using homeopathic medications.2 A host of homeopathic allergy preparations are on the market.

According to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, it is important for patients to discuss the most effective treatment for their allergies with their primary care providers, even when considering the use of homeopathic medications. Pharmacists should remind patients to seek medical care from their primary health care provider if their symptoms do not improve, if they worsen, or if adverse reactions occur.
