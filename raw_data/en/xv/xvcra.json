An all-new episode is coming tomorrow. Taking a vow of silence: biohacking the mind and relationships by shutting my mouth. Taking a vow of silence is something that monks and religious figures usually are seen doing, though I decided to take on the challenge by not speaking for 7 days. I was first introduced to the concept of not speaking for long periods of time via my partner Sorelle, who has to date completed two Vipassana silent 10-day meditations. I haven't as yet taken the plunge, though the idea of not speaking for a prolonged period of time had always interested me. Recently in Los Angeles, my friend Sunny gave me some insight into his own Vipassana experience, and I was inspired by him to see what would come out of my own journey of not speaking for a while. So within days, I'd shut my mouth, and decided to keep it closed for an entire week. Although I can't scientifically quantify any data points or quantifiable benefits, I am sharing in this episode some insights into what I learned during my interactions with humans as I took this biohacker's vow of silence, how it's changed me since, and lessons I've taken into my own life. Do I recommend you take your own vow of silence? Well, not necessarily, as you'll learn in this episode. ---------- CONNECT Connect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won't find anywhere your biohacking skills to the next level?

Although there were no sources, the soundbite suggested that if you ate an orange today, you'd need to eat eight of them to get the same nutrition as an orange your grandmother or grandfather ate. I figured there would be a lot of truth in this. Due to the fact that food today is grown so much faster, and generally picked when not completely ripe, as well as in many cases eaten several weeks after picking, it makes sense that we're probably not getting as much nutrient value as the food we ate a few generations ago. However, I wanted to know for sure exactly how much less vitamins, minerals, and nutrient value I'm getting today, when compared to a carrot or lettuce that my Oma may have eaten when she was a girl. And so, for my benefit and that of your ears as well, I decided to dig up some stats. In this episode of Bio Alchemy: The Daily Biohacking Podcast, I go into some statistics of how deficient our modern food supply is when compared to a generation or two ago. And trust me, the data ain't good. You don't have to be a biohacker to care about the nutrient content in your food. After all, we all eat food, and so we should all care about how nourishing it is to the human body. Despite all the doom-and-gloom you may hear about in this episode, it's not all bad news. Fortunately, I'm also sharing three simple tactics on how we can all boost the nutrient content of our food for better overall health. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Even if it was only to hear how many times I blabbed about the fact that I live in Iceland. ---------- CONNECT Connect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won't find anywhere your biohacking skills to the next level?

But let's face it, most of the time the health claims around juicing are more often than not seriously inflated. But not in the case of the biohacking juice that I'm talking about in today's episode. The topic of which, is beetroot juice. I've been taking a shot or two of beet juice almost every day for a while now, and sometimes as a pre-workout. It's all down to the way that beet juice has been shown to scientifically boost our body's production of nitric oxide, which can massively help our brain, muscles, and lungs perform. For me, it's usually taken in the morning. The biggest parts of my routine in a day as a biohacker are the things I do in the morning, and beet juice fits in here as a way of getting my brain firing as best it can. But, on today's episode of Bio Alchemy: The Spiritual Biohacking Podcast, I'm also covering how it may help with our sexual performance. And although boners are one thing it can help guys with, the ladies among us aren't being left out either. I will admit that some of the information discussed in this episode is purely anecdotal, but at this point there's so much evidence around beet juice as a biohacking tool, that it's hard to ignore. But in saying that, there's also a lot in the way of beet juice that's backed by science, which I'll talk about also. ---------- CONNECT Connect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won't find anywhere your biohacking skills to the next level?

Well, that whole health myth may not be as scary as you might think. As a biohacker, I'm always critical when I hear old wive's tales, or seemingly hearsay about health. I mean, questioning this stuff is one of the fundamental basics of what I do here when creating episodes for Bio Alchemy: The Spiritual Biohacking Podcast. Recently, I posted on Instagram a recipe for a protein smoothie, that I drink most days. Although some of the particulars of the biohack ingredients I put in it change, one thing is almost constant: that I put a raw egg in my smoothie. This prompted a response from one of my followers as to whether I was scared of contracting or dying of salmonella, because of the risk of the bacteria in a raw egg. And although I knew the risk was extremely low, I decided to track down exactly how low, by digging up the statistics of exactly how risky it was. This episode will show you how risky (or not risky) it actually is to eat a raw egg when it comes to salmonella. And the hint is, you'd have to eat raw eggs for a VERY long time, in order to guarantee your death from one. But more importantly, this is another episode that focuses on the fact that you shouldn't always believe what you hear. Or in fact, you shouldn't be scared of what you hear, just because you've heard it a ton of times. So raw eggs: will I continue to put them in my smoothies as a way to biohack my health? Yeah, probably. ---------- CONNECT Connect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won't find anywhere your biohacking skills to the next level?

This is a pretty big milestone for me. Although we would have reached the centenary of episodes much sooner id I'd continued to publish at the original pace I wanted to, unfortunately that's not always the way it happens. But as with all things, everything happens as it should. In this very special episode, I want to share with you all a very special story. And that is, the story of how I biohacked my consciousness with the most profound spiritual experience of my life. And that experience was my first ever meeting with DMT. DMT is something that's been used by our human ancestral cultures as a spiritual tool for millennia. In fact, although we know it has been used via many plants such as ayahuasca, we don't know how far back this stretches into human history. The earliest record of human psychedelic use dates back to 12,000 years ago, via rock paintings in my home country of Australia. And my own personal psychedelic use stretches back over 20 years, which definitely isn't as long. Although I've had some transformative experiences in my life as a spiritual biohacker with psilocybin, LSD, and other compounds, nothing could have prepared me with what DMT would show me. Mind blowing is an understatement, and one I've tried to express the best I can in this episode. This episode was written as a story. So I could best describe the experience, and how much DMT impacted me the first time it came into my life, I wrote this episode down, and recited it so it would sound the way I needed it to. Although with many of my episodes I'm reciting from memory to sound more organic, I thought this episode needed something more. It needed the accuracy and poetry I feel when I recall this experience in my mind. Biohacking is my passion, but uncovering human spirituality is even moreso. And for that reason, I hope you enjoy this very special episode 100.

Yeah, yeah, I know my biohacking podcast has been away for a while, though I always knew it'd come back at the right time. Not to sound too much like a hippie, though the Universe always guides us towards the things that we should be doing, and after a bit of a long hiatus, I knew it was time to return. Today, I'm dropping two episodes of Bio Alchemy: The Spiritual Biohacking podcast. Today's episode is episode 99, where I'm going to be talking about how you can biohack your body's natural innate immune system using the phenomenal Reishi mushroom - sometimes called, the \"Mushroom Of Immortality\". And later today, around an hour after this episode drops, I'll be sharing with you my 100th episode of the daily biohacking podcast, which is a very special one indeed. Anyway, as I mentioned, today's episode is all about the reishi mushroom, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, and is a tool that modern medical science is starting to back up for its hepatoprotective, immune-modulating, and potentially even cancer-fighting properties. Many of which, I'm going to discuss in this episode. I've been taking reishi myself as a biohacker for the best part fo four years (I usually buy my extract from RealMushrooms.com), however recently I started to cultivate my own reishi, and harvested my very first batch only a few days ago. Biohackers and other people alike were so intrigued by the information I put up on my Instagram story, that I figured it definitely warranted a full episode on the topic. Anyway, I'm stoked to be back. I hope you enjoy this episode of Bio Alchemy, and check out the other episode I'm about to post for the special 100 celebration. Much love to all of you. Always.
