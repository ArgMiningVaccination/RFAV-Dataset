In this article, we'll explore what holistic healing is and why it works so well. The term \"holistic\" means \"whole,\" and holistic healing is based on the idea that the body is a complete system, and any part of it needs to be treated in order for the entire system to function properly. What Is Holistic Healing? Holistic healing is a type of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that emphasizes the importance of taking care of the whole person. It's also known as integrative medicine because it combines conventional medical treatments with other therapies such as herbs, nutrition, exercise, meditation, massage, and more. In addition to being a form of alternative medicine, holistic healing has been used for centuries to treat various ailments. For example, Chinese herbalists use acupuncture to help patients recover from illness, while Native Americans use herbs to heal wounds. Today, many people may turn to a holistic healing center because conventional medical treatments often leave them feeling worse than before they started treatment. Why Does Holistic Healing Work So Well? Holistic healing has been practiced by people throughout history. Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, was a proponent of holistic healing. He believed that the body was made up of four elements\u2014air, fire, water, and earth\u2014and that these elements needed to be balanced in order to maintain good health. These ideas have progressed into more clinical modalities as of the present day! In addition to being a natural form of treatment, holistic healing has been proven to work better than conventional medicine in many cases. For example, research shows that people who use alternative treatments tend to recover from illness faster than those who rely solely on medical care. What Are Some Conditions That Can Be Treated with Holistically? Holistic healing is based on the idea that our bodies are interconnected and that when one part of the body is out of balance, other parts will also suffer. This means that if you're suffering from headaches, back pain, or stomach issues, there's a chance that you might also be dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression. It's become increasingly popular in recent years. In fact, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), there were [nearly 1 million visits to complementary health care practitioners in 2010 alone](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name). And while many people use alternative medicine to treat minor ailments such as colds and headaches, some people turn to holistic healing for serious conditions such as cancer.
