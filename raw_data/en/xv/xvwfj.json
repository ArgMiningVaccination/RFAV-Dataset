Energy healing is the practice of aligning our lifeforce, also known as chi, prana, or ki around the world. It's a safe and gentle process of clearing stagnant energies from our physical, mental, emotional and subtle bodies. Overtime, we block the flow of energy with our experiences, limiting beliefs, and feelings such as shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, and distrust. Based on our energy field, we manifest health, relationships, prosperity or the lack thereof. Energy healings are opportunities for deep restoration on every level. We create a sacred space to witness yourself without judgement and with compassion. We examine the root cause of illness and suffering. Our cells, tissues, and organs can harbor thoughts and emotions that lead to illness. Energy healing and meditation create the perfect mental and emotional environment for physical healing. The relaxation response activates our body's innate healing capabilities. The body finds equilibrium and we discover our wholeness. We discover our power in every situation. We release chords of attachment to the past. We heal trauma, memories, and energetic disturbances that hold us back. We discover the power of our intentions. In energy healing, we get clear on what it is that we want to call into our life, so that we can live deliberately and mindfully.
