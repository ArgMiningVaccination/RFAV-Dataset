This system is still evolving today and comes in several forms, depending on the types of healthcare you need. For a multifaceted condition like [back pain](https://www.eihmd.com/chiropractic-care/back-pain-relief/), it's wise to choose a practice that offers an integrative chiropractic approach. This means having access to a team of primary care physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists and other medical professionals who work together to find a solution for you. Here are the reasons why this is so beneficial. Patient-Centered Focus An integrated practice prevents patients from falling through the cracks or experiencing delays in care. No matter how severe your condition is or what other treatments you've tried, an integrated practice can pick you up and offer multiple viewpoints from physicians who specialize in different areas. More Knowledgeable Healthcare Team When practitioners of different specialties collaborate, they tend to develop a higher level of competence and experience than doctors who operate out of an independent office. Being held accountable by other doctors who depend on them for high-quality referrals also keeps them on their toes in an ever-changing healthcare landscape. This is always good news for patients, especially if you're struggling with a chronic ailment that other doctors have failed to remedy in the past. Coordinated Efforts Instead of visiting independent medical practices for a piecemeal approach to healthcare, choose a chiropractic integrative practice where your treatments are delivered in a coordinated, cost-effective way. When all your providers are on the same page about what care you have received, you prevent unnecessary testing, avoid conflicting treatments, reduce prescription painkillers, minimize errors and ultimately receive the best, most complete care possible. Enhanced Outcome The ability to seek various treatments from a range of co-located specialists avoids the need to jump from provider to provider with little consistency or communication between them. An integrated approach to back pain - which may include and other treatments - is likely to enhance the outcome. The providers who participate in an integrative practice draw from centralized information and coordinated referrals. Not only does this decrease the complexity of your treatment and keep your healthcare costs in check, but it increases the chance of overcoming your back pain or other ailments so you can return to full health.
