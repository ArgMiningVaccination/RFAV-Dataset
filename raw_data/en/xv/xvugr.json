What is Traditional Chinese Medicine? Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focuses on creating whole-body health using an integrated approach and remedying imbalanced Qi, [the vital life force of the body](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/chinese-medicine), flowing through 12 meridians, or channels, in the body. Each channel corresponds to a different organ, and [TCM healing modalities can address Qi imbalances](http://www.shenmedicine.com/acupuncture/) that cause disease and illness. The practice of TCM is rooted in the concept that our bodies are capable of self-healing, like how nature is regenerative, and we are intimately connected to nature and its elements. All the healing modalities of Chinese Medicine tie back to the framework of the [Five Element Theory](https://www.tcmworld.org/what-is-tcm/five-elements/), which \"organizes all natural phenomena into five master groups or patterns in nature.\" The five groups - wood, fire, earth, metal, and water - include seasons, directions, climates, stages of growth and development, internal organs, body tissues, emotions, aspects of the soul, tastes, colors, sounds, etc. The Five Element Theory emphasizes the dynamic relationship we have with our environment as well as the relationship between all our internal organ systems. In order to balance our Qi, we must address any potential imbalances between our internal organs and the external elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. How does Traditional Chinese Medicine promote health and well-being? TCM practices can be used to decrease pain, relieve stress, improve digestion, clear skin, and help find which diet and foods will optimize our health. Chinese Medicine modalities include: Acupuncture is the use of needles to relieve Qi energy blockages along any of the meridians in your body. These needles are placed strategically on points along the meridian, or \"acupoints,\" that can impact biochemical and physiological conditions, including stimulating sensory receptors to alleviate pain. Research has demonstrated that [acupuncture can be used to help manage chronic pain](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1357513), such as back and neck pain, shoulder pain, headaches, and osteoarthritis, as well as relieve stress and anxiety. Cupping is the method of either heating or suctioning glass cups onto the skin. When the cup is placed on your skin by either heat or air pump, your skin and muscle draw into the cup, causing you to feel intense pressure and sensation in that area. Cupping is particularly effective for easing muscle soreness, aches, and pain, and this practice was made famous by Michael Phelps during the 2016 Olympics. As [this article](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/what-are-the-purple-dots-on-michael-phelps-cupping-has-an-olympic-moment/) explains, \"Physiologically, cupping is thought to draw blood to the affected area, reducing soreness and speeding healing of overworked muscles. Athletes who use it swear by it, saying it keeps them injury free and speeds recovery.\" Moxibustion is the burning of moxa, a cone or stick made of ground [mugwort](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential) leaves, on or near your body's acupuncture points. Direct moxibustion is when the cone or stick is applied directly to the skin and removed when the skin turns red; indirect moxibustion is when the cone or stick is held a short distance away from the skin. Moxibustion is typically used for people with digestive issues, as it is thought to promote detoxification, increase blood flow, and expel cold energy. Four ways to stay healthy this winter, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine As mentioned earlier, each meridian in the body corresponds to an organ, and these organs correspond to different times and seasons of the year. The winter is known as the season of the kidneys, and those with kidney imbalances may be more prone to getting sick or may feel more lethargic than usual. This is because the kidneys are considered the \"powerhouses\" of Qi, providing Qi to the rest of the body when other areas are depleted. If your kidneys are depleted, you're more prone to catching that cold or flu going around your office. If you want to prevent getting sick, and you have access to acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, or another Chinese Medicine healing remedy performed by a qualified practitioner, that's amazing. But if not, there are other ways to bring traditional healing practices into your daily life. According to board-certified and licensed acupuncturist [Paige Bourassa, MSTOM LAc, RHN, CAS](http://www.shenmedicine.com/meet-the-team/), these are the best, surefire ways to prevent getting sick this winter: Exploring different health modalities to find what works best for you Chances are you're new to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Slowly but surely, Western medicine is starting to incorporate more holistic Eastern medicine concepts and modalities into its practices. The great thing about this emerging acceptance is that modalities such as acupuncture and cupping are now becoming more mainstream, and you can likely find a qualified practitioner in your area, maybe even covered by insurance! But what we at IIN find most exciting is that now there's the availability to try out these modalities to see what makes your unique body feel amazing. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to wellness - what we call bio-individuality. Yes, we can encourage you to incorporate certain foods into your diet to help boost immunity, but if your body doesn't tolerate garlic, for example, that's okay! You can try out cupping or moxibustion, but if you can't tolerate the pain that may come along with them, that's okay, too. There's no right or wrong when it comes to doing what you know is best for your own health. To that end, we'd love for you to explore all the unique concepts that IIN teaches to guide you to become your happiest, healthiest self.
