Insecticides virtually eliminated the para - sites in the postwar era, but now the blood-sucking insects are making a comeback. \"Bed bugs bite and run,\" says Jack W. Ross, M.D., director of the Department of Infectious Disease at Hartford Hospital. \"They don't jump. They don't fly. They don't even have wings.\" Although they crawl at the speed of a ladybug, the parasites are found worldwide. Bed bugs began to reappear in the decades after the pesticide DDT was banned in 1972 because of its hazards to wildlife and birds (including the near-extinction of the bald eagle). Bed bugs have six life stages and live up to a year. The flat, brown bugs often hitch a ride in a suitcase. They lurk behind headboards or picture frames or in the tufts of a mattress in the darkness. As you sleep, a bed bug slowly makes its way up toward your face\u2014attract - ed by the carbon dioxide given off by your breathing\u2014and feeds on your blood. The bites leave itchy, swollen, reddish welts. \"Bed bugs have been coming back in urban areas since 2005,\" says Dr. Ross. \"They are often a problem for the homeless, but they can also infest homes. You can pick them up if you travel.\" Since bed bugs are susceptible to heat, Dr. Ross suggests throwing your clothes into the dryer at the hottest setting as soon as you return home from a trip. \"Hotels use large heaters to kill the bugs with 'heat remedia - tion,'\" he says. Recently, researchers in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, found bed bugs carrying antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Even though a bed bug may be infected with \"flesh-eating\" bacteria, no one has ever documented its transmission to a human host. Bed bugs may be nasty, but unlike ticks or mosquitoes, they don't seem to spread disease. UPDATE In last issue's feature on Hartford Hospital's Center for Education, Simulation and Innovation (CESI), we should have recognized the contributions of anesthesiologist Thomas C. Mort, M.D., who established the hospital's first simulation center.H E A L T H T I P S There's An App for Health Now that smartphones are everywhere, an explosion of \"apps\" for health, wellness, diet and fitness is underway. (\"App\" is an abbreviation for application software.) Mobile apps are available for the iPhone, Blackberry, Android and Windows phones, as well as the iPad and other tablets. Many cost less than $1 and nearly all sell for under $5. Top health and fitness apps include mobile workouts from magazines like Men's Health, Women's Health, Self and Runner's World. Diet-related apps include calorie trackers, body mass index (BMI) calculators and weight- loss plans. Kids can play games to learn how to make healthy food choices or how to burn calories with physical activity. If you want to check a symptom, download the free WebMD app from iTunes or www.webmd.com/mobile. Just be sure to avoid cyber - chondria (the kind of hypochondria you get from too much online research). Remember, no app can ever replace your doctor's advice. 2For people with food allergies, menu choices can be challenging. In susceptible individuals, food aller - gies trigger the release of inflammatory compounds that can lead to a life-threatening over-reaction throughout the body known as \"anaphylactic shock.\" \"Food allergies have increased in prevalence over the past 15 years,\" says Jeffrey M. Factor, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with the Connecticut Asthma & Allergy Center. \"Serious allergies that can cause fatal or near-fatal reactions have increased threefold.\" Eggs, nuts, milk and shellfish can trigger a severe immune response in sensitive individuals. Your mouth and throat begin to itch and your tongue starts to swell, signaling the onset of a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Breathing difficulty, severe stomach pain, rash, vomiting and diarrhea follow quickly, usually within two hours after eating. By contrast, fresh apples, peaches or cherries tend to cause an itchy mouth and a mild reaction that gen - erally responds to over-the-counter antihistamines. Suspected food allergies can be confirmed with skin testing or blood tests that measure antibodies pro - duced by the immune system. No one knows for sure why food allergies have risen so dramatically, but no one disputes that potentially fa - tal allergic reactions have soared in both children and adults in recent years. The prevalence of peanut allergy has nearly doubled over the past decade.\"Peanut allergies are a major health issue in schools,\" says Dr. Factor. \"Adolescents or young adults are at particularly high risk because they feel invincible or ashamed to show weakness in front of their friends.\" Why are food allergies on the rise? The Hygiene Hypothesis Early exposure to microbes trains the immune system to stave off infection. Some researchers blame food allergies on efforts to create a germ-free environment. Shielding children from disease with antibiotics and vaccines may be adding to allergic reactions, since food allergies are rare in the developing world. The Food Delay Debate In 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urged parents to delay the introduction of foods known to cause allergies. Now the AAP is backpedaling in the wake of an alarming jump in food allergies despite the ban on cow's milk, eggs and peanuts in early childhood. Peanut allergies are rare in Israel, where one of the first foods given to babies is a snack made from peanuts. The Climate Connection Scientists are studying whether sunshine and Vitamin D play a role in food allergies, since Vitamin D defi - ciency is linked to allergies and autoimmune disorders. Physicians write three to four times more prescriptions for epinephrine autoinjectors (EpiPens) in cold climates than in sunny southern states. \"The EpiPen can delay or prevent an allergic reac - tion if used right away,\" says Dr. Factor. \"Although 80 percent of children outgrow milk, soy or wheat aller - gies, shellfish or tree nut allergies often persist into adulthood.\" Desensitation Therapy Nearly eight million Americans with food allergies live under constant threat of a deadly allergic reaction. Dr. Factor is currently using an experimental technique to desensitize at-risk children by introducing gradually increasing amounts of peanut allergen in a controlled environment. So far, he has enrolled 65 children with peanut al - lergies. \"One patient accidentally ate half of a peanut butter cookie at a social function,\" he says. \"Nothing happened. Before desensitization it would have been a life-threatening emergency.\"Food Allergies Can Be Fatal Call 1-800 DOCTORS to locate an allergy specialist near you. 3Saving Your Brain: A Million Neurons at a Time When you're having a stroke, minutes count. Dawn Beland, R.N., the coordinator of the Stroke Center, urges you to remember the acronym \" FAST \" if you suspect you may be having a stroke. \"If something's wrong with your Face, Arms or S peech, note the T ime of onset and call 911.\" As the ambulance races toward Hartford Hospital, paramedics assess your vital signs and wirelessly transmit data to alert the emer - gency department (ED) to the imminent arrival of a potential stroke victim. The resident phy - sician follows the procedure for an \"activated stroke\" and pages the Stroke Center team on call 24 /7. The ambulance pulls into the emergency bay. Waiting personnel hustle you onto a gurney and sprint to the critical-care Red Pod, where nurses and physicians are standing by. Sometimes a stroke victim arrives by air ambulance via the hospital's helicopter, LIFE STAR. Within minutes, life-saving care begins. \"As part of a regional stroke center, our emergency department manages acute stroke patients in an emergent, prioritized fashion,\" says emergency medicine physician Lincoln Abbott, M.D., co-medical director of the Stroke Center at Hartford Hospital. \"The multi- disciplinary team is often activated even before patients arrive, and patients are rushed to immediate care in the same way as a heart attack or trauma victim. This organized, emergent treatment affords patients the best chance at recovery from their stroke.\" The management of acute stroke has advanced dramatically over the past decade. Founded in 2001, Hartford Hospital's Stroke Center was the first in New England to be certi - fied by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). The Stroke Center provides rapid treatment in the critical minutes just after a stroke by reopening vessels and rapidly restoring blood supply to the brain. Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in the area with the exper - tise and equipment to treat even high-risk patients with clot-busting drugs and minimal - ly invasive neurointerventional procedures. In EDs nationwide, physicians rely on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \"stroke scale\" to help assess the severity of a stroke. Physicians ask the patient a series of stan - dard questions. \"Can you raise your arm?\" asks neurologist Catherine M. Hosley, M.D., a hospitalist who cares for stroke victims while they're in the hospital. \"Can you squeeze my hand?\" \"Stroke patients receive rapid, coordinated care,\" says neurologist Isaac Silverman, M.D., of Hartford Neurology, co-medical direc - tor of the Stroke Center. \"The team works as quickly as possible, sending the patient for a brain scan, inserting an intravenous line and drawing blood for lab work. Some patients may need a breathing tube or treatment in our dedicated neurointensive care unit. Our team includes physicians from emergency medi - cine, neurology, interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery and anesthesiology, among other specialties.\" Time Is Brain The most blood-hungry organ in the body, the brain is extremely vulnerable to damage because of its constant demand for oxygen and other nutrients delivered through the bloodstream. When blood flow to the brain is suddenly cut off by a stroke, oxygen-starved tissue rapidly begins to die. \"If you have new onset of neurologic symptoms, seek immediate medical atten - tion,\" says Dr. Gary Spiegel, M.D., director of Interventional Neuroradiology and co-medical director of the Stroke Center. \"Patients may have no predisposing medical condition before the onset of a stroke. In any stroke, particu - Dr. Catherine Hosley asks a patient a series of questions that can help neurologists assess the severity of a stroke.This organized, emergent treatment affords patients the best chance at recovery from their stroke.\" 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Martin Ollenschleger, M.D. Martin D. Ollenschleger, M.D., an interventional neu - roradiologist, treats condi - tions such as acute stroke and cerebral aneurysms with minimally invasive techniques. Dr. Ollenschleger is part of the hospital's multidisciplinary Stroke Center team. Dr. Ollenschleger graduated from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey- New Jersey Medical School in 2002. He then completed a combined residency and fel - lowship training program in neurology, radiology and diag - nostic neuroradiology at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center from 2007 to 2009. The following year, he completed an additional fellow - ship at NYU in interventional neuroradiology. He practices with Jefferson Radiology, where his areas of interest include interven - tional neuroradiology, stroke and neurological imaging. Dr. Ollenschleger, whose hobby is astronomy, says looking at faint object through a telescope utilizes the same skills he uses when diagnosing a stroke or spotting a brain aneurysm on a CT scan or MRI.larly one where blood flow to the brain has been limited by blockage of a vessel, time is brain.\" An estimated 1.9 million neu - rons\u2014the critical nerve cells in the brain\u2014are lost after one minute of blockage caused by a blood clot. After an hour, it jumps to 120 million neurons. When not recog - nized or treated rapidly\u2014optimally within three hours\u2014stroke can result in death or severe loss of function. Stroke is a killer, account - ing for one in every 18 deaths in the United States. Sudden-onset language difficul - ties, dizziness, confusion, loss of vision, unusual headache, numb - ness or weakness\u2014especially on one side of the body\u2014signal the beginning of a stroke. Each year, more than 795,000 Americans suf - fer a stroke, making it the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in adults. Someone suffers a stroke every 45 seconds. Different Strokes An ischemic stroke happens suddenly. About 85 percent of all strokes occur when a blood clot lodges in an artery that supplies the brain, blocking blood flow and depriving the brain of oxygen. The clot blocks the vessel in the same way a clogged pipe stops water from going down a drain. Whenever possible, Stroke Center physicians use minimally invasive techniques and catheter- delivered therapies to dissolve or retrieve a blood clot in the brain. \"We make a nick in the skin over the femoral artery at the groin,\" says Dr. Spiegel of Jefferson Radiology. \"Catheters (tiny tubes inserted into a blood vessel)\u2014some of them finer than a strand of angel hair pasta\u2014are used to deliver coils, sealants, clot-dissolving medicines, or dilating balloons to the affected area of the brain. We can stop a stroke as it happens. \" A less common hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery within the skull suddenly rup - tures, spilling blood into the brain. Hartford Hospital's neurosurgical team is always on call to collabo - rate with the Stroke Center's neuro - interventional radiologists to stop the bleeding. Craniotomy (removal of part of the skull) may be the only way to perform lifesaving surgery on delicate blood vessels lying deep within the brain, although several clinical trials are ongoing at Hartford Hospital to treat brain hemorrhage. Clot-Busting Therapy The clot-dissolving drug tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signifi - cantly increases the odds of surviv - al after an ischemic stroke. When administered quickly, tPA halts the cascading brain injury that other - wise can lead to cognitive impair - ment, language difficulties, paraly - sis, coma or death. Thrombolytics like tPA dissolve clots only if administered within a very short period of time. The worst-case scenario occurs when someone suffering mild symptoms goes to bed\u2014rather than going directly to the ED\u2014and wakes up with a massive stroke that can't be treated because too much time has passed. 6\"Patients and their families should respond to stroke symptoms not by calling their doctor but by immediately dialing 911,\" says Dr. Silverman. \"Driving your family member to the hospital wastes valuable minutes since you'll be seen much more quickly if you come by ambulance.\" Timing Is Crucial Although the treatment window has widened slightly over the years, physicians still juggle life-and- death decisions. Will the patient benefit from clot-busting drugs? How much time has elapsed since the onset of symptoms? If too much time has passed, the risks of bleed - ing and brain injury outweigh the potential for healing. \"The standard treatment 'win - dow' for patients with diabetes or a prior stroke is three hours,\" explains Dr. Hosley. \"In someone without diabetes under age 80 who hasn't had a prior stroke, we can sometimes go out to four and a half hours. We often won't see any damage on a CT scan from an ischemic stroke if you arrive at the hospital within the first couple of hours after symptoms start. Therapy choices become limited if we see a 'gray zone' of injured brain tissue.\" Hartford Hospital is one of only a few medical centers in the country with the expertise to \"shoot\" stroke-stopping medications through a catheter directly up into the brain, called intra-arterial or IA therapy. Intra-arterial thrombo - lytic agents can reduce debilitating brain damage even when injected up to six hours after a stroke. While nationally only about 3.4 percent of stroke patients receive \"clot-bust - ing\" drugs, the Stroke Center treats up to 28 percent of patients arriv - ing in the ED within the crucial window of three to six hours with either intravenous or intra-arterial agents. Strokes that affect the brain - stem are especially devastating. \"Patients become uncoordinated, weak or paralyzed on one side and can't speak,\" says Dr. Hosley. \"We can use intra-arterial tPA up to 12 hours after the onset of symp - toms because patients often don't survive or are left severely disabled after a catastrophic stroke.\" Catching A Clot The most active stroke cen - ter in the state, the Stroke Center provides non-invasive diagnostic brain imaging and 24/7 neuroin - terventional emergency treatment. Hartford Hospital's Stroke Center is the premier center for diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke in the region. In 2001, the Stroke Center pio - neered the development of the rev - olutionary MERCI retrieval device to capture a clot. Interventional neuroradiologists maneuver a cath - eter through a small incision in the groin, then thread the device up through arteries to the brain, where they snag the clot or dissolve it to restore the normal flow of blood. When a scan shows a dense area in a vessel or choked-off area where a clot is visibly blocking the circu - lation, the patient may undergo an angiogram to map the blood vessels.\"We don't waste time,\" says Martin D. Ollenschleger, M.D., an interventional neuroradiologist. \"The biplane Artis zee imaging tech - nology allows us to rapidly identify the blocked blood vessel and the pathway to it.\" The 52-inch, high-definition flatscreen display just above the table provides a range of exquisitely detailed images that can be viewed by technicians in an adjacent room during delicate neurointerven - tional procedures. Rolling carts in the biplane suite are stocked with devices in various shapes and sizes for catheter-based procedures. The carts can be moved to either of the hospital's two neurointerventional suites. \"We employ a large selection of devices\u2014including the MERCI and Penumbra systems\u2014along with angioplasty balloons and stents to open up blocked arteries to the brain,\" says Dr. Ollenschleger. \"Newer stent-like devices that firmly grab and remove the clot even more rapidly should be approved for use soon.\" Nearly half of stroke victims who arrive at the hospital promptly have no lasting effects from a mild stroke. \"If a patient gets to Hartford Hospital in time, we can usually break up the clot with a combina - tion of tPA and neurointerventional techniques,\" says Dr. Ollenschleger, M.D. \"It's great when you get here early because large areas of your brain can be saved.\" For more information go to the Stroke Center page on our website at www. harthosp.org.Patients and their families should respond to stroke symptoms not by calling their doctor but by immediately dialing 911. 7We welcome some of the newest members of our Hartford Hospital Medical Staff.

Members of the maternity nursing staff pro - vide hands-on support for new mothers during their stay in the hospital. \"We teach mothers how to breastfeed their babies on the postpartum unit,\" explains certified lactation consultant Sara Young, R.N., MSN, IBCLC. \"After they leave the hospital, they can always call the Lactation Center for a follow-up appointment if they have ques - tions or concerns. We provide advice, guidance and hands-on help.\"Breastfeeding Is BestCertified lactation consultants are available seven days a week in the Maternity Unit. Nursing mothers from the community can also make an appointment to meet with a lactation consultant on an outpatient basis. Many obstetricians in the area refer their patients to Hartford Hospital's Lactation Center on the sixth floor of the Bliss Building. \"Young babies don't always latch properly, so we show new moms how to position the baby,\" she says. \"Most mothers do quite well with basic instruction, but others struggle at first. They may have too much milk or not enough milk.\" Babies can nurse up to 8 - 12 times in 24 hours dur - ing the first few weeks. \"Good\" babies who sleep all the time are probably not getting enough milk. Some mothers produce too much milk. \"We tell moms with a large milk supply to lie down and let the force of gravity help them regulate the amount of milk they're giving the baby,\" says Ms. Young. \"Babies who start choking and sputtering may be getting too much milk.\" Lactation consultants also help mothers who expe - rience engorgement, soreness, latching difficulties or problems with breast pumping. Breast pumps are avail - able to rent or purchase from the Hartford Hospital Auxiliary Store in the main lobby. The Special Deliveries Childbirth Center has been designated a Baby-Friendly Facility by Baby-Friendly USA, part of UNICEF'S Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. Breast milk contains the optimum nutrients to help protect your infant against childhood illnesses and help your infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler. To make an appointment for breastfeeding support, call the Lactation Center at 860-545-2824 or visit www.harthosp.org/ women/PregnancyChildbirthServices/Breastfeeding. Diabetes Rising One in 10 Americans suf - fers from type 2 diabetes. If current trends continue, one in three will suffer from the disease by the year 2050, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University re - cently found that lower-cost generic drugs may lower blood sugar better than newer medications, with fewer side effects.Building Brains Scientists at California's Stanford University School of Medicine manip - ulated DNA transcription to transform human skin cells into nerve cells, or neurons, according to a re - port in the journal Nature. Someday, the experimen - tal technique may be used to create new, perfectly matched cells for trans - plantation into the brains of patients with neurologi - cal conditions.Hope for Hep C The Food and Drug Administration has ap - proved a new drug for chronic hepatitis C infec - tion that may cut treatment time. Incivek (telaprevir) is approved for patients who have either not received interferon-based drug therapy or who have not responded adequately to prior therapies. About 3.2 million people in the United States are infected with the hepatitis C virus.Sunscreen Foils Cancer Exposure to the sun is a strong risk factor for mela - noma, the potentially deadly form of skin cancer. A new study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows that wear - ing sunscreen outdoors decreases the risk of mela - noma. Avoid tanning beds, which emit ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The EPA says melanoma is the most com - mon cancer among people in their late 20s. in the CLINICIAN'S OFFICE 9Fixing Broken Bones Dr. Michael A. Miranda, orthopedic surgeon, holds a stainless steel rod used to reinforce a bone during trauma surgery. Summer is \"trauma season\" in hospitals nation - wide. During the summer months, there's an up - swing in visits to Hartford Hospital's Emergency Department, which treats more than 80,000 patients annually. Summer is the season for car crashes, head injuries and broken bones. As one of only two Level I trauma centers in the state, Hartford Hospital has earned the highest na - tional designation for trauma surgery and critical care. Accidents can leave orthopedic trauma patients clinging to life, with shattered bones and devastating injuries. Victims airlifted from the scene of a car wreck often have multiple fractures, complicated by life- threatening blood loss and plummeting blood pressure. Hartford Hospital's air ambulance system, LIFE STAR, transports about 1,200 critical care patients annually. With five intensive care units (including a neurointen - sive ICU for head injuries), Hartford Hospital cares for the most critically injured patients in the region. Orthopedic Trauma \"Motorcycle trauma patients are flown in from all over the state, southern Rhode Island, Massachusetts and eastern New York,\" says Michael A. Miranda, M.D., the only private practice, board-certified traumatolo - gist in Connecticut, who practices with Orthopedic Associates of Hartford. \"We operate on a thousand fractures a year. People don't realize the level of care provided by Hartford Hospital. We have critical care beds available in our ICUs and a step-down unit to stabilize acute trauma patients who have lost a lot of blood.\" The rapid pace of a hospital emergency room cre - ates a particularly hectic setting for physicians dealing with complex fractures, a ruptured spleen or severe bleeding. Since bones have rich blood supplies, break - ing a long bone (such as the femur in the thigh) can cause significant blood loss. Orthopedic trauma vic- tims can lose as much as a liter (about a quart) of blood. \"We were ahead of the rest of the country,\" says Dr. Miranda, who joined Hartford Hospital in 1994. \"Since 1988, an orthopedic trauma team at Hartford Hospital has treated orthopedic emergencies 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Anesthesia is criti - cal. Our team approach includes access to a dedicated operating room and collaboration with colleagues from neurosurgery, trauma and other specialties. We treat the very sick patients other hospitals won't take.\"Healing Takes Time \"Critically ill patients need to be stabilized first,\" says Dr. Miranda. \"We do damage control right away with surgery to stop the bleeding and splint the frac - tures. Life over limb is our first priority. After a few days we can begin tackling the fractures.\" New research published in the journal Archives of Surgery shows that more than 60 percent of traumatic injury survivors still suffer significant pain a year later. \"When someone doesn't die right away, orthopedic and neurological problems often persist,\" says Dr. Miranda. \"Recovery from multiple broken bones can take up to a year and a half.\" Minimally Invasive Surgery Smaller scars, reduced pain, minimal blood loss and shorter recovery times have spurred the rapid growth of minimally invasive surgery over the past decade. Although most severe breaks necessitate \"open\" sur - gery, minimally invasive techniques have made their way into the orthopedic operating room. Under real-time X-ray guidance, Dr. Miranda makes a small incision and slides a metal plate over the break, anchoring the plate with screws drilled through the skin. \"Typically, the fracture is right under the skin in the tibia (shinbone),\" he says. \"Minimally invasive surgery is more challenging, but we try to do it when appropriate.\" Fixing Broken Bones Metal plates, screws and rods have now replaced rigid plaster casts in the high-tech operating room. \"Bones heal better when they're fixed with a little flex - ibility,\" says Dr. Miranda. \"Allowing the patient to move the extremity normalizes the blood flow, decreases swelling and speeds healing. We encourage people to move a broken limb that has been splinted with inter - nal plate-and-screw fixation.\" Hartford Hospital's Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, headed by Bruce Browner, M.D., treats a wide range of patients with challenging musculoskeletal problems who are referred by other orthopedic sur - geons from all of Connecticut and the northeast. Dr. Miranda travels around the world teaching other orthopedic surgeons the innovative techniques developed at Hartford Hospital.Although most severe breaks necessitate 'open' surgery, minimally invasive techniques have made their way into the orthopedic operating room. 11Hartford Hospital Programs & Events From July 1 Through September 15, 2011 To register online go to www.harthosp.org/classes or call 860-545-1888, toll free 1-800-545-7664.

(Amounts are just suggestions, so feel free to add more or less of certain categories.) To prepare, follow the Directions below. GRAINS (Choose 2-4 items from this list to total 4 cups) Medium or thick rolled oats Rolled rye flakes Rolled wheat flakes Rolled barley flakes Spelt wheat (Triticale) FRUITS (Choose several from this list to total 2 cups) Dried Shredded or flaked unsulfured, unsweetened coconut Dried papaya Dried or fresh pineapple Dried or fresh cherries Dried cranberries Dried apple slices Dried or fresh banana Dried dates Dried figs Dried or fresh apricots Prunes (dried plums) Raisins Fresh (Add or substitute fresh fruits for dried or serve as a topping) Blackberries Blueberries Apple Sliced peaches Orange or grapefruit slices Melon balls or slices Raspberries NUTS and SEEDS (1 cup total) Chopped macadamia nuts Slivered almonds Chopped walnuts Chopped pecans Shelled pistachios Filberts or hazelnuts Brazil nuts Pistachios Raw pumpkin seeds Unsalted soy nuts Sunflower seeds Flaxseeds or flax meal Directions Mix the ingredients together in a large bowl. Transfer to an airtight container. If storing for longer periods, you may choose to keep the cereal in the freezer or refrigerator.Hot Muesli Instructions: Add \u00bd cup Muesli to \u00bd cup water, milk or soy milk and bring to a boil. Simmer for 3-5 minutes. You can also microwave Muesli in a large bowl on high for 3-5 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Makes 1 serving. Cold Muesli Instructions: Soak \u00bd cup Muesli in \u00bd cup yogurt, milk, soy milk or fruit juice for 5-10 minutes, or soak over - night. Makes 1 serving. Three-Grain Muesli with Fruits & Berries This Muesli recipe uses three grains as well as dried fruit, nuts and seeds to make a healthy, flavorful cereal. Ingredients 1 \u00bd cup rolled oats/oat flakes 1 \u00bc cup rolled rye flakes 1 \u00bc cup spelt wheat flakes \u00bd cup dried sunflower seeds \u00b9/\u00b3 cup raisins Follow directions above. Top with fresh blackberries and peach slices (optional). Healthy grains and fruit create a flavorful alternative to sugar- laden breakfast cereals. Whole grains are food powerhouses packed with antioxidants and phytonutrients that may help reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. When kernels are heavily processed (into white flour, for ex ample) they lose much of the fiber, bran and germ that consti- tute the \"whole\" grain. Always avoid \"enriched\" products that contain added vitamins and iron, with healthy fiber and healthy nutrients removed. To create your own muesli, mix wheat, rye, oats, nuts, seeds and raisins and top with sliced fruit and ripe berries. Brightly colored blackberries and cherries are rich in cancer-fighting phytochemi- cals, while peaches are packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Sliced peaches are naturally sweet, yet low in calories. Berries have been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent cell damage.1 serving: ( \u00bd cup g Protein: 6.5g Fat: 6.5 g Fiber : 6.5 g "}
