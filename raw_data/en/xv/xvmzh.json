The [results](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408257) appear today in Environmental Health Journal. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing compound. For decades it was employed to keep multi-dose vials of vaccines free from contamination by germs and bacteria. Multi-dose vials are pricked repeatedly to load fresh needles for injections. During the 1990s, concerns emerged about thimerosal's potential to harm children's brain development. In response, the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 ordered manufacturers to remove or reduce to trace amounts the thimerosal in all vaccines recommended for children 6 and under - with the exception of multi-dose vials of inactivated flu vaccine. \"This comprehensive study of infant primate development, including analyses of learning, cognition, and social development, indicated that vaccinated primates were not negatively affected by thimerosal,\" and developed normally, said lead investigator Laura Hewitson of The Johnson Center for Child Health and Development in Austin, Texas. She worked with the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) at the University of Washington, where she is an affiliate scientist. Their study of infant macaques compared the safety of different child-immunization schedules, including the schedule from the 1990s, which involved several thimerosal-containing vaccines. Some animals instead received a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine that did not contain thimerosal, and some received a saline injection. Regardless of vaccination status, all animals developed normally, Hewitson said. \"This is the first time the safety of the entire pediatric vaccine schedule has been investigated in a relevant animal model,\" commented Dr. Judy Van de Water from the University of California-Davis MIND Institute, who was not involved in this study. Today all child vaccines are available in thimerosal-free forms. Inactivated influenza vaccine for kids also is available in single-dose formulations that contain no thimerosal, but their supply is more limited than the multi-dose vials that contain thimerosal. This study was supported by The Ted Lindsay Foundation, SafeMinds, National Autism Association, the Vernick family, and the Johnson family. This work was also supported by WaNPRC Core Grant RR00166 and Center on Human Development and Disability Core Grant HD02274. Related "}
