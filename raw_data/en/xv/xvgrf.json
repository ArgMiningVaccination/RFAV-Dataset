Homeopathy is a therapeutic method that uses highly diluted natural substances to relieve symptoms. Principles of Homeopathy Homeopathy derives from the Greek words homeo, meaning \"similar,\" and pathos, meaning \"suffering\" (such as the pathology of a disease). Homeopathy operates on a \"like cures like\" principle that has been used empirically for more than 200 years, and is now confirmed by an increasing number of research publications. Translated, this means that a patient suffering from symptoms can be treated by micro-doses of a substance capable of producing similar symptoms in a healthy person. Homeopathic medicines stimulate the body's physiological reactions that restore health, with a very low risk of side effects due to the use of micro-doses. An Example An example of how homeopathic medicines work is the similarly of symptoms between a bee sting and a rash. A bee sting swells and itches. If similar symptoms appear from perhaps hives, a rash or even another insect bite, the homeopathic medicine most appropriate to treat these symptoms is actually made from a tiny amount of a bee. Instead of masking symptoms, the medicine sends the body a signal to help it rebalance and heal. Benefits of Homeopathic Medicines Natural \u2014 The active ingredients in homeopathic medicines are diluted plants, animals and minerals that relieve the same symptoms they cause at full strength (i.e., a micro-dose of coffee bean helps nervousness). Scope of Use \u2014 Similar to other over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, homeopathic medicines can be used to relieve symptoms of a wide range of acute health conditions such as allergies, coughs, colds, flu, stress, arthritis pain, muscle pain, and teething. Efficacy \u2014 Homeopathy has been used for more than 200 years, building a remarkable safety record and generating a great body of knowledge. Quality-controlled \u2014 Homeopathic medicines are manufactured according to the highest standards, complying with specifications of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) and Drug Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). - Safe \u2014 Homeopathic medicines are one of the safest choices for self-treatment. - No known side effects such as drowsiness - No interactions with conventional medications or herbal remedies - No contraindications with pre-existing conditions - No masking of symptoms Forms \u2014 Like other OTCs, homeopathic medicines are available in a variety of dosage forms such as gels, ointments, creams, "}
