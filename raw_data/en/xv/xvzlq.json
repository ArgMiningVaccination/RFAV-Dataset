It's not only important what you eat, but also whether your intestines are actually absorbing all the nutrients you're ingesting. According to the [ Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://shawellness.com/shamagazine/traditional-chinese-medicine/) expert Eva Escorihuela, in Western countries, digestive problems tend to be quite frequent, for several reasons: - Eating an excess of precooked or refined foods, lacking real nutritional value. - Poor eating habits, such as eating quickly, not chewing properly and not practicing mindful eating. - A predisposition to suffering from digestive issues. For those who suffer from digestive problems, Traditional Chinese Medicine can positively improve the underlying issues and treat the imbalances that are impeding correct functioning. The methodology that TCM applies to diagnose whether the digestive system is working correctly is by analysing whether the \"digestive fire\" is balanced; the energetic state that allows correct digestion and absorption of foods. When the \"digestive fire\" is weak, food isn't digested correctly, provoking the spleen-stomach to overwork, as well as causing symptoms such as bloating, gas, lack of hunger, vomiting and abdominal pain. On the other hand, when the \"digestive fire\" is too intense, the opposite sensations arise: constant hunger, acidity, weight-loss and can lead to illnesses such as gastritis and stomach ulcers. In order to prevent these symptoms and ensure your digestive system is working optimally, Traditional Chinese Medicine can bring back the \"digestive fire\" into balance and ensure that your gut is healthy!
