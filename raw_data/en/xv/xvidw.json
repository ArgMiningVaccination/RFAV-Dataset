The Chattanooga Campus provided 594 clinical rotation blocks for these students during this period. Our primary clinical training site and major affiliated hospital partner is Erlanger Health System. Medical students are considered part of the healthcare team and receive individualized attention from our Faculty, Residents, and Fellows. Many of our students remain in Chattanooga for residency training as a direct result of these clinical rotations. The University of Tennessee College of Medicine - Chattanooga offers training to junior and senior medical students from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine - Memphis as well as to senior medical students from other U.S. medical schools. UT students from Memphis are able to elect their entire clinical training in the last two years at any UT campus. Chattanooga offers all required rotations for junior and senior UT medical students. Junior students from Memphis are able to participate in required Core Clerkships (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Surgery, Neurology, and Psychiatry). Students from Memphis may also elect other required rotations in Chattanooga: Capstone, Geriatrics/Palliative Care, and the Patient Safety/Quality Improvement Clerkship. In addition, the Chattanooga campus offers about 40 additional specialty and subspecialty electives for UT Students and other Seniors Students throughout the U.S. Visiting Students: Decisions for Visiting Student rotations will be made based on availability after our UTHSC students are registered and in accordance with AAMC and the Coalition for Physician Accountability recommendations. Click on the Applying for Rotations link above for details about eligibility requirements and the process for applying for these Visiting Student Learning Opportunities through the AAMC VSLO System. Please check back periodically, and also work with your own Dean's Office regarding whether or not your medical school will permit you to apply for Visiting Student rotations. The maximum time permitted for Visiting Students is three four-week rotations in Chattanooga during their senior year. Visiting Students must meet eligibility requirements in accordance with UT and individual department guidelines. All allopathic and osteopathic visiting students must apply via the AAMC's VSLO system. Their Dean's Offices should be able to assist them in completing the application process. UT is not permitting international student rotations at this time unless there is an agreement the visiting school and the University of Tennessee. Housing and Other Amenities: UT provides housing at Hayden Place Apartments (just across the river from downtown Chattanooga) for up to 28 UT Medical Students during each rotation period based on the date on which requests are received and availability. Each apartment is furnished and has two bedrooms with high speed fiber-optic internet and a desk in each bedroom. Priority is given to M3 Medical Students enrolled in Clerkships and required rotations (up to six, four-week blocks) during the M3 and M4 years of training. Due to the large number of UT Students as well as a limited number of bedrooms, we cannot guarantee the availability of housing. Pets are not permitted unless a student has approval from UTHSC SASSI for a request to bring an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). Housing is not provided by the University for visiting students.
