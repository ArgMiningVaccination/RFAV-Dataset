All rights reserved.KRISTIN GIUSSANISCOTT POLAR RESEARCH INSTITUTEIssue 8 | Spring 2009 | 3RESEARCH NEWS The University of Cambridge has embarked on a year-long programme ofcelebratory events to mark 800 years as aseat of learning and academic research.The activities aim to strike a balancebetween commemorating the world-changing discoveries of the past,celebrating the achievements of thepresent and leaving a legacy for thefuture. A striking example of Cambridge's academic achievements is the 83 Nobelprizes awarded to affiliates of theUniversity for significant advances inphysics, medicine, chemistry, economics,literature and peace. Cambridge ideashave shaped thinking across all thedisciplines; Cambridge discoveries havechanged our understanding of life,matter and the universe. Highlighting the University's transformative research, a series ofpodcasts, vodcasts and films -'Cambridge Ideas'- will showcaseCambridge academics nominated fortheir ability to inspire, innovate, discover,engage and achieve. Visit the 800thAnniversary website for more details. An important component of the anniversary has been securing the futureof education and research at thecollegiate University. In 2005, Cambridgeannounced the public phase of the800th Anniversary Campaign with theambitious goal of raising \u00a31 billiontowards this future. Over \u00a3800 million hasnow been raised, funding new buildings,posts, programmes and Cambridge'scollections and architectural heritage, as well as enhancing the financialsupport available for students, both atundergraduate and postgraduate level.Examples of important new facilities that will enhance Cambridge's contributionsin research and teaching include theCentre for the Physics of Medicine (seepage 20), purpose-built facilities for theInstitute for Manufacturing, the HauserForum (future home to CambridgeEnterprise Ltd and associated activities)and the new Sainsbury Laboratory for the study of plant development (see right). A series of prestigiousprofessorships has also been endowedacross a wide range of subjects includingthe Joseph Needham Professorship ofChinese History, Science and Civilization,the A G Leventis Professorship of GreekCulture and the Tata Steel Professorshipof Metallurgy. 'Cambridge has never stood still and for almost 800 years has shown aremarkable ability to evolve to meet thechallenges and grasp the opportunitiesthat the future presents. Cambridge-educated graduates and Cambridgeresearch have frequently transformed theworld we live in,' said Professor AlisonRichard, Vice-Chancellor of the University.'The legacy of the 800th Campaign willbe that Cambridge can make theinvestments that will ensure that ahundred years from now our successorswill be able to celebrate Cambridge'sachievements with the same pride wefeel today.'

Exceptional gift for plant scienceresearch centre Cambridge will be home to anew research laboratory forthe study of plantdevelopment. The Gatsby Charitable Foundation has provided \u00a382 million - thelargest single gift received by theUniversity since the launch of the800th Anniversary Campaign - for anew building with state-of-the-artlaboratory facilities situated in theCambridge University BotanicGarden (CUBG). Due for completion in late 2010, the Sainsbury Laboratory will house120 scientists, and 30 additionalstaff, to study plant development.The Gatsby Charitable Foundationhas given a further \u00a32 million tosupport research fellowships in theDepartment of Plant Sciences and\u00a32 million to fund the research ofDavid Baulcombe, Professor ofBotany, who was recently awardedAmerica's highest research honour,the Lasker Prize. The building will also provide a home for the University Herbarium,which contains over a millionpressed and dried plant specimensfrom all over the world, includingthose collected by Charles Darwinon the Beagle voyage. This collection is a key resource in ourunderstanding of plant evolutionand biodiversity. 'This is one of the most exciting projects with which my CharitableFoundation has been involved,' saidLord Sainsbury. 'I believe it will soonbecome a world-class centre ofexcellent plant science.' Professor John Parker, Director of the CUBG, added: 'The Gardenlooks forward in the 21st century tomaintaining its position with thestudy of plant diversity in the mostmodern way. The laboratory will bededicated to the advancement ofcuriosity-driven research.' For more information, please visit www.botanic.cam.ac.uk 'Assembling Bodies' , a major new exhibition opening in March at theMuseum of Archaeology andAnthropology, challenges us to thinkin different ways about the humanbody. The exhibition explores howbodies have been considered indifferent time periods, culturalcontexts and disciplinary perspectives,as well as the technologies throughwhich bodies are made visible. The exhibition is part of a five-year, cross-disciplinary research project -'Changing Beliefs of the Human Body'- involving 15 researchers spreadacross the Faculty of Archaeology andAnthropology, the Faculty of Classics,and the Museum of Archaeology andAnthropology. This ambitiousprogramme is a comparative history,spanning 10,000 years, of how andwhy humans change what theybelieve about the human body. Boththe wider project and the exhibitionhave been funded by the LeverhulmeTrust, with additional support for theexhibition provided by the ArtsCouncil England (East) and theWellcome Trust. 'The exhibition incorporates findings generated by the largerproject but is also developing its own independent research,' explainedCurator Anita Herle. 'The intention is tobuild bridges between disciplines thatwill lead to further study, as well as toprovide a springboard for outreachevents and artist workshops.' One goal has been to showcase the extraordinarily rich and diversecollections within the Museum, theUniversity and the Colleges. Alongsidethese fabulous artefacts will becommissioned artworks, including a unique collection of body mapspainted by the Bambanani Women'sGroup in Cape Town, South Africa,documenting the lives of women with HIV/AIDS, and a soundscape of recordings from deep within the body. 'One of the fun things about this exhibition is that when you put verydifferent objects together you provokenew kinds of ideas,' said Anita Herle.'There is an intellectual challengeimplicit in the contrast for instancebetween a Malanggan mortuary effigy and Watson and Crick's structureof DNA. Unexpected juxtapositionsstimulate us to think about the body in new ways.' 4| Issue 8 | Spring 2009RESEARCH NEWS What do we think we are?

Research collaboration for mental health A new \u00a323 million partnership brings together the National Health Service (NHS) with fourUniversity departments to improve mental healthcare. A partnership between the University, the County Council and a range ofCambridgeshire and East Anglian NHShealthcare commissioners andproviders has been awarded fundingfor a Collaboration for Leadership inApplied Health Research and Care(CLAHRC). Hosted by theCambridgeshire and PeterboroughNHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), theCLAHRC is one of nine in the UK, andthe only one to focus on mentalhealth. The funding comprises an award of \u00a39.5 million by the NHS NationalInstitute for Health Research (NIHR) \u00a313.5 million of alignedfunding from the NHS and CountyCouncil. It was made following opencompetition throughout England and Wales and review by an internationalpanel. CLAHRCs are collaborative partnerships between a university andthe surrounding NHS organisationsfocused on improving patientoutcomes through the conduct andapplication of applied health research.The Cambridge centre aims to testnew ways of working in mental healthto see if they are effective andappropriate for everyday use in thehealth service. 'This will be a true collaborative effort that efficiently and effectivelyharnesses research findings to clinicalpractice,' said Professor Peter Jones,Head of the Department of Psychiatryand Director of the centre. Alongside the Department of Psychiatry, thepartnership involves the Departmentof Public Health and Primary Care, theEngineering Design Centre in theDepartment of Engineering andJudge Business School. A physicalbase is being established at DouglasHouse, Trumpington Road,Cambridge, where both Universityand NHS staff will work together.

According to the laws of thermodynamics, absolute zero(-273.15\u00b0C) cannot be reached.However, Dr Michael K\u00f6hl's group in theDepartment of Physics has developed alaser-based method of cooling that hasachieved almost absolute zero. At theseultracool temperatures, atoms trappedin the machine come to a standstill,allowing researchers to study theirquantum nature. 'The ability to control and cool atoms by laser light has given acompletely new twist to the traditionalfield of atomic physics in recent years,'explained Dr K\u00f6hl. 'Experimentally, it only became achievable a decade ago, but ithas initiated a wave of research based onaccess to a microscopic understandingof quantum degenerate gases.' The Cold Atoms Group has built a machine in which six interfering laserbeams are directed via a small army oflenses through rubidium gas. The laserlight slows down the gas atoms, whichare then subjected to evaporativecooling in a magnetic trap. For the firsttime ever in Cambridge, the group hasrecently demonstrated a Bose-Einsteincondensate - essentially, atoms at closeto absolute zero that have collapsed into the lowest quantum state. 'The ultimate controllability of atoms in these states makes us optimisticabout studying a whole range ofphenomena linked to solid-state physics,'said Dr K\u00f6hl. 'Such condensed matter physicsand high-temperature superconductivity,as well as pave the way for quantumcomputers of the future.'

The research is being carried out by Polly Casey, Lucy Blake, JenniferReadings and Dr Vasanti Jadva, and isled by Professor Susan Golombok. Withfunding from the US National Institutesfor Health (NIH), the longitudinal studyis looking at parent-child relationshipsand the psychological well-being ofchildren in families created bysurrogacy, egg donation and donorinsemination. The study is alsoexamining whether and when parentsdecide to tell their children about their origins.The CFR is based in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences. 'To beawarded a prize for the bestpresentation at an internationalconference is a remarkableachievement for the Centre for FamilyResearch given that the competitorswere largely from the biological andbiomedical sciences,' said ProfessorGolombok, Director of the CFR. 'Theaward enabled the researchers to travelto Brisbane to present a paper at therecent FSA conference.' For more information, please contact Polly Casey (pc371@cam.ac.uk). A boost for family research A team studying the psychological well-being of children created by assisted reproduction has been awarded a prize for their work.Its territorial borders define the eastern boundaries of the European Union, andits state language is spoken by over 40 million people worldwide. YetUkraine, Europe's second-largest country,remains a relatively unknown quantity inBritish universities. Now, thanks to agenerous donation from Mr DmitryFirtash, Ukrainian Studies has beenlaunched in the Faculty of Modern andMedieval Languages under theleadership of Rory Finnin, newly arrivedfrom Columbia University, New York.Trained in comparative literature, Finnincentres his research on the interplay ofliterature and national identity in Ukraine. 'Ukraine is in an important geopolitical position at the crossroadsbetween East and West,' said Finnin. 'Ithas a vibrant literary tradition and a livelyculture which, since its independence in1991, has really begun to explore newdirections. This is a very exciting time forscholars of Ukrainian literature andculture, and it's an excellent time forCambridge to be formulating aprogramme to study this remarkablecountry.'Although the initiative focuses on Ukraine's language, literature andculture, Finnin aims to foster a broaderexchange with researchers from variousdisciplines that will enrich the study ofSlavic and Turkic cultures, as well asnationalism and post-colonialism. 'Thehistoric permeability of Ukraine'sterritorial, linguistic and ethnic an opportunity for us toexplore the interdependency of thecultures of Eastern Europe and the BlackSea region,' explained Finnin. 'Aninterdisciplinary approach is being trueto the region itself, whose historicalreality is largely one of tolerance andcross-cultural penetration.' Rory Finnin will work closely with CamCREES, the Cambridge Committeefor Russian and East-European Studies,which facilitates interdisciplinarycollaboration among scholars of theregion, as well as the Centre for Researchin the Arts, Social Sciences andHumanities (CRASSH). 'I am delighted that this initiative has given Cambridge an opportunity toexplore such a complex and fascinatingcountry,' said Simon Franklin, Professor of Slavonic Studies in the Faculty ofModern and Medieval Languages. 'Notonly will it benefit Cambridge but it willundoubtedly promote the study ofUkraine further afield, in the UK andbeyond.'

One such initiativethat is fostering research collaborationsacross the University is the recentlylaunched Centre for TrophoblastResearch, which aims to promote thestudy of placental biology. Reproductive disorders and unsuccessful pregnancies cause greatdistress to families. The societal andhealth economic burdens are alsosubstantial, ranging from the costsassociated with preterm births(estimated at $26 billion for a single yearof preterm births in the USA) through tothe costs of diseases later in life as aresult of intrauterine complications.Improving our fundamentalunderstanding of reproductive health,and translating these basic insights intoclinical intervention, clearly hasenormous potential to impact positivelyon the rest of society. 8| Issue 8 | Spring 2009REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH The past 50 years have seen many societal and technological changesin reproductive health. The readyavailability of hormonalcontraception has dramaticallyaltered reproductive behaviour; thenormal place of birth has movedfrom the home to hospital;Caesarean section, once the mode ofdelivery for a small proportion ofwomen, is the method of birth forapproximately a quarter of thecurrent generation; and themanagement of infertility has beentransformed by in vitro fertilisation, with more than 10,000 children ayear now being born in the UK as aresult of this process. Our understanding of the physiological, pathological andclinical processes relating toreproductive health has alsoflourished. We now know thatcertain genes we inherit from eachparent undergo complexreprogramming during formation ofthe eggs and sperm, and play keyroles in regulating feto-placentalgrowth. We have a deeperunderstanding of the immunologicalinteractions that take place at thematerno-fetal interface in thewomb, and how these are vital forsupporting the growth of the fetus.We also know that growthconditions in the womb can havelong-term health effects, such as ahigher risk for diabetes, obesity andcardiovascular disease.

The precursors ofsperm and eggs, known as germ cells,provide this enduring link betweengenerations because they transmit theparents' genetic information to theoffspring. Precisely how these cellsbecome equipped to reproduce a neworganism - and the remarkable erasingand reprogramming steps that happenduring this process - is being studiedby Professor Azim Surani's researchgroup in the Wellcome Trust/CancerResearch UK Gurdon Institute, withfunding from the Wellcome Trust andthe Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). Backing-up the blueprint Even as the embryo implants in thelining of the womb during pregnancy, a founding population of germ cells isalready being set aside within theembryo for the next generation. It'svery important that these cells maintainthe ability to form every cell type withinthe organism - an attribute known aspluripotency and one that is quicklylost from those cells that develop intothe rest of the body (skin, neurones,muscle and so on). Studies in ProfessorSurani's group have discovered thatthese primordial germ cells develop inresponse to a 'master regulator' of germcell fate called Blimp1. This initiates aspecial germ cell programme that atthe same time represses all the otherpotential cell fates in these cells, leavingintact the blueprint for creating any cellin the body. Wiping the disc clean After Blimp1 has halted the marchtowards development into body cells,the germ cells then proliferate andmigrate into fetal gonads, whichdevelop independently at another siteFor more information, please contact the author Professor Azim Surani(a.surani@gurdon.cam.ac.uk) at theWellcome Trust/Cancer Research UKGurdon Institute.

Here, one of the mostextraordinary of events occurs that israther like wiping a hard disc clean andthen reloading it with either a maternalor a paternal operating system. The critical 're-setting' event wipes out all the pre-existing information and'imprints' that are normally associatedwith the genetic blueprint that carriesthe instructions necessary to form thewhole organism. This associatedinformation, known as epigeneticmodification, is usually required tointerpret the genetic informationappropriately so that the right genesare selected for expression at the righttime during critical cell fate decisions.The modifications are 'imprinted' andheritable, to denote their maternal orpaternal origin. What the researchers at the Gurdon Institute have discovered is preciselyhow the erasure process wipes out allthe pre-existing epigenetic informationand imprints. This leaves the geneticinformation intact in preparation fornew instructions and imprints to be laiddown on top of the genetic information- a process that occurs duringdevelopment of the eggs and sperm inthe growing fetus. How to make eggs and sperm Our understanding of these processeshas now reached such a level that it ispossible to make germ cells directly from pluripotent embryonic stem cells,or even from body cells such as skincells. This naturally raises the prospectthat sperm and eggs could bedeveloped directly from body cells in aculture dish. Such innovations mightprovide new opportunities forapplications in reproductive medicine,including exploration of the basis forcertain forms of infertility or theunderlying causes of cancers such astesticular tumours. But they also raiseimportant ethical issues that will needto be addressed hand-in-hand withprogress in the field. need arises; for example, during the development of stem cells into particularorgan systems. If these naturalepigenetic processes occur improperly,major adverse health and behaviours can ensue. Epigenetic modificationstherefore render our genomesfunctionally flexible, adaptable andvulnerable. The study of the epigenetic control of genome function has led to the dawnof a new revolution that some havecoined of Obstetrics andGynaecology) and Dr Sue Ozanne(Metabolic Research Laboratories at theInstitute of Metabolic Science) arestudying epigenetic processes thatconfer long-term memory to genes underthe influence of the cellular environment,with far-reaching implications for humanreproduction and health. An epigenetic voyage in space and time Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are important throughoutdevelopment, from when the sperm firstmeets the egg (fertilisation), throughearly lineage decisions, to fetaldevelopment and postnatal life. Somaticepigenetic modifications need to be'reprogrammed' in germ cells and also inearly embryos so as to achievedevelopmental pluripotency, wherebycells can give rise to all the cells neededin the developing fetus. This normallyresults in epigenetic marks that aredifferent in some locations onchromosomes inherited from eggscompared with those inherited fromsperm. For 99% of genes inherited by the embryo, gene expression can occur fromboth the maternally and paternallyinherited versions. But the remaining 1%are 'imprinted' , which means that onlyone of the two gene copies is expressed 10| Issue 8 | Spring 2009REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH Cracking the DNA structure in the early 1950s revolutionised the study ofgenetics in providing key informationon how cells transmit information tothe next generation. Five decadeslater, upon the publication of the drafthuman genome sequence, weentered the so-called post-genomicera. The ability to interrogate ourcomplete DNA sequence has alloweda field of genomic medicine toemerge that has had profoundpromise for our understanding ofgenetic disease. But our genomes constitute more than just the linear DNA blueprint.DNA is bundled into three-dimensional chromosome structures.This packaging is influenced bymolecular flags known as epigeneticmodifications that are attached to theDNA and to the proteins thatorganise it into chromosomes. Thesechemical modifications (includingmethylation and acetylation)determine whether parts ofchromosomes are tightly or looselypackaged, which in turn influenceswhether a gene has the potential tobe switched on or off. Remarkably, during cell division, cells acquire the same epigeneticmodifications as their parent cell,resulting in the heritable transmissionof these epigenetic states and a'memory' of a cell's identity.Epigenetic states, however, haveinherent flexibility because they canundergo normal regulated change inresponse to particular stimuli, tomodulate biomedical research worldby storm; three Cambridgescientists use examples from their own research toexplain why.

TheCambridge researchers have discoveredthat the functional epigeneticasymmetry that exists between thegenomes of the parents has importantinfluences during pregnancy andthroughout life. These effects includecontributions to the allocation ofmaternal resources - especially to thecontrol of key aspects of mammalian physiology related to growth andadaptations to feeding and metabolism. Dr Const\u00e2ncia's group has recently described the effects of one gene that isexpressed only from the copy inheritedfrom the father. The gene for insulin-likegrowth factor 2 (Igf2) operates in a vitalarea of the placenta where maternal andfetal blood mix and nutrients areexchanged, controlling the influx ofnutrients to the fetus. Igf2 also operatesin fetal tissues to control the level ofdemand for nutrients. These studies raisethe novel concept that imprinted genesare key genetic regulators of the supplyof, and genetic demand for, maternalnutrients to the mammalian fetus. Thismay have implications for ourunderstanding of the selective forcesthat led to the evolution of the processof imprinting. The control of nutritional resources is now known to apply to many otherepigenetically regulated imprintedgenes controlling growth in themother's womb and also after birth.Work by Professor Ferguson-Smith'sgroup has looked in further detail atsuch genes and has shown thatimprinted genes can also influencenormal metabolism. We are what we eat The diet of an individual has importanthealth issues at any stage of life - 'we arewhat we eat' after all. There is growingevidence from studies both in humansand in animal models that maternal dietduring pregnancy is particularlyimportant as it has major long-termhealth consequences, including risk ofdeveloping type 2 diabetes, heartdisease and obesity - so in some ways'we are also what our mothers ate' . Thishas been termed the developmentalorigins of health and disease hypothesis.It suggests that subtle differences innutrition or other early environmentalfactors during fetal or early postnatal lifelead to permanent alterations in thestructure and function of importantorgans, leaving a legacy of diseasesusceptibility in later life. Dr Ozanne's group has shown that reducing the protein intake of pregnantrodents leads to type 2 diabetes, obesityand premature death in the offspring.This is accompanied by permanentchanges in the expression of genesregulating insulin production and action.All three research teams are currentlyinvestigating what the molecular mechanisms could be that connect theeffects of maternal diet duringpregnancy with gene expression in theoffspring many years later (i.e. after manyrounds of cell division). Not surprisingly,permanent changes in the epigeneticmarks on DNA, and therefore effects ongene programmes throughoutdevelopment and into adult life, areemerging as a major player. For example,Dr Ozanne and Dr Const\u00e2ncia haverecently discovered that a reduction inprotein intake during pregnancy altersthe epigenetic marks on the regulatoryregions of important genes in thepancreas, leading to differences in theirexpression. DNA wears Prada Epigenetic processes are not confined tonutrition and growth - many othersystems under epigenetic influence arealso now coming to light. These includethe ability of plants to respond toseasons, the capacity of chromosomesto segregate properly during celldivision, and many of the key changesthat occur in cancer and neurologicaldisorders. It seems that our geneticfuture lies not only in studying theskeleton that is our DNA, but also inunderstanding the epigeneticmodifications that clothe it.

If this is defective,major problems of pregnancy arise,including recurrent miscarriage, low birth weight, stillbirth and pre-eclampsia. Degrees of invasion As many as 3-10% of births worldwideare affected by pre-eclampsia, acomplication that is particularlycommon in first pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia develops suddenly towardsthe end of pregnancy and progressesrapidly, causing death of the motherand her baby unless there is delivery byemergency Caesarean section. Thecondition arises when the placenta(which is derived from the fetus) fails toinvade deeply into the uterus, so thatthe proper connections with the uterinearteries that provide essential oxygenand nutrients to the fetus are notestablished. A fine balance exists in this'no-man's-land' - too little invasionmeans the fetus will be starved, toomuch invasion is detrimental to themother. Placental trophoblast cells are at the interface between the placenta anduterus; as they migrate through theuterine wall they come into contactwith cells of the maternal immunesystem. The maternal cells that appearto be especially important in regulatingthe degree of invasion are uterinenatural killer (uNK) cells. Work inProfessor Moffett's lab has been lookingat what determines which way thebalance tips and how uNK cells mightboth assist and hinder placentation. Mix and match The group's focus has been on thereceptors on uNK cells that recognise New insights into pregnancy are resulting from research on the interaction betweenmother and fetus at the placental interface.The balance between mother and fetus in'no-man's-land' fetal trophoblast Thesereceptors, knownas The trophoblastcells recognised by KIR receptors arecalled MHC and these are also highlypolymorphic. Indeed, MHC and KIR areencoded by the two most variablepolymorphic gene systems known inhumans. Professor Moffett's lab has typed the KIR genes in women with pre-eclampsia and compared themwith those of mothers with normalpregnancies. Results show thatparticular combinations of maternal KIRgenes and fetal MHC genes areassociated with pre-eclampticpregnancies. Similar findings werefound in women with repeated earlymiscarriages where the placenta fails toestablish proper connections with theuterine arteries early in gestation. Howthese genetic findings translate into abiological understanding ofplacentation is now under activeinvestigation. Brainy humans walk upright Curiously, pre-eclampsia is unique tohumans and is absent even in the greatapes; is this related to the particulartype of placenta that humans haveevolved? There are selective pressuresassociated with both the constraintsimposed on the pelvis by walkingupright and the acquisition of largebrains, which requires a longer periodof development in the uterus. Thesespecifically human attributes haveplaced unique demands on the systemthat regulates the balance in utero between the mother and her fetus.Comparison with their primaterelatives indicatesthat the human KIR and MHC genefamilies have changed and expandedsince humans evolved. Part of this rapidchange may have been dictated by thepotential dangers of humanreproduction - fine-tuning is needed toachieve a birth weight not too large toprevent delivery through the femalepelvic outlet and yet large enough forthe baby to survive once born.

Because thesebabies are themselves likely to be atincreased risk of gestational diabetes,the population risk for type 2 diabetes could accelerate in just a few generations. The problem iscompounded by maternal obesity andthere is evidence from some high-riskpopulations that only modest increasesin maternal obesity may be enough toprecipitate gestational diabetes. High BMI Recent research in the Department ofPaediatrics and Medical ResearchCouncil (MRC) Epidemiology Unit ledby Professor David Dunger and Dr KenOng has shown that high maternalbody mass index (BMI) increases therisk of obesity in offspring. Incollaboration with colleagues inUppsala, Sweden, the group is lookingat variations in maternal glucose andlipid metabolism during pregnancyusing state-of-the-art cold-isotopetechniques. These complexphysiological studies are being carriedout at the Wellcome Trust ClinicalResearch Facility on the CambridgeBiomedical Campus at Addenbrooke'sHospital. The findings show that maternal obesity and insulin resistance aredeterminants of fetal and newbornbody fat, even where glucose levels arenormal. Futhermore, although maternal glucose levels in late pregnancy are animportant determinant of body fat atbirth, over the first two years of life this relationship tends to decline and, by the age of two years, the pre-pregnancy BMI of the mother is the more important determinant of offspring weight. Feeding on demand Maternal weight gain and genespredisposing to type 2 diabetes maynot be the only factors determininggestational diabetes risk in mothers.Professor Dunger and Dr Clive Petry,with support from an MRC projectgrant, have also found evidence thatfetal genotypes associated withincreased fetal growth may modify themetabolism of the mother. It seemslikely that these effects are a result ofthe fetus trying to boost its owngrowth by increasing nutritionaldemand through the secretion ofplacental hormones into the maternalcirculation. The important inferencehere is that if some fetal genotypesinfluence the risk of maternalgestational diabetes then, incombination with increased rates ofmaternal obesity, this could contributeto the current worldwide epidemic of diabetes. Baby growth The group has also identified rapidpostnatal weight gain as a major riskfactor for adult obesity and risk of type2 diabetes. To explore this further, theinvestigators are using the CambridgeBaby Growth Study of over 1000 infants,originally established with European Union funding by Professor IeuanHughes in the Department ofPaediatrics and now funded by theMRC. The group is looking at the effectsof feeding regimes, including breast,bottle and early introduction of solidsand cows' milk, as well as measures ofsatiety, to determine hormonal markersof differential weight and height gain. The aim over the next five years is to arrive at a full evaluation of thesecomplex prenatal and postnataldeterminants of obesity risk inchildhood and type 2 diabetes risk inlater life. The accurate prediction of riskmight lead to the development of newintervention strategies that will reducethe vicious circle of maternal obesityand diabetes risk in future generations.Obesity and diabetes inpregnancy: a vicious circle?

The concept is familiar to us allthat traditional risk factors, such assmoking and obesity, and geneticmakeup increase the risk of heartdisease. However, it is now becomingapparent that a third factor is at play - adevelopmental programming that ispredetermined before birth, not only byour genes but also by their interactionwith the quality of our prenatalenvironment. A biological trade-off Pregnancies that are complicated byadverse conditions in the womb, suchas happens during are necessary to maintainviable pregnancy and sustain life beforebirth, the adaptations come at a cost,claiming reduced growth as abiological trade-off. In fact it's morethan just growth that is affected - wenow know that the trade-off extends tothe development of key organs andsystems such as the heart andcirculation, which increases the risk ofcardiovascular disease in adult life.Overwhelming evidence in more than adozen countries has linkeddevelopment under sub-optimalintrauterine conditions leading to lowbirth weight with increased rates inadulthood of coronary heart diseaseand its major risk factors -hypertension, atherosclerosis anddiabetes. The idea that a fetus' susceptibility to disease in later life could beprogrammed by the conditions in thewomb has been taken up vigorously bythe international research community,with considerable efforts focusing onnutrient supply across the placenta as a risk factor. But nutrient supply is justpart of the story. How much oxygen isavailable to the fetus is also adeterminant of growth and the risk ofadult disease. Dr Dino Giussani'sresearch group in the Department ofPhysiology, Development andNeuroscience is asking what effectreduced oxygen has on fetaldevelopment by studying populationsat high altitude. Lessons from high altitude Bolivia lies at the heart of SouthAmerica, split by the Andean Cordillerainto areas of very high altitude to thewest and areas at sea-level to the east,as the country extends into theAmazon Basin. At 400 m and almost4000 m above sea-level, respectively,the Bolivian cities of Santa Cruz and LaPaz are striking examples of thisdifference. Pregnancies at high altitude are subjected to a lower partial pressure ofoxygen in the atmosphere comparedwith those at sea-level. Women living athigh altitude in La Paz are more likely togive birth to underweight babies thanwomen living in Santa Cruz. But is this aresult of reduced oxygen in the wombor poorer nutritional status? The research team studied birth weight records from healthy termpregnancies in La Paz and Santa Cruz,especially from obstetric hospitals andclinics selectively attended by womenfrom either high- or low-incomebackgrounds. High-altitude babiesshowed a pronounced reduction inbirth weight compared with low-altitude babies, even in cases of highmaternal nutritional status. Babies bornto low-income mothers at sea-level alsoshowed a reduction in birth weight, butthe effect of undernutrition was not aspronounced as the effect of highaltitude on birth weight; clearly, fetalStudies in La Paz, the highest city in the world, are helping to uncover a link between prenatal conditions and heartdisease in later life.Prenatal originsof heart diseaseoxygenation was a more important determinant of fetal growth withinthese communities Remarkably, although one might assume that babies born to low-incomemothers at high altitude would showthe greatest reduction in birth weight,these babies were actually heavier thanbabies born to high-income mothers athigh altitude. It turns out that thedifference lies in ancestry. The lowersocio-economic groups of La Paz arealmost entirely made up of AymaraIndians, an ancient ethnic group with ahistory in the Bolivian highlandsspanning two millennia. On the otherhand, individuals of higher socio-economic status in Bolivia represent alargely European and North Americanadmixture, relative newcomers to highaltitude. It seems therefore that anancestry linked to prolonged high-altitude residence confers protectionagainst reduced atmospheric oxygen. Do these early influences of oxygenation feed through to increasedrisk of cardiovascular disease? A large-scale, five-year study to determine thishas been initiated in the two cities thatwill link birth weight data withmeasurements of cardiovascular healthand disease in Bolivian high- andlowlanders. But an early indication hasbeen supplied by a somewhat unlikelysource: Bolivian hen eggs. Mountain chicks Dr Giussani's group has discovered thatthey can replicate the results found inAndean pregnancies in eggs: fertilisedeggs from Bolivian hens native to sea-level show growth restriction whenincubated at high altitude, whereaseggs from hens that are native to highaltitude show a smaller growthrestriction. Using hen eggs has allowedthe researchers to accomplishsomething that would take generationsof migration in human populations todemonstrate: moving fertilised eggsfrom hens native to high altitude downto sea-level. This not only restoredgrowth, but the embryos were actuallylarger than sea-level embryosincubated at sea-level. And,importantly, when looking for earlymarkers of cardiovascular disease, it was discovered that growth restriction athigh altitude was indeed linked withcardiovascular defects - shown by anincrease in the thickness of the walls ofthe chick heart and aorta. Bringing the Andes toCambridge To have hopes of clinical intervention,we need to understand why reducedoxygen should be a trigger for aprenatal origin of heart disease.Towards this goal, the group's mostrecent data studying rat pregnancycomplicated with reduced fetaloxygenation have indicated that theadverse effects on cardiovasculardevelopment may be secondary to adisturbance known as oxidative stress.The body normally produces by-products of oxygen called free radicalsand, unless these are neutralised byantioxidants, they cause damage tocells. If oxidative stress is the underlyingcause of cardiovascular defects, thisoffers the highly interesting possibilityof using antioxidants to treatpregnancies complicated by reducedoxygen delivery to the fetus, be it atsea-level or high altitude. This may haltthe development of heart disease at itsvery origin, bringing preventivemedicine back into the womb.

Roman votiveofferingA fresh dialogue As the last point suggests, this is a workaimed at the elite of Rome; the bulk ofthe urban poor would not have beenable to afford the time or expenserequired to pursue Soranus' instructionson the diet, exercise, bathing andmassage regime to be followed by apregnant woman. And perhaps theyeven followed the prescriptions of hisrivals. Can we move from advice towhat actually happened, from ancienttreatises to demographic patterns onthe ground? This is beginning tohappen, as new scientific techniquesaimed at extracting a range of dataabout diet, lifestyle, disease and well-being from ancient skeletal remains aredeveloped, the results of which can becompared with the teachings ofancient physicians. Data recentlyderived from isotopic and dentalanalysis of skeletal remains from ancientRome, for example, have provedconsistent with the written advice ofthe Roman doctors that encouragedmothers to introduce solid foods aftersix months and complete weaningsoon after two years. This kind of dialogue between ancient materials and moderntechniques and models needs to bedeveloped and expanded. Researchinto ancient reproductive healthrequires an interdisciplinary approach, abringing together of scholars in thefields of ancient medicine and historicaldemography, as well as experts workingwith the new scientific analyses. DrFlemming is currently helping to buildup such a broad and collaborativeapproach in Cambridge - an approachthat promises further progress in thesecrucial areas of understanding.

Gaining insightinto issues such as just how riskypregnancy and childbirth were forwomen in Imperial Rome, and thechances of any child surviving a year, letalone five, is crucial to understandingboth the structure and the texture ofRoman society. The extent to which thecity's population was sustained onlythrough very high levels of immigrationrather than by being able to reproduceitself must have had very considerable social and cultural consequences. The rates of infant mortality, on the other hand, will have impacted heavily on the practicalities and meanings of family life. What the ancients knew Ancient medical texts offer one avenue for research into these key issues. The most detailed discussion of reproduction and female health to survive from the Roman Empire belongs to the physician Soranus of Ephesus, who practised at Rome in the late 1st and early 2nd century AD. Though scornful of anatomy (he considered it 'useless'), Soranus shares the general classical view that the fetus is nourished through the vessels of the umbilical cord, and supports those who argue for the existence of two embryonic membranes, attacking those who contend there is just one. Nor is this the only ancient medical dispute he becomes involved in - his treatise is highly polemical throughout. Soranus also offers advice (and criticism) on everything from the best time for intercourse if the aim is conception, to infant weaning and teething, covering topics like the (exacting) care to be given during pregnancy and birth, the best swaddling techniques, and how to choose and manage a wet- nurse. 16| Issue 8 | Spring 2009Issue 8 | Spring 2009 | 17Reflection on generation goes back to antiquity, but the term 'reproduction'gained wide currency only during theage of revolutions around 1800.'Generation' was the all-encompassingprocess by which new creatures cameinto being and in which the humanacquisition of a rational soul was thecrucial event. 'Reproduction' was morenarrowly framed, and soon became atopic of scientific research, a target ofmedical and agricultural intervention,and a project for pressure groups andstates seeking to improve the quantityand quality of populations. In themodern era, reproduction has beenmade increasingly independent of sex. A group of medical historians in the Department of History and Philosophyof Science (HPS) is studying thesechanges. Under the theme 'FromGeneration to Reproduction' , and fundedby a Wellcome Trust EnhancementAward, Drs Nick Hopwood and LaurenKassell and Professors John Forrester, JimSecord and Nick Jardine areinvestigating how our world ofreproductive practices, controversiesand, not least, images was made. From generation toreproduction Since 2004, the Enha ncement Award has enabled the researchers to buildstrength in the history of reproduction through studentships, research leaveand events. Seminars, workshops andconferences have generated lively local,national and international conversations,and created new cross-disciplinaryinitiatives such as the CambridgeInterdisciplinary Reproduction Forum, agraduate/faculty research group at theCentre for Research in the Arts, SocialSciences and Humanities (CRASSH). Current work covers topics as diverse as consultations about childbearing inastrological casebooks, controversiesover Darwinism, the hospitalisation ofchildbirth in the 20th century and theadvent of in vitro fertilisation. The history of embryo and fetus, and especially theirvisualisation, is a major focus and thesubject of the main outreach activity ofthe award - 'Making Visible Embryos' , anonline exhibition by Drs Tatjana Buklijasand Nick Hopwood. An online exhibition Images of human embryos areeverywhere today: in newspapers,clinics, classrooms, laboratories, babyalbums and on the internet. Debatesabout abortion, evolution, assistedconception and stem cells have madethese representations controversial, but they are also fairly routine, and wetend to take them for granted. Yet asrecently as 250 years ago human development was nowhere to be seen.How were embryo images made torepresent some of the most potentbiomedical objects, and subjects, of our time? The story begins with a sketch of the variety of views of pregnancy and theunborn before developing embryoswere first drawn at the end of the 18thcentury. We then see how, during the1800s, medicine and biology exploitedtechnical innovations to producepictures and models thatcommunicated new attitudes tochildbirth, evolution and reproduction.In the 20th century, these became thedominant representations of pregnancyand prominent symbols of biomedicalhope and fear. The exhibition contextualises such icons as the German Darwinist ErnstHaeckel's allegedly forged illustrationsand the Swedish photographer LennartNilsson's 'Drama of Life Before Birth' on a1965 cover of Lifemagazine. It also interprets over 120 now little-knowndrawings, engravings, woodcuts, oilpaintings, frescos, wax models, X-raysand ultrasound scans. By depictingimaging technologies and peopleengaged in image production (seepicture), the web pages emphasise thework of making visible embryos.Wherever we stand in today's debates, itshould enrich our understanding ofembryos, and of reproduction moregenerally, to explore how these iconshave been made.

Productionwas organised almost entirely withinthe respective country and companiesemployed a very large, semi-skilledlabour force. The 'value chain' - theactivities from conception of theproduct, through its production, to itsfinal sale that add value at each stageof the chain - was overseen by skilledmanagers, technical experts anddesigners. Today, outsourcing andoffshoring have reshaped the industry,just as they have reshaped many otherindustries worldwide. Depending onthe management strategy adopted,many companies have relocated severalsteps in the chain to low-wagecountries around the globe, and todayonly 10-20% of clothing ismanufactured in western countries. How are companies responding to the pressures associated withglobalisation and particularly how are they managing the fragmented valuechain? To research this question, acollaborative project 'GlobalisingBehaviour of UK Firms in a ComparativeContext' has been undertaken jointly bya team in the Cambridge Centre forBusiness Research, based at JudgeBusiness School, and the IndustrialPerformance Center at MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT). Financedby the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI),the project focused on pharmaceuticals,publishing and - the focus of our book- textiles and clothing. Fashioned by nations Much of our research was conducted inthe 'field' - in Britain, the USA andGermany - carrying out in-depth,qualitative interviews with topmanagers/owners of clothing, textileand retail companies, as well asindustry experts. We spoke to suppliersto our western firms in three veryimportant (in terms of import volume) sourcing countries: China, Turkey andRomania. We explored the geographicaland organisational aspects of theclothing value chain. And we askedhow managers configure the valuechain and whether relations withcontractors in different parts of theglobe are organised in nationallydistinctive ways. Even within such a highly globalised industry as clothing, we discovered that the configuration of the valuechain is still influenced by the socialinstitutional context of our firms' homecountry. Highly distinctive productparadigms were retained by companiesfrom Germany, the UK and the USA,determined by the material and thehuman resources that firms can access;by the capabilities developed as aresult; by the regulatory climate; and bythe nature of consumer demand. German clothing firms produce mainly branded clothing for the Changes in the clothing industry have fashioned a new look for how manufacturing and retail is managed globally.FFAASSHHIIOONNIINNGG TTHHEE VVAALLUUEE CCHHAAIINN\u00a9ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/CARLA LISINSKIIssue 8 | Spring 2009 | 19PREVIEW upper-middle market, destined for older and more conservativeconsumers both at home and inEurope. UK companies concentratemore on middle and lower-middlemarket private-label fashion clothing forthe younger consumer and they mainlyservice the domestic market. USclothing firms pursue yet anotherstrategy, combining the production/in-licensing of branded and private-labelclothing. They serve a diversified mainlymiddle to lower-middle market, withmore classical fashion and fashion basicgarments. The export performance ofUS firms is not as good as Germanfirms' but is better than that of UK firms. These diverse strategies, in turn, affect the divergent relationsestablished with suppliers in low-wagecountries. In order to achieve control,buyer firms seek to integrate theirsuppliers to differing degrees. This isexpressed through more relationalcontracting by German firms, market-type arms' length relations by US firms,and by British firms taking a positionbetween these two extremes. Onenotable exception to national influenceis evident in the management of labour,where low costs and a low incidence of unionisation in supplier countriesprovided the impetus for outsourcing in the first place. Protection versus competition Our book was conceived as a multi-level study, encompassing variousgeographical and political-regulatorylevels, and designed to capture thecomplexity of this globalised industry. The global production networks of western buyer firms are highly dynamicand have been influenced, though notalways in the intended direction, byframeworks seeking to protect the USand European industries, such as the1995 Agreement on Textiles andClothing. Following the end of thisagreement and consequent abolition ofexport quotas for developing countrieson 31 December 2004, the networkshave become increasingly influencedby the competitiveness of theirsuppliers. We enquired how national, institutional and political contexts haveshaped competitiveness, as well asexplored how contractors view therelationships with their various nationalbuyer firms.

They havenot, however, afforded the westernclothing industries the protection theywere intended to provide. Instead, theyhave drawn more and more developingcountries into the industry, greatlyintensifying global competition and itsharmful effects on labour. Retail dominance According to our research, thedominant position in the value chainhas been assumed by the fashionretailers, owing to the high levels ofcapital concentration in retail andbecause of their greater closeness tofinal consumers. Electronic point-of-saletechnology provides retailers withsuperior knowledge of the quantityand, particularly, the quality of demand.This dominance expresses itself in theretailers' ability to determine pricing,lead times and the modalities ofclothing delivery, as well as productionquality. Their much increased influenceover western middleman'manufacturers' is passed on by thelatter to contractors in developingcountries who, in turn, pass oncompetitive pressures to labour, therelatively defenceless social group atthe end of the chain. Again, nationaldifferences prevail. In the less highlyconcentrated German retail sector,'manufacturers' still retain some influence and relations are morecooperative. These divergent powerrelations, in turn, determine the degreeof adversarialism present in globalnetworks. A much-copied pattern In the context of a globalisingeconomy, research into the clothingindustry has granted us many valuableinsights, from the dynamics of globalproduction to the changing geo-political and regulatory frameworks thatshape the globalisation process andentrench polarisation betweendeveloped and developing countries.The clothing industry was the first toengage in large-scale outsourcing andas such provided a template that manyother industries have since copied.Ironically perhaps, the fashion industryis sometimes regarded as an'unfashionable' industry to study, yet itretains an enduring fascination forscholars of value chain dynamics andcomparative capitalisms.20| Issue 8 | Spring 2009 Medicine and biology have long benefited from fundamentaladvances in physics. Whether it's thetools of diagnosis and treatment(from X-rays to lasers), orunderstanding the structure andorganisation of biological systems,the association between thedisciplines has broken new groundtime and again. For Cambridge, thisinteraction holds a special, historicalsignificance: the momentousdiscovery of the double helicalstructure of DNA by physicists atCambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in1953 transformed our understandingof the building blocks of life. Thebreakthrough gave birth to theentirely new discipline of molecularbiology and, in effect, the foundingin 1962 of the Laboratory forMolecular Biology on what is nowthe Cambridge Biomedical Campus.In 2009, we stand once more at thedawn of a new era and witness thefounding of a new laboratory, onethat will give structure and directionto the interaction betweenphysicists, biologists and clinicians. Building a future Over the past decade, an increasingcrossover in goals, philosophy andtechniques has been emergingbetween researchers in theDepartment of Physics and those inthe many biomedical departments and research institutes across the University.Building on this, the vision of thePhysics of Medicine initiative has beento draw physics more deeply into thelife sciences by creating an environmentwhere researchers from these differentfields can work together. The first step of the University's investment in Physics of Medicine hasjust been completed with the buildingof a new research centre on the WestCambridge Site, adjacent to theCavendish, and the appointment of experimental biomedicalphysics, Guck, Julian building, comprising state-of-the-art laboratory space and core facilities,was opened on 16 December 2008 andwill house researchers from differentdisciplines alongside a core from theDepartment of Physics. Diversity of science is expected to be associated with the enterprise. Tounderpin this, and to ensurerepresentation from the differentacademic communities, the initiative isoverseen by a steering committeecomprising the School Chairs of PhysicalSciences, Clinical Medicine, BiologicalSciences and Technology. Construction of a second phase of the building is planned. Currentlyawaiting funding, this will provide officeand teaching space, as well asadditional areas where researchers canmeet, discuss and develop common terms of reference. An importantdimension will be the training of a newgeneration of young researchers to befamiliar with a broad range ofapproaches and capable of working atthe interface of disciplines. As researchgroups develop within the Centre, andcollaborations reach out across theUniversity, a host of exciting newopportunities will be nurtured that willpush boundaries in the physics ofmedicine as never before. The Grand Opening of the Centre for the Physics of Medicine in December 2008 marked a major development in bringing together researchers working at the interface of physical sciences, life sciences and clinical sciences.

The modelling work has shown that the standarddogma about epidermal maintenance (involving the existence of so-calledtransit amplifying cells) is false, and provides an alternative framework that nolonger requires ongoing stem cell proliferation. The process by which a 'pluripotent' stem cell commits to becoming a particular type of cell depends on the stiffness and three-dimensional structureof the substrate (or scaffold) to which it is attached. Several collaboratinggroups are working on the design of tissue scaffolds and the nature ofcell-scaffold interactions: Dr Serena Best and Dr Ruth Cameron (Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials), Professor Wilhelm Huck and Dr Melinda Duer (Department of Chemistry), and Professor Eugene Terentjev and Professor Athene Donald (Department of Physics). Through collaboration with researchers within the Stem Cell Initiative, including Professor Fiona Watt and Professor Roger Pedersen , the possibility of control over the stem cell differentiation process using appropriately designed scaffolds can be explored. Pathogenic infection Bacterial interactions between cells and respiratory tissues are being studied byDr Pietro Cicuta (Department of Physics) and Dr Clare Bryant (Department of Veterinary Medicine), and Dr Julia Gog and Professor Ray Goldstein (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics), using acombination of mathematical modelling, optical tweezers and real-timeimaging. Optical tweezers are used to manipulate beads coated with a varietyof biologically relevant materials. By directly visualising how the cell engulfs thebeads and how this process is affected by the nature of the coating, researchershope to gain new insight about the infection process. Mathematical modellingis directed towards understanding fluid dynamics in the respiratory tract in thevicinity of the tiny 'hairs' that clear bacteria during infection. Professor Athene Donald is collaborating with Professor Duncan Maskell (Department of Veterinary Medicine) to pioneer novel methods of imagingbacterial pathogens. Bacteria are being imaged using the new technique ofenvironmental scanning electron microscopy, which permits imaging while thebacteria are still viable. The aim is to obtain higher resolution images of a livingpathogen than is currently possible with conventional light microscopy and toanalyse how bacterial shape may change during the life cycle.

Gateway to Rome According to ancient texts, theconstruction of Portus was initiated bythe Emperor Claudius, inaugurated bythe Emperor Nero and enlarged by theEmperor Trajan. In the 1st century AD,Claudius ordered the construction of agreat harbour and the digging of canalsto drain the land at the mouth of theRiver Tiber. But it wasn't until the early2nd century, when Trajan constructed ahexagonal harbour basin and hugewarehouses a little inland, that Portusbecame the main thoroughfare ofimports from the Empire. Marble, glass,metalwork and foodstuffs arrived onships from Egypt, Africa and theMediterranean provinces bound for the Imperial city. Under Trajan's rule, the area due south of Portus in the Tiber delta wastransformed into an artificial islanddefined to the east and south by theRiver Tiber, to the west by the Tyrrhenian Sea and to the north by acanal. A road traversed Isola Sacra,linking Portus with the adjacent city of Ostia, and along the road grew amajor cemetery. By the 6th century, however, the once bustling, cosmopolitan Portus hadhad its day, as Rome and herMediterranean trade declined. Gradually,the mausolea, paintings, inscriptions,sculptures and mosaics of the necropoliswere buried by sand dunes. A hidden gem Although records show thatantiquarians and archaeologists havestudied the ruins of Portus since the16th century, and a substantial part of the Isola Sacra necropolis wasexcavated in the 1930s, the site hasbeen effectively closed to study through most of the 20th century. A major issue for the Italian antiquitiesagency has been how to manage andpreserve this monumental landscape,which sits within an area of intensivemodern development immediatelyadjacent to Rome's main airport atFiumicino. In the 1990s, they acquiredmuch of the site to develop it as anarchaeological park, opening up thearea to new research such as the Portus Project. 22| Issue 8 | Spring 2009Portus, the great sea-port of Imperial Rome, is regarded as one of the mostsignificant civil engineering works of theancient world and yet, through acombination of historical circumstances,it has been the subject of surprisinglylittle archaeological research. The portarea spans more than 2 km by 1 km andfeatures a unique hexagonal harbourbasin covering more than 32 hectares,itself equivalent in size to a middle-ranking Roman city. And stretching outfrom Portus lies an even larger area ofarchaeological interest - Isola Sacra - anartificial island created by Emperor Trajanon which is sited one of Italy's bestpreserved Imperial Roman cemeteries. For the past decade, a project aimed at answering many of the key questionssurrounding this important site has beencarried out by a collaboration betweenthe Universities of Cambridge andSouthampton, and the British School atRome, in collaboration with theSoprintendenza per i Beni Archeologicidi Ostia and the Duke Sforza Cesarini.The latest stage of the project began in2007 with funding from the Arts andHumanities Research Council (AHRC),and combines a new survey usinggeophysical techniques with excavationof the core of the complex. Through this,the project aims to gain a fullerunderstanding of the historical and Excavation and geophysical survey are uncovering the secrets of an exceptionally diverse Imperial Roman landscape. Above and right: Members of the research team excavating and surveying the siteALL IMAGES BY HEMBO PAGI/PORTUS PROJECTFEATURES PORTUS PROJECT: BRINGING TRAJAN'S LEGACYIssue 8 | Spring 2009 | 23Excavation and survey The excavation led by Professor Simon Keay and Dr Graeme Earl from theUniversity of Southampton is applying anintegrated suite of techniques not widelyused on complex Mediterranean sites,including digital recording andvisualisation. A particular focus has beenan area between the Claudian andTrajanic harbour basins that is helping todisentangle the structural sequence thatruns from the 1st to the 6th century AD.It has already revealed unexpecteddetails about the Claudian harbour, aswell as information concerning thesystem for providing fresh water for shipsto use at sea. The excavated finds(including marble and pottery) holdgreat potential for writing the economicand social history of the port, therebymaking an important contribution to ourunderstanding of its role in relation toOstia, Rome and the RomanMediterranean. Professor Martin Millett from Cambridge's Faculty of Classics and KrisStrutt from the University ofSouthampton are directing thegeophysical component of the project.The new survey is attempting to cover allthe areas of the Roman landscape onIsola Sacra that have not been built over.The first results from 2008 (coveringabout a third of the island) are alreadyproving their worth. They show asequence of relict pre-Roman coastlinesleft behind as the Tiber delta expanded westwards. Importantly, these join withthose previously discovered in the surveyof Portus to the north, demonstratingconclusively that no former east-westriver channel existed in this area beforethe canals were dug in the 1st century. Overlying this sequence of geological deposits are three different Romanlandscapes. First, a settlement andbuildings appear to be limited to thenorth margin of the island, along thecourse of the canal, and include marblewharves and a bridgehead settlementopposite Portus. Second, there is a seriesof land boundaries which imply thatmuch of the island was given over toagricultural exploration, presumably toprovide foodstuffs to the populations ofOstia and Portus. Finally, there are thefunerary landscapes. These include boththe dense concentration of tombsbeside the road across the island as wellas a smaller number of monumentsoverlooking the Tiber. The latter continuethe pattern observed in the surveyfurther north, and reflect the use of theTiber as an artery for communication -the Roman dead were buried in tombsthat were designed to be seen bytravellers, whether travelling by road orby river. Future fieldwork Both the excavation and the survey arein their early stages and furtherdiscoveries are sure to follow over the next two seasons of fieldwork. However,it is already apparent that the integratedmethodology being used - thegeophysical survey to enhanceunderstanding of the area's layouttogether with the excavation ofindividual buildings and material culture- is yielding a breadth and depth ofknowledge not previously available. Inthe process, this exceptionally rich andchallenging site is also providing youngacademics and students from a range ofcountries with experience and trainingin site and survey techniques, electronicdata capture and the identification andanalysis of artefacts, fauna and botanicalremains.

FEATURES24| Issue 8 | Spring 2009FEATURES Cambridge neurologists have shown that an antibody usedto treat leukaemia also limitsand repairs the damage inmultiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects almost 100,000 people in the UK and severalmillion worldwide, many of whomdevelop the illness between the ages of 20 and 40. Individuals at first experienceepisodes that transiently disturb functions that healthy people take forgranted: seeing, walking, feeling,thinking and emptying the bladder.Later, the episodes are replaced bysecondary progression and, as thedisabilities mount up, the illness beginsto threaten many aspects of daily living. MS results when the body mounts an autoimmune attack on nerve fibres,particularly targeting the myelin sheaththat envelops them and interfering withthe passage of the nerve impulsethrough the spinal cord and brain. Theprime orchestrator of this damage hasbeen identified - a type of white bloodcell known as the T cell - but exactlyhow tissue injury occurs, why there is acharacteristic relapsing-remittingpattern followed by secondaryprogressive disease, and how to treat theillness effectively, have remained elusive. Made in Cambridge The results of a recent study raise newhopes for patients with MS. A three-year,Phase 2 clinical trial with Alemtuzumab(also known as Campath), in which over300 patients were treated, showed thatnot only was the advance of diseasehalted but, remarkably, many patientsstarted to get better - perhaps due tobrain repair. Professor Alastair Compstonand Dr Alasdair Coles in the Departmentof Clinical Neurosciences found that thedrug reduced the relapse rate by anadditional 74% compared with thestandard treatment, and the risk ofaccumulating fixed disability also fell by 71%. These results provide a new installment in what has been afascinating history for an antibody madein Cambridge in 1979 by ProfessorHerman Waldmann in the Departmentof Pathology. Campath was the firstantibody to be 'humanised' - atechnique pioneered by Dr Greg Winterat the Medical Research CouncilLaboratory of Molecular Biology thatminimises the risk of the drug beingrejected as foreign when given to patients. Because the drug destroyswhite blood cells, it has been principallyused to treat adult leukaemia, a diseasein which abnormal white blood cellsbuild up and fatally 'crowd out' normal,healthy blood cells. This lymphocyte-destroying ability is now being exploited to destroy the perpetrators of havoc in MS. Surprisingly, given that the drug is known to destroy white blood cells,infections were only slightly morecommon after treatment with Campath.Instead, the development of anotherautoimmune disease - usually affectingthe thyroid gland - proved to be themajor, and unexpected, complication. All in the timing Although Campath's potential as atreatment for MS was first considered 18 years ago in Cambridge, earlyattempts to treat patients who hadalready reached the secondaryprogressive stage failed to improve theirworsening disabilities. It seems that it'sall in the timing. The results of this lateststudy have shown that the drug mustbe given early, before the destruction ofthe myelin sheath has advanced to thepoint that secondary damage to theunderlying nerves continues unabated.Not only does this strategy head offsustained accumulation of disability butit also allows some existing damage toget better, a factor not seen in anyprevious clinical trials. Expectations arehigh that the Phase 3 trials, now inprogress, will lead to drug registrationwithin a few years.

Damage to the nervous system lies at the rootof the devastationcaused by multiplesclerosis andParkinson's diseaseNew hopes for thenervoussystemIssue 8 | Spring 2009 | 25FEATURES DR JON HERAS, EQUINOX GRAPHICS (WWW.E-NOX.NET)The way a common virus hijacks the cell it infects could hold theclue to combating Parkinson'sdisease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases inthe elderly population. Usually diagnosedafter the age of 50, PD has a prevalencethat is rising as the average populationage increases, with about 120,000 peoplecurrently affected in the UK. The diseaseresults from loss of the cells that producedopamine, a chemical that relays signalsfrom one neuron to another in the brain.Without this neurotransmitter, debilitatingneurological symptoms ensue, includingimpaired walking, talking, swallowing and speech. Although the processes leading to neuronal death in PD are not fullyunderstood, indications from experimentswith neurotoxins point towards a role formitochondria, the energy-producingpowerhouses of cells. It seems likely thatthe neuronal cell death and degenerationof neurological functions are a result ofimpaired mitochondrial function,particularly of an enzyme known asComplex I that provides the first step inthe chain that coverts food energy intochemical energy. Protecting the powerhouse Cell death isn't always a bad thing. Timelyand regulated cell death is crucial for thecorrect development of some tissues andis also an important defence mechanismagainst invading pathogens. For thisreason, many viruses have evolved ways to keep cells alive until the viralreplication cycle is completed. Humancytomegalovirus (HCMV), a type ofherpesvirus, is an expert at this. BecauseHCMV needs 4-5 days to complete itsreplication cycle, it encodes several pro-life genes that hijack cellular functions tokeep the cell alive throughout the stresses of the infection cycle. Molecular virologists in Professor John Sinclair's group in the Department ofMedicine have long been interested inthe machinations of this virus. Recentresearch took a surprising turn when theydiscovered that one product of HCMV - a piece of ribonucleic acid (RNA) thatdoesn't even encode a protein - targetsmitochondria and protects Complex Ifrom stress-induced dysfunction. Couldthis viral neuronal cells fromthe type of neurodegeneration observedin PD?Pro-life therapeutic With recent funding from the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research,Professor Sinclair's group is nowinvestigating how to translate the basicvirological function discovered in HCMVinto a novel therapeutic. Experiments are being designed in collaboration with Dr Roger Barker andProfessor Maria Grazia Spillantini at theCambridge Centre for Brain Repair, part ofthe Department of Clinical Neurosciences,with the aim of preventingneurodegeneration in models of PD bydelivering the viral RNA directly to thebrain. Such approaches are difficult as thebrain is protected by the blood-brainbarrier, which restricts the passage ofvarious chemicals and microscopicobjects (such as bacteria) from the bloodto the brain. However, some viruses suchas rabies are not only able to overcomethis barrier but can also specifically targetneuronal cells by expressing a proteinthat binds to them; even a smallpolypeptide fragment of this protein issufficient. The researchers have generated a complex comprising the HCMV RNA andthe rabies polypeptide, and results arealready indicating that it protectsneuronal cells in the Petri dish from celldeath. By engineering this polypeptide tobind RNA even more tightly, the hope isthat it might deliver its RNA cargo to thebrain after injection into the bloodstream.This would be a fascinating example oftranslational biology - takingobservations of the basic molecularanalysis of virus infection and extendingthem to therapeutic solutions forneurodegeneration.

Professor John Sinclair26| Issue 8 | Spring 2009The study of personality can be traced back over two millennia but it wasn'tuntil the early 1990s that an empiricallyderived framework for studyingpersonality became widely accepted inthe scientific community. Decades ofresearch involving hundreds ofthousands of individuals revealed fivebroad dimensions of personality. Theseso-called Big Five dimensions -Extraversion, Agreeableness,Conscientiousness, Neuroticism andIntellect - provided a basic model forconceptualising and measuringpersonality. We know a fair amount about the antecedents and consequences of thefive dimensions. Evidence from studiesof identical twins suggests that the BigFive have a substantial genetic basis.There is evidence that the dimensionsexist in different parts of the world. And numerous studies have shown that differences between individuals are associated with important lifeoutcomes, from academic andoccupational success, to marital stability and physical health. One question that we know less about concerns the geographicdistribution of personality. Are the BigFive personality dimensions evenlydistributed across the globe, or are theygeographically clustered? National andregional stereotypes would have usthink that there are importantgeographic personality differences. Butdo such stereotypes have any basis inreality? Mapping personality Ongoing research by Dr Jason Rentfrow,at the Department of Social andDevelopmental Psychology, and Dr Sam Gosling, at the University of Texas, aims to examine geographicvariation in personality. In a large-scaleproject partially funded by the USNational Science Foundation (NSF), datacollected by online survey from overthree-quarters of a million individuals inthe USA revealed that personalities arenot randomly distributed but areclustered into distinct geographicpatterns. It seems that residents of the Mid-Atlantic and New England states are relatively stressed, irritable anddepressed, whereas West Coast residentsare more emotionally stable, relaxed andcalm than the rest of the country. Thetwo coasts are quite similar on othertraits, though. Traits associated withintellect, such as creativity, imagination,and openness, are higher in theNortheast and West Coast than in theCentral and Southern states, wherepeople are more pragmatic,straightforward and traditional.Compared with the rest of the country,residents of the Central and Southernstates are also more neighbourly, friendlyand generous. One particularly important discovery is that the prevalence of certainpersonality traits is associated with arange of important geographicindicators. In states where rates ofneuroticism are high, life expectanciesare short and rates of cancer, heartdisease, stroke and diabetes are high. Insuch places, residents are also lesssocially connected than in regionswhere people are more emotionallystable. In regions where intellect is high,more patents are produced per capitaand more people work in the arts,technology and R&D than in places FEATURES The new geography of personality Jason Rentfrow explains how analysis of over three-quarters of a million online surveys has been used to build a 'personality map' of the USA.Issue 8 | Spring 2009 | 27FEATURES DR KEVIN STOLARICK AND PAULO RAPOSO, THE MARTIN PROSPERITY INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Personality heat maps showing the geographic distributions of the Big Five dimensions: left to right, Neuroticism, Intellect, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Extraversion; areas in red have high concentrations of each trait and areas in blue have low concentrations where intellect is low. The prevalence of traits associated with agreeableness,such as warmth, generosity andfriendliness, is linked to lower crime rates- people are more trusting in safeplaces. Do birds of a feather flock together? One explanation for the geographic clustering of personality traits is selectivemigration - the idea that people chooseto live in places that meet their needs.Concerns about safety, job opportunitiesand the quality of schools factor intosome people's decisions about where tolive. So it's reasonable to expect thataspects of personality also filter into thedecision. Consider, for instance, thefinding that large cosmopolitan citieshave disproportionately large numbersof people who are open, creative andintellectual. It's likely that such peoplemigrate to cosmopolitan cities preciselybecause those cities afford a multiplicityof choices with which to satisfy theirneeds for stimulation and diversity. Another explanation is social influence. There's a wealth of empiricalevidence that attitudes, opinions andemotions are contagious. So it isconceivable that the clustering ofneuroticism, for instance, is a result ofemotional contagion. In places withdisproportionately large numbers ofpeople who are anxious, irritable andtense, others 'catch' some of thatnegative affect simply through regularcontact. A third explanation is environmental influence. As in the case of socialinfluence, features of the physicalenvironment could affect thepersonalities of individuals within agiven region. Climate, for instance, has a significant effect on the types ofactivities in which people within aregion can engage. In warm climatespeople spend more time outside andhave more contact with larger varietiesof people than those in colder climates.Research on seasonal affective disorderindicates that in regions that receivelittle direct sunlight during certain partsof the year residents are prone todepression and anxiety. Aspects of aregion's physical environment might notonly shape the psychologicalcharacteristics of the residents, butmight also provide incentives for settlingor migrating. Magnet or melting pot? Understanding regional personalitydifferences can inform our knowledge ofwhat makes regional development tick -why it is that some regions prosperwhile others struggle. Social scientistshave argued that technology, humancapital and community are essentialingredients for economic and socialprosperity. But it now appears that wehave another set of useful ingredientswith which to work. It will be informativeto examine how the Big Five aredistributed in other countries andwhether the processes connecting traitsand geographic indicators are similar. Personality captures an individual's behavioural tendencies, emotionalityand capacity to acquire newinformation. It has been shown topredict important life outcomes, such asoccupational success, longevity andsocial connectedness. So it's not too farfetched for the aggregate personalitiesof thousands of individuals to play asignificant role on a geographic scale.Indeed, it makes sense that more innovation and discovery occurs inplaces with high concentrations ofintellectual people because pushingknowledge to the limit requires curiosityand imagination. It also makes sensethat rates of disease and mortality arelower in places where people areemotionally stable becausepsychological health is a keydeterminant of physical health. Butwhich came first? This research, like most, raises more questions than it answers. Are regionslike magnets, attracting certain peopleand repelling others? Or, are they likemelting pots, infusing the beliefs, valuesand customs of their inhabitants? Wedon't yet know the answers to thesequestions, but the new geography ofpersonality provides a map that maydirect us to the answers.

But fewperhaps understand the scale of thechallenges posed by the project.Accelerating beams of protons towithin a whisker of the speed of light,around a tunnel the size of LondonUnderground's Circle Line, in a vacuumas empty as intergalactic space andcolliding them together every 25nanoseconds to re-create theconditions just after the universe was formed is just the start... Hunting for Higgs The scientific goals of the LHC areextremely ambitious - no less than theuntangling of some of the longeststanding mysteries of physics relatingto the innermost structure of matter.One of the key endpoints is todetermine, finally, whether the mass offundamental particles is due to the long-sought-after Higgs mechanism.According to the Standard Model ofparticle physics, the Higgs mechanismexplains how mass-less particlesacquire mass and, for the theory to becorrect, the hypothetical Higgs bosonparticle must be shown to exist. The aim also is to search for phenomena beyond the StandardModel: seeking to explain why theuniverse contains so little antimatter;searching for supersymmetric particles,which may be a source of dark matter;and even exploring whether we live ina universe with hidden dimensions.With these advances, it may even bepossible to create and study tiny blackholes within the laboratory.

But what iscertain is that the results will transformour fundamental understanding of the Centre for Scientific Computing High-level computing of the sort required to analyse data created by the LHC is embedded in many research activities in the physical and biomedical sciences. It might be driven by the ability to collect enormous datasets, such as for theLHC, or by a requirement to analyse huge gene banks or medical records as quickly as possible, or to process datadelivered from satellites or environmental sensors. In Cambridge, high-level computing resources have been brought together under the Centre for Scientific Computing (CSC) with the goals of linking research projects in diverse disciplines, encouraging the sharing of resources,consolidating intellectual activities and transferring skills. CSC is a federated initiative that encompasses the High-Performance Computing Service (HPCS) , which is one of the largest academic supercomputers in the UK; the eScience Centre , which supports eScience projects involving scientists and industry using Grid-enabled applications (e.g. CamGrid ) in the Cambridge region; and teaching at the MPhil level.

The archive is among the richestin the world for the study of polarenvironments but is extremely fragile,and for the past two years a team at SPRI have been working to capture and preserve over 20,000 of theirphotographic negatives. Now nearingcompletion, the JISC-funded project willbe available online as Freeze Frame,opening up this unparalleled resource to those wishing to discover the historyof polar exploration for themselves. The heroic age Spanning 1845-1982, the imagesrepresent the great wealth of history ofexploration and embrace some of themost iconic photographs of their time:the men, their ships, sledges andskidoos; tents, huts and rations;equipment for survival and for scientificinvestigation; as well as stunning imagesof the Arctic and Antarctic landscapes.The collection includes photographer Herbert Ponting's entire visual archive(some 1700 glass plates) taken onCaptain Robert Falcon Scott's Expedition(1910-1913) to reach the South Pole.Also featured are images from ErnestShackleton's valiant attempt in 1915 toachieve the first land-crossing of theAntarctic, and the only knowndaguerreotypes of Sir John Franklin andhis crew, taken in 1845 prior to theirfateful voyage in search of theNorthwest Passage. Promoting research The collection provides a record of theliving conditions and the scientificefforts of the men involved in polarexploration. This is an invaluableresource to researchers who areinterested in exploring the history ofextreme physiology and humanendurance, such as Dr Vanessa Heggiefrom the Department of History andPhilosophy of Science. Dr Heggie will beusing the Freeze Frame materials as shestarts work on a project examining theexperiments and observations that wereundertaken on various trips to the poles, since these were central to someof the earliest understandings of howthe human body reacts to lowtemperatures. This type of research has diverse applications, fromimproving the provision of emergencymedical aid during natural disasters to designing medical supervision for ultra-endurance sports. Freeze Frame Growing public interest in changes tothe polar ice caps, as well as theforthcoming centenaries of the 'HeroicAge' expeditions, have provided theimpetus for SPRI to promote researchinto its collections. In so doing, thisvisual archive will be accessible to aglobal audience, from schoolchildren inNunavut and northern Greenlandinvestigating their polar heritage, touniversity researchers with an interest inthe development of polar technologies,physiology at low temperatures or thechanging shape of the cryosphere. Digitisation of related documents - personal journals and official expeditionreports - will provide historical andcultural context. Many of the images areunpublished, having been rediscoveredwithin private albums and personalcollections. A series of interpretative web pages and e-learning resources will provide access to these hiddencollections for all educational levels.

Have you ever had a Eureka moment? Occasionally people make throwawaycomments that stop you dead in yourtracks (in fact these frequently becometitles of my papers!). My first 'Aha!' momenthappened in 1979 when an Inupiat whalersaid that itself wife' . of hunter-gatherergroups and, yet, Inupiat whalers regard thewhale as giving itself as a gift to thecommunity via the Captain's wife. With thisone comment, everything fell out of placeand I realised my assumptions abouthunting as well as gender had been wrong.As an anthropologist this is what I look for- what surprises me, what doesn't fit, whatchallenges received wisdom. What's the best piece of advice you've ever been given?That you have to be realistic about what itis you can know based on what you'velearned. This was advice I was given by anInupiat woman when I was writing areport and feeling the pressure togeneralise. She brought me down to Earthby telling me not to get fussed aboutdiscovering the nature of the world, butinstead to stay focused on being true to theinformation I had gathered. If you could wake up tomorrow with a new skill, what would it be?Recently I've thought that perhaps I'd like tobe a volcanologist. All the regions I studyare profoundly affected by seismic activityand I'm fascinated by volcanoes, in termsof what they can do and how people thinkabout them. What motivates you to go to work each day?It's the thought that I am doing somethingin which it makes a difference that I'm theone who's doing it. I don't mean that tosound megalomaniac but to emphasise that I want my work to require somethingof who I am. You spend most of your lifeworking, so it's vital that there's a real 'sowhat?' element to what you do. It'simportant to me that my relationshipsmake a difference to what I'm doing.People in the Arctic communities know meas Barbara, who happens to be ananthropologist, and I think this must helpmy credibility when I talk to them. Myresearch has always included localcollaboration, with a specific goal thatthere is a local end benefit - whether it'sfacilitating environmental educationclasses taught by local folks, or promotingrecognition of local expertise. The 'so what?' of it all is as much about whathappens locally as whether I'll get apublication out of it. What is your favourite research tool? Mainly, it's being able to talk to people. ButI think any kind of social science dependson the dedication to use as many tools aspossible - combining personal in-depthinterviews with listening to people, takingpart in what they do, analysing censusdata and going into the archives to findletters written 100 years ago. Whatanthropology has to offer is the possibilityof working in the same communities foryears - as well as having the chance towork in a different part of the worldaltogether. With any luck, that means yourinitial impressions and assumptions willget dashed to bits! Dr Barbara Bodenhorn At first glance, reasons for researching locations as different as the Arctic and Mexico are not self-evident. But comparison is atthe core of Social Anthropology and, for Dr Barbara Bodenhorn,a dual focus on these remarkably different environments isshaping a cross-cultural exchange programme between youngmembers of three indigenous communities. INSIDE OUTIN FOCUS Towards a sustainable energy economy Research in the Electricity Policy Research Group (EPRG) isproviding world-class analysisfor an industry faced with majorchanges in the years ahead.The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) supports researchfrom across the social sciences, fromsociology to anthropology, throughto statistics, methods and computing. As global energy resources decline and concerns over climate change increase,how the UK and other countries produceand supply electricity has become ofcritical importance. In Cambridge, theEPRG is a focus for appliedinterdisciplinary research into theelectricity supply industry. The EPRG was launched in 2005 with \u00a32.38 million funding under the joint UKResearch Council initiative 'Towards aSustainable Energy Economy (TSEC)' ,which is supported by the Economic andSocial Research Council (ESRC), the Gender equality in modern times The largest multidisciplinaryresearch network of its kindin the UK is investigatingwhy gender equality is still a pressing social issue in the 21st century. The Gender Equality Network (GeNet)links academics from eight UK institutionswho are conducting empirical researchon gender equality. Funded since 2004with \u00a33 million from the Economic andSocial Research Council (ESRC), theNetwork is coordinated by ProfessorJackie Scott, from Cambridge's 32| Issue 8 | Spring 2009 The ESRC's aim is to equip the UK with the knowledge and evidence needed to prosper in a demanding and unpredictable world: whether it's tackling economicand social problems, making the most of business opportunities, improving theimpact of education strategies, or understanding global uncertainties. A third of the ESRC budget (\u00a356 million in 2007/2008) is allocated to postgraduate studentships, to strengthen future research by training the nextgeneration of social scientists, and nearly two-thirds (\u00a3105 million in 2007/2008) isallocated to research. Cambridge benefits from ESRC support across many departments. The two projects highlighted here are the Electricity Policy Research Group (EPRG) and theGender Equality Network (GeNet). Other examples of some of the larger ESRC-funded projects in Cambridge include: A three-year, \u00a31.1 million project is exploring the potential of emerging semantic web technologies to support teaching and learning. Jointly funded by the ESRCand the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under theTechnology Enhanced Learning Programme, the 'Ensemble' project is led by Dr Patrick Carmichael in the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies (CARET) . Issues of international collaboration, knowledge transfer and capacity building in biomedical science and bioethics are being addressed by a three-year study inthe Department of Social Anthropology led by Professor Marilyn Strathern and Dr Monica Konrad. The ESRC has contributed \u00a31.2 million to support the study. The Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study, led by Professor Per-Olof Wikstr\u00f6m in the Institute of Criminology , has been awarded \u00a32.6 million over five years to contribute to a better understanding of the causesof young people's involvement in crime. A \u00a32.5 million, five-year grant 'Conflict in Cities' led by Dr Wendy Pullan in the Department of Architecture is investigating how cities that have been torn apart by ethnic unrest or war may regenerate. The Centre for Public Health Research Excellence in Diet and Physical Activity at the Institute of Public Health is providing the evidence base for improving diet and physical activity across the population. Funding was providedunder the umbrella of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC), apartnership of funders administered by the ESRC, which together have invested\u00a320 million over five years to establish five Centres of Excellence in the UK. The UK Innovation Research Centre (UK IRC) is a recently announced collaborative venture between the Centre for Business Research at JudgeBusiness School and Imperial College Business School to research into howinnovation can make businesses more competitive. The Centre is part of a widerinitiative that will receive \u00a35 million over the next five years from its partnerfunders, which includes the ESRC. For more information on these and other ESRC-funded projects, please visit www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.ukElectricity Policy Research GroupIN FOCUS Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the NaturalEnvironment Research Council (NERC).The remit of this initiative is to findreliable, affordable, safe and low-carbonways to supply the growing demand forenergy. Electricity policy research in Cambridge in fact stretches back to 1990,at the very start of the liberalised UKelectricity industry. Since then,Cambridge researchers have benefitedfrom almost two decades of supportfrom the ESRC and, with the launch ofthe EPRG, have formed one of only threeenergy research groups in the UK to beawarded ESRC Research Group status,giving them the stability of five years offunding. Professor David Newbery, Director of the EPRG, leads a core research team of12 from the Department of Economicsand Judge Business School. Togetherwith PhD students and Associates fromdepartments across Cambridge andother universities, the Group numbers in excess of 30. The Group's contribution to the TSEC initiative addresses three key themes:delivering reliable and safe energy in aliberalised market (Professor Newbery and Dr Michael Pollitt); investigating thebenefits of strategically deploying newlow-carbon energy technologies and the economic impact of carbon emissionpolicies (Dr Karsten Neuhoff ); andresearching social and political attitudesto energy policy, as well as governanceprocesses (Drs William Nuttall and David Reiner). A key component of the Group's research - the 'feet-on-the-ground' aspectas Professor Newbery puts it - isengagement with stakeholders throughthe Energy Policy Forum, directed by Dr Pierre No\u00ebl. By bringing togetheracademics with leaders in the electricityindustry, regulators and policy makers, theForum encourages the identification of real-world problems and plausible solutions.Commenting on the EPRG, Professor Newbery said: 'We are delighted to havebeen given this extraordinaryopportunity to contribute to a major UKinitiative. It allows us to engage in andinfluence an energy policy debate thatwill have impact for the next 50 years.' Professor David Newbery Department of Sociology in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences. 'Society today is witnessing an ongoing paradigm shift in genderrelations,' said Professor Scott. 'We havegone beyond the male breadwinner/female homemaker post-war family.Dramatic changes have taken place inthe workforce and enormous progresshas been made in policy, but a gapremains in women's attainment in theworld of paid work, and this relates to theunequal division of unpaid work in thehome.' Nine projects funded through the Network ask questions such as why hasthe gender wage gap proved so difficultto overcome? Do women who play anequal role in the workforce do so at theexpense of family life? How have careerpaths for men and women changedacross the generations? What are youngpeople's aspirations for gender equality? How do families trade off conflictsbetween time and money? What stepshave corporations taken to supportequity goals? In Cambridge, Professor Simon Deakin, Programme Director in theCentre for Business Research at JudgeBusiness School, is addressing genderinequality through progressive humanresource management in the workplace.And Professor Scott is examining shifts in public opinion about women'swork-family balance. 'I'm a tremendous fan of Network grants,' said Professor Scott. 'From the verystart, all members bought into the goalof talking to each other, informing eachother's work and contributing to jointoutputs. The Network has given us thecritical mass and diverse expertiseneeded to create a really strong factualunderstanding of gender equalities, what choices we make as adults, and how wemight shape our children's lives at thestart of the 21st century.'

This is an unnatural state forwomen, as Dr Stephen Charnock-Jones,from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, explained: 'Thenatural state for woman during thechild-bearing years is either pregnant or lactating. It is only with theintroduction of birth control and adecrease in infant mortality that amodern woman can control her fertility and also expect to see herchildren reach adulthood.' For many women, this increase in menstrual cycles is associated withadditional distress due to endometriosis,a disease in which endometrial tissue -the lining of the uterus - also occursoutside the uterine cavity, mostcommonly within the pelvis.Endometriosis is found at a higherfrequency in patients presenting withinfertility.The wide range of symptoms make it difficult either to define the underlyingcause or to identify a model that drugcompanies could use to develop drugs.Ethical considerations limit research inhumans and primates; although somemouse models exist, each has significantlimitations and, as a result, diseasestudies are difficult to undertake andresults are hard to interpret. Dr Charnock-Jones and colleagues have generated a novel endometriosisallograft mouse model, recentlypatented through Cambridge EnterpriseLtd, in which cells are sourced from agenetically modified mouse andtransplanted into another mouse. Afterimplantation, the hormone-treatedendometrial tissue grows and therecipient mouse develops characteristicendometriosis lesions and associatedblood vessels. For the first time, this model of endometriosis reproduces themechanism that is thought to underlie the human disease, allowing scientiststo investigate the cellular and molecularmechanisms responsible. This is asignificant step forward as the modelwill help in the screening anddevelopment of new therapeutics. A solution will not be found overnight. The condition imposes asignificant burden on the suffererbecause surgical and medicaltreatments are only moderatelyeffective. However, for the millions ofwomen who suffer worldwide, there isnow a glimmer of hope.
