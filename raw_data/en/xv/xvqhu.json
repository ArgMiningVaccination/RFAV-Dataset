The Mumbai-based research organisation Vedic lifesciences achieves the NutraIngredients award for nutrition research product, with their submission proving the studied supplement to could enhance the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers and stakeholders are reacting to new research that contradicts two previous meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials that found vitamin D to have a protective shield against respiratory illnesses. A doctor diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 20 years ago at the age of 16, is so determined to help others with health issues he has carved a career in research, created a company and recently launched two products that promote immune health. In a year dominated by COVID-19, the countdown for 2021 has been dominated by stories about the gut, vitamins, minerals and anything else linked to supporting immune health and warding off the virus' effects. The International Alliance of Dietary/Food Supplement Associations (IADSA) is underlining the link between inadequate vitamin D levels and a higher risk of falling with its online resource that highlights nutrition's role in vulnerable populations. The UK's current threshold for vitamin D sufficiency (25 nmol/L 25(OH)D) is not supported by evidence and a higher threshold of 50 nmol/L, achievable by supplementation with at least 800 IU per day should be urgently promoted, according to a new... Nutrasource, a Canada-based contract research organization, quickly adapted to the pandemic by implementing regulations and best practices to continue running human trials. The company's president and CEO, Will Rowe, and Josh Baisley, VP of clinical... Researchers have highlighted nutrition as a possible factor influencing the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, as recent news establishes a link between vitamin D levels and an adequate immune response. The clamour to add vitamin D to the COVID-19 fight took a step back this week as a UK Member of Parliament (MP), who cited a study suggesting the active form was effective against the virus, faced much criticism among researchers. The health and nutrition market experts at HMT (Healthy Marketing Team) have launched their annual 'Gamechangers' report to help industry players tap into trends as they move from niche to mass market appeal. In response to the pandemic, UK firm Westomatic has made available a new contactless drinks dispenser that can mix up and distribute protein shakes along with a number of sports nutrition-based beverages. The pandemic presents an exciting opportunity for food manufacturers to innovate products targeting consumers who believe access to affordable food should not come at the cost of health and good nutrition. One of the reasons COVID-19 is so unsettling is because the virus' impact on each individual is so different. Researchers say a number of factors could impact this \u2014 including age, race, gender and an underlying mechanism. M-Gard is yeast-derived beta glucans (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that work immune-enhancing agent. The natural yeast beta 1,3/1,6 glucan was developed by using a proprietary process that extracts the ingredient from the cell wall of a proprietary... The international team behind a new global analysis caution that highly variable childhood nutrition may lead to stunted growth and a rise in childhood obesity\u2014 factors that could affect a child's health their entire life. The dietary supplement market has been flooded with new products, with an unprecedented demand in immune health. A recent Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)-IPSOS survey found that vitamin D usage jumped 37% and zinc grew 17% amid the pandemic. About 70% of the immune system is housed in the gut, so it's no wonder probiotic bacteria have been shown to have a number of beneficial immune and health effects. With a pandemic playing out before us and immune-supporting ingredients at the forefront,... The recent webinar \"The Human Microbiome and COVID-19: Investigating a Potential Connection\" offered an exclusive look into a pioneering clinical investigation that wrapped up in August. The research is being led by Dr. Martin J. Blaser, Henry... When it comes to discussing immunity and other health claims, marketers have to be cautious, especially in the current climate. A recent National Advertising Division (NAD) decision stated this is an \"unprecedented time\" and declared it would fulfill... Over 70% of Americans take dietary supplements, and by now, most consumers have probably noticed the disclaimer that says \"This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" There is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat COVID19 but everyone should consider taking vitamin D supplements if they are in lockdown, the UK government has announced. Within this global health and economic crisis lies opportunity for supplements offering great value for money but companies must act now to flourish, according to a recent webinar from private label supplement developer PharmaLinea Ltd. The unpredictable spikes in demand that are distorting the supply chain in the current crisis has created another opportunity, in this case for herbal ingredients that help adults deal with urinary incontinence issues. It is \"inconceivable\" that immunity will not remain high on the list of health priorities when this pandemic ends and now is the time to create more \"convincing experiences\" to ensure trial turns into adoption, according to food and...
