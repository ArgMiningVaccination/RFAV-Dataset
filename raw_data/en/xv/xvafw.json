I feel like I won't be able to drag myself any longer. My body can't take medicines. Whatever medicines I've taken has made my condition worse since November. Had I not taken any, I'm sure I would've been out of it by now. I'm having constant boughts of endong it all. I can't breathe since November. It's mostly uneasy. I went to 2 Cardio and both didn't find any issue in my heart. They say it's anxiety but I know it isn't. They gave me beta blockers back then. It just made my body all the more bad. Stopped taking it then but my heart never went back to nomal. My chest shakes when beating. I don't think I can cling in to living such a life forever. It's been 6 months now and I don't see any improvement from past 5 months. The 1st month I was still better say about 75-85% good back then. These doctors have ruined my life. I can't take this anymore! I don't know what to do. I can't just sit on ocer it and expect it to go away on it's own. Tried Ayurveda medicines on 1st March. Haven't seen any improvement yet. They say these natural herbs take time. Some take 6 months or more too to show improvement. I'd go dead by then anyway. Sorry for pouring it out here but I don't know what to do. I thought of ending it so many times but I didn't kniw how to do it and didn't even have the courage to do it. I rather end my life than just living like this. I just don't know how to do it. I was all good before getting injected. I feel I've murdered myself. Might as well end the body when my soul is already trapped. Dr told me to try L Glutamine which is a good supplement. Not much luck. Tried probiotics with no results. Have you tried famotadine or prilosec. Helps some people. But vax treatment is hard. Just a quick comment on the \"donating blood to feel better\" idea: remember that whatever was floating around in your body due to the vaccine, whatever toxic particles are in there will unfortunately end up in whatever innocent person happens to be unlucky enough to recieve the blood transfusion Whether it's spike proteins or micro-bloodclots or whatever else is in there, just something to think about Anyone here take J and J vax. And have some recovery ? What were your symptoms and how long and what did you take and do for relief ? Suffered with headaches dizziness, brain fog, mild tinnitus, vertigo, out of focus vision, and occasional anxiety with heart palpations for five weeks. The intensity varied, but was near constant. What snapped me out of it was a mild sinus cold. As my nose started to run and my throat started to hurt, my head started to clear. I had a few bad days after that, but my symptoms subsided. I still have mild tinnitus, and my balance is not what it used be. Lately I have been having mild dizzy spells and vertigo again. I hope with time this will go away. I will never get a booster. - Vitamin D - Vitamin C - NAC (N-acetylcysteine) - Ivermectin - Nigella seed - Quercetin - Zinc - Magnesium - Curcumin - Milk thistle extract But no idea if all of this is super helpful. I think first 3 are very useful. Guys i am past my 6 weeks, and it is horrible. One day is ok, and the next 2 days are bad. We are indeed in living Hell. I am just wondering what circles this vacc is doing. I started 2 days ago SSRI antidepressiva, which means my next 2 weeks will also be very nightmarish because of the SSRI antidepressiva till the body gets used to it. This is really a day to day battle. Nothing else somehow matters. Last night I hade once again Insomnia. And bingo this could eaxtly be the sideeffect of the SSRI. The SSRI sideeffects seem pretty close to the vacc sideeffects. Holy Jesus this will be a very tough 2 weeks. After 2 weeks (lets hope 2 weeks, some sy 3 weeks) the SSRI sideeffects sould vanish. Biggest problem is that I can not get my brain/thinking to anything else than anxiety, symptoms, restlessness and very dark toughts about dying. Too bad , that I am such a weak person with a weak willpower. An now Insomnia is back Guys thats why I asked not donating blood but get a blood wash (a hemodialysis): Has anyone tested a blood wash (a hemodialysis)? As far as I know people with long Covid get a hemodialysis to help them recover. hemodialysis ias also great against inflammation. \"Extended hemodialysis (HDx), with medium cut-off membranes, could favor the effective elimination of medium-sized molecules such as IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators\" But on the other hand, only washing he blood will not be sufficient to get a big effect, since the spikes and inflammations are (more or less) everywhere in the body. Do you also have this Zero Appetite issue. I have no clue where this zero appetite issue comes from. Is it the braininflammation that says your apetite is restriced. Or it i\u00e9vn the anxiety) Or the GI? I do not understand how stubborn this loss of appetite is. I have passed 6 weeks and still zero appetite. anyone had loss of appetite and the apppetite came back, can tell me how long did it take? If anyone has a clue about it and how to solve the problem please tell me. have literally to push food into my mouth and very often my throat is also swollen too, which makes eating even worse. But the swollen throat issue also have some people. I too am having GI issues however no loss of appetite . Just keep losing weight 20 lbs . So far and I eat like I used too ??? Hope this weight thing stops soon.weird gurgling and rumblings in stomach have been persistent for a least month . [@jtranger](https://vestibular.org/participant/jtranger/) I haven't tried anything but supplements. Just don't know whether to go to GI doctor or not. I do t know what to do but I know I'm tired of being sick. [@watis](https://vestibular.org/participant/watis/) you are in no way weak. This is very hard mentally and physically on all of us. We all suffer in many ways. I suffer from insomnia too and was put on an anxiety medicine and now I can't get off of it . Sometimes you sleep and sometimes you don't and it takes awhile for me to recover the next day when you only get a couple hours of sleep. It's hard to function each day not knowing what you will feel like the next day. It I still pray that we all will recover. [@jtranger](https://vestibular.org/participant/jtranger/) yes that's what I thought. But I don't know about you but sometimes I feel weak with not enough sleep and the weight loss. Did you ever take antihistamines or prednisone or anything? Anyone dealing with severe high blood pressure as result of vaccine and if so what has worked for you? I'm 2 months post 2nd moderna booster (4th shot). Yes, crazy. Didn't realize there was downside to vaccine and did not want to get Omnicron. Within days of getting shot in Jan, blood pressure started soaring. To date, I'm on 2 meds and BP is still spiking to 160/105 regularly and mostly stays stuck in the 148 - 159 range. Besides BP, also have burning skin sensations in arms and upper chest, sometimes tingling in face/lips, twitching right ear whenever it brushes against anything or reacts to loud noises, a rash that comes and goes on abs and upper back, and some strange white dots (hypopigmentation) spots on chest; oh and major insomnia. The BP is most concerning right now and not sure I'm going to survive this to recover. The burning sensations and insomnia are definitely the other major issues that bother me. Only upside to all of this is because of the resistant high blood pressure, the doctors are taking post vaccine reaction seriously. I just got results from IncellDX (Dr Patterson / Covid Long Haulers) cytokine panel and it flagged me high on: TNF-Alpha (more than 2 times normal), IL-4 (almost 3 times normal), IFN-Gamma (twice normal), SCD40L (60% above normal limit), and VEGF (5 times normal limit!). Still waiting on results from the CellTrend autoimmune panel from Germany. Has anyone done the Dr Patterson / Covid Long Haulers treatment protocol? Curious if anyone is seeing benefit from it. Pricey for some of the meds and don't want to hurt myself but if there is a decent chance it can help, I'm willing to give it a try. My primary dr is not going to be on board with their treatments so I reached out to them for referral to doctor they work with before setting up a video consult. "}
