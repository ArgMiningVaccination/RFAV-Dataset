(a) Please describe the agency's procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment committed by or against its employees. (b) If different, please describe the agency's procedures for investigating allegations of misconduct. (c) List and describe each allegation received by the agency in FY 2020 and FY 2021 (as of January 31) and the resolution of each as of the date of your answer. (a) Agency's procedures for inve stigating allegations of sexual harassment. OSSE takes claims of sexual harassment or misconduct very seriously. O SSE's procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment, or misconduct committed by or against its employees, are consistent with the procedures set forth in Mayor's Order 2017- 313, dated December 18, 2017. In cases where claims are substantiat ed in part or in whole, OSSE will issue and implement a formal plan of action, which could result in disciplinary action up to and including adverse action and/or removal. When an allegation of sexual harassment or misconduct is made, the Sexual Harassment Officer (SHO) or alternative Sexual Harassment Officer (ASHO) is tasked with reviewing the allegation and determining a plan of action. Depending on the nature of the complaint, immediate action may be required, such as separating the alleged harasser fr om the complainant. If immediate action is not required, the SHO or ASHO must move on to interviewing the complainant, harasser, and witnesses. If any follow -up interviews are required, those interviews are scheduled accordingly. The SHO or ASHO will ga ther all evidence for evaluation, document the investigation, and then report their findings to the agency General Counsel. If further action is required against any individual based on the findings, the agency General Counsel will provide the report to a gency leadership and the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel MOLC. (b) See answer to (a) above. (c) Complaints to EEO Counselors . In FY 20, there were six (6) complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of sex (which includes sexual harassment & right to breast feed), gender identity/expression and sexual orientation received by OSSE's EEO counselors.

It is worth noting that for allegations of sexual harassment, complainant s are able to bypass EEO counseling and file a formal complaint directly with the Office of Human Rights. Additionally, complainants are able to seek EEO counseling, for any of the protected traits, outside of their own agency. These EEO matters were handl ed by the agency in accordance with policy and protocol.

What efforts has your agency made in the past year to increase transparency? Explain. Consistent with OSSE's core value of partnership, we strive to understand the needs and perspectives of our stakeholders, and we work in partnership with many others to support DC students and families. We are committed to transparency, and we are mindful of the trust placed in us to administer services fairly and honestly and operate with the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. OSSE consistently engages and communicates with leadership and personnel in our local education agencies (LEAs), community- based organization s (CBOs), schools, child care facilities and partner organizations and we have built robust communications systems to support this effort. These communications systems with our partners have been exceptionally important as we respond to the COVID -19 pandem ic. OSSE keeps partners informed through various emails going out weekly to education leaders and through the LEA Look Forward, a weekly publication from OSSE that provides information to LEAs on trainings, policy guidance, and opportunities for policy engagement. We continue to meet with leaders and staff of LEAs and CBOs on a consistent basis. Each division at OSSE conducts regular meetings with key stakeholder groups to share programmatic updates and receive feedback. A few examples of this include: chil d care providers, teachers, principals, teacher preparation programs, and data managers . We host bi -weekly early childhood stakeholder calls with child care providers to explain and obtain feedback from them on our policies. We meet with our Teacher Advisor Council and Principal Advisory Council quarterly to share programmatic information obtain their feedback. We conduct calls with LEA Data Managers on a routine basis to explain policies and procedures and obtain feedback. OSSE regularly engages with the State Board of Education in their public and working sessions on matters related to their joint functions, and the Superintendent meets monthly with leadership from the Board to ensure communication flow on policy matters . We have also regularly kept the public informed about our work to support students with disabilities. In fall of 2019, OSSE published the Students with Disabilities in DC: Landscape Analysis, to help establish a shared understanding of the current state of students with disabilities in the District. Last year, we shared this analysis with various stakeholder groups to work together on setting forth an ambitious agenda to support this vulnerable group of students, particularly during this pandemic. We also created the first -ever Special Ed ucation Resource Hub, available in seven languages, to provide parents and families information they need to know to support their student this year. The Division of Early Learning has implemented several strategies to increase support and transparency f or childcare providers and families. During the public health emergency, the Division of Early Learning implemented weekly stakeholder calls to provide updates and information or health and safety guidance, payment policies, and regulatory fixes to assist the community with safe operations, business planning and parent engagement, which transitioned to a bi-weekly basis in September 2020. The Division of Early Learning also stood up a stakeholder working group to help inform the childcare recovery and reope ning plan. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 70 The sharing and use of actionable data foundational to OSSE's work. We collect and share reliable and actionable data to inform policy decisions, empower our partners to improve, and build community understanding. Despite the pandemic, we mainta ined our data and reporting practices while accommodating the operational shifts necessary to implement remote work and learning. OSSE modified student attendance policies to accommodate distance learning, so stakeholders would have important information on student attendance during these challenging times. We updated the DC School Report Card, so stakeholders would still have access to data that empowers their decision -making. The sharing and use of actionable data foundational to OSSE's work. We collect and share reliable and actionable data to inform policy decisions, empower our partners to improve, and build community understanding. Despite the pandemic, we maintained our da ta and reporting practices while accommodating the operational shifts necessary to implement remote work and learning.

OSSE remains committed to transparency by forming strong partnerships with its stakeholders and ensuring that the public has access to accurate and actionable data on the performance of the District's schools and LEAs. We will continue publications li ke the LEA Look Forward and meet routinely with stakeholders through our established channels with child care operators, LEA leaders, LEA data managers, and members of the State Board of Education (SBOE).

What are your top five priorities for the agency? Please provide a detailed explanation for how the agency achieved or worked t oward these priorities in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Priority 1: Continuous Education Description : Communicate clear expectations to families and LEAs about what they should expect for the 20 -21 school year and provide corresponding supports to help sc hools meet them. Achievements : Public schools in the District of Columbia ended a tumultuous 2019- 20 school year amid a public health emergency and uncertainty over whether conditions would support in- person learning, distance learning, or a hybrid of bot h in the 2020- 21 school year. In an effort to ensure students continue to learn and grow in the safest environments according to health guidelines, OSSE developed a set of guiding principles to provide local education agencies (LEAs) and families with clea r and consistent expectations for continuous education in the 2020- 21 school year. The principles were intended to help LEAs develop effective and equitable continuous education plans that strive to meet the needs of all students and are developed in partn ership with families. These guiding principles also sought to help families understand what they should expect for their students and the two- way communication that schools should establish with them. All of the District's LEAs submitted plans that were re viewed by OSSE and (for charter LEAs) the Public Charter School Board. OSSE made these plans publicly available on its website and compiled a summary of model responses. Additionally, OSSE curated a list of internal and external resources to aid LEAs in the implementation of the guiding principles. Priority 2: COVID Response Description : Offer timely guidance, actionable resources, and promising practices to help LEAs respond effectively to the public health crisis. Achievements : Throughout the public health emergency, OSSE remained committed to providing accurate and timely information to the DC education community to help child development facilities, LEAs, schools and families plan effectively for reopening and recovery after cl osures related to the COVID -19 pandemic. From March through December 2020, OSSE provided critical policy updates, guidance and resources, publishing more than 1,000 documents and holding weekly technical assistance calls to help students, families, educato rs and our partners navigate a challenging school year in a dynamic public health emergency. Topics included on OSSE's Guidance and Re sources for COVID -19-related Closures and Recovery webpage range from educator licensure, grants, enrollment, assessment and attendance to planning for continuous education and virtual professional development, serving vulnerable student populations, meals guidance, information on child care subsidies, resources for higher education and more. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 84 Priority 3: Stabilize the Early Childhood Sector Description: Coordinate efforts across OSSE and external partners to support early care and education providers to promote health and safety of children and staff, provide high- quality early learning, meet families' child care needs through closures and reopenings, and promote sustainability of the early care and education sector. Achievements : In September, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the DC Child Care Provider Relief Fund, which provided $5 million in emergency operational funding to local child care facilities. As part of the District's COVID -19 recovery efforts, relief was granted to all licensed District child care providers to ensure a supply of child care for families as the public health emergency continues. Mayor Bowser, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and OSSE partnered to deliver this relief to child care pr oviders. The Washington Area Community Investment Fund managed the disbursement of program funds. OSSE also received $6 million in federal CARES Act funding for child care to support the child care sector during the public health emergency. OSSE used $1.4 million to provide emergency child care for essential workers during periods when many child care providers were closed, $1.7 million to cover increased costs of continuing subsidy payments to closed child care providers from April -September 2020, and $2.8 million for the District Road to Recovery Fund, which will provide additional emergency relief grants to child care providers with demonstrated need who meet additional priorities. Later in the year, OSSE partnered with the Low -Income Investment Fund (L IIF) to make an additional $2.8 million in emergency grants available to both subsidy and non- subsidy child care providers. Distribution of the emergency grant funds prioritized child care providers serving children and families with low incomes, as well a s underserved neighborhoods. In December, Mayor Bowser announced a new Public Health Emergency Subsidy Rate, that increased the daily, per -child payment rate for open subsidized child care providers by 32.7 percent for three months beginning December, 2020. OSSE also made personal protective equipment (PPE) available to any child care facility in the District to ensure the health and safety of staff, children and families, and help reduce the financial burden for providers. Priority 4: Special Education Description : Lay the groundwork for closing the special education achievement gap by analyzing the landscape and developing a long- term citywide agenda for change in partnership with our stakeholders. Achievements : Following the October 2019 release of O SSE's seminal Students with Disabilities in the District of Columbia Landscape Analysis , which showed growing gaps in academic performance between students with disabilities and other student groups, OSSE doubled down on its strategic plan commitment to improving academic progress for these FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 85 students and shared the agency's vision for in a Roadmap for Accelerating Outcomes for Students with Disabilities . Developed in collaboration with partners across the education space, including teachers, school lea ders, families, advocacy organizations, and colleagues at the Public Charter School Board (PCSB), DC Public Schools, and the Deputy Mayor for Education. Released in October 2020, the roadmap outlines the strategic direction and core priorities for accelerating academic progress for students with disabilities across the District. Additionally, in response to the immediate needs, OSSE partnered with families, organizations across DC and national experts in 2020 to launch a new online Special Education Resour ce Hub before the start of the 2020- 21 school year to help ensure families of students with disabilities feel equipped and empowered to support their child, in partnership with their child's school. The resource hub provides students and families with answ ers to common questions around what to expect this school year and information on how parents and family members can best support their students. Translated into multiple languages, the resources hub i s simple and accessible, offering multiple pathways for finding answers. Priority 5: Data Vision Description : Build the foundation for transforming the experience of using OSSE's data into a seamless and user -friendly process that drives program, policy and practice improvements and enable the agency to realize its mission and goals more fully . Achievements : In FY20, OSSE completed an inventory of data assets and launched an application that empowers data stewards across the agency to define critical assets and serve as a hub for users to learn about the data points they use in FY20. This work represented the beginning of a multi -year effort to transform how our data is stored, accessed, and used. While this effort is deeply behind the scenes, it is critically important to the efficient functioning of the agency, continued success of our programs, and ongoing improvements for students, parents, families, and stakeholders. Each year, OSSE collects more than 108 million data points, completes more than 700 pages of required reporting to Council, submits 200 plus reports to the U.S. Department of Education, fulfills hundreds of data requests, and executes nearly 100 external data sharing agreements. Investments in data infrastructure such as the ones described above are critical in order to improve data management practices that have not kept pace with the agency's g rowth and introduce the potential for errors and burden staff. This work will continue through the next several fiscal years and ultimately result in more modern, user -friendly, and efficient services .

(a) CFSA and OSSE info sharing. CFSA and OS SE collaborate in various ways to ensure students in foster care receive their education. The following are the various collaborative activities led by the agencies: CFSA, DCPS, OSSE Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). OSSE, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), and CFSA entered into an MOA to address specialized education services for children and youth placed in out of state placements by CFSA. The MOA clarifies each participating agency's responsibility for District of Columbia wards receiving spec ialized educational services while placed and attending schools in other jurisdictions. It is the intent of this agreement to ensure that school -aged children receiving specialized educational services receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) and a re monitored accordingly under federal and local laws and regulations. ESSA Foster Care Provision. With the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (\"ESEA\"), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (\"ESSA\") on Dec. 10, 2015, OSS E partnered with CFSA to create practical, comprehensive guidance to facilitate an LEA's ability to meet new requirements.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 97 48. (a) For fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31), how many nonresidency tips did OSSE: (1) receive; and (2) investigate? (b) How many nonresidency cases were substantiated in fiscal year 2019? Please breakdown the data by sector. (c) Of the cases that were substantiated in fiscal year 2019, what actions did OSSE take to remediate them? (d) What efforts did OSSE take to strengthen its nonresidency program in fiscal years 2019 and 2020? Include in your response what steps OSSE has taken to ensure that each family receives adequate due process and notice. (a) Nonresidency tips for FY20 -21 (to date). Investigations of non- residency allegations can be initiated by any person submitting a tip through the OSSE tip hotline, both online and via telephone, through partner agencies investigating individuals for other fraud matters (e.g., Medicaid fraud), by sharing complaints received from the public relating to student residency, and by other mediums such as the mail, email, or in-person communications with OSSE's Office of Enrollment & Residency. The overall number of tips received by OSSE is greater than the number of cases investigated by OSSE. This is primarily due to duplicate tips (e.g. a tip for the same family submitted multiple times) or tips submitted without sufficient information for OSSE to investigate. Please note that OSSE tracks cases on a school year (SY) rather than fiscal year (FY) basis and the table below reflects that practice. SY19 -20 & SY 20- 21 (as of 1/ 31/2021) Non-Residency Tips Received Year Non-Residency Tips Received SY19 -20 7/1/2019 - 6/30/2020 322 SY20 -21 to date 7/1/2020 - 1/31/20210 54 Upon receiving a tip, OSSE merges duplicate tips or sibling tips and then reviews for sufficiency of information provided. For example, some tips come in without sufficient information to begin an investigation (e.g., providing a first name but no last name). If a tip has sufficient information to move forward, it will be assigned to an investigator for investigation. In addition, investigation referrals can also come from the Enrollment Audit. Auditors flag documents that appear altered or suspect and are further examined by investigators within OSSE's Office of Enrollment and Residency. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 98 The table below provides the number of cases OSSE is currently investigating or has investigated to date. A single case involving related students can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case if the students are attend ing schools in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of cases in both sectors. SY 19 -20 & SY 20- 21 (as of 1/31/2021) Non-Residency Cases Investigated School Year DC Public Schools Cases Public Charter Schools Cases SY19 -20 7/1/2019 - 6/30/2020 246 125 SY20 -21 to date 7/1/2020 - 12/10/2021 37 30 (b) Substantiated non- residency cases in FY19. OSSE's non- residency investigations typically begin with a submitted tip or finding from the annual enrollment audit. Referrals from the annual enrollment audit and tips with sufficient information to identify the student are turned into cases and assigned an investigator. These cases are considered 'open' until a determination of resident has been made, or, in the case o f a potential non- resident, substantiated after all notifications and administrative proceedings have concluded. For cases where a student is initially determined to be a non -resident, OSSE will issue a Finding of Non- residency to the family. The family ca n either contest or accept the finding. If the family accepts, the finding becomes final and substantiated, and the parties enter into an agreement for tuition. OSSE will notify the LEA that the student is a non- resident and ineligible to remain enrolled if the original enrollment was not in compliance. Continued enrollment at the LEA may require re -application, payment of owed tuition, and completion of a valid tuition agreement. If the family contests the Finding of Non- residency, OSSE will file the request for an appeal at the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) and proceed with a mediation and continue with a hearing if the mediation is unsuccessful. The outcome at OAH will either be a concession from the family substantiating the finding of non- residency, a reversal of OSSE's initial finding of non-residency and a closing of the case, or a substantiation of its finding of non- residency through an OAH judgement.

These cases are cases that OSSE is currently still investigating. 2Open - OAH : These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding and the family appealed the finding. When appealed, these cases are referred to OAH. These cases will continue through the administrative process with the OAH for formal mediation and hearing. 3Close d - Residency verified during investigation: These cases were investigated, and student determined to be eligible to attend as a resident. 4Closed - Residency determined through Administrative Review: these cases were initially determined to be non- residen ts, but the determination was changed through the OAH mediation and hearing process. 5Substantiated - Concede: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non - Residency and the family conceded they were non -residents. 6Substantiated - Uncont ested: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non - Residency and the family failed to contest the finding within the provided timeframe. Because they did not contest the finding in the notice, OSSE's initial determination became the final decision, and these families are non -residents. If the students were still enrolled, these students were subsequently unenrolled from school. They were also issued tuition payment agreements for the relevant school year(s). 7Substantiated - OAH Decision: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding and the family appealed the finding. Neither OSSE nor the family came to an agreement during the mediation process and the case was decided through a formal hearing. 8Withdrawn: These cases involve stude nts enrolled for very short periods of time and withdrew before an investigation could be conducted. 9Duplicate : These cases were submitted more than once in the same school year. Information is consolidated and one case is moved forward while the other is closed. *A single case involving related students can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case if the students are attending schools in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of ca ses in both sectors. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 100 (c) Actions taken to remediate FY19 substantiated cases. All findings of non- residency are referred to the appropriate authorities, which may be the Office of the Attorney General, the Inspector General, and where a DC government employee is involved, the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA). The prosecution of fraud, the pursuit of a False Claims Act case, or other civil remedies lies with the Office of the Attorney General or the United States Attorney . (d) Agency's efforts to strengthen its residency fraud program in FY19 and FY20. Strengthening the Non- Residency Program OSSE is committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washington, DC residents This requires a robust system of compliance and enforcement to ensure that public schools in the District, including DC Public Schools (DCPS) and public charter schools, are available, first and foremost, to bona fide residents of the District. In FY19, OSSE released req uirements to LEAs on the electronic submission of supporting residency documents and the use of e -signatures on residency verification forms. These requirements strengthen the residency verification process while providing guidance to LEAs seeking a transi tion to electronic enrollment. For tuition collection, OSSE continues to mandate electronic agreements for all tuition -paying non-resident students. This process allows for quicker processing of agreements and ensures that all payments and agreements are made prior to the start of school. In FY19, OSSE established a partnership with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure clear enforcement of significantly delinquent payments through referral to their Central Collections Unit (OCFO - CCU). To da te, OSSE has referred $638,213.68 in outstanding debt for follow -up collection. Finally, OSSE continued its public information campaign to assist District residents with understanding the enrollment and residency process by developing a non- resident tuition guide for interested families, updating the DC residency verification form, and continuing an outreach campaign that notifies the general public on how to report potential non- residents. OSSE expanded its outreach campaign to run digital ads two times during the year - during the release of the common lottery results and the start of school. These ads not only targeted District residents, but also residents in surrounding counties. The enrollment and residency process must balance ease for families and LEAs and support for our most vulnerable families, with enforcing District laws and regulations that ensure residents have access to a free, public education. OSSE remains committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washi ngton, DC residents. We will continue to take steps to improve our practice, and look forward to working with schools, families, and the community to further improve our residency efforts. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 101 Ensuring Due Process When OSSE conducts a residency investigation, if it is not clear from the initial review of records that the student is a DC resident, and prior to issuing a determination of non- residency, OSSE contacts the family to gather additional information. An OSSE investigator will set up a time either ove r the phone or in- person to talk with the enrolling person about any questions OSSE has regarding the persons residency claim. This also allows the family to help the investigation understand complex and unique circumstances that some of our District resident's experience. In some cases, the additional information and context provided by a family does not verify District residency, and in those cases, OSSE will make a determination that the student is not a resident of the District. When a determination of non-residency is made, a detailed notice letter is sent to the parent, guardian, other primary caregiver or adult student by mail and email, if known. The detailed notice letter helps families understand why OSSE's investigation led to a finding of non- residency and explains the next steps and timeline for the administrative review process. Specifically, the detailed notice letter includes the following information: The basis of the non- resident finding; An option to request an administrative review within 10 business days; An explanation that the student may remain enrolled until a final administrative decision is made; An explanation that if a request for administrative review is not received within 10 business days, then the n on-resident finding will be the final administrative decision; and An explanation of the tuition owed in the event of a final administrative decision of non- residency and that the tuition is prorated on the time the student spent enrolled in a DC public sc hool as a non- resident . If an administrative review is requested, OSSE will refer the request for review to the Office of Administrative Hearings. The purpose of administrative review is provide families with an additional opportunity to tell their story and present evidence that proves they are a resident. First, OAH will schedule a mediation session between the two parties. In mediation, a specially - trained neutral mediator meets with the parties (the family and OSSE) and assists them to state their posi tions and to explore options to resolve the case without going to an actual evidentiary hearing. The mediator helps the parties to reach a mutually acceptable settlement of the case. All judges are qualified to mediate any case before the Office of Adminis trative Hearings. If, during mediation, OSSE agrees that the documents and information presented in mediation are sufficient to establish a student's status as a District resident, OSSE will withdraw the finding of non- residency and take no further action . If a family concedes that a student is not a resident, the non- residency finding becomes final and the parties will enter into a settlement agreement for tuition. If mediation is not successful, the matter will proceed to a full evidentiary hearing where the Administrative Law Judge will issue a final decision, which will be the final administrative decision of OSSE. The final decision that is provided by the judge will also include the statement FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 102 of appeal rights. As stated in the appeal rights, if a part y wishes to contest the decision of the judge, they have 30 calendar days from the date the decision was issued to file an appeal to the DC Superior Court. Collectively, these efforts have been sustained into FY20 and to present. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 103 49.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law about the privacy of, and access to, student education records. FERPA allows OSSE to re -disclose student -level data to third parties without parental consent under several exceptions. Most frequently, OSSE shares FERPA data under the exceptions for: Audit/evaluation (including enforcement/compliance) (also commonly referred to as \"authorized representative\"); and Research studies The table below describes OSSE's current research data agreements with governmental and non - governmental entities.

Describe OSSE's protocol to ensure that student data is protected and how this impacts responses to Freedom of Information Act requests or research requests. OSSE's policies and procedures to protect student data OSSE is committed to protecting student privacy and takes its responsibilities as the state education agency under local and federal privacy laws seriously. At the same time, OSSE is committed to facilitating access to and use of education data so that education stakeholders have high- quality information for decision- making. To meet both of these goals, OSSE has taken a robust approach to codifying policies and procedures to ensure the protection of student information, and to build the agency's capacity around data privacy, security, and confidentiality. Dedicating resources and supporting ongoing efforts OSSE has a data governance and privacy team within the Division of Data, Assessment, and Research that is charged with overseeing policies, procedures, and structures that govern and protect student data. To meet this charge, the data governance and privacy team collaborates with OSSE's Office of General Counsel to develop policies and ensure compliance. Additionally, data sharing agreements are critical legal vehicles needed to share student information with third parties, while holding them accountable for keeping that information private, secure, and confidential. OSSE ensures that all contra cts and data sharing agreements comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and include additional protections for sensitive data. OSSE has created an internal tracking system for data sharing agreements and been featured nati onally for this work in accordance with FERPA. OSSE requires all third parties that receive personal identifiable information (PII) to complete a data destruction form that describes how the data received from OSSE has been destroyed, and third parties ar e required to certify that the destruction occurred after the data sharing agreement has ended, in accordance with OSSE's Data Destruction Policy . As part of continuous improvement and in an effort to better balance privacy and public transparency, OSSE adopted a new Student Privacy and Data Suppression Policy in November 2020. Under the new policy, OSSE will be able to r eport more data to the public transparently, while still rigorously protecting student privacy. This is accomplished by setting the rules for suppression of affected datasets based on the potential risk of identifying individual students. For bigger popula tions, there is lower risk to individual privacy, so less suppression is needed. For smaller populations, more data is suppressed to ensure individuals are protected. This population- based approach is ultimately more transparent than having absolute suppre ssion rules for all files, without sacrificing student privacy. More specific information about the policy, including an example illustrating it, is available on OS SE's website . FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 112 Training staff on protecting student data As cited in a recent report by the National Association of State Boards of Education , human error is a factor in 95 percent of all data security incidents. To address this, OSSE has continued to implement its data privacy training policy that includes two (2) primary components: Data Privacy Training All new employees and on- site contra ctors at OSSE must complete data privacy training within 30 days of their start date. All current employees and on- site contractors must complete data privacy training once every fiscal year. Non-Disclosure Agreement All new employees and on- site contractors at OSSE must sign a data non- disclosure agreement upon start with the organization. OSSE's human resources team must ensure all current employees and on- site contractors have a non- disclosure agreement on file. In consultation with national experts, OSSE has developed a robust training curriculum on the basics of student privacy that is used with all employees annually and has been shared with LEAs and other states. In 2018, OSSE released an online data privacy training module that included real life examples of data incidents and required all staff to complete a data privacy quiz upon completion. This year's new content is about best practices and tips for protecting privacy while working remotely. Regarding non- disclosure agreement s (NDAs), all current employees and on- site contractors signed and returned NDAs, affirming their commitment to protecting confidential information. OSSE's Human Resources Division is required to ensure all current employees and on- site contractors have a non -disclosure agreement on file. OSSE has a robust data destruction policy, which is enforced when data sharing agreements end. Stakeholders that receive individual -level under written data sharing agreements are required to submit a certificate attestin g that they have destroyed data OSSE provided. In addition, OSSE's data incident response plan provides guidance and best practices process for staff to report potential data incidents for a response to investigate and propose mitigation and other next steps. OSSE's policies and procedures to respond to data and FOIA requests OSSE has protocols in place for sharing of data as permissible by law. The release of student records/data is prohibited under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2- 534 (a)(2) and \u00a7 2- 534 (a)(6). OSSE does not fulfill request for student data through FOIA. Student data is protected through FERPA, and may only be released if it m eets one of the statutory release exemptions. OSSE believes in transparency in accordance with FOIA, but student records have heightened statutory standards under FERPA and applicable local laws. This section outlines OSSE's procedures for reviewing FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 113 and co mplying with request for records including student records when permissible by the relevant laws. General data requests The OSSE Data Request Portal serves as a centralized intake and tracking system for all requesters. In general, regardless of the type of request or requester, data request fulfillments go through a minimum of three (3) stages of quality assurance and security checks, including: Peer review in OSSE's Division of Data, As sessment and Research (DAR), where analysts review data pulled together by other analysts and ensure it meets the relevant standards, requirements, and limitations; Review and approval from DAR's Director of Data Governance and Assistant Superintendent, where data are checked for proper suppression and alignment with data sharing agreement(s); and Final approval from the Superintendent. Data requests for student records Under FERPA, parents (and guardians) and adult students have rights to request their child's education records and their own, whether for themselves or for a third party (such as an attorney). These requests are most often and appropriately directed to schools, so OSSE redirects requesters to LEAs as they are the original source of t he information shared with OSSE. If LEAs are unable to respond to the request, OSSE will periodically receive and fulfill student records requests, as deemed legally appropriate and authorized under FERPA. These requests are also entered and tracked in O SSE's data request portal and handled by a designated staff person in CIO. Prior to receiving data, requestors are required to verify their identity in -person to ensure the person is entitled to this information. Data requests for research and evaluation OSSE staff ensures that data requests that include a student's personally identifiable information (or other confidential information) require signed data sharing agreements outlining legal responsibilities for requesters and OSSE regarding data sharing, use, re -disclosure, protections, and destruction. Entities must agree to written data sharing agreements and demonstrate compliance with these agreements. If they do not, an entity may be subject to compliance monitoring and required corrective actions. Da ta sharing under FERPA is permissive, not mandatory; FERPA provides discretion to the state education agency with regard whether to prohibit non- compliant entities from receiving data. The US Department of Education has enforcement authority and may also unilaterally impose 5 -year ban on data sharing with non- compliant entities. See 20 U.S. Code \u00a7 1232g(b)(4)(B) and 34 CFR 99.67. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 114 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests OSSE's Office of the General Counsel ensures compliance with the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2- 531-540) statute and has developed a system for processing FOIA requests that increase transparency, communication, and timeliness while safeguarding student data. This system encompasses robust coordination between the agency FOIA officer and points of contact within OSSE divisions to identify and gather responsive documents in a timely manner. The FOIA officer is responsible for review and redaction of all responsive records in compliance with the D.C. FOIA statute to ensure protection of student information. Each FOIA request is subject to a four -tier review process including: initial review and redaction by the FOIA officer, legal sufficiency review by the General Counsel, technical security check by the Chief Information Officer, and final review by the programmatic lead in the relevant OSSE division. OSSE has adopted the FOIAXPress tool that allows for centralized submission and tracking of all FOIA requests. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 115 52. Provide the findings from the testi ng integrity investigations for School Year 2017- 2018 and the status of the investigation reports for School Year 2018- 2019. Documentation on OSSE's test security and integrity processes, requirements, and templates as well as the test security investiga tions process can be found on the OSSE's website. Following the test integrity investigations of SY 17 -18 and SY18- 19, there were no substantiated findings that resulted in of ficial OSSE sanctions. On Friday, March 20, Mayor Bowser announced that all District of Columbia public schools would be closed until April 27, 2020 (extended following that announcement). In light of that announcement, OSSE announced the cancellation of statewide summative assessments for students in spring 2020. This impacted the PARCC, DC Science, Multi -State Alternate Assessments (MSAA), Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM), and all the remaining ACCESS for ELLs 2.0 and Alternate ACCESS assessments. Given that statewide testing was cancelled in spring 2020, there were no test integrity investigations .

ATTACHMENT: Q53 - Childcar e.xlsx Early Childhood Education in the District of Columbia is delivered through a mixed delivery system that includes child development homes (105); child development centers (365) operated by independent businesses, non- profits, and faith- based organizations; and pre -k and afterschool programs operated by District of Columbia Public Schools and charter LEAs. Thi s mixed delivery system provides a range of options for families. To assist families with the costs of care, the District of Columbia funds child care subsidies for low-income and working families, which follow children to the care their families choose. Roughly 55% of the District's licensed child care facilities participate in the subsidy system. Child care facilities that participate in Early Head Start, Head Start, or the District's publicly funded pre -k program also receive public funding through thes e programs, but the majority of child care funding in the District comes from tuition payments made by parents. The District's 470 licensed child development facilities have licensed capacity to serve 26,958 children ages 6 weeks through 13 years old, alt hough the number of children that providers are able to serve is currently reduced as a result of COVID health and safety guidance. In FY19, FY20, and FY21, the District worked to enhance access to, quality of, and affordability of child care through a var iety of strategies. In FY19, a historic investment in child care subsidies allowed the District to increase payment rates for subsidy child care providers to reflect the cost of quality, and from FY18 through FY20 the District invested $9M to create and sustain the supply of quality infant and toddler child care slots through the Access to Quality grant program. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 117 The public health emergency declared in March 2020 has had a substantial effect on the District's child care sector in FY20 and FY21 to date. In M arch 2020, 88% of child care facilities \u2014like most District businesses \u2014closed in response to stay- at-home orders. As the District entered the recovery phases in Summer 2020, child care providers began to reopen, and roughly 70% of the District's licensed child care facilities (325) were open as of January 31, 2020. However, those facilities that are open are operating at reduced capacity, as a result of COVID- related health and safety guidance that limits the number of children and adults per group. In addit ion, family demand for child care varies, so that while some facilities are not able to accommodate all families who wish to return, others have fewer children in attendance than even their reduced COVID capacity allows. As a result of closures, capacity l imits, and varied attendance, District child care facilities have experienced significant revenue losses during the public health emergency, even as they face increased operating costs for staff, cleaning, and materials and supplies as a result of the publ ic health emergency. The District has taken a variety of steps to support child care providers during the public health emergency, including: Providing health and safety guidance, technical assistance, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to support c hild care providers to operate safely during the public health emergency Funding $5 million in emergency relief grants for child care through the D.C. Child Care Relief Fund, which reached nearly all licensed providers. Providing $400,000 in Access to Quality Emergency grants to child care providers who previously received funding through the Access to Quality grant program, to support newly licensed or expanded providers to maintain the supply of infant and toddler care. Continuing to pay child care s ubsidy providers based on enrollment through October 2020. Implementing a Public Health Emergency subsidy rate in December 2020, to increase payments to subsidy providers in recognition of the increased costs of delivering child care during the public he alth emergency. Utilizing $6 million in federal CARES Act funding for child care to support the child care sector during the public health emergency, including through: o $1.4 million to provide emergency child care for essential workers during periods when many child care providers were closed o $1.7 million to cover increased costs of continuing enrollment -based subsidy payments to child care providers from April -September 2020 o $2.8 million for the District Road to Recovery Fund, which will provide additional emergency relief grants to child care providers with demonstrated need who meet additional priorities. As a result of these efforts, the licensed capacity of child care facilities has not declined substantially in FY20 and FY21 to date (although most facilities are currently operating below licensed capacity as a result of COVID -related health and safety guidance). The Division of Early Learning continues working, in partnership with child care providers, other District agencies, and other stake holders, to support the child care sector through the public FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 118 health emergency and prepare to facilitate and accelerate the sector's recovery in service of the District's economic recovery as the public health emergency resolves.

Please describe how OSSE is supporting the early childcare education workforce in meeting the enhanced educational requirements. OSSE's child development facility licensing regulations, 5A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7100- 199 (effective Dec. 2, 2016) seek to improve the quali ty of the early care and education workforce by ensuring that staff have the necessary qualifications and credentials to educate and care for young children. In June 2018, OSSE extended the deadline for meeting the qualifications for various child developm ent facility positions. In Dec. 2020, in order to support child care providers who are experiencing challenges recruiting and retaining adequate staff as a result of the public health emergency, OSSE promulgated emergency and proposed rulemaking (posted on Dec. 11, 2020) to extend the deadline for teaching assistants and home -based child care providers to obtain a Child Development Associate (CDA) to Dec. 2023. OSSE has determined that some staff in child development facilities will need more time to reach the minimum education requirements deadline due to the unforeseen hurdles that were caused directly (or in part) by the public health crisis due to the novel coronavirus pandemic (or COVID- 19). The table below reflects all of the aforementioned deadlin e extensions for each position and their required credential type. Position Minimum Education Credential Required Compliance Date Center Director Bachelor's degree (BA) in early childhood education (including early childhood development, early childhood education, elementary education, or early special education) or a bachelor's degree in any subject area with at least 15 semester credit hours in early childhood education . Dec. 2, 2022 Teacher Associate degree (AA) in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family studies, or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Assistant Teacher Child Development Associate (CDA) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area Dec. 2, 2023 Expanded Home Caregiver Associate degree in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family studies or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Home Caregiver and Associate Home Caregiver Child Development Associate (CDA) Dec. 2, 2023 FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 122 OSSE has taken numerous steps to ensure that the early care and education workforce meets the enhanced educational requirements. The list below summarizes some highlights of these efforts. ECE Resources Webpage Launched in July 2017, the ECE resources webpage provides position- specific information on the new education requirements, as well as programs and resources available to help the workforce meet the new requirements. Early Childhood Education (ECE) Help Desk In Fall 2017, OSSE la unched the ECE Help Desk to provide individualized support and address specific questions about the new education requirements. Child care professionals can contact the help desk at ECEhelpdesk@dc.gov or (202) 478- 5903 and will receive a response immediate ly or within 24 hours. College Fairs OSSE's Division of Early Learning, in partnership with OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education, facilitates the Adult College Completion Fairs: Early Childhood Educators Edition. This initiative provides focused support to DC's early childhood education workforce in learning about programs and resources to help gain their respective education credential. Due to the public health emergency caused by COVID -19, this workforce initiative has been modified. OSSE has plans to conduct a virtual college fair in FY2021. Quorum Online Learning In May 2017, OSSE introduced an online training platform through Quorum. The platform allows child development staff unlimited, 24/7 access to a catalogue of engaging and interactive training courses, including those required for obtaining a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. Professional Development Scholarships OSSE also supports the early learning workforce by providing funding to obtain higher educational credentials. There are three avenues of support: (1) Child Development Associate (CDA) grants; (2) Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) scholarships; and (3) First Step program . Child Development Associate (CDA) Grants OSSE fu nds two grantees, CentroNia and Southeast Children's Fund, to provide scholarships and supports through their CDA programs, which are offered in English, Spanish, and Amharic. The grantees also provide scholarship funding to cover the CDA application fee f or those who obtain the required instructional hours outside of the grantees' programs, including via Quorum. Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) DC Scholarship Program The National Black Child Development Institute (NBCDI) administers this program on behalf of OSSE. In FY2020, there were 137 active scholars (i.e. teachers, directors or expanded home caregivers) in the T.E.A.C.H. program working on either an associate or bachelor's degree. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 123 Additionally, there are several assistant teacher s enrolled in the program with hopes of earning their degree and becoming a lead teacher. First Step OSSE piloted the First Step CDA Career and Technical Education (CTE) program in FY17, which provides high school students the opportunity to work towards earning their CDA credential and high school diploma at the same time. For the 2019 -20 school year, there were 162 students in the First Step CDA Program across three DC Public Schools and one DC Public Charter School high school site, that successfully graduated 62 students. Currently enrolled in the program for the 2020 -21 school year, there are 163 students participating, with 55 expected graduates. This includes students from the previous school year who are in their second year of the program. Conti nuous Service Waiver OSSE recognizes the value of experience in the field. Facilities can apply for waivers for center directors, teachers and expanded home caregivers who have demonstrated at least ten years of continuous service in early childhood educa tion. Further information on the waiver application process is available on OSSE's website. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 124 55. Describe the professional development opportunities OSSE provided/offered to child development centers and early care staff in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Include in the description the formats in which the opportunities were offered (e.g. face- to-face or online). OSSE continues to provide robust professional development and support for child development centers and early child care staff. Trainings are delivered by OSSE's Division of Early Learning (DEL), contractors, inter -governmental partners, external partners and a cohort of OSSE - certified trainers. In response to the coronavirus (COVID -19), pandemic OSSE had to modify its delivery of in -person traini ngs to synchronous online trainings while continuing to make asynchronous online course offerings available. This shift has allowed OSSE to reach more centers and staff with helpful content to better serve children in their care. OSSE makes training avail able to the early childhood workforce through the Professional Development Information System, (PDIS), OSSE's workforce registry and professional development tracking system, as well as OSSE -certified trainers offering trainings outside of PDIS. Through t hese delivery mechanisms, OSSE provided approximately 794 face -to-face and synchronous online training opportunities for approximately 26,419 participants in FY20. Note that this number is not unique individuals, but the total number of participants. Compa red to FY19 numbers (955 trainings and 24, 114 participants), there was a 17 percent decrease in trainings but a 10 percent increase in participants in FY20. It's clear that the workforce is responsive to changes in delivery method. OSSE leveraged profess ional development platforms to provide trainings to the early childcare workforce with great success once the shift was made from in -person training to synchronous online trainings during the COVID -19 pandemic. The number of trainings offered through PDIS from April to December 2020 (323) was an increase of 92 from the same time period in 2019 (168). The number of participants in trainings offered through PDIS increased 173 percent during this time period from 4,608 to 12,585. OSSE also uses Quorum, an onl ine professional development platform of asynchronous courses, for the early childhood education workforce. As of Feb. 2, 2021, there were a total of 551 facilities registered for Quorum, comprised of 437 centers /schools/programs and 114 child development homes/expanded homes. There were a total of 7,336 individual active users registered in the online e -learning system. Once each course is completed, educators earn a certificate. A total of 122,160 courses have been completed from May 2017 to Jan. 31, 2021. During the COVID -19 pandemic, course completions have increased 74 percent, from 30,605 course completions from March 1, 2019 to Jan. 31, 2020 to 53,153 course completions from March 1, 2020 to Jan. 31, 2021. We believe that t he PDIS and Quorum ere effective in reaching more of the childcare workforce in taking advantage of these trainings due to online delivery. The chart below outlines the continuing education topics required of all staff working in a licensed child developm ent facility, per 5 -A DCMR Chapter 1. This table includes in- person and FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 125 synchronous online course offerings, as well as courses available through the online Quorum professional development system .

We discuss how to access local early childhood mental services. Social -Emotional Development Training Descriptions (Quorum) Building Positive Relationships Participants will explore the impact of classroom climate on children's behavior and learning. For instance, how do the subtle nuances of the teacher's behavior impact the atmosphere in the classroom? You will review important ideas about the nature of positive relationships, and you will study examples and strategies to promote positive teacher -child and child- child relationships. Relationships are essential to children's FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 136 development and learning. A teacher's ability to create a positive atmosphere will inspire positive relationships and support the education and healthy development of young children. Building Resilience after Natural Disasters Hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other natural disasters can threaten the well -being of adults and children. While some people easily bounce back from adversity brought on by these types of traumatic events, others struggle to overcome the experience and its aftereffects. Resilience - the ability to adapt or recover from a difficult event - can be learned during childhood or later in adulthood. This course is divided into two parts. Part I is about adults - the impact of stress on the body and mind, how resilience affects well - being, and how to build resilience before and aft er natural disasters. Part II is about children - supporting children after natural disasters, recognizing when a child might need extra help recovering, and building resilience to improve their ability to \"bounce back\" throughout life. Challenging Behavi or: Reveal the Meaning Children express their needs through words, facial expressions, body language, and behavior. When communication is sent in the form of challenging behavior, understanding the message can be difficult. Participants will explore the ways children speak to us through behavior and will examine the role teachers play in the two- way conversation. Participants will learn how to interpret children's behavior, how to effectively teach social skills, how to develop an environment that supports cooperative and meaningful learning, and how to build partnerships with families. Creating Positive Connections The love and nurturing that a child receives in the first few years of life can have effects on development that last a lifetime. As we le arn more about children and how they develop, we understand more clearly the role of early relationships. Warm, nurturing relationships based on respect, understanding, and acceptance are essential for children's optimal development. In this course, explor e caregiver behaviors that create four positive connections: Teacher to child, child to child, child to environment, and teacher to family. Through interactive learning activities, group discussion forums, videos, reflective writing exercises, scenarios, a nd a field assignment, participants will learn to create an environment where relationships flourish. Helping Children Navigate the World of COVID -19 Most children - even very young children - know, or at least sense, that something has changed in the wo rld - that something isn't quite right. Though they may not be able to voice it, many of them are worried and afraid or at the very least, confused. They need the adults in their lives to help them understand and navigate the world of COVID -19. This 10 minute not -for-credit course provides tips and ideas to help adults guide children through this stressful time.

Participants will examine how to encourage exploration, uncover interests, and support peer relationships. Strategies that extend lea rning from the school day as well as encourage children to unwind, relax, be themselves, and socialize will be explored. Specific activities that support literacy and math learning, and physical development are presented. To Expel or Not to Expel Childre n who are expelled or suspended from school are more likely to experience academic failure and grade retention, hold negative views of schools and education, are at greater risk of dropping out, and have increased rates of incarceration. To Expel or Not to Expel covers the conditions and risk factors that lead to expulsion and suspension, strategies to promote social- emotional development in children and personal well -being in educators, ways to develop trusting partnership with families, and discipline pra ctices that reduce the risk of suspension and expulsion. Trauma Informed Practices Approximately 66% of children report experiencing traumatic events before the age of 16. The effects of these experiences can be devastating, but with support, many childr en can overcome their traumatic experiences. This course, Trauma Informed Practices, raises awareness of the impact of childhood trauma on children's learning and development and provides strategies to support the healing, resilience, and well -being of traumatized children and those who care for them.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 139 Inclusive Practices Training Descriptions (Quorum) Autism 101 Once considered a rare disorder, the most recent study on autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 1 in 59 children are living with it. Likely, most of us know someone \u2014a family member, a friend's child, a neighbor, a student \u2014who has been diagnosed. Autism seems to be everywhere, and most of us are left with lots of questions: What is this disorder? What causes it? Is there a cure? Is it becoming more common? What are some strategi es for working with a child in your early childhood classroom who is on the autism spectrum? This course addresses these questions and will help you become more knowledgeable about autism and the people it impacts. Basics of Inclusion According to the Division for Exceptional Children (DEC), \"Inclusion is children of all abilities learning, playing, and working together.\" While this sounds great, teachers and parents may wonder if inclusion is really the best choice for a child. Will the child with disabil ities struggle and the child without disabilities fall behind?

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 140 57. Provide an update on the full implementation of Capital Quality. Capital Quality is the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). Capital Quality is a systematic approach to assess, improve and communicate the level of quality of a child development facility. Capital Quality has three components: an annual rating, a continuous quality improvement (CQI) plan and process, and a public -facing online profile to convey the quality designation of each child development facility. Methodology Capital Quality measures program quality using research -based measures (the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS), the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scales (FCCERS) and/or the Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre -K (CLASS Pre -K)) to evaluate the quality of each program. The observation data is used to inform each facility's Capital Quality designation: Developing, Progressing, Quality and High- Quality. As of fall 2019, OSSE has collected observation data for licensed subsidy facilities and for non- subsidy licensed facilities that voluntarily participate in Capital Quality. O SSE canceled observations during the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency and is working to assess when observations may safely resume. The CQI plan includes a set of research -based quality standards that are common to programs that serve childr en birth to age five. Most of these standards align with the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS), the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Act and the National Association for the Education of Young Children's (NAEYC) accreditation standards. The 10 quality indicators in the Capital Quality Continuous Quality Improvement Plans (CQIPs) look at the following: Curriculum is aligned to DC Early Learning Standards; Formal and informal assessments are aligned to curriculum; Formal and informal assessments are implemented; Data is used to inform instructional and professional practices Using the results of the CLASS Pre -K and/or ITERS -R and/or FCCERS -R; Culturally and linguistically responsive practices are implemented; Inclusion practices are implemented; Developmental screenings are implemented; Early care and education professionals meaningfully engage in professional development; Family engagement promotes positive and goal -oriented relationships; and Mission statements are reflective of both the program and the families served. Reporting The public -facing quality profile on My Child Care DC includes the facility's designation and additional information that is beneficial to families including, but not limited to, group size and ratios, curriculum used and the mission of each facility, as appropriate. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 141 Support To support continuous improvement, each facility participating in Capital Quality has a quality facilitator (provided by a thi rd-party grantee of OSSE) who provides one -on-one support to the child development facility director to help them improve quality and monitor progress. New Capital Quality participants received an initial site visit from a facilitator and OSSE representat ives: during the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency, the facilitator and OSSE representatives conducted the initial site visit virtually. These visits were conducted to gain a better understanding of the child development facility and their spe cific needs. The programs received technical assistance (TA) on how to complete the online CQI plan and completed their first complete CQI draft plan within their first year in Capital Quality. The plans were reviewed by the quality facilitators and providers received feedback on the CQI plans. These plans will then be reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Initial and follow -up site visits were conducted with participants, OSSE staff and the quality facilitators. Follow -up site visits were then conducted to gather one -on-one feedback from providers about their experiences in the program (e.g., areas of strength, how OSSE could provide better supports). During the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency, these site visits were held both virtually and in-person, as appropriate and with health and safety measures in place. The valuable feedback received from both the site visits and the community of practice sessions is used to improve the overall design and implementation of Capital Quality. Progre ss to Date In April 2016, OSSE successfully launched the pilot of its redesigned QRIS, Capital Quality. Between March 2017 and January 2019, OSSE welcomed three cohorts of child development facilities in Group Two, Group Three and Group Four. Therefore, child development facilities joined Capital Quality on a rolling basis upon entering into a subsidy agreement or electing to participate. Child development facilities that join Capital Quality on a rolling basis are assigned to group Five. There were 230 t otal active facilities in Capital Quality as of December 2020. Facilities that have entered into and maintain an agreement for subsidized child care services with OSSE are required to participate in Capital Quality. Licensed non- subsidy facilities may volu ntarily elect to participate in Capital Quality. The following table shows the active facility types as of December 2020. Facility Type Subsidy Non-subsidy Total Child Development Centers 168 9 177 Child Development Homes 29 3 32 Expanded Child Development Homes 17 4 21 Total 214 16 230 Beginning Oct. 1, 2018, OSSE transitioned all subsidized child care facilities from their Going for the Gold rating to one of four Capital Quality Designations: (1) High Quality, (2) Quality (3) Progressing, or (4) Developing and all subsidized child care facilities will be reimbursed based FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 142 on their Capital Quality designation. OSSE implemented a \"hold harmless\" policy to ensure that the tiered reimbursement for each of the four Capital Quality implementation g roups would not be lowered upon initially participating in Capital Quality. If the program's designation lowered during the designated timeframe (which varies for each Capital Quality group), then the tiered reimbursement remains the same for a period of time (i.e., the program does not receive a lower reimbursement that would be associated with that lower designation). However, if a program earned a higher designation, then the program received a higher reimbursement that aligns with the higher designation. The hold harmless policy is summarized in the following table . Action Pilot and Group Two Group Three Group Four Capital Quality designation determined Fall 2019 Tiered reimbursement changes only if facility designation is higher Fall 2019 Hold Harmless policy ends; tiered reimbursement aligns to facility designation whether higher or lower Fall 2020 Fall 2021 Fall 2022 OSSE completed the Capital Quality rating and designation process for facilities participating in the Pilot, Group Two, Group Three and Group Four in fall 2019. Subsidy facilities that received a higher designation in fall 2019 began receiving the higher tiered reimbursement effective Oct. 1, 2019. Due to the cancelation of observations during the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency, OSSE did not complete the Capital Quality rating and designation process in fall 2020. Child development facilities maintained their current designations; however, upon expiration of the hold harmless policy for Pilot and Group Two in fall 2020, 18 out of 64 total Pilot and Group Two facilities' tiered reimbursement rate lowered to align to their Capital Quality ratings and designations based on observation data (determined in fall 2019). Facilities that entered into a new subsidy agreement after Oct. 1, 2018 are designated Preliminary until a Capital Quality rating and designation is determined based on observation data. As noted previously, these facilities joined Capital Quality on a rolling basis and are assigned to Group Five, The hold harmless policy is not applicable to Group Five facilities; once a Capital Quality rating and designation of Developing, Progressing, Quality or High- Quality is determined, the designation immediately takes effect. In September 2019, the authorized representative from each child development facility that participates in Capital Quality had an opportunity to review the accuracy of their facility's Capital Quality rating, designation and review the cal culations. This review process is referred to as validation. Each year, child development facility owners, center directors and home providers (\"providers \") have an opportunity to review the scores used to calculate their facilities' Capital Quality rating and designation. Providers also have the opportunity to review for accuracy other FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 143 information that is included in their facilities' Capital Quality profile, accessed through My Child Care DC. Validation is a passive process, meaning if a provider does not submit any concerns during the validation time period, OSSE considers the Capital Quality rating, designation and all other information to be final. Since OSSE did not complete the Capital Quality rating and designation process in fall 2020, providers val idated only the information included in their facilities' Capital Quality profile during the fall 2020 validation period. In November 2019, all Capital Quality participants received their official Capital Quality designation notification letter and certif icate based on the Hold Harmless policy. These designations are in effect for each facility for FY 2020 and the observation- based designations are valid for up to three years . FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 144 58.

The federal U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Off ice of Head Start (OHS) provides grants directly to local public and private non-profit and for -profit agencies to provide Head Start and Early Head Start services in the District. OSSE is one of the District's recipients of these grants. OSSE leveraged its grants to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), as discussed below. OSSE does not provide direct oversight to Head Start programs in the District. OSSE's role in Head Start programs include the following: (1) Leading the District's Head Start Sta te Collaboration Office (HSSCO); (2) Administering the Early Head Start- Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) Grants that are part of the QIN ; and (3) Coordinating with Local Education Agencies. Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) OSSE receives the Head Start State Collaboration grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS) and leads the Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) which works to enhance state coordination and partnerships to meet the unique needs and challenges of low -income children and families in the District. The HSSCO supports ongoing collaboration on crucial issues, such as family and community engagement, continuity of care for children, comprehensive services and supports and ongoing professional development for early learning professionals. Additionally, the HSSCO works in collaboration with the District's State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) to address gaps in early care and education service delivery, improve the overall quality of delivery services to low -income children and their families, and improve coordination of services and information exchange between various programs within the ear ly care and education system. Administering the Early Head Start- Child Care Partnership Grants In 2015, OSSE was awarded the Early Head Start -Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) grant and used the funds to develop a neighborhood- based Quality Improvement Net work (QIN) to build capacity, increase access and enhance the quality of care for infants and toddlers. The QIN is comprised of two hubs - United Planning Organization (UPO) and Easterseals DC MD VA. All services provided through this initiative are full -day and full -year. All facilities that participate in the QIN are required to meet EHS standards. In addition, OSSE received a federal expansion grant to support an additional 166 EHS -eligible children in March 2019. Accordingly, OSSE is maximizing the imp act of the QIN by leveraging local, and federal funding to increase the number of children birth to three years old receiving an EHS quality experience. Coordinating with Local Education Agencies: FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 153 The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) emphasizes coordinat ion and quality of Head Start programs. Local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving Title I funds must develop a written Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Head Start programs, and other early learning programs if feasible, on records, parent communication, staff training, student needs, transition, and services (ESSA Sec. 1119). OSSE had an ESSA Working Group to coordinate and collaborate with the DCHSA and interested LEAs. The goal of the working group was to draft a model citywide MOA that outlines how L EAs will work with Head Start and other early childhood programs. LEAs applying for Title I funds and serving pre -K or kindergarten signed an MOA with HSAs as part of their Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) annual application to OSSE for federa l funds. The working group provided a model, citywide MOA to ease the challenges of coordinating with the Head Start providers. LEAs had the option to sign the citywide MOA or sign individual MOAs with all District Head Start agencies sending students to t heir LEA. The final citywide MOA and supporting documents are posted here . The District of Columbia has expanded and aligned efforts of both Early Head Start and Head Start programs to better meet the needs of children from infancy through preschool age. Through this continuum of support, the District is focused on providing more young children access to high-quality early learning opportunities needed to succeed in school and beyond.

What progress has early intervention made in implementing the Natural Learning Environment Practices (NLEP) and what changes has OSSE seen as a result? The District of Columbia Early Intervention Program (DC EIP), Strong Start, supports and complies with the federal law and regulations that require early intervention services to be family centered, community- based, and provided in the natural environment, to the maximum extent appropri ate. Natural environments are more than places. The critical component of early intervention practice is to embed services and supports into naturally occurring learning opportunities. Natural environments are settings where the child, family, and care pr oviders participate in everyday routines and activities that are important to them and serve as important learning opportunities. Early intervention providers support families to promote functional participation in these activities. A provider coaching a m other to use techniques to help her son pick up and hold a spoon, fill it with yogurt and get it to his mouth during breakfast in the kitchen at their home so that he can learn to feed himself and enjoy a meal with his family is an example of providing interventions in a natural environment. Interventions within the context of a naturally occurring learning activity create opportunities for children to learn and practice skills that promote participation, build relationships; and get their needs and wants m et. Primary Service Provided (PSP) and teaming approach DC EIP has made strong progress to implement the Primary Service Provided (PSP) and teaming approach which will better serve the District's children with disabilities. The PSP and teaming approach ma tches families with a lead early interventionist who serves as the primary provider on the child's team. A child's team will include interventionists from all disciplines who can support the family and the primary provider in addressing their child's speci fic developmental needs. This approach, as part of the evidence -based natural learning environment practices, will continue to improve outcomes for children with developmental delays or disabilities and their families. In February of 2020, OSSE issued a s olicitation to contract for service delivery for the four core disciplines (Speech Therapy (ST), Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy (OT) and Developmental Therapy (DT)). This change was needed in order to start the implementation of the primary se rvice provider (PSP) and teaming approach. OSSE selected and awarded contracts effective Oct. 1, 2020 to 9 agencies that are qualified contractors to provide early intervention teams that consist of at least one member of each of the four core disciplines , and provide services that are family centered, reflect a primary provider approach, and are delivered in accordance with the coaching interaction style promoted by DC EIP. Strong Start facilitated a smooth transition for families. Of the roughly 24% of Strong Start children who had the potential to be affected by this transition, 98% have successfully transitioned to new vendors (the others are on hold due to COVID -19 and the family's decision to pause services), and 58% were able to continue with their previous therapist, who transitioned FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 163 to a new vendor who is in the system. Overall, about 11% of children experienced a change in interventionists as a result of this transition. Those families were notified on Sept. 11 via email of the changes effective O ct. 1 and their service coordinator notified them of their new assigned therapist who continued to deliver the approved services. This transition to the PSP and teaming approach is important to providing equitable services to all families regardless of payer. Prior to the contract transition, vendors could choose whether to provide services to children enrolled with a DC Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO). As contracts ended for vendors exiting the system (not participating in the transition), analys is showed that 71% of impacted children were not enrolled with DC Medicaid. This means that the exiting vendors had overwhelmingly chosen to not to serve our most vulnerable families. To prevent this kind of fracture in our system, the new contract stipula tes that all vendors must be participating with all DC Medicaid MCOs and must take children from all payers. Effective Oct. 1, 2020, all the current vendors are credentialed with the Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and serve families from all areas and i ncome brackets in the city. This is a significant step that will yield long -term benefits for the system, children, and families. Strong Start is now on track to fully implement the PSP and teaming approach by July of 2021. Professional Development In March of 2020, Strong Start started the Early Intervention Teaming and Coaching Handbook study group in order to ensure that Strong Start leadership, Strong Start staff and vendor agencies obtain foundational knowledge about coaching and tea ming and are able to support early interventionists in the system. The book study group was done in three different cohorts. The first cohort was Strong Start leadership which included the director, program manager, clinical manager and three service coordination supervisors. The second cohort included all Strong Start staff including service coordinators, early intervention specialists, child find personnel and evaluation team. The last cohort included the clinical supervisors at each vendor agency. The Strong Start Reflection Group is an initiative created in 2019 where providers in the DC early intervention community can come together monthly to discuss issues related to using a coaching interaction style, family -related challenges and challenges relate d to delivery of early intervention services in child development centers. The group is also an opportunity to reflect on what providers have been doing to support families in early intervention and to engage in peer coaching opportunities with current providers in the DC early intervention system. In FY20, Strong Start held 13 sessions and some of the topics included Teaming across agencies, supporting families with feeding challenges in the Natural Learning Environment, coaching families through new rout ines, coaching during the COVID -19 public health emergency, and cultural humility. In FY20, we had 104 total unique service providers participate across the 13 Reflection Group opportunities from three different units within our EI system (service coordinators, clinical team/early interventionists, and child find outreach specialists). FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 164 100% of the respondents to the Reflection Group Survey rated the initiative as Effective or Highly Effective in enhancing their knowledge of effective teaming and NLEP impl ementation. Additionally, 90% of respondents rated the groups as Effective or Highly Effective in providing opportunities for them to address case -specific barriers to implementing the coaching interaction style and teaming approach to service delivery.

On March 16, 2020, the offices of the state lead agency (OSSE) and the early intervention service (EIS) provider (Strong Start, DC's Early Intervention Program (DC EIP)) closed due to public health and safety concerns as a result of a coronavirus (COVID -19) outbreak in the area FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 168 and did not provide Part C services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families during this period of Monday, March 16, 2020 through Tuesday, March 31, 2020. During the weeks that the program was closed, DC EIP worked on developing guidance to be able to resume services remotely. DC EIP partnered with the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to ensure that all services delivered via telehealth were covered by DHCF and the Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). On April 1, 2020, Strong Start resumed the delivery of Part C services remotely via telehealth. The term telehealth includes services delivered by phone (audio) or through video conferencing (audio- visual) technology. Evaluations Between April 1 and Oct. 31, 2020, eligibility for children to access Part C services was determined using the Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System for Infants and Children (AEPS) eligibility cut- off score allowing the system to easily respond to the public health emergency and continuing to identify children in need of early intervention services without any delays. The Strong Start evaluation team worked with other states and the publisher of the Battelle Developmental Inventory, Second Edition Normative Update (BDI -2 NU) to adapt the test to be delivered virtually. Effective Nov. 1, 2020, DC EIP resumed the use of the BDI -2 NU tool virtually to determine eligibility for Part C services. Services During the pandemic, Strong Start has been able to provide services to an average of 82 percent of the children with and IFSP. Even though the number of children with an active IFSP increased from 1,339 in FY19 to 1,378 in FY20, the number of children receiving services decreased by 2 percent for the fiscal year and 10 percent if analyzed from April to September.

Since April 1, Strong Start continued to provide services for children age 3 and older in the transition process to Part B whose Part B eligibility has not been de termined. During this time, Strong Start continued to work closely with DCPS Early Stages to ensure that their evaluation teams have the most updated information for them to be able to determine Part B eligibility. We did this by continuing to hold transi tion meetings before the child turns 2 years 9 months, providing access to Part C records, sharing intervention log notes and most recently resuming the use of the BDI -2U assessment tool. Even though services continued to be provided for children over 3 years, the unavailability of safe in -person assessments has delayed the Part B service eligibility process. Now that DCPS Early Stages has started to offer limited in -person evaluations and Part C has resumed, Early Stages ' use of the BDI -2U, a standardized assessment tool , will support the District to decrease the backlog for Part B eligibility determination . OSSE continues to monitor DCPS' activities to scale- up in- person assessment activities to address this backlog of delayed evaluations, and OSSE confir med as of the date of this submission that all families have been offered the opportunity to complete assessment activities.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 173 Teaching and Learning 64. Describe OSSE's efforts to monitor and provide support to LEAs with regard to the student achievement for English Language Learners in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. OSSE provides guidance to school leaders and teachers around maintaining a la nguage instruction educational program for English learners that is rooted in federal and local regulations. OSSE does this through Title III, Part A monitoring, policy guidance, professional development, technical assistance, and program supports. Title III, Part A Monitoring In winter 2018 and spring 2019, OSSE conducted on- site monitoring of selected LEAs receiving federal funding in FY19 for English Learners under Title III, Part A grants, including a program and fiscal review. A similar on -site monitoring process is being conducted virtually now for selected LEAs who received Title III, Part A funding in FY20. Monitoring was conducted through OSSE's risk- based monitoring framework to help reduce burden on LEAs and to focus OSSE's onsite monitoring efforts on the highest -risk grantees across all federal grants. Under the Coordinated Risk- Based Monitoring framework, OSSE evaluated LEAs' compliance with fiscal and programmatic requirements under Title III and LEAs were given one of three designations: low-risk, medium -risk, or high- risk based. High- risk grantees received an onsite monitoring review. Each LEA participated in an on -site monitoring review of indicators and alignment of required activities required by Title II, Part A. After each visit, participating LEAs received findings of non- compliance in each applicable area and targeted technical assistance to develop a corrective action plan and improve the English Learner program. Supporting English Learners: Policy, Program, and Instructional Supports During FY20, OSSE's Division of Teaching and Learning provided responsive supports for English learner (EL) students' achievement in these key areas: (1) maintaining up -to-date EL policy and guidance, (2) providing timely policy and guidance on serving ELs during the public health emergency, (3) engaging stakeholders in policy and guidance input, (4) expanding EL resource hubs, (5) developing a dual language roadmap, (6) building LEAs' capacity to use data to improve EL programs, and (7) providing in- person and online EL and d ual language professional development. During the global public health emergency (PHE), OSSE's EL supports shifted rapidly to anticipate the needs of EL students, teachers, schools, and LEAs and develop timely and relevant policy, guidance, and training. Maintained Up- to-Date EL Policy and Program Guidance OSSE made minor updates to the OSSE EL policies and procedures document , which i s the main policy and guidance document OSSE maintains to guide LEAs in serving ELs. The updates included announcing the new Home Language Survey, adding citations, and making stylistic edits. OSSE released an updated Home Language Survey with new, clear s urvey questions to increase accuracy of subsequent referrals for EL identification screening. The OSSE Home Language Survey is the first part of the two -step EL identification process. The FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 174 OSSE Home Language Survey is used to determine if the student is el igible to take an English language proficiency screener. The screener score determines if the student is identified as an English learner or not an English learner. OSSE released its four foundational principles for EL policy and programs and its vision for success for ELs, developed by the OSSE EL working group and reviewed by stakeholders including the State Title III Advisory Committee. In addition to being grounding principles for OSSE's EL work, LEAs are encouraged to use these statements as a foundation for providing high- quality education to ELs in the District. Provided Timely Policy and Guidance on Serving ELs During the PHE In response to the public health emergency, OSSE released a frequently asked questions document, ELs and Distance Learning FAQ , which reiterated LEAs' continued responsibility to provide language development services to EL students. In response to the need for remote identification of E Ls, the list of state -approved EL identification screener assessments was updated to include the Pre- IPT Oral Remote for grades pre -K 3 and pre -K 4. This assessment can be administered remotely and can serve as the full identification assessment for grades pre-K 3 and pre -K 4. (Remote screeners are not available for grades K -12.) In anticipation of the need for continued distance learning, and given the lack of remote EL identification assessments for grades K -12, OSSE developed a Provisional EL Identification Procedure to ensure that EL identification could occur and needed EL service could begin during the PHE. OSS E included EL specifically in the S tate Continuous Education Principles , which set a target for success for LEA during distance learning. OSSE developed distance learning guides for educators and multilingual families (in six languages) that focused on English language development, home language development, partnering with schools during distance l earning, and how to support your child during distance learning. OSSE released Eleven Actionable Strategies for LEAs to Support English Learners' Success During the 2020 -21 School Year , a guide organizing OSSE's four foundational principles for serving ELs that provides concrete program -level strategies for LEAs to take, and tools, examples, and resources to support them in impl ementing these key strategies. Engaged Stakeholders in Policy and Guidance Input OSSE convened five meetings of the State Title III Advisory Committee to provide input on key policy and guidance considerations, including EL exit criteria review, EL progress monitoring for current and monitore d ELs, and monitoring for exited ELs, and, in response to the move to distance learning, provisional EL identification. OSSE led a cross -agency agency response working group at the beginning of the public health emergency to rapidly address the needs of E L students. Resources and trainings created through this group include: multilingual resources for immigrant families, guidance on increasing EL students' participation in distance learning, strategies for engaging students new to English, and guidance on translation and interpretation. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 175 Expanded EL Resource Hubs OSSE responded to the increasing volume of resources we offer by dividing the OSSE EL Policy webpage into two distinct pages: OSSE EL Policy and Programs and OSSE EL Instructional Resources. The webpage on OSSE EL Policy and Programs provides school leaders and teachers guidance around maintaining a language instruction educational program (LIEP) for ELs that is rooted in federal and local regulations. This guidance, including administrative procedures and instruction, is available in the form of publications, professional development, and in- person technical assistance and programmatic support. The webpage on OSSE EL Instructional Resources provides educators resources and archived training materials to inform their instruction of ELs in academic content and English language development. Among the resources are publications, tools, archived webinars, materials to support EL parent and family engagement, and information on accessing OSSE's professional development and technical assistance opportunities. OSSE created a new dual language resources webpage that included frequently asked questions, program model definitions, relevant research, training recordings, and multilingual instructional resources for use by the 20+ dual language programs in DC. Developed a dual language roadmap In the Fiscal Year 2020 Local Budget Act of 2019, the DC Council appropriated funds for the Office of Multilingual Education to create a citywide roadmap for dual language school. The dual lan guage roadmap includes sections pertaining to student enrollment, performance and growth outcomes among students, demand and equitable access to dual language programs, projected supply, demand, and enrolled, programs models and characteristics, national approaches to dual language programming, performance measurement and program evaluation toward continuous improvement. The roadmap reflects on the progress that the District of Columbia has made over the past five years to increase students' access to dual language programs. The report includes the following key findings: The District has grown its DL program options significantly in the past five years, and enrollment has nearly doubled in those programs. DL programs tend to serve more students who are E nglish learners, Hispanic/Latinx, two or more races, or White. Students who are at -risk, have disabilities or are Black are less likely to enroll. Academic outcomes in DL programs are positive overall but are uneven when examining improvements for student s of underserved groups. Data on attaining bilingualism in DL programs' languages (in addition to English) may be available at the local level but are not statewide. While demand for DL will likely outpace supply by the 2024- 25 school year, building program quality for all students in DL programs is paramount. Built LEAs' Capacity to Use Data to Improve EL Programs and Services OSSE released the Landscape of English Learners in DC and Vision for Success , based on the state -level and LEA -level analysis of ELs students' academic and English language growth conducted the previous fiscal year. After a guided analysis of and discussion about the data participants drafted a vision of success for the state's ELs. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 176 OSSE provided EL data \"deep dive\" technical assistance to four LEAs that focused on how to use performance data to improve EL programs. OSSE provided visualizat ions of state and local education agency -level EL data and tools to identify trends in data related to EL achievement. Participants gained skills in analyzing ACCESS and PARCC data to identify strengths and areas for growth in serving EL students; and how to guide data interpretation discussions with school -based staff. As a result of these sessions, the four LEAs that participated have refined their professional development to build capacity in serving their EL students. To build upon the agency's prior t raining initiatives to increase LEAs' data literacy and usage of EL -data to improve their programming for EL students, OSSE released a new web training designed to inform users of the Early Access to English Learner (EL) Data Qlik application to understand how to use its new features to enhance their EL program planning and supports in the 2020- 21 school year. The goals of the training were to inform potential users of the expanded role access to the app and to identify how data from the app can be used to collaborate with colleagues on EL program planning and supports. Provided In -Person and Online EL and Dual Language Professional Development EL-focused professional development consisted of (1) in- person training workshops (2) On- line training workshops, and (3) Start of School Summit trainings designed for educators and school leaders to addressed specific strategies for supporting EL student achievement. For the first time, EL supports expanded to include new professional development geared specifically to dual language teachers and school leaders. OSSE offered nineteen professional learning opportunities, including several multi -day workshop series and a cohort series. 13 EL -focused offerings English Language Acquisition three -part series of half-day sessions each followed offered twice with each part being followed by an extension webinar training What Teachers Need to Know About Teaching ELs 4- day cohort series for teachers who are new to teaching EL students Supporting English Learners in t he Four Language Domains and its extension webinar Secondary Transition for ELs (offered twice) Literacy and Numeracy for Secondary Students with Limited or Interrupted Formal Education Response to Intervention for ELs EL Instructional Practices During Distance Learning Igniting ELs' Enthusiasm for Learning five -part series to address ELs' unique learning needs during remote instruction Guiding Principles for Using Educational Technology with ELs The Language -Rich Classroom WIDA's six Self -Paced eWorkshops Supporting English Learners in the Four Language Domains school -based offering The Sheltered I nstruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 177 6 dual language -focused offerings The Potential of Biliteracy Additive Bilingualism Biliterate Writing Trajectory Dual Language Classroom Observations and Feedback School Visits: Dual Language Classroom Observations and Feedback Biliteracy from the Start OSSE conducted fifteen webinars for distance learning planning and instruction, including workshops series and virtual PDs were conducted. 2.1. EL focused offerings: Four webinars on special topics in EL programm ing and instruction, addressing the following topics: ELs and The Law OSSE's Testing Accommodations Manual Part 2: English Learners Difference vs. Disability Preparing ELs for College and Career Eleven on -line training workshops focused on Dual Language were conducted, addressing the following topics: Virtual Libraries for Dual Language Google Classroom for Dual Language Instruction Tips to Record Read Aloud Stories Home Habits for Distance Learning Pr\u00e1cticas efectivas para el aprendizaje a distancia Teaching Strategies to Develop Cross -Language Connections Educator Certification for Bilingual Teachers Biliterate Writing Trajectory The Biliteracy Framework: Planning and Delivering Instruction in Two Languages Defining Instructional Programs for Multilingual Education In conjunction with the OSSE Start of School Campaign, five webinar -based workshops were provided to all LEAs to ensure each LEA had a team of skilled staff who could not only leverage EL student -level data from multiple systems to m eet state and federally required responsibilities, but also be prepared for the rapidly changing nature of education caused by the COVID -19 crisis. OSSE's offering to ready LEAs to effectively serve ELs on the first day of the 2020- 21 school year included: What's New for 2020- 21 in the Early Access to English Learner Data Qlik Application New OSSE Home Language Survey2020- 21 School Year New EL Coordinator Orientation Serving English Learners During Distance Learning: FAQs and Provisional Identification Procedure Landscape of English Learners in DC and Vision for Success Re-Entry to the 2020- 21 School Year: Strategies and Tools for Supporting ELs: o Part 1: Value English Learners' Cultural and Linguistic Backgrounds FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 178 o Part 2: Partner with English Learners' Fam ilies o Part 3: Provide Language Development and Academic Instruction Programs to English Learners o Part 4: Use Multiple Data Sources to Support English Learner Students and Programs In January 2020, OSSE convened EL Coordinators for its first -ever LEA EL Coordinator Meeting which focused on policy and practice topics that are key to supporting ELs effectively. In October held its second LEA EL Coordinator Meeting this fall, which focused LEAs' current implementation and goal setting for using OSSE's publication Eleven Actionable Strategies for LEAs to Support English Learners' Success During the 2020- 21 School Year .

In FY20, OSSE awarded the early literacy grant as a two -year competitive grant to two (2) organizations: The Literacy Lab and Reading Partners Each organization worked with DC Public Schools and/or public charter schools to implement interventions to increase reading outcomes for students in pre -Kindergarten through third grade across the District. In FY 20, grant recipients received $2,200,000. Additional funding was provided in FY21 increasing the total grant fund available to $2,600,000. Individual awards per organization are listed below. The Literacy Lab Amount awarded: $1,445,000.00 in FY20 and $1,690,000 in FY21 Overview The Literacy Lab served 968 students in 15 schools between September - March 2020 The program tutors are prepared through summer literacy training and consisted of full -time Americorps tutors and the Leading Men fellowship. The Literacy Lab reports that an additional 146 students were supported through virtual classroom support, once in- person support was paused. This grant a llowed The Literacy Lab to provide direct, evidence -based literacy interventions daily to achieve the goal of tutoring 1,114 students in early literacy skills. Literacy Lab shared the following outcome data with OSSE: FY20 Outcomes During the 2019- 20 school year, The Literacy Lab placed 55 tutors and fellows in 15 schools. Literacy Lab proposed serving 684 in SY 20 and served 1,114 students. Leading Men Fellows focus on comprehension through a daily repeated read aloud intervention with their p re-K students. The impact of this intervention can be seen in growth in their students' reading comprehension from fall to winter, based on scores from the Preschool Early Literacy Indicators assessment. In the fall, 11% of students served by Leading Men w ere \"on target\" for Kindergarten readiness in comprehension. By the winter, this number had grown to 64% of students \"on target\". Fifty percent of K -3 students served exceeded their weekly growth targets. In addition, Literacy Lab has noted that their prog ram attracts people to education who might have not otherwise considered a career in the field. They provide intensive training and coaching in evidence -based literacy instruction. Updates for FY21 In the early months of the COVID -19 in- person school closures, Literacy Lab pivoted to a virtual learning posture to provide services. They created tutoring videos with the same practices of FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 180 their in -person tutoring. They also provided virtual tutoring. They met with OSSE to discuss plans for continuing support s. Reading Partners Amount awarded: $755,000 in FY20 and $910,000 in FY21 Overview Reading Partners' goal is to help close the achievement gap among low -income youth at a system -wide level by producing measurable improvement in students' reading skill s. During the 2019- 20 and 2020- 21 school years, Reading Partners' overarching goal has been to close the opportunity gap for literacy achievement among low -income youth at a system -wide level by producing measurable improvements in reading skills of students. Reading Partners shared the following outcomes data with OSSE: FY20 Outcomes During October - March, Reading Partners engaged 19 schools to serve 683 students across DC. These students received at total of 90 minutes (two 45- minute sessions) of one -on-one literacy tutoring each week. On average, students received 24 sessions. 20% of students served are English learners. In the early months of the public health emergency and in -person school closures, Reading Partners held tutoring on Zoom. Beginning in April 2021, one -to-one tutoring was provided to students in two, 45- minute sessions each week for the remainder of the grant period. They also had a virtual platform, Reading IQ, for virtual story time. In fall 2019, 75% of all Reading Partners students were meeting or exceeding their primary literacy growth goal. 75% of Pre -K students had a composite score that was far below the kindergarten readiness level on the PELI assessment. 11% were on level. By winter, 30% of students were on track or near ta rget for kindergarten readiness, including 21% of the students who were far below grade level. Updates for FY21 Reading Partners continues to provide tutoring sessions on Zoom and hosts the virtual platform, Reading IQ, for virtual story time. One -to-one tutoring continues to be provided to students in two, 45- minute sessions each week. Reading Partners have also created at -home learning packets and shared resources to families including family literacy workshops and text messaging services that send tips to parents on what they can do at home. They met with OSSE to discuss plans for continuing supports. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 181 66. (a) How much funding, separate from the Uniform Per Student Funding Formula, did OSSE provide to each LEA to support homeless students in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (as of January 31) and how did each LEA use it? (b) Describe the professional development training OSSE made available to school liaisons in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31). (a) Funding, separate from the Uniform Per Student Funding Formula, did OSSE provide to each LEA to support homeless students in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Federal Funding - McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Grant (MKV) Program OSSE distributed $211,640.01 to in FY20 and $333,435.62 in FY21 (of which $74,310.18 is carry over funds) as documented below: LEA FY20 FY21 New Awards Carry over Appletree PCS - $15,791.50 - Cedar Tree PCS - $2,500.00 - DC Prep $31,706.33 $45,000.00 $10,475.10 Howard - $10,000.00 - Maya Angelou PCS - $15,500.00 - Monument Academy PCS - includes carry over funds for three LEAs \u2014two were slated to exit but were granted a no cost extension to carry over remaining FY20 funds because of delays in spending down funds due to COVID -19. OSSE sub -granted these federal funds through a competitive process to LEAs that serve homeless students. Sub- grants must be used to supplement LEA strategies for children and youth experiencing homelessness that are in tended to ensure immediate enrollment, educational stability, and equal access to the same free appropriate public education (FAPE) as provided to all other students. As described above, $333,435.62 was distributed to LEAs in FY21 for this purpose. Three LEAs were slated to exit the MKV grant program in FY20; however, one LEA exited as scheduled, and two LEAs had challenges spending down funds due to the unscheduled closing and the shift to virtual/distance learning resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic. These two LEAs (DC Prep and DCPS) were granted a no cost extension to carry over remaining FY20 funds. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 182 Eight new subawards were granted as a result of the FY21 MKV competition that was held in June 2020. Also, there was one continuing subaward granted to Fr iendship PCS in FY21 (Friendship also carried over funds, which is a standard process for multi -year grants). The MKV competition is held every two years to ensure there are enough funds reserved for continuation subgrants. A new Request for Applications ( RFA) will be released in spring 2022 for the FY23 MKV competition to award available FY22 and FY23 federal funds. LEAs use MKV grant funding to ensure that students and families experiencing homelessness receive necessary educational supplies and services . The information in the following table (taken from the appendices from the approved SLATE) provides an overview of each LEA's intended uses of MKV grant funding in FY21: LEA Name (Award Type ) Program Summary / Use of Funds Appletree PCS (New FY21 Award) Appletree Early Learning Center Public Charter School (Appletree PCS) reported that they had 82 students experiencing homelessness in SY2019- 20. Appletree homeless liaison works to assist families with the essential items needed to ensure that their student attends school daily. This assistance includes providing transportation support to our families, supplying them with uniforms twice a year, and other clothing items, food, laundry support, and resources, enabling their students to participate in field trips, aftercare, picture day, and other extracurricular school activities. Appletree also provides health and wellness support in the form of hear ing and vision screenings, as well as dental cleanings. Finally, Appletree provides training and support for social workers (also referred to as school -based homeless liaisons) and other school -based staff. It is essential that they are equipped to address our McKinney- Vento families' sometimes unique needs without any implicit bias. This year with the COVID pandemic, the need focused on food, general household items, and access to technology and internet data. This will continue to be a requested need in the 2020- 2021 school year. The following is a breakdown of proposed allowable budget items: Student Supplies to purchase books, supplies, materials, and resources provided to students experiencing homelessness in order to support Instruction. Equipment to provide Wi -Fi hotspots connectivity to 8 students experiencing homelessness to participate in virtual learni ng. School supplies and uniforms (2 uniforms per year based on growth) at a cost of $35 per student for 83 students experiencing homelessness. Basic Needs Clothing and Supplies for students such as, underwear, socks, shoes, and laundry detergent/supplies. Young children grow out of clothes quickly and need multiple pairs of clothing. These basic FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 183 LEA Name (Award Type ) Program Summary / Use of Funds needs clothing will be supplied to children experiencing homelessness. Winter Apparel for students, such as hats, coats, and gloves and blankets to protect students experiencing homelessness during winter months. Transportation support to support parents who accompany younger children to/from school. SmarTrips will be purchase at an average cost of $20- $60 per month for 65 families experiencing homelessness over a pe riod of - 9 months. Cedar Tree PCS (New FY21 Award) Cedar Tree Public Charter School (Cedar Tree PCS) reported that they had 118 students experiencing homelessness in SY2019- 20. Cedar Tree's homeless population continues to increase, each year, at minimum by 5%. Many families struggle with housing and instability, which causes low school attendance and students lack educational resources i.e. school supplies, food, transportation and uniforms. This has a significant impact on our young learners; however, Cedar Tree continues to provide stabilization for these students and their families. Cedar Tree has three goals: 1) To eliminate barriers for displaced students and offer students the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. Their objectiv e for this goal is that 100% of our displaced students will have opportunities to participate in enrichment activities, evidenced by documentation of participation forms and they measure outcomes by student participation. 2) To increase in awareness and sen sitivity surrounding homelessness. Their objective for this goal is to provide training opportunities for school personnel and our families. Indicators of success will be gauged by parent participation in school events and having 90% of our staff trained i n MKV awareness. 3) To eliminate barriers to successful completion of the academic program. Their objective is to provide transportation subsidies, school uniforms and supplies for displaced students. Indicator of success will be through tracking student attendance and ensuri ng that students are in the range of approaching all their early learning standards. The following is a breakdown of proposed allowable budget items: Student Supplies to support Instruction including uniforms, winter coats, socks, shoes, instructional supplies like backpack , pencils, crayons, notebooks etc. for the students who are experiencing homelessness. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 184 LEA Name (Award Type ) Program Summary / Use of Funds DC Preparatory Academy Public Charter School (New FY21 Award) DC Preparatory Academy Public Charter School ( DC Prep PCS ) reported that they had 263 students experiencing homelessness in SY2019- 20. Funds will be used to focus on three specific goals identified in their needs assessment to ensure all students experiencing homelessness receive school supplies and materials, uniforms, and transportation support for parents (including the ability to pick up resources and materials for distance learning). The following is a breakdown of proposed allowable budget items: School supplies and materials (headphones, visual timers, highlighters, pencils, scissors, crayons, markers, pens, erasers, sharpeners, glue sticks, independent reading books, composition books, spiral notebooks, binders, graph paper, individual whiteboards & markers, Math at -home kit s, early childhood kits, book tote baggies) for an estimated 300+ MKV students across six DC Prep campuses.

Transportation support to purchase WMATA tokens for students and families experiencing homelessness for travel to and from school, either for in -person learning or to pick up resources and materials for distance learning as needed throughout the school year. DC Public Schools (New FY21 Award) DC Public Schools ( DCPS ) reported that they had 3,478 students experiencing homelessness in SY2019- 20. Due to COVID -19 and the challenges families and youth experienci ng homelessness face on a regular basis, DCPS will provide relevant support to families to remove barriers. In the upcoming school year during and post COVID -19, DCPS identify the need to provide technology to all students experiencing homelessness who do not have a device they can use for virtual learning. Also, due to COVID -19 and the challenges our families and youth are facing during this pandemic, many of our families will lose their housing once eviction moratoriums are lifted. As a result, DCPS also identified an increased need for educational and social emotional support \u2014trauma informed care, mental health services, mentorship, and educational support \u2014that are critical to the success and well-being of students. The following is a breakdown of propose d allowable budget items: Professional Development to purchase a subscription to educational content, summer enrichment, tutoring and mentoring programs provided by licensed companies to support enhanced instruction for students experiencing homelessness.

Friendship Public Charter School (Continuation from FY20 \u2014 Year Two) Friendship Public Charter School (PCS) reported that they had 273 students experiencing homelessness enrolled in SY2019- 20. The results of Friendship's needs assessment identified four key priority areas for this grant funding that serves as a barrier to academic achievement: 1) Mental Health: A major barrier continues to be mental health needs, which have become an even greater issue during the pandemic. 2) Supplies: personal and school supplies will be purchased to alleviate stress by ensuring that families who have been displaced have personal supplies, school supplies, and transportation. Friendship will enhance MKV funds with its own resources, in- kind contributions, and private grants. For example, Friendship Food and Nutrition Services hav e provided meals seven days a week. For every $1 in MKV funds, Friendship provides $4 to meet the needs of students experiencing homelessness. 3) Transportation: Children ages three to eight (Pre -K to 3rd grade) or students with disabilities is transportation for parents to bring the child to and from school. The grade- by-grade data show that 163 (59%) of the 273 children who are displaced are in third grade or under. The parents of the 163 elementary school students will need transportation support to pick up food and supplies from their children's campus. Three 2nd grade whose families are experiencing homelessness are in a learning pod, so their parent will need transportation to and from school four days per week. The following is a breakdown of approve d allowable budget items: Outerwear and Uniforms outer wear will be purchased to meet the needs of students experiencing homelessness, including shoes and boots @ $20 each, coats @ $43 each, hats, gloves, scarves @ $15 each, and school uniforms if in person classes resume. Outer wear is estimated at approximately $78 per student X 244 = $19,047.40 per student. School supplies and devices , supplies and materials will cover iPad data plans for 244 students experiencing homelessness throughout the Friends hip system. Each data plan is $20 per month X 244 students = $4880 per month X 12 months = $58,560. The data plan ensures successful distance learning for students experiencing homelessness.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 201 71. Describe the training, support and oversight provided by OSSE during School Year 2019- 2020 to ensure that LEA's are appropriately serving students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. The least restrictive environment (LRE) is a legal term found within the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which states that students with disabilities must be educated with students who are not disabled, to the maximum extent appropriate. This means that a student with a disability should only be removed from the general education classroom to receive services when that student's disability is so seve re that supplementary aids and services accessible within the general education classroom cannot provide that student a free and appropriate public education. To fulfill this mandate, schools must follow the principle of inclusion and use inclusive practic es across all classrooms. In the District, most students with disabilities spend the majority of their school day in general education settings. OSSE supports LEAs and schools in this LRE mandate by providing a framework of professional learning, resources and supports centered on inclusive practices and evidence -based strategies. In the 2019- 20 school year, this framework included: Landscape Analysis: Students with Disabilities in the District of Columbia; Foundational professional development trainings made available to leaders and educators across all LEAs which focused on evidence- based practices for instruction and behavior support; A new LEA Toolkit: Serving Students with Disabilities During Periods of Remote or Blended Learning; The Leadership I nstitute for Secondary Special Education (LISSE) through American University; Trainings, convenings and communities of practice focused on the successful postsecondary transition of students with disabilities; Monthly trainings for LEA Special Education Points of Contact; The Special Education Enhancement Fund (SEEF) grant opportunity; and A robust nonpublic placement oversight process. Students with Disabilities in the District of Columbia Landscape Analysis As part of the commitment OSSE made in its strategic plan to help accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities, OSSE developed a comprehensive landscape analysis to help establish a shared understanding of the current state of students with disabilities in the District. Drawing fr om in -depth data analysis, focus groups and interviews as well as online research, this landscape analysis examines who these students are, where they live and attend school, their current outcomes, their rates of identification and exit, key barriers hindering their progress, lessons learned from other states, and initial recommendations for what OSSE as the state education agency can do to address these barriers. The report includes national benchmarks and comparisons to other states and urban districts w here possible. OSSE believes that sharing this comprehensive fact base is an important first step toward developing a shared, citywide agenda to accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities.Access the full landscape analysis here on the OSSE website. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 202 Foundational Professional Development Training Opportunities During SY2019- 20, the OSSE Division of Teaching and Learning (TAL) Professional Development Team provided a robust calendar of professional development (PD) trainings which focused on evidence -based instructional practices and behavior support strategies to support all students, especially students with disabilities. The target audience for these trainings included not just special educators, but also school leaders, general educators, and support staff, who can all register via a first -come- first-served basis. The OSSE TAL PD Team advertised current PD offerings via a TAL PD training calendar, which was updated each month via the TAL PD Bulletin, a monthly newsletter w ith a current subscribership of over 1,400 District educators. View all archived SY19 -20 editions of the bulletin here . TAL PD offerings were also promoted e ach week in OSSE's LEA Look Forward Newsletter, and through other outlets, such as the PCSB Wednesday Bulletin. More information about the OSSE TAL PD team can be found on OSSE's website. During the first half of SY19- 20, the majority of PD trainings were provided in- person at the OSSE building, and in various locations across the city. In response to the public health emergency in the sprin g of 2020, which required the vast majority of educators to pivot to distance teaching andlearning, OSSEshifted its professional learning opportunities to online virtual learning experiences in order to support educators during this pivotal time.To dat e, the OSSE TAL PD team continues to provide a robust menu of virtual PD trainings for all District educators. Examples of OSSE TAL PD trainings offered in SY19- 20, and centered on inclusive practices and evidence -based strategies to support serving students in their least restrictive environments include the following: IEP Quality Training Series This four -part series, Responding to the Endrew F. Decision: Building Capacity to Develop High -Quality IEPs, provides special education leaders and staff with an overview of the Supreme Court's decision and its impact on the free appropriate public education (FAPE) requirements in the IDEA. Additionally, the series supports special education school leaders to develop capacity among their special education staff to meet the more rigorous standard for IEP quality set forth by Endrew F . In SY19- 20, OSSE staff continued to work cross -collaboratively to make updates to training materials, such as including more up- to-date state assessment guidance, as well as to incorporate specific, practical \"how -to\" supports that will lead to actual implementation of the content learned in the series, and more streamlined documentation when using the state's online Special Education Data System (SEDS).In addition, OSSE staff worked with external stakeholders at Early Stages and Apple Tree Public Charter School to create early childhood-specific version of the series. A ver sion of the training series was also created in partnership with Center City Public Charter Schools to ensure that general educators and other student support personnel were also trained to be informed, prepared, and engaged members of students' IEP teams. In SY18 -19, the content in the IEP Quality series was delivered to389 FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 203 participants representing 40 LEAs, and in SY19- 20 the series was delivered to an additional 63 participants representing 24 LEAs. Using High -leverage Practices Improve Outcomes for ALL Learners The OSSE TAL PD team has partnered with DCPS andthe DC Public Charter School Board to deliver a four -part training series that provides LEAs with support to develop capacity among all educators, including general educators, serving students with disabilities to implement evidence - based, high- leverage practices that correlate with improved academic and social -emotional outcomes for all learners, regardless of disability status. During the first phase of rollout, beginning in SY18- 19 and m oving into SY19- 20, TAL PD team specialists delivered the following four modules to 49 participants representing 23 LEAs: HLP Introductory Series Part 1: Collaboration HLP Introductory Series Part 2: Assessment HLP Introductory Series Part 3: Social -emotional Learning HLP Introductory Series Part 4: Instruction This training series provides guided opportunities to: Identify the key skills and structures that support efficient, effective collaboration between general education teachers, special education teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff; Discuss evidence -based principles for fostering positive relationships between educators and families; Identify formal and informal assessment tools and strategies used to collect information on student's present levels of academic and functional performance and identify their strengths and needs for support; Identify routines and procedures that support the development of a respectful, consistent, positive classroom environment that empowers students to take ownership of their learning; Identify the key elements ofspecially designedinstruction, including instructional strategies that support metacognition; and Work collaboratively to develop a shared library of resources that support implementation of high- leverage practices. Later in SY19 -20, the TAL PD team expanded its use of these high leverage practices by incorporating, emphasizing, and training on these practices within the existing framework of foundational ELA, math and science PD trainings. Embedding high- leverage practices into core academic content improves outcomes for all students, including students with disabilities. This practice of weaving high- leverage practices into existing and new PD modules across all PD content areas offered at the state level will contin ued to be a featured model moving forward. Examples of deepened training objectives due to this collaboration include: Using data to identify and develop appropriate learning goals; Planning and deliveringspecially designedinstruction; and Implementing instructional strategies that support metacognition. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 204 Student Support Teams Training Student Support Teams (SST) are school -based problem -solving teams focused on meeting the needs of individual students. Dur ing the 2019- 20 school year, the SST trainings were attended by 20 educators representing 9 LEAs. Section 504 Training The Section 504 regulations require an LEA to provide a \"Free Appropriate Public Education\" (FAPE) to each student with a qualifying disability who is enrolled in the LEA's jurisdiction.FAPE consists of the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet the student's individual educational needs and ensure that students with disabilities are e ducated with their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate.The Section 504 training was offered during the 2019- 20 school year both as an in- person training and as a webinar training. These Section 504 trainings were attended by 15 representatives from 3 LEAs. Positive Behavior Support To address positive behavior support and effective response to behavioral crises, OSSE offered a series of in -person trainings to elementary and secondary District educators, and then pivoted to virtual trainings on these same topics. Trainings on positive behavioral interventions and supports, trauma informed care, and non- violent crisis prevention support effective instructional practices that allow students to remain in the least restrictive environment, w hich often includes the general education classroom. Response to Intervention RtIis a multi- tiered approach to the early identification and support of students with learning and behavior needs. TheRtIprocess begins with high -quality instruction and universal screening of all children, in the general education classroom. Struggling learners are provided with interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of learning, and progress is closely monitored. RtIis designed for use w hen making decisions in both general education and special education, creating a well -integrated system of instruction and intervention guided by child outcome data.During SY2019- 20, OSSE provided Response to Intervention (RtI) trainings to a total of 57 educators on foundational RtI concepts and how to develop effectiveRtIsystems.During the period of distance learning due to COVID - 19, RtI trainings were adapted to include factors relevant to interventions in the virtual space. LEA Toolkit: Serving Students with Disabilities During Periods of Remote or Blended Learning In response to the COVID -19 public health emergency, OSSE's Division of Teaching and Learning and Division of Systems and Supports, K12 collaborated to issued consolidated Guidance based on core principles of special education service provision and developed an LEA toolkit and technical assistance and training series to support this guidance. The Serving Students with Disabilities during Periods of Remote or Blended LearningLEA Toolkit provides foundational guidance and concrete, actionable resources for local education agencies (LEAs) as they establish and implement policies and procedures for remote and/or blended learning contexts that are consistent with Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requirements. LEAs can access the toolkit, as well as on -demand recordings of the introductory FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 205 webinar andthree deep -dive technical assistance sessionsfocused on the foundational principles of special education service provision, online on the OSSE website . In addition to providing on- demand online access, these technical assistance sessions were also hosted as live virtual trainings from May to August 2020, focusing on three core areas: Balancing LEA Discretion and Flexibility (Toolkit Session 1) Ensuring Transparency and Collaboration (Toolkit Session 2) Data- driven Supports (Toolkit Session 3) The table below shows the participation numbers for these live virtual sessions: Live Virtual Trainings Date(s) Total Attendees Introductory Webinar May 20, 2020 428 LEA Toolkit Session 1 June 17, 2020 July 29. 2020 126 LEA Toolkit Session 2 July 1, 2020 August 5, 2020 96 LEA Toolkit Session 3 July 8, 2020 August 12, 2020 89 The LEA Toolkit, training recordings, and other user -friendly resources and templates were pulled together on anew landing page on the OSSE website , which so far has received 1,385 total page views, including 1,042 unique page views, between July 8, 2020 and Jan. 4, 2021. Leadership Institute for Secondary Special Education (LISSE) The LISSE program provides a select group of DC teachers who work with secondary special education students with the resources and supports to develop leadership skills through participation in intensive professional development (PD) aimed at supporting teachers' use of evidence -based practices (EBP), integrating the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Individualized Education Program goals within curricula for seconda ry students with disabilities. In SY19- 20, OSSE, in collaboration with the American University (AU) Institute for Innovation in Education (IIE), hostedanother LISSE cohort. Inthe fall of 2019, OSSE launched the 2020 LISSE application, and provided orie ntation to the new cadre. The professional development series began in January 2020and ran through June 2020. Through the course of PD sessions, one-day workshops and a full -day institute, LISSE provided support for participants to: (a) conduct an analysi s of the areas of greatest need in participants' schools relative to evidence - based practices and the Common Core State Standards (CCSS); (b) develop a professional development (PD) plan (including instructional strategies and assessments) to address the s chool community needs of each participant; (c) implement each PD plan at an AU -based event and then an LEA -sponsored institute for DC secondary special education teachers; and (d) evaluate the quality of each PD plan, its implementation, and its intended outcomes.With the start of the public health crisis, LISSE pivoted from in- person sessions to virtual sessions.OSSE selected 13 educators from DC public and public charter schools to participate in the SY19- 20 cohort, and 11 FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 206 of those individuals completed the program.The culmination of the 2020 LISSE was recorded presentations by the cadre, whichfocused on teacher action research plans that could be used for professional development, and included these specific topics: Evidence Based Instructional Strategies Literacy Practices to Support Students Across Content Secondary Transition Trainings,Institute, and Community of Practice In SY19 -20, OSSE offered extensive training and technical assistance related to secondary transition compliance. OSSE part nered with DC Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and other agencies to ensure awareness of requirements and best practices.Supports included professional development trainings, an institute, and a community of practice. Professional Developme nt: Developing High -quality Transition Plans for Middle School Learners This professional development opportunity was developed to support implementation of 2016 District regulations requiring that the first IEP in effect after a child with a disability reaches 14 years of age includes transition assessments and services. This introductory training was provided on a monthly basis in SY19- 20, and prepares special education teachers and leaders serving middle school students to develop high- quali ty, age -appropriate transition plans that meet these requirements. In SY19 -20, this content was delivered to 25 participants representing 7 LEAs. Secondary Transition Institute The purpose of the annual DC Secondary Transition Institute is to share r esources and information that will assist schools and districts in strengthening their capacity at the local level to implement evidence -based education and services, increase compliance with IDEA secondary transition requirements, and improve postsecondar y outcomes for all our students with disabilities. The most recent DC Secondary Transition Institute was held on Oct. 18, 2019. Those in attendance consisted of 104 individuals representing 16 LEAs, 12 DCPS campuses, and 9 nonpublic schools. The content was provided by 23 contributors from 10 various DC agencies, nonprofits, and service organizations.Participants were able to: Increase their knowledge of student -focused planning practices and receive tools and resources to support increased student involvement in the transition planning process; Increase their knowledge of how to foster interagency collaboration throughout the transition planning process; and Review and revise the LEA three- year strategic plan for improving secondary transition compliance and program quality that incorporates evidence -based practices and evaluation. Secondary Transition Community of Practice (CoP) The DC Secondary Transition CoP is a space for collaborative, cross -functional work that supports DC youth wi th disabilities as they transition into a self -directed life. The CoP is a city - wide, cross section of stakeholders who come together monthly to strengthen our individual and collective ability for action. In SY19- 20, OSSE continued to host the Secondary T ransition CoP, FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 207 which is open to all LEAs and community stakeholders.Monthly themes and attendance is captured in the table below.

Special Education Enhancement Fund (SEEF) Competitive Grant OSSE awarded a total of$1,729,470to the three cohort 3 SEEF grantees in early 2020: American University, the DC Special Education Cooperative, and the Relay Graduate School of Education.The purpose of this funding was to: Address systemic barriers to academic achievement for students with disabilities, based on the barriers identified in the landscape analysis research conducted by OSSE; Accelerate student achievement for students with disabilities by using research- based interventions; and Share and scal e promising practices citywide. All SEEF recipients partnered with targeted school(s) at one or more LEAs and will continue implementation through Sept. 30, 2021.In FY20, OSSE also granted a total of$3,500,000in continuation awards to a total of 13 LEAs from prior cohorts. Seven Cohort 2 LEAs will also receive a total of$2,000,000in continuation funds in FY21; the six Cohort 1 LEA grantees received their last year of funding in FY20.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 208 72. LEAs that do not meet targets on the Office of Special Education Programs monitoring indicators must complete self -studies and develop Continuous Improvement Plans. How many LEAs completed self - studies in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (as of January 31)? Detail what actions are included in the Continuous Improvement Plans. Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), LEAs may be identified for two reasons. First, the LEA could have a \"significant discrepancy\" which means the LEA's data sho ws it is disciplining special education students and/or students or specific racial and ethnic groups more than general education students and/or other racial and ethnic groups. Second, the LEA could be potentially identified as having \"disproportionate re presentation\" of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services that is the result of inappropriate identification. If identified, LEAs must complete a review of policies and procedures to assess whether this rate of representation was due to policies and procedures that do not comply with regulatory requirements. OSSE then reviews the LEA's self -assessment and underlying documentation to make a final determination regarding compliance. If the LEA is found to have noncompliance, OSSE wil l issue a finding and require an improvement plan. In SY 19- 20, there were 24 LEAs flagged for Disproportionate Representation reviews and one LEA flagged for Significant Discrepancy. Each LEA submitted its self -assessment for OSSE to review. Upon complet ion of the review, OSSE determined that all 25 LEAs had compliant policies, procedures, and practices, which did not result in inappropriate identification. As a result, the 25 LEAs were not required to submit a Continuous Improvement Plans (CIPs). The n umber of LEAs identified to complete a self -assessment for FY 21 to date is not available at this time. These reviews and identifications are conducted annually in the spring, and we have not reviewed the cycle for the 2020- 21 school year as it is still in process.

SAPSE Recommendation: Based on SAPSE's continued community engagement and informed experiences, SAPSE recommended that OSSE improve its communication with families of students with disabilities. Improvements should include but are not limited to: digital communication, use of parent -friendly language, and listening to parents and considering their point of view and needs before issuing communications. OSSE Action : Consistent and clear communication with families is vital to improving outcomes for students with disabilities. As part of OSSE's Roadmap for Acc elerating Outcomes for Students with Disabilities , OSSE has committed to expanding access to information for families by investing in resources to provide families of students with disabilities the information they need to support their child at every stag e of their education. This work includes OSSE's creation of the Parent Resource Hub (August 2020), which was developed through significant engagem ent with community stakeholders, including parents and SAPSE members. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 210 Proposed Special Education Regulations : On November 8, 2019, OSSE posted in the DC Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing amendments to Chapter 30 of Title 5- A in the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (currently found at 5 DCMR \u00a7E -3000- 3036) governing the education of students with disabilities. On December 12, 2019, SAPSE panelists participated in OSSE's public hearing. SAPSE members were pleased to see that OSSE t ook its advice from the previous year and incorporated a simultaneous session geared towards parents of children with disabilities throughout the District. On January 7, 2020, the SAPSE submitted public comment responsive to the proposed regulations. SAPS E/ OSSE Liaison Meetings : To ensure that disability -related policies, regulations and guidelines are developed with input from SAPSE, OSSE continually met with an identified policy liaison on a monthly basis to discuss any upcoming policy changes in order to ensure the SAPSE has an opportunity to authentically engage in State education policy work led by OSSE. During these meetings, existing and proposed policy are discussed upon request. OSSE also encourages the SAPSE to comment publicly on any rule or reg ulation proposed by the State regarding the education of children with disabilities.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 212 75. Provide an update of how OSSE is providing support to schools in the bottom five percent of schools in the STAR Framework. OSSE is investing $11 million in federal funding to the schools that were first identified as Comprehensive Support (CS1) in Dec. 2018 for being in the bottom five percent of DC's statewide accountability system. After identification, schools worked with t heir LEAs and communities to conduct needs assessments and design multi -year school improvement plans that are available on the Investment in Schools webpage . In year two (SY 2019- 20), eight CS1 schools received approximately $4.86 million to implement their school improvement plans. OSSE and DCPS met monthly for grant oversight and reviewed evidence of CS1 schools' progress against their planned approaches in January 2020. Prior to the year three grant application cycle, CS1 schools and LEA leaders shared their progress to date with OSSE and DME and shared plans for continuous improvement in the 2020- 21 school year. For year three (SY2020- 21), CS1 schools received approxi mately $3.36 million to continue implementation of their school improvement plans, with modifications as needed based on lessons learned and ongoing stakeholder engagement. OSSE reviewed evidence of progress through a desktop audit in Jan. 2021 and will continue to support LEA grant oversight through monthly touchpoints. Due to the pandemic in March 2020, OSSE was granted an Assessment and Accountability waiver from the US Department of Education (USED). As a part of this waiver, schools designated as CS1 schools were required to remain in that same designation for the next school year, and OSSE will continue to support these schools in FY2021. Through additional flexibilities made available from USED , OSSE is applying to extend the timeline forward one additional year and will not be required to designate new CS1 schools until the Fall of 2022. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 213 76. Please describe any pla ns OSSE has made to address learning loss by (1) students overall; (2) students who are defined as at -risk; and (3) students with special needs. Include in your response what supports OSSE will provide to LEAs to address the academic recovery of each gr oup of students. As the state education agency for the District of Columbia, OSSE sets high standards, supports LEAs with grants and technical assistance to address their needs, and strategically invests statewide resources to improve instructional outcomes. We will continue to take those steps to address learning loss experienced as a consequence of the pandemic. It was important to lay a foundation for high quality virtual learning. Through our Guiding Principles for Continuous Education , OSSE provided LEAs with clear and high expectations of what constitutes quality, continuous education for all students. The Continuous Education principles and the associated plans required LEAs to describe the steps that they will take to support the social -emotional needs of students, support students that are academically behind, and to address the needs of specific groups of students including those that are homeless, English language learners, or with disabilities. OSSE will revisit these principles with our stakeholders, and we plan on revising the principles to focus on accelerating unf inished learning. We know that a significant number of students will have missed prior knowledge and skills that are essential for future academic work. For some students, this will require direct instruction of new material, for others, more time for gui ded or independent practice. As was true before the pandemic, there will be instances where students have lost learning time; students will have different needs based on their individual circumstances. The revised guiding principles will place special emp hasis on determining student learning gaps and responding to them in a way that best supports the learner. LEAs will write plans for the 2021- 22 school year with a focus on describing how they will operationalize these processes. OSSE will provide guidance , feedback, and training on how LEAs can fulfill these guiding principles. OSSE also provides supports to LEAs through grants, technical assistance and guidance on how to best allocate those resources. In response to the significant strain placed on LEAs and schools during the pandemic, the federal government has appropriated emergency funds to state education agencies to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. OSSE will administer grants funded through the Elementary and Secondary School Eme rgency Relief Fund (ESSER). Federal funds were appropriated to ESSER on two separate occasions - for ESSER I through the CARES Act in March 2020 and in ESSER II through the FY 2021 Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act in December 2020. OSSE applied and received approximately $42 million from ESSER I. OSSE sub -granted the vast majority of these funds, 90 percent or approximately $38 million, to LEAs that receive Title -IA funds as required by federal law. OSSE has announced preliminary allocations of ESS ER II funds. These allocations total about $172 million, with 90 percent of the total award or about $155 million to be sub -granted to LEAs. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 214 ESSER funds may be used on broad allowable uses to address the needs of students that are at - risk and students with disabilities. Finally, OSSE invests funds strategically based on the needs of the state through teacher training, instruc tional supports, and access to data. OSSE anticipates allocating the remaining 10 percent, which totals about $17 million of ESSER II funds in three ways. First, OSSE aims to provide comparable funding to non- Title IA eligible LEAs. Allocations to LEAs would be based on student enrollment. As with ESSER federal allocations, LEAs would be able to spend their allocation on broad allowable uses including any expense allowable under federal education law and to support COVID -19 response. Second, OSSE will invest in continuing to expand existing behavioral health supports for students and adults, including focus areas identified by LEAs such as telehealth services, emergency response, and curation of high- quality resources for school communities. The pandemic's impact on child development will be significant and many of our students will need these additional supports. Finally, OSSE aims to invest remaining funding into instructional and special education supports to address accelerating unfinished lear ning. We are exploring the creation of a virtual coaching program to help teachers build their skills in virtual instruction. We will continue to offer professional development to support inclusive learning. We are also thinking about ways to invest in tools to help school leaders track and monitor student needs and outcomes, as well as ways to provide administrative and data supports to help schools manage the backlog of special education coordination activities. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 215 Special Education Student Transportation 77. With regard to special education transportation, please provide the following information for School Year 2019- 2020: (a) Any actions taken over the last year or planned for the next year to improve the special education transportation system; (b) Number of special education students receiving transportation services from OSSE -DOT; (c) Number of special education students receiving transportation services from contractors; (d) In table format, the percentage of buses that arrived at school on time, broken down by month; (e) In table format, the percentage of bus ride times that exceeded one hour, broken down by month; (f) In table format, the number of complaints received regarding special education transportation, broken down by month and su bject matter of complaint; (g) In table format, the average number of days it took to resolve complaints regarding special education transportation, broken down by month and subject matter of complaint; and (h) The number of buses and vans in service and their average age for each type; (a) Actions taken over the last year or planned for the next year to improve the special education transportation system. FY20 Actions Completed OSSE DOT completed the renaming of the entire school bus fleet from District of Columbia Public Schools to District of Columbia Student Transportation which better illustrates the supports OSSE DOT provides for all District LEAs (DCPS and DC public charter schools). OSSE DOT received 20 new vans to be utilized for student transportation. OSSE DOT began planning a Stop Arm Pilot Program. Stop arm cameras will ensure the safety of pedestrians while loading and unloading the bus supporting the Mayor's Vision Zero Campaign. Drivers who illegally pass an activated stop arm pose a threat to the safety of our children and staff. The pilot consisted of five buses, each bus equipped with stop arm cameras that collected data for the duration of the pilot. Staf f involved in the pilot program received FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 216 detailed training on the program and process. The pilot was placed on hold due to COVID -19 closures and will resume when in person services begin. OSSE DOT maintained a clear line of communication with internal a nd external stakeholders regarding services during the COVID -19 closures. OSSE DOT participated in weekly meetings with DCPS and OSSE DOT leadership regarding reopening plans, start of school and student accommodations (i.e. nursing). OSSE DOT facilitated meetings with the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) and other parent advocates to discuss parent concerns and OSSE DOT plans for reopening. OSSE DOT also developed a plan to support LEAs and met with LEA leaders in preparation for return to school. OSSE DOT developed a Bus Safety Kit and reopening video focused on providing content and information related to internal measures the agency is taking to create a safe transportation environment upon reopening. As a result of local and federal guidelines pertaining to health and safety in response to COVID - 19, OSSE DOT updated its fleet guidelines. OSSE DOT cleans all buses in use at the beginning and end of each tour to include wiping down frequently touched surfaces and seats. Electrostatic sprayer ma chines have been incorporated into bus cleaning to provide an additional level of disinfecting on the buses. In the event that an individual is confirmed to have COVID -19 and had entered the bus in the prior seven (7) days, the bus would immediately be taken out of service and deep cleaned by a specialized deep cleaning vendor. There is single row, \"Z style\" seating for students, meaning every other seat from left to right. Additionally, standard bus capacity has been reduced in accordance with CDC recommen dations. Wheelchair accessible bus capacity has been reduced by half. To adhere to safety guidance at OSSE DOT terminals and facilities, floor markings have been placed to maintain social distancing. Seating capacity has been limited and/or restricted to reduce capacity inside of buildings. Upgrades have been made to technology so that select in person activities can be done remotely and/ or by phone. All staff and contractors must receive approval prior to entering any OSSE DOT facility and a mask must be worn for the duration of their time on site. Actions Planned for FY21 OSSE DOT will continue to implement \"new normal\" practices in accordance with local and federal guidance as a result of COVID -19. OSSE DOT in collaboration with DC Department of Public Health and OSSE's Health and Wellness Division have ensured that bus drivers and bus attendants are included in Phase 1B of vaccination of workers in the Pre -K-12 educational settings and childcare settings. OSSE DOT in collaboration with the Deputy Mayor for Operations and Infrastructure, District Department of Transportation, and the Department of Motor Vehicles, will begin the implementation of the Stop Arm Camera Project by redeploying a pilot program in FY21. The Stop Arm Project will allow OS SE DOT to place stop arm cameras on its buses and to issue citations for violators. Stop arm cameras will ensure the safety of students, staff and pedestrians while loading and unloading the bus. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 217 OSSE DOT will develop and pilot a more reliable, efficien t and user -friendly Student Ridership Tracking System, routing/scheduling module and GPS which will better meet the needs of operations. This new system will enhance routing and reporting for all stops in a bus journey (arriving/ departing homes, schools, terminals), while removing the existing burden of utilizing multiple systems. OSSE DOT, in collaboration with DGS will award the construction contract and begin construction of the new terminal at W Street. The W Street project will better support the o ver 500 students with disabilities who reside in Ward 5 to their designated schools. OSSE DOT led by the Department of General Services and DC Fire and Emergency Medical Service Department capital project in the Blue Plains/ Southwest Corridor will begin construction on a new terminal facility that will replace the current Southwest Terminal by FY2024. FEMS in coordination with DGS will lead the project, making any necessary enhancement requests by OSSE DOT. OSSE DOT will prepare new school buses and vans received in FY20 to be placed in service in FY21 to include developing a program for the review and storage of camera footage. All newly purchased vehicles are equipped with internal cameras to monitor staff and student safety on the bus and to aid in the investigation of school bus incidents/accidents. (b) Number of special education students receiving transportation services from OSSE - DOT. On average in the 2019- 2020 school year, OSSE DOT provided services to 3,565 students, which includes 105 student s who received parent reimbursement or received transit benefits via the DC One Card. This is a two percent increase compared to the average number of students served last school year. (c) Number of special education students receiving transportation service s from contractors. OSSE DOT contracts with external transportation companies to provide transportation to eligible students with disabilities who are residents of the District of Columbia.

(a) What were the top three compliance issues that OSSE faced with regard to special education transportation in fiscal year 2020? (b) What steps has OSSE taken in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31) to remedy these issues? (a) Top three compliance issues that OSSE faced with regard to special education transportation in fiscal year 2020. The top three complaints are : Early / Late Bus Unprofessional Conduct Student Behavi or (b) Steps agency has taken in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31) to remedy these issues . To address the early/late bus complaints, the first step was to ensure that parents/guardians are aware that according to the OSSE DOT transportation policy, a bus can arrive up to 15 minutes before or after the scheduled pick -up time and still be on time. While this is standard practice for the door -to-door transportation industry, not all parents/guardians may be fully aware of the policy. OSSE DOT has continued to communicate to LEAs, schools, and parents the importance of providing accurate contact information and emphasize procedures regarding pick up and drop offs. OSSE DOT completed a transportation fact sheet for parents detailing the transportation process from IEP declaration to bus arrival. OSSE DOT continued to provide support to LEAs by following up with concerns, assisting with Transportation Request Form submissions, student specific concerns, schedule change notifications and service failure follow up. OSSE DOT also conducted daily meetings to review the prior days On- Time Performance r eport to discuss controllable failures and next steps for adjustments. After the bus driver bench had been reached, OSSE DOT began the SY19- 20 school year with a focus on aggressively recruiting bus attendants in order to decrease service delay. OSSE DOT w ill continue its education campaign among bus staff about the importance of consistency for the student population that OSSE DOT serves and the impact to those students when they do not arrive on time. To address unprofessional conduct complaints, OSSE DOT has continued to focus on providing training to bus staff in many areas to put them in the best position to support the families and students served. OSSE DOT closely tracked unprofessional complaints and used that information to develop and deliver a new Professional Engagement training for bus staff. This training provides guidance to bus team members on communicating with stakeholders in a professional and effective manner. This newly developed training was delivered to staff virtually during the health pandemic and has been made available for managers to provide to staff on an as needed basis. OSSE DOT continues to deliver \"Communicate with Heart\" training with a goal of all FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 222 employees receiving the customer service training program developed by the Cleveland Clinic as well as \"Right Response\" training to provide bus staff with additional skills on interacting with students and parents, focusing on proactive strategies to manage the environment. To address student behavior complaints, OSSE DOT ha s been delivering multiple training programs that provide guidance to bus staff on how to best support the students transported. \"Behavior Support\" training provides evidenced- based behavior management strategies designed to increase the capacity of bus teams to decrease frequency of escalation and to manage students in crisis. \"De -escalation Techniques\" training provides participants with guiding principles for effective de- escalation of unsafe behavior. \"Disability Awareness\" training is designed to teach staff about common disabilities that OSSE DOT bus teams may encounter when transporting students. The bus staff learns about the characteristics relating to each disability and the challenges manifested during transport. OSSE DOT also regularly partners w ith LEAs and schools to focus on targeted support techniques for individual students. Partnering with these educators and service providers gives OSSE DOT insight into how to specifically handle and respond to specific student behaviors. The goal of delive ring these training sessions and partnering with educators and service providers is not only to lower the amount of student behavior incidents that occur during transport, but to also make the school bus a safer place for everyone on board.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 224 80. Describe any technology upgrades OSSE's Department of Transportation (OSSE - DOT) has taken in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31) to improve the tracking of buses and to communicate with parents and schools regarding arrivals and pick- ups. In FY20, OSSE DOT provided refresher training to Transportation Online Tool for Education (TOTE). This training helps transportation information for student routing is accurately entered into the system. As a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, OSSE DOT complete d several critical updates to support the necessary changes to its transportation systems. COVID -19 caused schools to make significant calendar and schedule changes to accommodate both in- person and virtual learning. These changes required OSSE DOT to swi ftly implement additional programming of the TOTE application to ensure continued support of the various calendars and school changes. Additionally, OSSE DOT enhanced its FASTER system, a fleet management application that supports OSSE DOT's fleet operat ions. The upgraded FASTER system will provide more enhanced fleet management capabilities to include inventory and maintenance tracking for the division. OSSE DOT upgraded its Kronos application, used by all drivers and attendants to independently report their time and attendance. This upgrade has continued to improve payroll reconciliation and processing time. This upgrade to the Kronos application ensured that OSSE DOT is fully equipped with the latest technology and ensured security compliance. Duri ng this upgrade OSSE DOT also configured and deployed Kronos mobile, which will help ensure that drivers and attendants sign- in and sign- out via their mobile phones while on the work site. The Trapeze routing software system was also updated in preparati on for SY20- 21 to support the new school calendars and schedule changes. The urgent system changes helped to ensure that operations could function successfully, and OSSE DOT could deliver the services needed to the students the agency serves. In FY21, OS SE DOT will pilot a more reliable, efficient, and user -friendly comprehensive transportation system to include, routing and scheduling, the parent notification system, student ridership tracking and GPS, which will better meet the operational needs of the division. This new system will enhance routing and reporting for all stops in a bus journey (arriving/ departing homes, schools, terminals), making the routes traceable, allow for parent tracking, while easing the existing burden of utilizing multiple syst ems. The system will also enhance and improve data collection, data flow, data synchronization, system cohesion, and agency responsiveness, as well as eliminate redundancy across multiple system solutions.

(b) How many OSSE -DOT staff, if any, has OSSE furloughed during School Year 2019- 2020 or 2020- 2021 (as of January 31) due to the COVID -19 pandemic? (c) Please describe what duties OSSE -DOT's staff have fulfilled during the COVID - 19 pandemic since the demand for bus drivers and aides as dropped drastically. (a) OSSE -DOT's efforts to reduce the number of vacancies with regard to drivers and aides. For School Years 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 (as of January 31) , and the number of drivers/aides needed and how many of each are employed. In FY20, OSSE DOT reached its driver bench and shifted its focus to increase recruitment efforts for bus attendants. OSSE DOT in collaboration with OSSE HR, continued its hiring campaign in FY20. This recruitment effort resulted in the hiring of 6 bus drivers and 36 bus attendants during FY20 ending the fiscal year with a 5.36% vacancy rate. Recruitment efforts ended on March 16, 2020 due to a hiring freeze ordered by the Mayor as a result of the pandemic. In SY19 -20, OSSE DOT maintained an active driver bench of 11%, exceeding the target of 10%. However, due to the growing need for 1:1 aide accommodations, the average bus attendant bench in SY19-20 was - 5% thus the need to shift focus to bus attendant recruitment in SY19- 20. Driver and attendant benches refer to t he number of staff available for support in the event the permanently assigned staff are unavailable. It is important to note, driver and attendant benches can easily shift due to absence, extended leave, turnover and fluctuating route counts based on student enrollment. As of February 1, 2021, OSSE DOT had 95 vacancies; 2 of these vacancies have candidates selected. The remaining 93 vacancies include 32 bus drivers, 35 attendants and 26 administrative positions.

(b) What steps has OSSE taken in fiscal years 2021 and 2021 (as of January 31) to support students' preparation for college admission exams? (a) Update on OSSE's free SAT testing for all DCPS and public charter school juniors and seniors for FY18 -21 (to date). In 2012, the Council of the District of Columbia passed the \"Raising the Expectations for Education Outcomes Omnibus Act of 2012\" (D.C. Law 19- 142) which requires ea ch student attending a public high school to take the SAT or ACT before graduating. Because the costs of both tests (over $40 per student) can be a barrier for students, OSSE provides all juniors and seniors who attend public high school in the District the opportunity to take the SAT without costs, through SAT School Day. During the fall semester, seniors take the SAT on a given day, and juniors do so during the spring semester. Prior to the pandemic, an eligible student is present at school on SAT School Day, they are required to take the exam. In school year 2019- 20, the SAT School Day administrations were prior to the declaration of the public health emergency. For school year 2020- 21, LEAs were given the option of participating in SAT School Day based on public health guidance and with permission of the State Superintendent . Cost of administering the program (SAT School Day) The table below summarizes the cost of administering SAT School Day. The number of juniors and seniors (based on OSSE -verified data) participating on SAT School Day dates in the 2020- 21 school year are not yet available, and therefore the cost is not available at this time Fiscal Year Administration Cost FY18 $351,921 FY19 $382,091 progress Number of students who utilized OSSE's program and the District's average SAT score The table below includes two test groups - All Test Takers and SAT School Day participants.

Therefore, the number of SAT tests taken exceeds the number of SAT participants. The average test scores reported here represent the average of all scores even w hen a student participated in testing on more than one day. (b) Steps has OSSE taken in fiscal years 2021 and 2021 (as of January 31) to support students' preparation for college admission exams . The District set high academic standards in Math and Engli sh/Language Arts, and exposure to rigorous instruction in those subjects is essential for success on college admissions exams. The steps OSSE has taken in FY 2020 and FY2021 (to -date) to support students' preparation for college admission exams include a r ange of supports offered to LEAs for high- quality secondary education. These include supporting DC's LEAs and schools in adopting rigorous standards and coursework, and by supporting their work to measure student achievement and growth using PARCC and DC S cience assessments in high school. Scoring a 3+ on PARCC assessments is an indicator that students are approaching college -ready and scoring a 4 or 5 indicates college readiness. Schools and LEAs can use this data to better understand students and groups t hat require additional support to be adequately prepared for their postsecondary choices. Since the public health emergency began in March 2020, OSSE has increased flexibility on grants so that schools could use resources in ways that best serve their s tudents, administered federal emergency funding to address the ramifications of the pandemic to LEAs with broad allowable uses, provided standards for continuous learning, convened communities of practice so that education professionals had the opportunity to learn what works from their peers, and provided professional development to improve educator practice. Collectively, these efforts are important to ensuring students are exposed to the content on the SAT and positively impact performance.

Travel Orientation - OSSE Staff members meets with students and parents about the intricacies of travel (many of the Scholars have never trav eled on an airplane before). Peer Orientation - Scholars alumni meet and discuss their experience with new Scholars. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 232 On-going and frequent 1:1 meetings with Scholars for essay writing and application assistance. Once students arrive on campus, students are exposed to: College level academic courses; College professors and staff; College residence halls and college resident life; and Opportunities to explore the surrounding areas, and participate in exploration activities and other cultural exposur e activities. In the 2019- 20 school year, many pre -program experiences were provided, and participating students remained in touch with program staff throughout summer 2020. However, in May 2020, due to challenges related to the public health emergency, this program as originally designed was cancelled for summer 2020. However, Syracuse University offered all 38 students who had been accepted as OSSE Scholars the opportunity to audit one summer college course at no cost and 18 students participated. Addi tionally, all OSSE Scholars were offered the opportunity to participate in an eight -week, virtual college preparation program delivered by the OSSE Scholars Program Manager, and 26 students participated. The virtual college preparation program included synchronous and asynchronous weekly lessons and assignments, and live panel discussions with representatives from college admissions, local and federal financial aid, scholarship programs, college professors, OSSE Scholars alumni and current college students. Activities included essay and personal statement writing, college exploration of match and fit, exploring scholarships, time management and planning for senior year, virtual college tours with OSSE Scholars alumni, financial literacy activities, and a moc k admissions event. (f) Student recruitment and outreach efforts . OSSE's recruitment and outreach efforts involve working with high school counselors and LEA staff to share information about the program and explain the application process. OSSE staff also works with high school counselors to help them better understand selection criteria and thus recommend the best candidates for the program. OSSE staff also visits high schools to hold informational sessions with interested or eligible students. Recrui tment for this program occurs in the fall and spring prior to the program dates and was accomplished prior to the public health emergency. In FY21, these recruitment and outreach activities have continued online. (g) Program outcomes . OSSE administers surve ys in order to measure student feelings and expectations around postsecondary education related to their experience as an OSSE Scholar. Overall, participants indicate that this experience increases their awareness and challenges their assumptions about college. Based on feedback from the 2020 Scholars that responded to surveys, they valued the essay writing instruction and \"developing my personal brand\" sessions most. Many students are using FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 233 essays from this summer as a tool for college applications this fall. They also valued scholarship information (tailored to this particular group) and alumni panels. As this program pivoted to the virtual program model, staff found that additional college preparation support is needed and appreciated among scholars wh o participated. This need informed the inclusion of essay writing and personal statements as early program components. FY 2021 outcomes will be measured after students complete programming in summer 2021. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 234 84. (a) Please provide the number of dual enro llment seats and individual student enrollments OSSE funded in School Year 2019 -2020. (b) Provide OSSE's reasoning for suspending the dual enrollment program and explain how the agency reached its decision. (c) What are OSSE's future plans for the dual enrollment program and when does the agency plan to reinstate it? (a) Number of dual enrollment seats and individual student enrollments OSSE funded in School Year 2019- 2020. OSSE funds dual enrollment in two ways. In the first, OSSE awards competitive grants to fund dual enrollment programs with institutions of higher education (IHEs) that establish partnership agreements with local education agencies (LEAs) through the Dual Enrollment Scholarship program. IHEs are then reimbursed per student, per course, using these grant funds. The second, called the DC Dual Enrollment Consortium, began in the 2018- 19 school year. The Consortium is designed to provide additional dual enrollment opportunities for all students, but particularly students atten ding small LEAs that may otherwise not be able to establish strong partnerships with multiple IHEs. This means beginning in the 2018- 19 school year, students could be enrolled in programming provided by the Dual Enrollment Scholarship and the Dual Enrollme nt Consortium. In the 2019- 20 school year, 527 dual enrollment seats were available, and OSSE funded 358 individual students who enrolled in those seats. Note that a student may take multiple courses. (b) OSSE's reasoning for suspending the dual enrollment program and explain how the agency reached its decision. In May 2020, OSSE notified partner institutions of higher education in the Dual Enrollment Consortium and Scholarship programs that OSSE would cancel summer 2020 Dual Enrollment Consortium and Schol arship programs due to the decline in revenue stemming from the ongoing public health emergency. In June 2020, OSSE cancelled dual enrollment programs for fall 2020. (c) OSSE's future plans for the dual enrollment program and when does the agency plan to rei nstate it. In summer 2020, OSSE began planning for the 2020- 2021 school year, and decided to delay the start of the dual enrollment program until spring 2021, with applications for the spring 2021 semester opening in fall 2020. Dual Enrollment Consortium programming re -started for spring 2021, and OSSE -funded dual enrollment will continue, based upon funding availability, in the 2021- 2022 school year.

DCTAG Graduation Rates First year in DCTAG Six percentage of DCTAG students in the application cohort of the corresponding year who earned a Bachelor's or an associate's degree within six years. This means that among students who first applied for and received DCTAG funds in the 2012- 2013 a ward year, 47.1 percent are reported as earning a bachelor's or associate's degree within six years of enrolling in college. These rates vary year -to-year because a student's first year of college enrollment may not be the same as the first year they apply for and receive DCTAG, so students within an application cohort may reach the six- year completion mark in separate academic years. Please note: Students participating in DCTAG are assigned to an 'Application Cohort' based on the year during which the student first applied for and received DCTAG funds. Students who earned an advanced degree (e.g., MA, MD, Ph.D., etc.) are assumed to have completed either a Bachelor's or an associate's degree within six years, and in cases where the student is reported as earning an Master's degree but does not have Bachelor's reported the Bachelor's graduation date was derived by deducting two- years from their Master's graduation date. Students who earned a certificate or who are missing a degree -type are excluded from this analysis.

ATTACHMENT: Q85(e) - DCTAG Institutions.pdf FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 238 86. OSSE set a postsecondary enrollment goal in its most recent strategic plan. Describe the steps OSSE is taking to achieve this goal. In its 2019- 2023 strategic plan, OSSE set the ambitious goal that 1,100 additional students would enroll in postsecondary institutions by 2023 on a path to completing a two- or four -year degree. OSSE set this goal recognizing that in the DC region, the str ong majority of jobs require some level of postsecondary education. Annually measuring progress helps motivate continual improvement and maintain a sense of urgency as DC supports more students along the pathway to meaningful work and family- sustaining wages. The District administers PARCC annually to measure progress towards college and career ready expectations. Although the District has made steady gains on PARCC, more progress is needed across all grades and subgroups of students to ensure more students are ready to succeed in college. In FY20, the agency took multiple steps that support achieving this goal. These include sharing actionable data, encouraging college access, and promoting high expectations through initiatives such as the Career and Technical Education state plan. First, the agency continued sharing actionable postsecondary enrollment data by including 6- and 12-month postsecondary enrollment rates to the DC School Report Card. Community and education partners can now use these school, LEA, and state -level indicators to ask questions, make decisions about programming and supports, and identify gaps among students accessing postsecondary education. As this is the second year of releasing this data stakeholders can now view postsecondar y enrollment rates for previous graduates from the prior two years. The metrics show the six -month and twelve -month postsecondary enrollment rates aggregated by state, LEA, and school levels for all students as well as by student groups. Second, OSSE e ncourages college access in various ways that include funding and direct program coordination. OSSE funds programs that expose low -income students to college -based and academically rigorous programs such as Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement and Internati onal Baccalaureate (IB) exams, and by providing funding for SAT and ACT exams. The Postsecondary and Career Education division coordinates the OSSE Scholars program, which provides high- achieving, academically motivated students who exhibit financial need with the opportunity to attend selective summer college programs. Confronted wi th numerous summer college cancellations due to COVID -19, the PCE team developed and led a virtual college preparations program, as a replacement for their traditional on campus opportunities. The College Conversations program is an invite -only non- traditional college fair created to address the issue of student \"undermatching\" at the postsecondary level. This opportunity exposes invited students to more selective colleges and universities that students may not be familiar with but may be a better fit for t heir abilities and offer greater financial aid. Students gain exposure to the more nuanced admissions processes of selective colleges and universities. In addition to readiness, cost can also be a key barrier for students and families. OSSE continued its work building the education ecosystem's capacity to address this barrier. Together with our partners we supported FAFSA completion work across all LEA's and schools, conducted FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 239 outreach around the DC Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) and other financial ai d options, and maintained postsecondary access supports for students in particular groups - such as students experiencing homelessness. Specifically, OSSE's Postsecondary and Career Education (PCE) division provided three workshops on college selection, financial aid and FAFSA completion. In addition, PCE continued to produce the DCTAG quarterly e -newsletter, TAGTALK. DCTAG, and also gave 70 presentations at college fairs, high schools, college access organizations, and other events (both virtually and in -person) that reached over 4,100 attendees (including both students and parents). Additionally, DCTAG continued to monitor and adjust their application process throughout the COVID- 19 public health emergency to meet the changing post -secondary landscape. The application deadline was extended three times and adjustments were made to required documentation to allow students and families additional time to make informed choices. The DC ReEngagement Center recently developed and began implementing postsecondary planning and supports with clients who are nearing their secondary completion. OSSE also focuses on increasing college persistence and completion rates for students attending public schools in DC by implementing programs that promote FAFSA and col lege application completion, and information sharing for students and educators around making smart college choices. The agency continues investing in setting high expectations by working with stakeholders to create high -quality programs of study through its career and technical education programs. OSSE unveiled a new CTE State Plan that focuses on implementing best -in-class programs of study, promoting innovative strategies to connect students to the workforce, providing a cutting- edge and rigorous cult ure of learning, and inspiring our students to become passionate about their college or career pathway of choice. Further, through this CTE work, OSSE is finalizing articulation agreements with the University of the District of Columbia for approximately 2 0 programs of study. These programs ensure that each student in participating LEAs may choose from multiple postsecondary pathways that lead to high- demand, high- wage careers for this region. Further, they offer multiple on- ramps to postsecondary education, including certificate, apprenticeship, and work -based learning programs, while acknowledging that not all careers require a traditional two - or four -year degree. The agency's postsecondary enrollment goal is one of three goals in the strategic plan that aim to reduce the achievement gap among students in DC; it is also a leading indicator for postsecondary completion. In the next few years, the agency and its partners will continue to focus on the students most proximate to postsecondary enrollment (hi gh school students), but in the future, successes related to the other goals of expanding access to high- quality early childhood programs and academic growth at the elementary and secondary level will ultimately ensure more DC students are prepared for the postsecondary pathways of their choice. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 240 87. The District established the DC Re -Engagement Center (REC) to reconnect youth ages 16- 24 to educational programs. Please provide an update on RECs activities and outcomes in fiscal year 2020 and 2021 (through January 31). The DC ReEngagement Center (REC) is a centralized District service through which out -of- school youth between the ages of 16 and 24 can reconnect to educational options and other critical services to support their attainment of a high school diploma or equivalency. OSSE spearheads this effort with support from DC's Department of Employment Services (DOES), Department of Human Services (DHS), Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS), the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (ON SE), Raise DC's Disconnected Youth Change Network, schools, community- based organizations, and other key partner agencies. In an effort to successfully reconnect youth to school, the ReEngagement Center specialists complete the following steps: Perform s an assessment of academic and non -academic needs to develop individualized reengagement plans; Provides assistance identifying \"best fit\" educational options, including District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, community -based organizations, and faith based organizations; Provides support during the re -enrollment process (collect ing documents, accompanying youth on program visits, and connecting youth to resources that address reengagement barriers); and Provides ongoing support for at least one year after enrollment occurs. Outcomes Number of Disconnected Youth Served in FY 2020 and 2021 to- date In FY20, the DC ReEngagement Center conducted 114 short intakes, conducted 109 full intakes (which includes a full intake interview that identifies barriers to enrollment and retention, a staff review of clients' past academic history , and student completion of the eCASAS assessment to determine literacy and numeracy levels), and reconnected 85 youth to an education program. In FY 21 to- date (through Jan. 31, 2021), the DC ReEngagement Center conducted 18 short intakes, conducted 18 full intakes, and reconnected 12 youth to an educational program. The \"stick rate,\" is another one of the REC's core outcomes which measures a student's six - and 12-month persistence at the program they were enrolled in through the REC. The calculation is run once per quarter and is averaged across quarters using a weighted average of quarterly stick rates, which controls for variation in the number of youth in each cohort based on their date of enrollment. When constructing this measure, there is a distinction between clients who have remained engaged, or active, with the ReEngagement Center (successfully contacted by their case manager at least once per month) and those clients who are inactive for a variety of reasons (including but not limited to refusi ng services or changing contact information without notifying FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 241 a case manager). Weighted \"Stick Rates\" for the first quarter of FY20 through the first quarter of FY21 are presented in the table below. DC ReEngagement Center Weighted Stick Rates (FY20Q1 t hrough FY21Q1) 6 Months 12 Months Active and Inactive Clients 97.35% 92.58% Active Clients Only 98.27% 94.44% The six months stick rate describes the percentage of youth who, six months after enrolling for the first time since coming to the ReEngagement Center, were still enrolled or had earned a credential. Youth are included in this calculation if their 180th day since being first enrolled occurs in the quarter the calculation was computed. The District of Columbia Government began modifying its operations starting Monday, March 16, 2020, in response to the public health emergency related to the coronavirus (COVID -19). This greatly impacted the operating status of both the DC ReEngagement Center and partner local education agencies t hat are the main source of enrollment placements and many public service entities that provide youth referrals to the DC ReEngagement Center. The overall total for the fiscal year is a direct reflection of the impact of the changes to operations and enroll ment options, each extremely limited during this time. This remains true for the first quarter of FY 2021. Activities In response to changes in operating status, the DC ReEngagement Center launched an online referral form and an online chat function, incr eased the frequency of client check -ins, and also established a weekly online group session for all youth and families called DC REC LIVE to provide additional opportunities for clients to remain engaged as well as to learn and share information about resources and opportunities, and to connect with each other. Details about these efforts and other shifts the DC ReEngagement Center made to marketing, outreach, and youth/partner engagement effort in response to COVID -19 are included here: The Learning Circle (TLC) - Established to provide DC ReEngagement Center clients with a virtual community for integrated learning and social engagement, during the COVID- 19 pandemic. DC REC LIVE (Virtual Youth -Driven platform for engagement) - Strategic weekly virtual en gagement opportunities for REC youth that offers direct support to students inclusive of but not limited to the following: resource sharing, motivational speakers, career readiness efforts, mental health and wellness conversations, KBEC stipends, and clien t-specialist engagement through group and individual conversations around real issues and barriers facing our youth during the COVID -19 pandemic. Back on Track -Building Stronger Partnership Meetings - Hosted a series of virtual meetings held with all educ ational partners highlighted on the Back on Track website. These meetings were a re -introduction of staff and supporting team members, overviews of each program's intent, program offerings, and enrollment processes. Each program also provided an update around enrollment availability and timing and how they were impacted during the COVID -19 pandemic. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 242 Virtual Partnership meetings - Hosted four virtual partnership meetings from the month of June through October, which consisted of over 70 individual professionals representing over 30 agencies to provide a platform for OSSE -REC updates during the pandemic and sharing of resources between agencies and identifying opportunities for cross agency collaboration. DC REC Pop -Ups - The DC ReEngagement Center held four in -person socially distanced events after the start of the COVID -19 public health emergency, to meet the educational, physiological, socio- emotional and socio- economic needs of our students. REC Pop- Ups were held outside and were used to collect document s needed to complete school enrollment and to distribute GED study guides and non- perishable food items and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). DME and other agency led Designated youth focus groups - The DC ReEngagement Center participated in a number of youth centered focus groups hosted by agencies such as the DME, Metro Transit Police Department, and Martha's Table during the pandemic. These individual focus group sessions brought together DC ReEngagement Center clients to the table for discussion ar ound a myriad of topics such as current social issues, student safety, transportation concerns and safely traveling within certain areas of the District, ward specific needs, immediate youth needs, current barriers impacting their growth and success, educational needs, and the impact of COVID -19. The DC ReEngagement Center launched REC's youth action board, better known as the C.O.R.E. (Council of Real Experiences) to support peer -to-peer outreach efforts, harness youth voice for program improvement, and s upport the creation of student leaders. Partnerships The success of the DC ReEngagement Center is due to the many partnerships formed throughout the District. The small number of DC ReEngagement Center staff maximize services and supports for clients by partnering with these agencies and below are highlighted agencies that have contributed to the overall success of the DC ReEngagement Center in FY 2020 and FY 2021 to- date (a full list of partnerships is available in the DC ReEngagement Center's annual report upon request). Please note: co- locations that are in -person were paused in response to public health guidance related to COVID -19. Co-located intakes in Columbia Heights: The ReEngagement Center's bilingual specialist continues to conduct intakes as needed in Columbia Heightsin order to provide service to youth who are not able or willing to come to the Northeast location. Department of Human Services (DHS): O pportunities include bi -weekly coordinated entry youth housing meetings , an assessment site f or the youth and single adult housing assessments, and colocation at the ReEngagement Center to support clients' who need to access TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, and other DHS administered benefits. Lastly, the DC ReEngagement Center is a primary TANF vendor which means that DHS can assign TANF customers who are eligible for REC services to the REC. Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement's (ONSE) Pathways Program: The ReEngagement Center partners with the Pathways Program to provide educational assessments, planning, and referrals; as well as barrier identification and remediation for all Pathways participants. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 243 OSSE's Division of Early Learning and the Department of Human Services: ReEngagement Center Specialists have been trained to complete the full application process needed to issue child- care vouchers at the REC to youth parents who identify child -care as a barrier to re- enrollment. Department of Employment Services (DOES): DOES makes referrals to the REC, assists eligible ReEngagement Center clients in participating in the Career Connections employment program and the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP), provides multiple interns to the DC ReEngagement Center under the Project Empowerment program and the MBSYEP, and provides employment and job readiness services for REC clients through the American Job Center. KBEC Group (a DOES vendor through the Office of Youth Programs (OYP) Youth Earn And Learn Program (YEALP)): The REC established a new partnership with KBEC that resulted in direc t support to students including; payments for completion of GED lessons, attainment of a National Work Readiness Certificate, and participation in DC REC Live and The Learning Circle (TLC) activities. Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services (DYRS): DYRS refers clients in need of educational support to the ReEngagement Center and REC staff provide onsite intakes at DYRS's Achievement Centers twice a month. Finally, DC ReEngagement Center developed and began implementing postsecondary planning and s upport for clients who have completed or are close to completing their secondary education. The initiative includes utilizing the Career Coach DC website to conduct career interest inventories and explore labor market information data regarding different c areer options and plan for their next steps in their career pathway, whether that leads them to a degree granting college or university, a publicly funded job training program to earn an industry- recognized credential, an apprenticeship program, or directl y into the workforce. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 244 88. What programs were offered by OSSE in fiscal year 2020 to assist District residents in achieving their high school equivalency? The District of Columbia, through OSSE, offers residents multiple pathways through secondary education, including waivers for local education agencies (LEAs) to offer competency- based education programs, as well as funding for GED, the National External Di ploma Program (NEDP), and basic education programs for adult learners. Specifically, OSSE assists District residents in achieving their high school equivalency in two ways - (1) direct service at OSSE's GED Program Office, and (2) federal and local sub -grants to programs that provide basic education and preparation for two high school equivalency assessments - the GED and the NEDP. Both options support pathways to a secondary credential, either a traditional high school diploma or a state diploma. Since the state diploma option was enacted, each adult learner who passes all sections of the GED has received a state diploma, and learners who complete an NEDP have received either a high school diploma or state diploma, depending on the entity that supporte d their NEDP completion (see Program Support below). Between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, OSSE awarded 145 State High School diplomas to residents who passed all sections of the GED and 43 State High School diplomas to residents who successfully completed the NEDP for a grand total of 188 State Diplomas earned. GED Program Office The DC GED Program Office is an official GED\u00ae testing center and serves as the single source in DC for administering the GED Tests via computer and endorsing candidates who successfully pass the GED Tests to receive the state diploma. This office informs adult educators and learners about the GED requirements, and provides professional development, technical assistance, and resources to GED instructional programs t o support students' success in GED programs. Since FY 2016, individuals who passed the GED received state diplomas. Program Funding and Support OSSE's Adult and Family Education (AFE) team supports LEAs and community- based organizations in the District that offer instruction towards the GED as well as the NEDP. The NEDP awards a secondary credential to adults who successfully demonstrate academic and life - skill competencies that have been determined to be what every high school student should know or be able to do. The AFE team works with Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS), NEDP National Office, DC Public Schools (DCPS), the DC Public Charter Schools, and community- based organizations to expand the NEDP option in the District of Colum bia. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 245 89. Please provide and update on the Adult and Family Education (AFE) grant. In FY20, OSSE, in collaboration with the WIC, awarded Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) and WIC Career Pathways funding to 10 sub- grantees to implement the Integrated Education and Training (IE&T) service models introduced in the FY 2017 grant competition. These sub -grantees include: Academy of Hope Public Charter School Briya Public Charter School Catholic Charities Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation Four Walls Career and Technical Education Center Latin A merican Youth Center Opportunities Industrialization Center - DC So Others Might Eat (SOME) YouthBuild Public Charter School YWCA - NCA The IE&T models implemented by the 10 providers include the provision of adult education and literacy, workforce preparation, and training services for a specific occupation or occupational cluster to 1,000 District residents for educational and career advancement. IE&T programs provide adult learners with an opportunity to enhance their literacy and numeracy skills or to earn a secondary school credential while working towards acquiring an entry level and/or industry recognized certification. Additionally, in FY 2020, OSSE, in collaboration with the WIC, conducted a new grant competition for FY21- FY25 AEFLA fundi ng. The federal FY 2021 funding began July 1, 2020 and continues through June 30, 2025 (assuming performance targets are met). Awards were made to the following 12 IE&T providers: Academy of Hope Public Charter School Briya Public Charter School Catho lic Charities Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation Four Walls Career and Technical Education Center Latin American Youth Center Career Academy Public Charter School Opportunities Industrialization Center - DC So Others Might Eat (SOME) Southeast Welding The Family Place Public Charter School YouthBuild Public Charter School YWCA - NCA FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 246 Both the FY20 and FY21 grants are federal grants, and AFE reports to the National Reporting System (NRS) annually on metrics required by the Department of Education. These metrics can be broken down into the following categories (as defined by AEFLA) for FY20. In total, 814 adult learners received services in OSSE AFE funded programs in FY20. Of this number, 809 learners met the National Reporting System (NRS) guidelines of having a valid assessment and 12 or more instructional hours in the program year to be reportable to the US Department of Education. The remaining five adult learners engaged in one to 11 instructional hours. For FY20, OSSE established a measurable skill gains performance target of 44 percent for all ABE and ESL Educational Functioning Levels (EFLs). This target represents the proposed percentage of adult learners making a measurable skill gain (e.g. achieving an educational functioning level gain, acquiring a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, or exiting a program below the postsecondary level and enrolling in postsecondary education and training during the program year). While OSSE AFE did not achieve its target of 44 percent, with 41.88 percent of students enrolled in an OSSE AFE -funded program achieving a measurable skills gain, it should be noted that this rate was achieved as of March 13, 2020 as COVID -19 required programs to suspend in- person services and remote CASAS assessments were not available until after the end of the FY20 program year. This means that the state was only two percentage points from achieving the target while it was still in the third quarter of the program year. I f the pandemic had not occurred and the state and local program providers could have continued to administer pre -and post -tests to students and collect and report on measurable skills gains without interruption throughout the remainder of the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the program year as well, the state would have very likely exceeded its target of 44 percent for FY20, as it did in FY19 (49.8 percent). The state will continue to work with local program providers to offer pre - and post -assessme nt services to students remotely, in place -based settings using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and social distancing and/or via a hybrid of the two approaches, so the state can meet or exceed its negotiated target of 47 for measurable skills gains in FY21.

FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 252 Health and Wellness 92. Provide a n update on OSSE's collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health and the Department of Health on the implementation of programs to identify and assist children with behavioral health or developmental problems at DCPS and at charter schools. What n ew work was completed in fiscal year 2020? Please also describe the training made available to LEAs on crisis response and intervention and which LEAs participated. OSSE has continued to collaborate with DC Department of Health (DC Health) and DC Depart ment of Behavioral Health (DBH) in the development and delivery of services to children and youth in the District and to offer guidance, actionable resources, and promising practices to help education agencies and schools address the unique challenges of behavioral health services during the COVID -19 public health emergency. From late March to early May 2020, OSSE and DBH staff supported the DME Mental Health Crisis Response Working Group, leveraging the collective expertise of District government and education agencies to develop resources and implementable solutions to immediate challenges related to the COVID -19 public health emergency. Through the efforts of the working group and the existing DC School Behavioral Health Community of Practice (DC CoP), a summative Q&A resource on school mental health and wellbeing was published and included resources for school leaders, staff, behavioral health providers, and families. During summer 2020, OSSE published the following resources to support the agency's Guiding Principles for Continuous Education that promote mental health, social -emotional learning and psychoeducation during distance, hybrid, and in- person learning environments: School Climate and Culture Ti er 1 (Universal) Planning Matrix : supports schools with phased planning and implementation of policies, practices, and engagement activities that support safe and supportive environments . Data to Action Guide: Addressing Youth Risk Behavior through Health Education : elevates trends in students' self -reported risk behaviors and provides educators with resources to support the integration of critical health and safety concepts into in- person and remote learning plans. In addition to mental health, this guide covers sexual health and disease prevention, nutrition, physical activity, and substance use prevention. School Behavioral Health Universal Support Planning Webinar : supports school behavioral health teams with implementing multi -tiered mental health services that include clear referral pathways to treatment and crisis response protocols. OSSE has continued to work closely with the Department of Behavioral Health and directly with LEAs to support student and educator behavioral health, through both the city -wide School Behavioral Health Expansion as well as Project AWARE, a five -year grant received by OSSE from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 253 The goal of the School Behavioral Health Expansion Program is to integrate school and community -based provider services to ensure all schools provide mental health promotion and prevention, intervention, and direct behavioral health services and supports. Led by DBH, and guided by the Coordinating Council on School Behavioral Health, the expansion effort is executed in partnership with OSSE, education agencies, schools, community providers, parents, youth, and education advocates. Leadership from OSSE's Div ision of Health & Wellness serve as members of the Coordinating Council, members of the Community of Practice and evaluation core teams, and as co -chairs for the implementation sub -committees. The implementation committee, comprised of leadership from OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness, DBH, DCPS, and DC Health, is focused on supporting schools with annually assessing the school's available behavioral health services and setting program goals, scoping out the sequence of implementation tasks for executing the expansion plan, and establishing standard benchmarks for year to year. The selected needs assessment - the School Strengthening Tool - was adapted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) School Health Index and is a self-assessment and planning guide that enables school teams to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the school's policies and programs for promoting health and safety, develop an action plan for improving student health and safety, and involve teachers, parents, students, and the community in improving school policies, programs, and services. OSSE members of the implementation committee operationalized the self -assessment process, created online accounts for Sc hool Behavioral Health Coordinators and CBO Clinicians, provided individualized communication to each school/CBO partner, and revised the annual work plan template. Each work plan submitted by a school/CBO partner indicated self - assessment scores in four a reas: (1) School Counseling, Psychological, and Social Services; (2) Social and Emotional Climate; (3) Employee Wellness and Health Promotion; and (4) Family Engagement. Four additional open- ended questions outline the current mental health needs of the school and the resources available to support improvements. The work plan outlines the school's goals for the year across the three tiers of intervention - prevention and mental health promotion, early intervention, and direct services. The work plan support s coordination and collaboration among all of the behavioral health providers within each school and assists with goal alignment and reducing duplication of services. In FY20, OSSE hired key personnel to support school leaders (with a focus on charter s chool leaders) to increase their readiness and ability to implement the multi- tiered model of prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. This staff person assists schools with the School Strengthening Tool process and ongoing work plan impleme ntation. Additionally, in FY20, OSSE and DBH completed phase one for Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience Education (AWARE), a five -year $8.8 million dollar grant awarded to OSSE in FY18 by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This grant opportunity, which complements the significant local investment in school mental health, allows OSSE and DBH to deepen the partnership with three large LEAs (DCPS, KIPP, and Friendship Public Charter School) to support t he development of multi- tiered systems of mental health supports for students, educators, and school communities. Mental health FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 254 promotion, trauma -responsive practices and family engagement are key elements of the model of care. Major actions through Projec t AWARE in FY20 were as follows: Project AWARE schools have adopted or expanded the use of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a 25- item behavioral health screening tool for youth that assesses emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hypera ctivity and inattention, peer relationship problems, and pro- social behaviors. A total of 21 trauma informed training sessions were hosted for staff at Project AWARE schools, ranging from how to promote trauma informed classrooms to providing trauma informed care virtually. Project AWARE schools hosted 17 trainings in FY20 and 19 trainings so far in FY21 elevating topics of mental health and wellness to parents and families through live and on-demand webinars, workshops and skill building events. Utiliz ing Project AWARE investments, staff from OSSE Division of Health and Wellness (H&W) and Division of Student Transportation, as well as staff from DCPS, KIPP PCS, and Friendship PCS, were certified as Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) trainers. OSSE fa cilitated two in -person and three virtual YMHFA trainings in FY20 and will continue to offer the trainings virtually on a monthly basis in FY21. Project AWARE LEAs will begin training school level staff in 2021. The Project AWARE team hosted suicide prevention education training for DCPS, KIPP PCS, and Friendship PCS mental health professionals in July 2020 and continues to provide technical assistance as our AWARE LEAs roll -out prevention education to their student community. On the subject of training and trauma -informed practices, both local and federal investments supported the District's school -based behavioral health Community of Practice (DC CoP). The DC CoP advances the citywide school behavioral health expansion and Project AWARE by inviting sc hool behavioral health coordinators and community- based clinicians to participate in a peer learning environment aimed at building the capacity to implement high- quality school - based behavioral health systems. The DC CoP served as an essential link to and across multiple District efforts focused on school -based behavioral health. During the 2019 -20 school year, the DC CoP facilitated monthly learning events and shared conversations to further best practices in school behavioral health. OSSE partnered with D BH and the DC CoP to develop sessions on tele -mental health and multi- tiered systems of support. Within the DC CoP is the Crisis Intervention Practice Group, which is co- chaired by an OSSE staff member and convened five sessions with school behavioral heal th professionals and administrators in FY20. Practice group participants represented nine LEAs: Cedar Tree Academy Public Charter School DC Bilingual Public Charter School DC International Public Charter School District of Columbia Public Schools Elsie Whitlow Stokes Community Freedom Public Charter School Friendship Public Charter School KIPP DC Public Charter School Monument Academy Public Charter School FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 255 Rocketship Public Charter School Lastly, OSSE and DBH continued to collaborate on communication and compliance strategies related to mandated behavioral health training requirements for all DCPS and public charter school administrators and teachers in FY20 (DC Official Code \u00a7 7-1131.17).

(c) OSSE enforcement of health education and physical education requirements during the COVID -19 pandemic and distance learning. OSSE continues to enforce health and physical education during the COVID -19 public health emergency. In an effort to ensure schools continued to offer health and physical educati on instruction and meet Healthy Schools Act requirements during remote and hybrid learning, OSSE issued school health reminders to LEAs which outlined health and physical education requirements for Kindergarten through Grade 12, including clarifying to LEA s that schools must continue to enforce and report on health and physical education requirements during the COVID -19 public health emergency. OSSE hosted a technical assistance call with LEA leaders to discuss strategies to meet these requirements in a dis tance learning posture. Additionally, OSSE developed the Data to Action Guide: Addressing Youth Risk Behavior Through Health Education to support the implementation of health and physical during dist ance learning. The Data to Action Guide elevates critical health and physical education standards and connects schools to a variety of community partners, training opportunities, and curricula. Finally, OSSE worked with DCPS and the Healthy Youth and Schools Commission Physical Activity subcommittee to identify and disseminate existing tools and resources to support teachers with planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of health and physical education during remote and hybrid learning. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 261 95. Describe OSSE's efforts in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (through January 31) to increase participation in the Child and Adult Care Food Program and promote health and wellness through Healthy Tots programming and funding. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Healthy Tots Act (HTA) provide an important funding stream that not only increases access to food for children in the District, but also supports child development facilities in becoming financially str onger by tapping into available funding sources. CACFP provides nearly 5 million meals to children in the District of Columbia through an investment of approximately $10 million. Most eligible child development facilities in the District participate in the CACFP. OSSE plays a key role in supporting access to balanced and nutritious meals for children in the District. OSSE provides over $50 million per year in local and USDA funding to support schools, child development facilities, adult day cares, summer meal programs, and other programs with healthy meals that feed District of Columbia residents. Through CACFP, child development facilities in the District can be reimbursed for up to four meals per day, which includes local funding for a fourth meal. The Healthy Tots Act ensures facilities have access to CACFP and additional local reimbursements beyond federal funding. The Healthy Tots Act establishes additional local funding for meals (breakfast, lunch, or supper) served by child development facilities th at: (1) participate in CACFP; and (2) meet the USDA meal requirements. These Healthy Tots Act reimbursements are detailed below: Add10 : Child development facilities participating in the CACFP may request an additional 10 cents ($0.10) for each eligible breakfast, lunch, and supper served to an eligible child. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.2) Local5: Child development facilities participating in CACFP may request an additional 5 cents ($0.05) per lunch or supper when at least one meal component is comprised of a locally sourced food item, as defined in section 101(3) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38-821.01) and unprocessed foods, as defined in section 101(10)(A) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38- 821.01). Locally grown a nd unprocessed foods include milk. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.4- 5) Full Day4: Child development facilities participating in CACFP that have maximized the number of daily meal services eligible for CACFP reimbursements allowed two (2) meals and one (1) snack or one (1) meal and two (2) snacks, reimbursements from the Healthy Tots Fund are made available to facilities for an additional meal to each enrolled and participating child, if 75 percent of the children enrolled and attending the child development facil ity are District residents and at least 50 percent of the enrolled and attending children are eligible for subsidized child care. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.7) The Healthy Tots Act requires licensed child development facilities to participate in CACFP if 50 percent or more of enrolled children are eligible for subsidized child care for at least six continuous months (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38-282.01(a)). Facilities that are mandated to participate in CACFP receive extensive outreach and technical assistance from OSSE i f they are not yet enrolled, including: FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 262 Initial and subsequent notifications from OSSE outlining participation requirements and options for the facility; Introductory in- person technical assistance visit and orientation with the facility to provide face -to-face assistance with Healthy Tots Act and CACFP compliance; Training and reoccurring technical assistance from OSSE throughout the entire CACFP applicat ion process, including a minimum of two in- person technical assistance visits during the full application process; and Individual and group CACFP trainings for child development facilities at individual facilities and OSSE headquarters. Beyond working di rectly with child development facilities to enroll in CACFP, OSSE also provides support and guidance to facilities on health and wellness, including through OSSE's Step by Step Guide for Implementing Wellness Guidelines , direct technical assistance on health initiatives, and wellness challenges for child development facilities to ed ucate them on the Wellness Guidelines. FY20 CACFP HTA Enrollment Activities OSSE has refined an effective and systematic approach for working with child development facilities that are required to participate in CACFP. When a child development facility h as been identified as meeting the HTA requirements to participate in CACFP, OSSE contacts the facility to encourage them to participate and follows up by scheduling an in- person technical assistance visit with the facility to provide face -to-face assistance with HTA and CACFP compliance. Facilities that decide to apply for CACFP receive training and reoccurring technical assistance from OSSE throughout the entire application process, with a minimum of two technical assistance visits during the full application process. Individual and group CACFP trainings for child development facilities are also held at individual facilities and OSSE headquarters. Typically OSSE conducts targeted and data -driven outreach to facilities beginning in March of each year to begin their enrollment activities; however, in spring 2020, OSSE's targeted technical assistance and recruitment pivoted to focus on expanding access to open meal sites due to the impact of the COVID -19 public health emergency on child development facilities and the widespread temporary closures and reduced capacities of facilities. OSSE continued to provide support and technical assistance to facilities participating or wishing to apply for CACFP, but OSSE did not conduct its routine targeted recruitment of new facilities that meet HTA participation requirements. After the transition to a remote working posture as a result of the COVID- 19 public health emergency, OSSE transformed trainings into virtual formats that allowed for self -paced learning, offered int eractive activities with operators, and provided face - to-face online connections. Traditionally, at least one -third of CACFP operators receive more targeted supports which includes off -site and on- site review and technical assistance of their meal service programs. The CACFP team also provides additional technical assistance to any program operator that requests support throughout the year. Coordinated CACFP training occurs quarterly with OSSE's Division of Early Learning, allowing for a broader reach to pr ogram participants. In FY21, OSSE will continue to evaluate how to best engage child development facilities that meet CACFP HTA participation requirements. This will continue to be a challenge for child care FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 263 providers as they navigate the broader demands presented by the COVID -19 public health emergency on their operations, funding, and staffing capacity. FY 20 Healthy Tots Wellness Grant Activities In FY20, the Healthy Tots Wellness Grant awarded $399,581.80 to four community- based organizations to support the dissemination of healthy eating, physical activity, and wellness programming in the District's early child care community. These four community- based organizations touched over 60 child development facilities with programming and/or through the Early Learning Market Share, which provides biweekly deliveries of fresh local produce to child development facilities so they can serve locally grown foods. Grantees targeted facilities in Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and served over 3,000 children, staff, and families in FY20. After the declaration of the COVID -19 public health emergency, the Healthy Tots Wellness Grantees were able to adapt their programming to meet this challenge, including the following examples: Transformed 5 nature -based field trips into virtual learning adventures for children and teachers; Shifted delivery of fresh local produce from being center -focused to being family- focused, ultimately enrolling 700 families in a free local produce delivery program; Led 70 online wellness workshops that provided 50 early childhood teachers and staff with stress -management techniques; and, Led a mini yoga certification course specifically designed for early childhood teachers in black and brown communities. Additionally, the Healthy Tots We llness Grantees led the following initiatives to increase participation healthy eating and promote health and wellness within the District's child development facilities: Provided training and technical assistance for increasing the amount of local food items purchased for meal programs and menu planning; Provided garden design maps, planting plans and materials, and age -appropriate curricula for child development facilities to integrate garden - and nature -based play into early learning classrooms; Targeted support for implementing a staff wellness program to support nutrition, physical activity, mindfulness, stress management, and the formation of healthy habits; The Healthy Wellness grantees are continuing their work in FY21 employing the virtual and socially distanced methods developed earlier in the pandemic.

More details on the Healthy Tots Program are available on the OSSE website . FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 264 96. Please provide an update on OSSE's implement ation of an environmental literacy program. Pursuant to the Environmental Literacy Specialist Pilot Program Amendment Act of 2015 (Section 4101 of the FY16 Budget Support Act of 2015), OSSE continued opportunities and initiatives for District teachers an d organizations to advance environmental literacy in the District, guided by implementation of the DC Environmental Literacy Plan, as described below. Environmental Literacy Leadership Cadre OSSE continued working with its Environmental Literacy Leade rship Cadre (ELLC), a group of individuals from elementary schools across the District who will be responsible for: (1) developing a plan to implement the Environmental Literacy Framework at their schools; and (2) coordinating its implementation. The ELLC meets monthly to discuss environmental education best practices, how the Environmental Literacy Framework supports teaching the Next Generation Science Standards, implementation of school garden and recycling/composting projects, and additional resources a vailable to support schools. There have been three cohorts of ELLC since 2016. In September 2019, OSSE began working with10 elementary schools for Cohort 3 and assigned each teacher a mentor. The cadre met monthly, with a successful transition to a virtual platform in April 2020. Teachers completed landscape surveys of activities currently taking place at their schools and created school -based environmental literacy programs. OSSE continues to engage schools from Cohort 1 (formed in 2016) and Cohort 2 (form ed in 2018) as \"alumni schools.\" These 30 alumni elementary schools continue to receive limited support from OSSE to ensure continuity and sustainability of environmental literacy efforts for almost 7,300 students. Environmental Literacy Advancement Grants To support environmental programming efforts at the ELLC schools, OSSE offers a grant opportunity for nonprofit organizations, strategically emphasizing the physical environment and community involvement components of the Whole School, Whole Communit y, and Whole Child (WSCC) model to provide environmental education programs in the areas of air quality/climate change, water, land, resource conservation, or health. For the 2019- 20 school year, OSSE awarded approximately $215,000 in grants to three nonprofit organizations, who partnered with three additional organizations, to support the following: (1) recycling and composting experiences, (2) watershed explorations and American shad (DC's state fish) restoration activities, and (3) school -based studies of air pollution and tree canopy. Many grant activities planned for the spring month of April and May were cancelled due to the COVID -19 public health emergency. Grantees quickly continued to provide environmental literacy activities and resources: Grantees provided programs to the entire grade level at the cadre schools, as well as some classes at alumni cadre schools. By the end of the academic school year, grantees reached 1,379 students through in- person programming and 521 students through virtual or online platforms. Grantees also supported teachers by quickly creating distance learning resources, which are posted on OSSE's website . Resources include: FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 265 o Environmental videos, some of which received a total of 5,000 views from April through June 2020. o Activities for students and their families for learning at home. o Virtual lessons that can be accessed by a larger audience of teachers. o Nature Connections: Livestream with Environmental Experts, a bi -weekly series that will provide virtual field experiences to locations in and around the District for all students will begin at the end of Feb. 2021. Capital LEAF (Leaders in Environmental Actions for our Future) Program In FY20, OSSE piloted the Capital LEAF (Leaders in Environmental Actions for our Future) program to recognize green, healthy, and sustainable schools in the District. This program pilot, developed in consultation with the Healthy Y outh and Schools Commission and school - and community -based partners, aims to support schools with achieving US Department of Education Green Ribbon certification. The Capital LEAF program also supports the sustainable schools outcome of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement and the education goal of the Sustainable DC 2.0 Plan. Capital LEAF aims to recognize schools that are achieving success in environmental and sustainability outcomes in the following areas: (1) administrative leadership, (2) staff invo lvement , (3) community engagement, and (4) school commitment. It will also consider the extent to which schools are engaging students in conducting audits and action projects in the following areas: energy, schoolyard habitat, health and nutrition, physica l environment, transportation, and waste. In the 2019- 20 school year, OSSE began field testing the recognition process with a small number of schools representing DCPS and charter elementary, middle, and high school students from almost every ward in the D istrict. In February, participating schools included Capital City Public Charter School, Cardozo Education Campus, DC Bilingual Public Charter School, Dunbar High, Hardy Middle, Key Elementary, Kimball Elementary, and Marie Reed Elementary. Due to the COV ID- 19 public health emergency, not every school remained actively involved in the initiative. The schools that completed the field test included Cardozo Education Campus, DC Bilingual Public Charter School, Key Elementary, Marie Reed Elementary and Whitti er Education Campus. Feedback from these schools will be integrated into the program pilot, which is planned to launch in the 202021 school year. Capital LEAF aims to serve as a steppingstone to schools seeking recognition by the US Department of Education's Green Ribbon Schools Program. In 2021, OSSE nominated two schools, DC Bilingual Public Charter School and Key Elementary, to be recognized as US Green Ribbon Schools. The US Department of Education will announce this year's honorees in April 2021. DC Environmental Literacy Plan In FY20, OSSE completed the triennial update of the DC Environmental Literacy Plan in coordination with other District agencies. The updated Environmental Literacy Plan was released in January 2021 and posted on the OSSE website , The Environmental Literacy Plan provides a framework for the District to ensure students will be prepared to make informed decisions concerning the environmental opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. Implementation of the Environmental Literacy Plan is a specific action item to achieve one of the education goals FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 266 in the District's environmental sustainability strategy, Sustainable DC Plan 2.0, plus the regional goals from the 2014 Chesapeake B ay Watershed Agreement.

ATTACHMENT: Q97 - ESEA Title s I, II, II I Funding (FY16 -20).xlsx FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 268 Non-Public Tuition 98. (a) Provide a narrative description on how the budget for Non -Public Tuition is formulated fo r each Fiscal Year. Which services are funded using this money for each student (i.e. tuition, transportation, etc.)? (b) What steps is OSSE taking to assist LEAs in providing students with a free appropriate public education and reducing the number of s tudents who are served by non -public institutions? (a) Narrative description on how the budget for Non -Public Tuition is formulated for each Fiscal Year . The budget for Nonpublic Tuition is established based upon a review of expenditures from three prior years and any rate increases from the placement schools. The OSSE Nonpublic Payment Unit (NPU) is responsible for processing and approving tuition, residential. services, room and board, various related services, including student evaluations and ass essments, and travel expenses to and from residential schools outside of the District, all in accordance with services as documented on the students' Individual Educational Programs (IEPs). The OSSE Nonpublic Tuition Fund covers costs in three categories related to students, aged 3 - 22, who have been identified by an LEA as eligible to receive special education services under IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 et seq. (2004), that are documented in an IEP: (1) Students who are placed into a nonpublic school by the LEA; (2) Students in the care of CFSA, DYRS, or Court Social Services (CSS), and DHCF healthcare MCO who are placed for non - educational reasons and are educated in schools outside of the District; and (3) Students who are placed by court decisions such as, a Hearing O ffice Determination (HOD) or a Settlement Agreement (SA). (b) Steps OSSE is taking to assist LEAs in providing students with a free appropriate public education and reducing the number of students who are served by non- public institutions . If an LEA anticip ates that a student may require a more restrictive nonpublic school placement, the LEA must notify OSSE to initiate the placement review. If at the conclusion of the placement process the IEP Team determines a nonpublic school is required, OSSE is responsi ble for identifying the school location (nonpublic school) for the student. If students are placed for non-educational reasons by other agencies, such as CFSA, DHCF, and DYRS, OSSE funds the educational portion of the placement through the Non- Public Tuition budget. FY 2020 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 269 Through the placement oversight process, OSSE coordinates with LEAs, parents, and other District government child -serving agencies and community partners to ensure that all District students receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). Since its inception, the District's state -level placement oversight process has ensured timely guidance and support to IEP teams and LEA teams in implementing/exhausting appropriate support and strategies for childr en with disabilities before considering placement into a more restrictive separate school setting. This has aided in preventing inappropriate placements into nonpublic settings and supporting LEAs' abilities to serve children in less restrictive public settings. Additionally, through its training and technical assistance approach, OSSE has developed a route to connect LEAs with the appropriate supports in OSSE for further technical assistance and training. For example, through the placement process, shoul d an LEA request additional training and technical assistance on behavioral intervention models, OSSE will share information about upcoming trainings on trauma -informed care and crisis prevention institute trainings and/or provide an onsite consultation to support program design and implementation.
