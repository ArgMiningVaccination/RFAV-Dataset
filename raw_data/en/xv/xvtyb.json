Each time, she has had a powerful and profound effect on me, both from her Medicine Readings and the lessons and ceremonies she offers on Space by Mama Medicine. She is a deeply powerful, intuitive, compassionate and magical healer. I'm proud to call her my teacher.\" - Chloe Zhao WHAT IS A MEDICINE READING? A Medicine Reading is a healing modality created by Deborah Hanekamp designed to empower you to be your own healer. - Medicine Readings are designed to transform the dissonance of superfluous burdens into the resonance of divine love. Together we explore your aura, find pathways to be your own healer, and ignite bespoke energy balancing to empower your voyage in this wild life. Medicine Readings are healing for the healers, holding for the holders, and empowerment for the warriors. Folks come for many different reasons including transition points in life like becoming a parent, loss of a loved one, and moving or changing vocations. Folks also come to just receive a check-in and nourish their spirits. We recommend preparing for your Medicine Reading by reflecting on your intention for the session including anything and everything that is coming up for you in life at this time. When you meet, Deborah will ask if there is anything you are wanting to work on. Then, she will read your aura and speak about intentions you have set, as well as your colors and other elements that could appear such as past lives, ancestral medicine, spirit babies, emotional well being, holistic health, work life, love life, location and family. While Deborah will speak to the way relationships affect you, she will not look into the energy of people around you, because she views that as a violation of their energy. This work is all about you. While Deborah doesn't call herself this, she is what most would consider a medium. She uses that gift to channel only Divine Love. She is very careful not to invoke the energy of loved ones who have passed on because of concern of disturbing a very sacred process their soul could be experiencing. Medicine Readings are focused on empowerment. Deborah holds a patient, nurturing space for you to come to things on your own and avoids specifically telling you where you are meant to go or what you are meant to do. This way, you can find you have always had your own intuitive magic. Deborah's responsibility is to lovingly guide you, but your life is your own creation to make. You gain the medicines of confidence and resilience when you find your own way. Deborah is here only to hold a light for you on your path. Deborah requests that you run everything she suggests through your own processing system, throw out what doesn't feel true for you and work (without attachment) with what does. She wants you to heed your own inner voice and takes no offense and holds no judgement to you seeing things a different way. The beauty of Medicine Readings being offered digitally, is that Deborah can also feel into the energy of the space you are in when you meet. It is requested that you create a sacred space for yourself prior to your Medicine Reading. This should be a place that feels quiet, serene, and where you can lay down and relax. Sometimes in a Medicine Reading, the dialogue portion is followed by a distance healing ceremony to cleanse, bless and protect your aura. Other times, the distance healing is transmitted during the conversation portion of the Medicine Reading. Each Medicine Reading slightly differs depending on the client and the needs of the client during that session. As the Medicine Reading comes to a close, you may be prescribed some homework (action steps toward being your own healer) or a bespoke Ritual Bath to use as a talisman on your healing journey. These are not prescribed every Medicine Reading but as needed for each client's specific process. It is not uncommon to experience some kind of healing crisis either right after you sign up for a Medicine Reading or right after the Medicine Reading itself. A healing crisis often manifests as a cold, head or belly ache, or even resistance. If you experience a healing crisis, it is a way of your energy cleansing itself. Taking a bath, drinking water, walking and napping will help this process be less symptomatic for you. You will feel when it's time to come. Clients see Deborah once a month, twice a year or once in a lifetime for a Medicine Reading, and on rare occasions she tells you to come again in a specific time frame (but never more than once a month). REQUEST A CITY FOR IN-PERSON MEDICINE READINGS \"Thank you for the magical alchemy of love and presence to enable me to see. Thank you for the space to receive what I needed for this apex in my life and the healing you offer with love, it was truly felt.\" - Sammi HOW DOES A MEDICINE READING WORK? Medicine Readings generally book out 3-4 months in advance and recommend booking early to hold a spot. Medicine Readings are NON-REFUNDABLE. We can re-schedule you with a minimum of 48 hours notice. Medicine Readings are done via AUDIO-ONLY (there is an option to request video at your 48 hour reminder email). As our offerings have transitioned to the digital space, I have noticed that the energy flows much more freely with our cameras off, perhaps because when you can relax and focus on your own experience, there is much more capacity for healing. Note: You have the option to RECORD your Medicine Reading at the start of the session. You must click RECORD and record it to your computer. For the deaf community, we can still schedule the ceremony section of the Medicine Reading and do the aura reading over Zoom text chat or via email. Please reach out to connect@mamamedicine.com so we can create a beautiful supportive experience. Please note: I trust the time and space of our Medicine Readings and do not do follow up emails after our appointments. "}
