Continuing to recognise the Society of Homeopaths would give the public a \"false impression\" homeopathy had some basis in science, Simon Stevens told bosses at the Professional Standards Authority (PSA). The PSA, which is answerable to MPs, was set up to \"protect the public and help ensure their health and wellbeing\", its website says. It assesses groups that register health practitioners who are not regulated by statute to help people make decisions. The PSA's website lists the Society of Homeopaths as an accredited register of practitioners. \"We understand that it is not the responsibility of the PSA to review evidence on the efficacy of homeopathic remedies,\" wrote Mr Stevens and Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England's medical director. \"However, it is difficult to see how the Society of Homeopaths can 'inspire public confidence' when the position of both the NHS and Nice, whose statutory duty it is to protect patients and the public by ensuring treatments are effective, have a firm and evidence-based position that homeopathy should not be recommended to the public. \"This is a vital issue at a time when there is a rise of misinformation about vaccines - some of which is apparently promoted by homeopaths - and which poses a significant danger to human health.\" Health news in pictures Show all 40 1/40 Health news in pictures Health news in pictures Coronavirus outbreak The coronavirus Covid-19 has hit the UK leading to the deaths of two people so far and prompting warnings from the Department of Health AFP via Getty Health news in pictures Thousands of emergency patients told to take taxi to hospital Thousands of 999 patients in England are being told to get a taxi to hospital, figures have showed.

Just 86.4 per cent of children had had the full dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab by the age of five in 2018-19, which is below the World Health Organisation's 95-per-cent target. Homeopaths claim \"like cures like\". Remedies are made by dissolving a substance believed to cause a certain illness in water, then diluting that solution many times past the point at which any molecules of the original material remain, before striking it against a hard surface. The weaker the solution, the more powerful the remedy, it is claimed.

After reviewing 225 studies of homeopathy in 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council said there was \"no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions\". A review by the UK parliament similarly found homeopathic claims were not supported by evidence. In a further statement on Monday, Mr Stevens said: \"Anything that gives homeopathy a veneer of credibility risks chancers being able to con more people into parting with their hard-earned cash in return for bogus treatments which at best do nothing, and at worst can be potentially dangerous. \"Whether touted as a miracle cure or as protection from serious diseases - like so-called homeopathic vaccines - homeopathy is no replacement for rigorously tried and tested medical treatments delivered or prescribed by properly-qualified professionals, and by stopping people seeking expert help, misinformation and ineffective remedies pose a significant risk to people's health.\" Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events Last year, the High Court dismissed a challenge by homeopaths to the NHS's decision that ended funding for the unproven pills.
