Perhaps your concerns are more mental/emotional and you require some energetic assistance. Whatever your worries may be, we can help you focus on and achieve your desirable goal. Opting for acupuncture treatment to help address these concerns may be the, \"missing piece,\" of your healthcare plan. In addition to your verbalized concerns, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis that involves looking at your tongue and assessing the quality of your pulse, to map out a plan of various acupuncture points found within the layer of your dermis. By placing single-use filiform needles of various lengths and sizes, a conduit is formed to help \"turn on,\" or \"turn off,\" these points with the idea of achieving your goals. Perhaps needles aren't your thing, fortunately TCM training has afforded us the means of being able to support all populations. Some other modalities that can be used in lieu of, or in conjunction with, are: cupping therapy, body work, electrical stimulation, and light/heat therapies. Alternatively, patients can opt for [Craniosacral Therapy](/craniosacral) with [Dr. Alyssa DeSena](/alyssa-bio) for a less contact approach with similar healing mechanisms. 'Acupuncture,' Dr. Tseng announced, 'may be called the science of the ducts in the human body... There are three hundred and sixty-five points in the body where the ducts rise to the skin. Skin, ducts and inner organs are one system and therefore subject to the changes of yang and yin. The physician must learn where these points are, by the piercing of the proper needle at the proper spot. The length of time for the needle to remain inserted is also important... The purpose is to increase or decrease a fluid \u2014 not so much a fluid as a substance that is nevertheless not a substance... First the pulse must be taken, the coloring noted, and all other signs observed...' \u2014 Pearl S. Buck, The Three Daughters of Madame Liang, 1969 "}
