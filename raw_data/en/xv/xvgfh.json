In recent years, however, they have shifted their practices from the embrace of ritually polluted substances to the healing of stigmatized diseases. In the process, they have become a large, socially mainstream, and politically powerful organization. Based on extensive fieldwork, this lucidly written book explores the dynamics of pollution, death, and healing in Aghor medicine. Ron Barrett examines a range of Aghor therapies from ritual bathing to modified Ayurveda and biomedicines and clarifies many misconceptions about this little-studied group and its highly unorthodox, powerful ideas about illness and healing. Aghor Medicine Pollution, Death, and Healing in Northern India About the Book Reviews \"Fascinating in its exploration. . . . Adeptly introduces the reader to this system of healing and would be a worthwhile read for anyone interested in multicultural medicine.\"\u2014Feminist Review \"A must for those interested in India's plural medical system and the importance of medicine answering.\"\u2014Maarten Bode Medische Antropology \"This is a brilliant book, lucidly written, abounding with insights on medicine, religion and politics in contemporary northern India that will be of interest to social scientists and historians of medicine and religion well beyond its regional framework.\"\u2014Guy Attewell Social History Of Medicine\"Aghor Medicine moves seamlessly between an ethnography of religion and medical anthropology. The stories of suffering and renunciation, of collective experience that turn Indian hierarchy and discrimination upside down are quite marvelous. The writing is clear and direct and the interpretations balanced and scrupulously documented. Barrett has written one of the best accounts on local traditions \"modernizing\" in ways that combine indigenous significance with globally crucial changes that react against health and social inequalities.\"\u2014Arthur Kleinman, Harvard University \"Ronald Barrett's fine account of aghor medicine reveals essential characteristics of India's popular culture, and, since an ashram in California has an important role in the story, of American popular culture as well.\"\u2014Charles Leslie, author of Death Row Letters (forthcoming) Table of Contents List of Illustrations Foreword Jonathan P.
