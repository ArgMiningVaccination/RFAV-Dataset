Possibly the four most frightening words ever spoken by a parent. For with these words comes the unraveling of a family's world. The trauma they will experience is something that will tear at the very fabric of each belief they hold dear. For theirs is the realization that even in a so\u00ad phisticated society such as ours, children are not spared from the anguish of becoming statistics. MISSING CHILDREN: Each of us has heard and read these words countless times. Each of us has wondered what our lives would be like if our child were missing, and each of us has been touched by the pain and anguish experienced by the parents of a missing child. We wonder how they survive. How they can face another day without knowing if their child is alive and well. And we wonder who will help them through this crisis-a crisis that for many will last for years. A crisis that many years ago was often endured alone. A crisis that destroyed marriages and created psychological problems for the remaining children in the home. A crisis that for many years was thought to be the problem of the \"other person.\" Tnere were, however, those individuals who understood early on that child victimization is some\u00ad thing that can touch each of us. They were the vision\u00ad aries-those who knew that with commitment and determination, the missing child issue would be looked upon as a serious one. They knew that their early work would not go unrewarded but would rep\u00ad licate itself through the interest and commitment of others who shared the same vision. These individuals were the first founders of the nonprofit organizations (NPOs) dedicated to providing quality services to the families of missing children. Many of these individu\u00ad als were parents who had missing children. What each of them brought to this issue is in evidence today as we examine the increased role of both the federal and local governments and witness the hundreds of dedi-cated volunteers and professionals throughout the country. It is due to these early efforts that more than one hundred nonprofit missing and exploited child orga\u00ad nizations are in existence today. It is to this group of visionaries that the Nonprofit Service Provider's Handbook is dedicated. The Nonprofit Service Provider's Handbook is a compilation of the NPOs' vast experience and knowl\u00ad edge. The individual interested in starting a nonprofit missing or exploited child organization will find a complete guide for creating the organization-choos\u00ad ing a Board of Directors, raising funds, working with law-enforcement, legislative advocacy, and much, much more. Those already involved in an organiza\u00ad tion will find such invaluable information as keeping the organization going, improving services to families and children, and working more effectively with the media. This handbook is the result of a combined effort of more than a dozen experts in the missing and ex\u00ad ploited child issue. It was created to help existing nonprofit organizations survive and continue to ex\u00ad pand and improve their services to families of missing and exploited children. It was developed to help bud\u00ad ding organizations learn from the experiences of their peers. Further, it provides those committed to pro\u00ad tecting children with the information and advice they need to turn their ideas, hopes, wishes, and dreams into reality. A few notes on the text itself: This handbook is designed as a series of instructive essays by individual experts on the many aspects of building a nonprofit organization serving families of missing or exploited children. Not all their advice and experience will ap\u00ad ply to every service provider reading the book. There will undoubtedly be a number of variations based upon the size and location of the nonprofit organi- v zation and the clients served. A current list of non~ profit service providers is available from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In order to preserve each author's distinctive stamp of individuality, the Nonprofit Service Provid\u00ad er's Handbook has retained the authors' terms as much as possible. Hence, there are three different terms, essentially interchangeable, that are used to describe the nonprofit organization: NPO (nonprofit organization), NSP (nonprofit service provider), and CBO (community-based organization). Regardless of the terms used, however, organizations that work vi on behalf of missing children and their families are, in the truest sense of the words, missing children service providers. They fulfill the same functions and duties as do their counterparts in the fields serving runaway children and other crisis populations, and they should be credited with a title that acknowledges their place in the human services arena. Marsha Gilmer, M.S.S.W. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children l Introduction Beginning as early as 1974, organizations have been providing a variety of services to families of missing znd exploited children. Created prior to the over\u00ad whelming nationwide attention to the issue of missing children with the passage of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984, these organizations were typically formed by people who were, in some way, personally involved with a missing child. The organizations were most often staffed by dedicated volunteers and operated on a very small budget, and their services were typi\u00ad cally limited to one \"type\" of case. Newspapers, tele\u00ad vision, and radio soon began carrying the news of missing children, and the general public took the is\u00ad sue to heart; many people responded by deciding to form new nonprofit organizations. Unfortunately, there was no one place to obtain comprehensive information about starting and oper\u00ad ating a nonprofit agency to serve missing and ex\u00ad ploited children and their families. Many of the new organizations were formed without regard to the needs of their own communities or states; as a result, some opened and closed in short order. Some oper\u00ad ated for a short time but were unable to continue because they lacked the backing of a solid Board of Directors, or they missed fundamental steps in the development of their service or fund-raising plan. The purpose of the Nonprofit Service Provider's Hand:-ook is to aid concerned citizens in forming and operating an effective agency to serve missing and exploited children and their families. It is a collabo\u00ad ration of more than a dozen experts in the United States in the provision of services. Although our ser\u00ad vices and some of our basic philosophies may differ, we share a common mission: to help find missing children and to help keep children safe. Those of you who have decided to form an or\u00ad ganization have accepted a large responsibility. As the founder, you must take the proper steps to ensure that your organization is the best that it can be. Even more, you must work to guarantee that \"your\" or\u00ad ganization can function just as well without you! The collaborators of this book encourage you to learn from our mistakes . . . we hope you will find this information a worthy template for the work you have ahead. As founder of Services for the Missing, Inc., an agency providing services since 1984, I appreciate this opportunity to welcome you to the field. There is a new spirit of cooperation in this cause we hold dear, and I look forward to working with you as you develop the services that arise from our common mission. Nikolette Thoman Gibbsboro, New Jersey March 1990 vii 1. The Non profit Service Provider Nikolette Thoman Services for the Missing, Inc. A Working Definition A nonprofit service provider (NSP) is best defined as any nonprofit organization that provides a necessary service to missing or exploited children or on behalf of the families of missing or exploited children, in\u00ad cluding those agencies that provide education pro\u00ad grams to help prevent abduction and sexual exploi\u00ad tation of children. First Steps The Board of Directors Any organization that forms to provide a human service needs to establish a working Board of Directors. The number of people on a Board may be determined by state law on non\u00ad profit incorporation, so be sure to check your own state statutes. A Board of Directors no smaller than five and no larger than twelve usually works best. The Board of Directors will select and hire a director or executive director for the NSP. Together, the Board and the director will be responsible for developing policies, bylaws, and budgets for the NSP and raising the funds needed to continue providing services. The director of the NSP will determine the specifics of the programs provided and will supervise the day-to-day activities of the organization. The Board of Directors must be made up of peo\u00ad ple who are dedicated not only to the issue of missing and exploited children, but also to the development and continued operation of the NSP. They should have some business background and be able to com\u00ad mit sufficient hours per month to work on NSP tasks. It is a good idea to have parents of missing or ex\u00ad ploited children (or parents in general) on the Board if possible; they have valid ideas to impart, and they help keep other Board members focused OIl the or\u00ad ganization's mission. The Vision Statement After deciding on a name and, if desired, a logo, the first task of the Board of Directors should be to write down a clear and concise statement of the organization's mission. Often called a vision statement, this philosophy will be used in all the NSP's publicity, grant writing, fund raising and, most important, in developing the agency's services. Obviously, a vision statement should be agreed upon by the director and the Board and should be devel\u00ad oped as a group exercise. What works best for most organizations is to hold a meeting during which the Board members \"brainstorm,\" and the suggestions of all members are written down. From that long list, the group works together to develop their unique vi\u00ad sion statement. For example, following is the vision statement from Services for the Missing, Inc.: \"Services for the Missing ... Uniting the Divided Family. Services for the Missing, Inc., was established in 1984 to act as a linkage between families of the missing and existing systems, in a cooperative effort to reunite the missing and their families. In addition, the agency is dedi\u00ad cated to the provision of valid information regarding missing adults, parental abductions, stranger abduc\u00ad tions, and runaway youth.\" Bylaws Corporations function by bylaws as pro\u00ad vided in state law. After determining the NSP's mis\u00ad sion or vision statement, the Board of Directors and the director should work together to develop bylaws for the organization. Bylaws accomplish the follow\u00ad ing: 1) govern the organization's Board of Directors; 2) state the mission of the organization; 3) set out the composition of the Board; 4) determine the election cycle of the Board; 5) specify the responsibilities and job descriptions of the members; 6) determine how often the Board will meet (a minimum may be set by individual state statutes); and 7) contain a provision for dissolution of the organization. This provision is 1 ---------- ---- ----~---~--required b~ the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to gam federal tax exemption. After the bylaws are completed, the Board should proceed with the incorporation of the NSP and with application to the IRS for federal tax exemption. You may want to get a lawyer to donate services to help you incorporate, draft the bylaws, and make the initial filing. Background Research The Board and the director should work simultaneously on several other tasks. Each of the following must be determined: 1. What is the geographic area to be served by the NSP? Will the organization serve the local com\u00ad munity, a portion of a state, the whole of astate or the nation as a whole? ' 2. What are the service needs of the people in that area? This is best accomplished by researching back Issues of newspapers and speaking to other agencies and police departments. Are there more parental abductions than non-family ab\u00ad ~uctions in that area? Is there a need for preven\u00ad tion programs? The information gathered in this research will determine the service plan. 3. What are the media contacts in that area? The media will be invaluable to the NSP, both in its formation and in its continued success. It is im\u00ad portant to make a list of the names and addresses of th~ .key media contacts for newspapers, local teleVISion, and radio. As the research is com\u00ad pleted, an effort should be made to meet some of t~ese people personally. Ask what they look for m a good story. Further, ask them if they will cover the official opening of the new NSP. 4. How will the organization raise funds to continue its operation? One of the harsh realities of pro\u00ad viding services is the constant need for funds. There may be salaries and employer taxes to pay' there wi.ll ~e phone bills, equipment needs, pos~ tage, pnntmg, and travel costs. How will the or\u00ad ganization raise the money? Will there be a fee for services? Are projected expenses low enough to count on the contributions of local commu\u00ad nity fund raisers? Does the Board hav~ access to a grant writer or someone who has experience in large fund-raising efforts? In any case, be sure to :~eck indiv~dual state statutes. Many munici\u00ad pahtJes, c.ountJes, andlor states require a state or local ordmance to solicit or raise more than a specified amount of funds in a year. A~ter thes~ tasks are completed, the NSP is ready to.begl~ planmng for actual provision of services. At this. pomt, the Board should also be busy ordering statIOnery and obtaining the equipment necessary to op~~ate the organization. Fund raising and grant wntmg should already be underway and should be 2 recognized as an ongoing part of the Board's work. Setting Up the Nonprofit Service Provider Service Plan Typically, the executive director drafts a plan for. services and seeks the approval of the ~oa~d of ?~r~ctors. The first step in planning serVIces ~s an mitIaI evaluation. Keep in mind that the serVICes of the organization will continue to change according to the demand for services. To de\u00ad velop an initial service plan, start with an evaluation of the research that was undertaken as part of the Board's first steps. Does the research indicate that there are more parental abductions than non-family abductions in the geographic area targeted for services? If so, the NSP s~o?ld focus on meeting the needs of the parents and victIms of parental abduction. Are there fewer abductions but more runaways reported? If so, then the needs of these families and youths should be the focus of ~ervices. The group of people the NSP fo\u00ad cuses on IS called the target population. After determining the exact service area and the targ~t popu~ation, the service plan should detail the speCIfic serVICes that will be provided. Currently, case an? other. service~ offered by missing and exploited chIld se.rvlce prOVIders across the country include 1) prev~ntIOn and education; 2) identification; 3) family legislative advo\u00ad cacy; 6) poster/picture dissemination; 7) assistance in sexual abuse and exploitation cases; 8) support gro~ps; 9) emergency funds; and 10) active casework. ActIve casework may be provided for one or all of the following: non-family abductions, family abductions, and runaways. Active casework services may include search an? location guidance, recovery assistance, system gUldance, case publicity, aid in enforcement of court orders, counseling, and referrals. ~he service plan should state each specific service and ll1clude a full explanation of what that service will provide. If search and recovery assistance are part of the NSP's services, the service plan for case\u00ad work may be a part of the training manual for staff. !n any cas~, a comprehensive service plan is essential m developll1g the NSP's training manual. ~ase Management Plan will be provid\u00ad ll1g a.ctual c~se services-i. e., providing search and locatIOn aSSIstance to parents of missing children\u00ad then a case management plan must also be devel\u00ad oped: A. c.ase managem~nt plan specifically states the way ll1dlVldual cases wlll be handled. It is useful to co~pare .the handling of sensitive missing or ex\u00ad plOIted chtld cases to the handling of emergency room cases at the hospital. The prioritization of cases, a process called triage in the hospital, may be neces\u00ad ~ary. In other words, in some cases, you may simply Intake a case over the phone. In more serious emergencies, you may have to visit the family imme\u00ad diately. Cases at one NSP are governed by the following plan: 1. lntaking a case. Request for aid is made by victim parent or other person. Request is fully detailed on an agency contact sheet. Questionnaire and additional information are sent to caller. When questionnaire is returned, an active case is opened. If questionnaire is not returned within four weeks, make two attempts to contact the caller. If the questionnaire is not returned within an additional two weeks, file the contact sheet as a \"service request.\" 2. Establishing a case. When questionnaire is re\u00ad turned, a caseworker ~s assigned. The case is en\u00ad tered in the agency casebook or other case rec\u00ad ord and assigned a case number, and then the caseworker evaluates the questionnaire. After the evaluation is reviewed by the supervisor, the case i~ \"worked\" according to the service plan. 3. Working a case. The case is actively worked on according to the service plan, at least biweekly: and more often as information is received. ~lients are c?ntacted at least monthly to check ~n and to ask If they have received any additional Information. If the client is emotionally dis\u00ad traught, calls or letters should go out ,more fre\u00ad quently. 4. Closing a case. After the missing child is located and recovered, or the case has been otherwise resolved, the case is closed. The case is marked as closed in the casebook, and the file is marked and filed. An~ original photographs or other per\u00ad sonal effects In the file are returned to the client. A final documentation of services provided is sent to the client as well. 5. Aftercare. Callbacks or follow-up letters should be made at the end of the following periods: 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Should re\u00ad abduction occur, the case will be reopened and s~ ma~ked. If the need for counseling arises, the chent IS referred to a counseling agency or the United Way in the area. The Vanished Children's Alliance created a handbook in 1988 called Missing Child Case Protocol w~ich provides a s.uggested procedure for missing children cas~s and Includes the forms reproduced in the AppendiX. (For a copy of the entire Missing Child Case Protocol, write the Vanished Children's Alli\u00ad ance at 1407 Parkmoor Avenue, Suite 200 San Jose California 95126.) \" Fees Whether or not the NSP decides to charge a fee for service.s, a fee structure should be developed. Very often, chents can afford to pay for services and are willing to do so. One NSP requests a $50 donation at the inception of a case (the request is included in the initial mailing). The donation is not mandatory, a.nd the work o~ a case is not affected by the dona\u00ad tIon. At the closmg of each case, or intermittently for long-t~rm c~ses, Services for the Missing, Inc., sends a detaIle? 1.ISt ?f casew?rk services, making it clear that the hstIng IS not a bill for services. The fee struc\u00ad ture often results in donations from clients who can afford them. The fee structure is also essential for document\u00ad !ng serv~ce costs to potential funding sources and for Illustratmg costs of services in fund-raising drives. Doc~mentation. Documentation is an important step m any service organization. The statistics that are. develop.ed by. evaluating the services provided in a given penod Will be used by the NSP for a variety of purp?ses, among them 1) ongoing evaluation of the service needs of the target population; 2) reports to the IRS and other authorities; 3) reports to funding sources; and 4) as a basis for publicity campaigns. Both for documentation and for ongoing service prov!sion, it ~il1 be necessary to develop or otherwise obtam a vanety of forms for use in the NSP's work. Comprehensive forms are given in the Appendix. If the NSP chooses not to use these forms, which were developed by the Vanished Children's Alliance, it is recommended that forms from another agency be used as examples. Each call that comes into the NSP should be re\u00ad corded on an intake sheet or contact sheet. This sheet should indicate the date of the call; the caseworker's name or initials; the name, address, and telephone number of the caller; and a detailed description of the caller's request. The steps outlined in the case management plan should be followed for each call received. On a quarterly basis, these contact sheets should be ev~luate.d .. A log book .should be kept with col\u00ad umns Identlfymg each service provided by the orga\u00ad nization. This log book is used to count the requests for each type of service. These quarterly totals are added at the end of the fiscal year and become the basis for the organization's annual report. Staffing and Training Whether .the work of the NSP is done by volunteers or by paid employees, the executive director must view the workers as \"staff.\" Staff must be recruited interviewed, reviewed, retained and sometimes ter~ minated. The executive director is typically re;pon- 3 sible for handling and supervising ail staff-related matters. The first step in staffing an NSP is to develop staff materials. What will eil.ch member of the staff do? What is the line of responsibility? The director and the Board, or a committee of the Board, should de\u00ad velop a personnel manual, which states that the or\u00ad ganization is an affirmative action employer, outlines the job descriptions of each staff member, and in\u00ad cludes the staff chart. The personnel manual should also contain the or\u00ad ganization's code of ethics. While there is currently no code of ethics that is uniformly adopted by NSPs, individual organizations should establish their own code. It is necessary to state the position of the NSP in many areas, such as referrals to private investiga\u00ad tors and attorneys, the confidentiality policy that gov\u00ad erns case publicity and the discussion of cases by staff, and the use of materials from other organiza\u00ad tions. After the staff materials are completed, the NSP must recruit workers. Good methods for recruiting staff members for an NSP are through the media and other organizations. If the media reseprch was suc\u00ad cessfully accomplished, local newspapers and radio stations will most likely publicize the NSP's search for workers. Send announcements to the local Chamber of Commerce, senior citizens' clubs, and all local li\u00ad braries. The services of an organization will largely de\u00ad termine the kinds of skills that are required of the staff. An application for employment should be de\u00ad veloped that includes space for all current information as well as a list of addresses for the last five years. The application must also include a background re\u00ad view form and a statement that the applicant gives permission to the NSP to conduct a background re\u00ad view to ensure that the applicant has never been con\u00ad victed of a child-related crime. The form should be mailed to the police department in each city that the applicant resided. After staff members are retained, it is necessary that they be trained. This training should be as fo\u00ad cused and detailed as possible, especially in the area of active casework. It is imperative that a training manual be developed that a staff person can turn to at any time. The training manual should be tailored to the positions that the staff members fill and should include examples and explanations of forms used in the work, any referral lists they may require, copies of pertinent resources and legislation, and an expla\u00ad nation of the v2rious services or organizations they will encounter in doing their work. An outline of the contents of the training packet for Services for the Missing, Inc., follows. 4 Sample Training Packet for Casework Staff Description of NSP and dedication Step-by-step parental abduction casework training sheet Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980* Missing Children Act of 1982* Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984 Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)* Form for court filing for temporary custody Form for public notice of hearing (alternative method of service) Example of request/explanation to advocate ac\u00ad tivity Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) letter of explanation * (Each state has a Parent Lo\u00ad cator Service (PLS) that enforces support pay\u00ad ments and helps search for abductors.)

Using the vision statement as a base, the director should de\u00ad velop a fact sheet or other type of handout to describe the organization, its services, and its needs. Infor\u00ad mation should always include the organization's name, address, and telephone number and a state\u00ad ment that the NSP is a nonprofit, tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization (assuming the Board has com\u00ad pleted these steps). These handouts will serve as the NSP's first introduction to the public. * Available in Parental Kidnapping, published by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (see **). *. Available by writing the National Center for Missing and Ex\u00ad ploited Children, Publications Department, 2101 Wilson Bou\u00ad levard, Suite 550, Arlington, VA 22201. Publicity Now it is time to write a press release to publicize the opening of the HSP. The press release should be typed double-spaced on letter-size stationery bearing the organization;s name, address, and telephone number. In the left margin should be the date of release and the contact person's name and telephone number. Centered on the page should appear the headline, followed by the \"who, what, where, when, and why\" of the press release. The first relea~e ~f the ~SP should announce its opening and descnbe Its serVIces. If you have invited notable guests to an open house or plan to have a ceremony for the parents of missing or exploited children in the area, make that the focus of the press release. Send the release to local televi\u00ad sion and radio stations and newspapers at least four\u00ad teen days'before the event. A few days after mailing, make a follow-up phone call and ask if they wilt carry a story about the event. . At the opening, be sure to take black-and-whIte pictures and mail them to local newspapers. Inclu~e captions and releases from anyone who appears m the photo. After the initial coverage, the NSP will begin to receive requests for services, and the w?rk begin~ in earnest. Publicity, however, should remam an ongomg activity. Whenever something noteworthy happens i.n the organization, the media should be contac~ed. ThIS could include such milestones as the locatIOn of a child, the first one hundred people served, funding received, volunteers needed, or the release of new statistics. To announce fund raisers or to reach out for vol\u00ad unteers, it is necessary to develop what is called .a public service announcement, or PSA. The PSA IS short, and should be no longer than sixty seconds in length, or less than two paragraph~,. double-~paced. These should be directed to televIsIon, radIo, and newspapers. The date of release should be stated, as well as the date the publicity for the announcement should cease. The contact name and phone number should be a part of the announcement, which should be brief and factual. The director should develop a publicity plan, which should include regularly scheduled volunteer drives and updates to local media friends. 5 --------------------------------- 2. Needs of Missing Children and Their Families June Bucy National Network of Runaway and Youth Services Having the bonds of a family broken by a child's disappearance is an emotional experience for both the child and the other family members. If foul play is suspected, or if the child is young, the parents' emo\u00ad tions can be overwhelming and may almost immobi\u00ad lize them as they go about finding their child. Parents will also very lik\\~ly be amazed at the response, or lack of response, by law-enforcement authorities to their problem. They will soon realize that they need assistance in taking the most effective steps toward recovery of their child. If the missing child is an adolescent and the par\u00ad ents do not know whether the child has left voluntar\u00ad ily, has had an accident, or is an abduction victim, parents may feel similar emotions. They may find \"the system\" even less responsive. Police often assume that an adolescent has run away, that he will return on his own within a few hours, and that any listing of the child as a missing person will complicate their records because parents often forget to call back and report to the police when a runaway does return. At these moments of confusion and uncertainty, the nonprofit organization (NPO) or community\u00ad based organization (CBO) may be of most assistance to parents. For parents to effectively use their ser\u00ad vices, the nonprofit service provider should maintain a public relations effort within the community so that the public, and particularly the professionals, can make appropriate referrals. Chapter 4 discusses the services an agency may wish to provide to assist in the recovery of children or in the prevention of miss\u00ad ing children. This chapter deals with the personal needs of the children and their families. Because the family dynamics are very different depending upon whether a child has been abducted or an adolescent has decided to run away, this chapter will discuss the needs of these groups separately. Missing Children A child will most likely be reported missing by a parent or other relative. The parents will be anxious, not only about the safety of their child but about their responsibility for the child's disappearance. A skilled person must get the information from the parent and begin to deal with the emotions of the parent as well as with the requirements of recovery. Psychological Issues People communicate on at least two levels, both of which are important. First is the content of the communication, the actual words and meanings that constitute the subject matter being communicated; second is the affective level, the com\u00ad munication of feelings. If the speaker does not sense that his feelings are being understood and accepted, he may-consciously or unconsciously-express the feelings more strongly. If the feeling is anxiety or fear, as it may well be when a child is missing, the parents must feel that the listener fully appreciates their anx\u00ad iety and fear. It is not necessary for the listener to share the feeling; in fact, it helps for the listener to stay calm while he assures the parent that he under\u00ad stands the parents' complex mixture of fear, anxiety, and perhaps remorse. The skill demanded of the helper in these situa\u00ad tions is called \"active listening.\" It involves providing reflective feedback to the speaker to let him know his feelings have been understood and are aceepted. Ac\u00ad tive listening avoids admonishing, moralizing, criticiz\u00ad ing, or even sympathizing with or praising the speaker while the story is being told. It involves acknowledg\u00ad ing the other person's emotions and thoughts and reflecting to him what you understand them to be. In active listening, the listener summarizes in his own words the content and feeling of the speaker in order to be sure that he understands and that the speaker is confident that he is being understood correctly. 7 For example, i~ the parent says, \"I will never forgive myself for letting Bobby out of my sight,\" the active listener may reflect back, \"I know you are feel\u00ad ing that you could have prevented what has happened to Bobby, and that you very much wish you had acted differently.\" Having been heard through his anxiety, the parent will be more free to deal with reality. Active listening is a skill that can be acquired. It may require practice, and all training programs for staff or volunteers who work with parents in missing children's agencies will need to learn and practice the skill until it becomes a natural response. Another emotion that a parent may be feeling is that of blame toward someone he holds accountable for the missing child. In cases of noncustodial paren\u00ad tal abductions, the parent whose child is missing has probably run the gamut of emotions in their relation\u00ad ship with the other parent. At one time there were love and trust and shared joy in the child; later, anger and distrust and perhaps even hate characterized the relationship. These strong feelings do not make it easy to think rationally, to assess options, or to accept and respond appropriately to undesirable situations, such as legal barriers that may impede recovery of the child. . Denial is an emotion that serves to block a feeling that is considered more dangerous and difficult. Den\u00ad ial is a coping mechanism. It may be an indication that a parent is denying his anxiety or anger and may alert the listener to the greater level of stress that is being masked. The parent may have very little af\u00ad fect-that is, show almost no emotion at all-or may be busy thinking up easy solutions to the dilemma or diverting attention away from the child's disappear\u00ad ance to some less threatening event or issue. Unless this diversion is extreme, a good listener can bring the parent back to reality by tuning into the denial and slowly bringing the parent into more active par\u00ad ticipation in reality. If the denial verges on hysteria, great care must be taken to see that the parent is able to vent the emotion and is not left alone to \"come down\" into depression. In summary, the nonprofit service provider needs to be aware of the possible psychological states of a distraught parent, to let the parent know that his feelings are being acknowledged, and to assist in the amelioration of the destructive or distracting effects of those feelings. It is easy for the anxious parent to displace these emotions qnd to feel that people are angry with him and are blaming him. This may deepen the sense of guilt and cause the parent to turn the rage inward. A child who has been taken somewhere against his will and away from his parents will experience psychological trauma. The level of trauma will be a function of the age of the child, the circumstances of 8 the abduction, the length of time the child is away, and the experiences he has during that time. If the child is away for a short period of time and is not physically injured or frightened, the trauma may not be great, and thY;; homecoming may be a joyful re\u00ad union. The child may have been gone long enough, however, to have come to terms in some way with a new life situation and new relationships-including, perhaps, false information that the custodial parent no longer wants him or is unable to care for him. For this child the return \"home\" is likely to be an ambi\u00ad valent situation. Parents should be prepared for this and should expect to require professional help to get their family dynamics in balance again. Many chil\u00ad dren have nightmares, periods of depression, recur\u00ad ring fears, and other emotions that they must learn to handle or diffuse. If enough time has passed so that an abducted \"child\" returns as an adolescent, then the developmental process may have been marred or proceeded unevenly. At the very least, time will cause the young person to be different from the child the parents remember. Counseling The art of counseling is more than lis\u00ad tening, assessing a problem, and giving advice, al\u00ad though all these elements may be a part of counseling. Counseling, as used here, will be defined as the de\u00ad liberate and guided relationship of a well-trained per\u00ad son and a person seeking assistance. The client will be assisted in assessing his present situation and find\u00ad ing out what part he would like to change. He or she will then determine options, set goals, and plan action steps that will lead to the accomplishment of those goals. The nonprofit service provider will guide the process by careful listening, questioning, pointing out inconsistencies between a desired goal and present behavior, and providing support to the client as he or she changes some part of the thought or behavior pattern. The effective therapist empowers the client to make decisions and thus rarely sets the agenda or gives advice. The process requires skill on the part of the therapist and work and courage on the part of the client. When a client is distraught, it may be difficult for him or her to enter a counseling relationship. A non\u00ad profit service provider's role may be to gather infor\u00ad mation and begin the process of looking for a child or carry out whatever function needs to be done. A disruption in the family, however, brings to the sur\u00ad face memories of experiences from the past and ques\u00ad tions about relationships, expectations, and respon\u00ad sibilities. It is the rare family that would not profit from therapeutic counseling assistance when a child is missing. The parent, or family, should set goals to be met by the counseling. The first goals should be clear and achievable. When they are attained, the relationship may end, or the family may want to work on new goals with the counselor. A first goal might be to carry out one's ordinary responsibilities while awaiting in\u00ad formation about a missing child. The counselor should be able to assist the parents in accepting that they have taken all the possible steps available to them in searching for their child and that they need to use their energies for other tasks. Fears may need to be explored, the steps already taken will need to be rehearsed, and careful planning must be done re\u00ad garding what activities can normalize the situation so that the parents can meet their vocational or familial responsibilities. When these goals have been achieved, the parents may feel they need no further counseling help, or they may wish to set other goals, such as working on some part of their marital rela\u00ad tionship to eliminate arguments or mistrust. The point is that counseling is a very special re\u00ad lationship. Talking over one's fears with a friend or getting advice from a neighbor who has had a similar experience will not provide the same results in changed attitudes or behavior that can be expected from professional counseling. An effective commu\u00ad nity nonprofit service provider should have profes\u00ad sional counseling available either through its own staff or by referral and will understand why clients need that kind of help. Good counseling is a time-saving and cost-effective way for people experiencing stress to relieve their anxiety and redirect their energies. Reunification When a child is returned to the fam\u00ad ily, the sudden joy may be almost as traumatic as the trepidation that accompanied the disappearance. The professionals assisting the family need to be sensitive to the feelings that reunification will bring to the sur\u00ad face. Not all these feelings will be positive ones, and even the positive ones may be so strong that the par\u00ad ents may have trouble knowing just what they are \"feeling.\" Relief may release anger. Joy in seeing the child may be marred by questions of why this hap\u00ad pened. The emotion of the situation may blind the parent to the need for certain actions, such as plan\u00ad ning how to deal with the legalities of the abduction or return of the child. A nonprofit service provider should be available to assist the parent and child in sorting out the emotions and taking the steps neces\u00ad sary to get family life on track again. This is another example of the unique intervention services that NPOs can provide, and NPOs should be prepared to do so. It is particularly important that law-enforce\u00ad ment personnel, the press, and others who have had a part in the recovery be given the appropriate infor\u00ad mation, acknowledgment, and appreciation. The NPO should also take special care to protect the pri\u00ad vacy of the family. I, Long-term Support and Aftercare Reunification is . not the last function that the nonprofit service pro- I i: r f L_~~ ___ .~ __ . vider will perform. Families enduring the trauma of a missing child will need support and comfort after the child has been returned. They may need counsel\u00ad ing and assistance in getting their lives back together. If they want to help other families, they will need training and monitoring. The returned child will also need to have access to someone outside the family who can assist with adjustment problems related to the abduction or provide help in returning to the nor\u00ad mal developmental process. Families should not feel that their case is closed and they have no access to the services of the nonprofit service provider once their immediate crisis is resolved. Families whose children are not recovered are in for long periods of incredible suffering, fear, uncer\u00ad tainty, and grief. The stress is never gone, and the pain remains acute. Marital relationships are strained, other children may not receive the parental nurturing they need, and one's job or other interest may be difficult to maintain. The ability to endure does increase, however, and the ability to move on begins to develop in healthy people who have the support of their mate and their family and friends. Again, the nonprofit service provider has a unique role to play with these families as they assist them in maintaining hope, taking the steps to find the child, and managing their lives under the most diffi\u00ad cult of burdens. Many NPOs were initiated by fami\u00ad lies in grief who wanted to reach out to others. The special compassion involved in this peer-group rela\u00ad tionship is of profound help to parents encountering the trauma offorced separation from their child. Peo\u00ad ple do, however, need to be aware that circumstances differ and solutions are not the same for all problems. If an NPO is to be of service to a variety of families and community agencies, great care needs to be given to strive for an appropriate level of objectivity, profes\u00ad sionalism, community networking, and good manage\u00ad ment of resources. Runaway Children The original Runaway and Homeless Youth Act de\u00ad fined a runaway as a child under the age of 18 who has left home for a period of 24 hours without the permission of the parent or guardian. While that def\u00ad inition may seem clear, it presents some difficulties. First, in many states a young person does not need to be 18 in order to leave home without the permis\u00ad sion of the parent. Parents in those states will find that authorities will be very reluctant to assist them in searching for their teenagers. In other states, run\u00ad ning away is not a crime for any child, and the parents or police cannot take such children into custody. They can, however, report runaway children to the Missing Persons File of the National Crime Information Cen- 9 ter (NCIC) of the FBI and can assist parents in locat\u00ad ing them in order to provide protection to the child. When police are not willing to help in this way, non\u00ad profit service providers need to work with the police department policy makers in order to negotiate some sensible solution to the dilemma. Many communities have solved this problem; it is not an unsurmountable obstacle, and there is no federal law or policy that mandates such neglect of a child's safety. (The Juve\u00ad nile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act offers fi\u00ad nancial incentives to states that do not lock children in jails with adults or lock up children for the act of running away. This is a far different mandate than relieving the justice system of all responsibility for the safety of young people!) When an adolescent is unexpectedly missing, it is difficult to know whether there has been foul play or whether the child chose to leave. Parents often find that law-enforcement officers assume that the child has run away and will soon return. Some police de\u00ad partments do not take information relative to a miss\u00ad ing adolescent for 24 or 48 hours. This is a matter of department policy, which can be changed. Commu\u00ad nity agencies working with tact, wisdom, and persist\u00ad ence can assist parents in their relationships with the police to enable them to get their child's missing sta\u00ad tus registered with the relevant law-enforcement agencies. Judging from the research and experience of professionals, it is clear that runaways are not running TO anything. They are running FROM situations with which they cannot cope. In order to prevent future runaway situations, it is important to under\u00ad stand the act of running from the adolescent's per\u00ad spective as well as from the parents' point of view. Runaway Centers There are runaway centers in al\u00ad most all the major cities and many of the smaller communities of the nation. They are designed to as\u00ad sist in the reunification of the child with the family\u00ad unless that is an impossible or unsafe option. Most often young people come to them voluntarily or are referred to them by community agencies. Sometimes parents refer their own children to a runaway center for prevention services or for a cooling-off period. The centers can usually assist parents in reporting missing children to the authorities and in negotiating relationships and requests with the police. Centers are usually crowded and often have a waiting list of children needing crisis shelter. They have to observe licensing regulations about the use of their staff in caring for the young people under their supervision. For these reasons, runaway center staff seldom have much time to assist in the recovery of a missing child. They may seem to a distraught parent to have little interest in assisting them in the recovery of their run- 10 away. This is regrettable and is quite likely a misun\u00ad derstanding. A few nonprofit organizations and other service agencies have successfully combined services for fam\u00ad ilies with missing children and services for young run\u00ad aways and their families. That combination seems sensible, particularly for smaller communities. Runaway centers were designed with the needs of the young people foremost. They were begun in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many young people had left their homes, congregating on the Bos\u00ad ton Commons, in Haight Ashbury, the French Quarter, or Times Square. Concerned citizens of these communities saw that these young people needed help, and they began to find ways to provide food, shelter, and crisis intervention. The people working in these new programs soon learned what all other runaway programs have learned since-most young people do not run far from home. On the first or second run, they rarely go more than a few blocks or miles from home; even frequent runners often remain in their home com\u00ad munities. Careful research has revealed that 85 per\u00ad cent of the young people coming to runaway centers in New York City are native to New York City. This trend is even more pronounced in smaller communi\u00ad ties. Psychological Issues Our society has made adoles\u00ad cence a time of significant emotional, social, and be\u00ad havioral change. The physical development of an ad\u00ad olescent adds its own changes as cognitive power becomes greater and the body attains sexual maturity. Family roles change to accommodate the emerging abilities of the adolescent and the new challenges and opportunities available to parents whose children no longer need constant supervision. Most parents have learned to expect turmoil where there are adoles\u00ad cents. Often the expectation of this turmoil and change blinds parents to the mental health problems of their children. Teenagers are allowed to be \"crazy\" with\u00ad out receiving much attention for unusual behavior. It is difficult and expensive to get mental health care for teenagers, and professionals are often as reluctant as parents to recognize signs of depression, substance abuse, a:1d atypical behavior. Many teenagers, there\u00ad fore, have un met psychological needs. The maturational task of a teenager is to develop a self-identity and self-concept that eventually enable him or her to assume control of life and become a productive adult capable of sustaining relationships and responsibilities. This is not a smooth or unevent\u00ad ful process! Normal behavior of a teenager can in\u00ad volve mood swings, experimentation with drugs and sex, and even risk taking that exceeds the expecta- -------------------I I. I l tions of parents and breaks the family rules. If the parents themselves are encountering difficulties or changes in their own lives-in marriage, job, or health, for instance-coping with a teenager can be beyond their emotional capacity at times. Parents may become too permissive or too authoritarian or may lash out in anger and frustration. This anger can be directed to the teenager, who may be told, \"Get out of my life. I never want to see you again.\" Chil\u00ad dren who leave home under such circumstances are sometimes referred to as \"thrownaways.\" If the child is a runaway, he or she may contact a runaway hotline or service agency. These agencies have become adept at interviewing adolescents and their parents and sorting through the facts and per\u00ad ceptions that have led to the runaway incident. Run\u00ad ning away is a serious step, and it is rare that a young person takes this step without what seems to him or her a very good reason. It is important to determine what that reason may be because if the situation is not addressed, the adolescent will likely run away again. The data from runaway centers tell us that many of the young people are fleeing from situations that they regard as abusive or that require coping skills they do not possess. In the large majority of cases, the runaway episode has its roots in the dynamics of the family, not in the undisciplined behavior or pa\u00ad thology of the young person. Often, children sense stresses in the family that they do not understand. The family may be in some crisis, such as an impend\u00ad ing divorce or financial loss. The adolescent may feel excluded and may run away in hope of reuniting the family around concern about him or her, or in hope of calling attention to his or her need for inclusion. Many young runaways have been victimized phys\u00ad ically and have turned that violence in on themselves, believing they deserve the abuse. If there has been sexual molestation, the young person may be partic\u00ad ularly reluctant to reveal the \"family secret,\" or may have been punished-or at least not believed-by other adults. A sensitive intake process may put these children enough at ease to reveal what is happening. It may take several interviews for the information to be revealed. For all these reasons, the runaway center is likely to want to interview the adolescent privately and may suggest that the parent not take the child home im\u00ad mediately when he or she is found. Counseling The goal in counseling for runaways and their families is to build on the strengths of the family and assist all family members in adjusting their relationships so that the needs of each person are met and the family can function harmoniously. Many times, parents want the counselor to \"fix\" their child-to make him behave as he did when he was younger or as the parents believe he should. If there is a family \"secret,\" such as sexual molestation, the family often does not want that revealed. Even the young victim may strive to keep the secret, feeling that his safety or well-being is dependent on secrecy. Victims of any sustained abuse or violence tend to internalize this in the form of low self-esteem. They feel they somehow deserve the violence, especially if inflicted by a parent. This prevents them from fully participating in family therapy designed to meet' everyone's needs. Many young people run away from home after they have confided in a parent that they suspect they are homosexual. Parents are usually shocked by this information and may initially reject the child. Sadly, suicide becomes an attractive option for such young people. Running away is another way they may cope with the rejection. On the streets, they may have exploitative experiences that make them feel even more unworthy of their parents. They may also en\u00ad counter other young people on the streets who have had similar rejection from their parents and who find acceptance and caring from each other. Having felt that sense of belonging, young people may be reluc\u00ad tant to return home to parents who want them to be something they feel they cannot be. Rejection by parents because of homosexuality is a difficult issue for all concerned, but it simply must be recognized as a major factor in a large percentage of runaway episodes. Nonprofit service providers and community agencies must have the expertise or the referral sources to work with such families. All staff and volunteers should have training designed to ena\u00ad ble them to be comfortable with young people strug\u00ad gling with their sexual identities and with families who have to make some accommodation. Counseling can also be directed toward assisting families to change rules to allow young people op\u00ad portunities to become more responsible and to exer\u00ad cise that responsibility in ways that are not destruc\u00ad tive to their health or welfare. Active listening skills help parents become more effective disciplinarians and set appropriate limits on their children's behav\u00ad ior. Parenting skills can be developed in parenting groups as well as in counseling sessions. In cases in which a family member has been a perpetrator of violence and has left the family, a coun\u00ad selor can assist the family in reuniting. This is diffi\u00ad cult, and goals should be set for small incremental steps. If violence has taken place in the family, how\u00ad ever, counseling and healing must take place there, too. Reunification Staff and volunteers at crisis inter\u00ad vention services for young people may hear the young 11 runner's story before they meet the parents. They will have understood the child's feelings of rejection, even though that pain may be masked by bravado or de\u00ad nial. They may have had to wait until the young peo\u00ad ple could build enough trust to tell them the real reason why they could no longer live in their own homes. They may have worked with families willing to blame their children for family disruption that seemed more the fault of the adult. Nevertheless, workers in runaway centers really believe that most families can change, that most young people want to go home and can if everyone is willing to work for the changes, and that their agency can be a part of the solution to the fami.!y difficulty. The goal of all good runaway services is family reunification when\u00ad ever it is possible and safe for the young person. Many runaway centers can work with the family after the crisis is resolved and the family is reunited. Others can make good community referrals for ad\u00ad ditional counseling or support services such as drug abuse prevention or parenting training. Adolescents are old enough to reason and learn. They can play valuable roles in families that are striving for an equi\u00ad librium. The nonprofit service provider should strive to empower the young people as part of a healthy family. Running is often a cry for help. It may also be a sign of strength and of wanting life to be productive. Each case is different, and each family deserves the greatest attention and care. Long-term Support and Aftercare Families of ad\u00ad olescent runaways may need more services than are available-or more than they wish to use-immedi\u00ad ately after a child has returned to the home. Research indicates that running away tends to be a family trait-the way that family deals with problems. Often the child who runs is copying a parent who ran away as a child or who has deserted the family. Other par\u00ad ents use \"running\" as a coping mechanism when they turn aside from problems and are not available to the family. Siblings from families where an older child 12 has run may also run away, usually at a younger age than the original runner. Families who use \"flight or fight\" to deal with problems need long-term support to assist them. The community center should have some mechanisms for keeping in touch with them and assuring them that they can return for services whenever they have the need. The community center that had the first expe\u00ad rience with the family may be most successful in maintaining a bond, as it was the agency that met the family needs in the crisis. This bond should always be acknowledged and respected, but continuing services from that agency may not be wise or feasible. It is impossible as well as unwise for any agency to try to meet all the needs of a client. A renewed contact, an updating of relationships, and a decision about the next agency to provide services will make the referral more likely to be useful to the client. If the runaway episode was a result of substance abuse by either a parent or the young person, after\u00ad care work will be needed in that area. If abuse was severe enough that either the perpetrator or the young victim is removed from the home, aftercare is recommended for both the youth and the family. The needs of children and their families are the focus of nonprofit service providers. Whenever there is a conflict between the best interest of the child and law-enforcement, for example, the NPO should keep its values clear and provide care and nurturance for the child and family. Planning and training in an agency should reinforce these values, and no funds should be accepted that violate it. The worlc of an NPO is emotionally draining and difficult, but the knowledge that families and children are being assisted in a time of great need is satisfying. The psychological needs of the staff and volunteers need to be met, and burnout should be avoided, moreover. No agency should ever neglect the celebra\u00ad tion of their work and their goals, and careful atten\u00ad tion should be paid to nurturing positive ideals. 3. Needs of Exploited Children and Their Families Lucy Berliner, M.S. W. Sexual Assault Center Harborview Medical Center Psychological Needs Sexual abuse and exploitation have been shown to have a serious negative impact on children. Only re\u00ad cently has this fact become widely known. Histori\u00ad cally, sexual abuse was thought to be rare because children often did not report and, when they did, they were frequently not believed. It is now established that between a fourth and a third of girls and about one in six boys will be molested or raped by age eighteen. The social climate has changed dramatically so that children are exposed to prevention education, parents talk to their children about the possibility of abuse, and professionals consider sexual abuse as an explanation for behavioral or emotional problems. When children do tell, it is likely that someone will believe them and take action. Effects of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation In the past, there was a belief that except in the most severe or violent cases, there was little harm caused by abuse experiences. Many thought that parental or societal reactions were the source of psychological distress and that children would forget about the ex\u00ad periences if they were handled by downplaying the seriousness and quickly moving on. Our current un\u00ad derstanding of the nature of abuse and what has been learned from adult survivors suggests that these ex\u00ad periences are rarely forgotten and that the effects can be very long term. Clinical experience and research has shown that child victims suffer from a broad range of emotional and behavioral problems following abuse. They may be afraid and anxious, have feelings of guilt, shame, and anger, or engage in inappropriate sexual behav\u00ad ior. These reactions may extend to difficulties in school, with peers, and in the family. Parents and siblings also have psychological distress when they learn that a child in the family has been sexually assaulted. The most serious negative impacts of abuse are not seen in young children, however. Problems like substance abuse, depression, thoughts of suicide, running away, self-destructive behavior, and mental health disorders usually do not appear until adoles\u00ad cence or adulthood. Clinical populations of adoles\u00ad cents reveal high rates of prior victimization. Pro\u00ad grams for runaways, youth involved in prostitution, alcohol and drug abuse, teenage parenthood, and sexual offenders find that substantially more than half the teenage clients were sexually abused. Similarly, inpatient and outpatient psychiatric clinics for adoles\u00ad cents have discovered that a significant fraction of teenagers who are suicidal, self-mutilate, or have eat\u00ad ing disorders have a victimization history. Sexual abuse in childhood has been found to be a major risk factor for mental health disorders and interpersonal problems in adults. Studies show that sexual abuse in childhood significantly increases the risk of receiving a psychiatric diagnosis. Abuse survivors are more likely to remain single or get divorced or be battered in an adult relationship. Although most adult surviv\u00ad ors do not exhibit such severe dysfunction, they do experience increased psychological distress and un\u00ad happiness related to the abuse. They are more likely to be depressed, anxious, and have sexual difficulties. We do not know exactly why children may appear relatively unharmed yet at risk for future conse\u00ad quences. This \"sleeper\" effect may be the result of the way children cope with abuse experiences. The cues that trigger the memory of the assault usually cause anxiety. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is man\u00ad ifested as intrusive thoughts, nightmares, hypervigil\u00ad ance, exaggerated startle response, loss of concentra\u00ad tion, and fears. Children may try to handle the 13 ----------------------------------anxiety by avoidance. Pushing the thoughts away, avoiding people or situations, a numbing of emotional responsiveness and, in certain cases, dissociation and even amnesia may help reduce the anxiety associated with remembering what happened. Children may also explain the abuse to them\u00ad selves in ways which are unhealthy. In attempting to understand why they were assaulted, they may blame themselves or minimize the intentionality of the of\u00ad fender's behavior. In some cases, offenders create or reinforce these beliefs by telling the victims that they are to blame or will be responsible for the conse\u00ad quences of telling. Child victims may think that their behavior or failing to say no or to tell makes them at least partially responsible. Sometimes these beliefs are adaptive responses to avoid facing the disturbing reality that someone they knew, trusted, or depended on took advantage of and exploited them without re\u00ad gard for their wishes or the impact. Children who learn to cope with abuse by avoid\u00ad ing the memories and altering the meaning of the experience may appear to have adjusted or have got\u00ad ten over the abuse. In fact, the experience may simply remain sealed off and intact and emerge at later de\u00ad velopmental junctures. These kinds of coping strate\u00ad gies may divert psychological resources from normal developmental tasks or may be maladaptive when ap\u00ad plied to other life situations. In severe cases, chil\u00ad dren's personalities are formed around unhealthy ad\u00ad aptations to abuse, which become a central part of the way they operate in the world. In this case, there may be low self-esteem, a mistrust of others, and a sense of helplessness in the world. This can lead to the more serious problems later on. Research has found that some aspects of the assault experience are associated with more severe impact. Abuse that is violent, involves penetration, is committed by a closer offender, and goes on longer causes greater harm. The most important factor is the family environment. Victims who have a supportive relationship with a non-offending parent and a sibling and who receive support following disclosure are less harmed. Chil\u00ad dren whose families are dysfunctional are more af\u00ad fected. The Nonprofit Service Provider's Role The impli\u00ad cations from our understanding of abuse suggest that it is important for the nonprofit service provider to help families assist their children as well as help pro\u00ad vide the victims with therapy. Children need to be helped to remember and talk about their experiences in a supportive environment. Over time this will lessen the emotional impact of the memories so that children will not expend resources trying to avoid recalling what happened. They can be taught effec\u00ad tive strategies for handling anxiety, such as relaxa\u00ad tion, cognitive restructuring, and increasing the 14 safety of their situation. Sometimes this means chil\u00ad dren will be more distressed initially. Parents can learn to recognize this as a necessary phase of suc\u00ad cessful emotional processing of the abuse experience and provide the needed support. Families must participate in helping children un\u00ad derstand that the assault is not their fault and that any behavior of theirs was a function of being tricked or the limitations of their developmental stage. Even well-meaning parents may communicate blame or dis\u00ad appointment by challenging the victims for not tell\u00ad ing. Therapists and parents may contribute to an in\u00ad accurate understanding of the offender's behavior by calling the offender sick or by implying that alcohol\u00ad ism, psychological problems, or childhood experi\u00ad ences caused sexual offending. This may make chil\u00ad dren feel unable to express anger or compelled to feel sorry for offenders. It is particularly difficult when the offender is a family member or a respected member of the community. The evidence shows that sexual offending is in\u00ad variably planned, calculated behavior. Sexual devi\u00ad ance may take years to develop and to be expressed in victimization of children. Offenders typically target children for victimization and groom them to accept increasingly inappropriate and sexualized contact as well as persuade them not to tell. Sexual offending is almost never an impulsive act. The circumstances or the offender's justifications, however, may make it seem as though something other than the offender's decision to offend explains the victimization. Some children develop sexual problems where they behave in sexualized ways, initiate sexual activity with other children or, in extreme cases, become sex\u00ad ually aggressive. The abuse experience can serve as a model of appropriate sexual behavior or may stim\u00ad ulate premature sexual interest or arousal. Young children are most likely to exhibit such problems and require enhanced supervision as well as therapeutic intervention to teach alternative ways of expressing feelings and meeting needs. Older children may en\u00ad gage in premature sexual relationships. This kind of behavior in children may make them more vulnerable to revictimization by serving as a disinhibitor to pre\u00ad disposed adults or offenders. It may also lead to os\u00ad tracization by others or may be a precursor to ado\u00ad lescent offending behavior. Teenagers who are raped or sexually exploited frequently come from a background of abuse and neglect. The incidence of date rape among teenagers is extremely high. Drinking or going somewhere with a casual acyuaintance has been implicated in a sig\u00ad nificant proportion of adolescent rape situations. Many teens may consider coercive sex acceptable be\u00ad havior. Studies have shown that teenagers of both sexes believe that it is all right for a boy to force sex l l , on a girl if he has spent money on her or she has led him on. Early sexual victimization experiences may set the stage for repeated victimization. In some cases, the teenager does not recognize the exploitive nature of the relationship. Older boys or young men may appeal to the girl's vanity or need to be accepted, and they may easily take advantage. An extreme ex\u00ad ample occurs in juvenile prostitution in which the youth does not see herself or himself as a victim at all. Most of these children were abused prior to in\u00ad volvement in the lifestyle. These young people are often very resistant to treatment and end up in serious conflict with parents, other adults, or the authorities. Child Sex Rings and Daycare Abnse When chil\u00ad dren are victimized in a group situation, there are complicating factors. Daycare abuse and sex rings ap\u00ad pear to have additional dynamics. In daycare situa\u00ad tions, more than one offender may be involved as well as multiple victims. Since the children are very young, it is often difficult to ascertain exactly what happened. Some of these cases involve ritualistic or sadistic ele\u00ad ments which may make children's stories seem un\u00ad believable or extreme. These cases are often high profile and create volatile community reactions. Careful coordination and separation of investigative and therapeutic interventions are especially war\u00ad ranted to insure successful case outcome and mini\u00ad mize unnecessary trauma for the children and fami .. lies. (For more information on daycare abuse, see Just in Case ... You Are Considering Daycare, published by the National Center.) In sex ring cases, the complication may revolve around children's apparent cooperation with ongoing exploitation. Offenders often use victims to engage other victims. Children may have received monetary or other gifts as a part of gaining compliance and maintaining secrecy. Pornography is frequently used to entice children or may be an element of the crim\u00ad inal activity. Parents and investigators are more prone to blame children in such situations, thereby adding to the victim's burden. Young adolescent boys are particularly likely victim targets who may subse\u00ad quently experience extreme gUilt or shame. (See also Child Sex Rings, published by the National Center.) Alleged Abuse in Custody Disputes Another type of case posing significant complications is that in which abuse is alleged in the context of separated parents. Although there appears to be an increase in such reports, the widespread public impression that there is a flood of cases, most of which are un\u00ad founded, is inaccurate. A national survey of family courts found that sexual abuse accusations comprise only a small percentage of all disputed custody cases. When such a concern is raised, however, professional responses are often colored by the assumption that these reports should be viewed with skepticism. The difficulty in sorting out the truth arises from the fact that most of the children are very young and may not be able to provide a coherent or credible history. In addition, the animosity between the parents may ov\u00ad ershadow the child's Issues. Unlike most other cases of suspected sexual abuse, child protection cannot be accomplished with\u00ad out making a determination of guilt. Parents who are suspected are usually seeking access to the children. To interrupt parent-child relationships when there has been no abuse would be harmful, as would exposing children to untreated and denying offenders. In many instances, it is impossible to arrive at a definitive con\u00ad clusion. Unfortunately, one result may mean that judges permit or order contact. Parents who believe their children have been abused and feel that the legal system has not provided protection may choose to flee with the children rather than obey a court order. While it may be understandable, this choice places children in a situation where there are also negative consequences. They must conceal their identity, lose friends and relatives, and maintain a secretive and unstable lifestyle. Careful and thorough assessment by experienced professionals is the best method of avoiding parental abduction. As soon as suspicion or concern is raised, cases should be referred to experts in custody evalu\u00ad ations who are knowledgeable about abuse. When the evaluation is conducted by professionals who are highly regarded, the necessity for repeat assessments is reduced and the likelihood of favorable resolution enhanced. This is a highly specialized area of clinical practice, and such assessments should not be at\u00ad tempted by inexperienced or nonspecialist evaluators. Interviewing Many children do not spontaneously report their abuse experiences. About a third of the time the story is elicited through questioning by parents or con\u00ad cerned adults. Research shows that in mental health settings, specific questioning about possible abuse ex\u00ad periences dramatically increases the likelihood that clients will report abuse experiences. The chances that certain clinical populations of children and ado\u00ad lescents will have been abused are so great that rou\u00ad tine screening is indicated. A large proportion of chil\u00ad dren who run away are suicidal, self-mutilating, have eating disorders or substance abuse problems, or have been sexually assaulted. They cannot be helped un\u00ad less the abuse is uncovered. Interviewing children about abuse has been the subject of great controversy. There is concern that improper interviewing approaches may influence chil\u00ad dren who have not been abused to say they have been abused. Leading and suggestive questioning or rein- 15 forcement for disclosing abuse have been implicated in false reports. The evidence shows that children as young as age 5 or 6 are able to accurately report events and are almost as resistant as adults to sug\u00ad gestive questioning. Very young children, however, because of their limited cognitive and language de\u00ad velopment and their reliance on adults, may be more susceptible to giving unreliable responses. In order to avoid jeopardizing the acceptance of children's reports of abuse, it is important to insure that properly trained professionals, referred by the nonprofit service provider, conduct interviews. It is usually not necessary for professionals or parents to elicit the complete history of events prior to making a report to the authorities. Child protection profes\u00ad sionals and law-enforcement investigators are trained in the proper methods for investigative interviews. The role of professionals and parents is not to gather evidence for legal systems. The primary objective is to provide a supportive environment and assist the children and their families in resolution of the psy\u00ad chological trauma. Sometimes professionals are asked to render an opinion about abuse or assault based on professional assessment. Although usually not admissible in court, these opinions may carry weight in determinations to go forward with legal interventions. It is important that the involved professional have the training and experience to conduct a thorough and knowledge\u00ad based assessment. A poor interview or inadequately supported opinion can become the focus of legal at\u00ad tack. This can result in the child victim not receiving protection or in justice not being carried out. Good supervision, consultation, and documentation are es\u00ad sential ingredients of a competent evaluation process. Counseling Effective counseling for child victims and their fami\u00ad lies has several important components. When abuse is first discovered, the children and families are in a state of crisis. The children are worried about the reactions of others and what will happen. This may cause them to suppress the distress associated with the victimization and focus on familial and system responses. Parents are usually shocked, upset, and angry. Although the negative feelings may not be di\u00ad rected at the children, children may feel responsible for causing the parents' discomfort. Crisis interven~ tion cannot resolve the emotional consequences of the abuse, but it is very helpful in stabilizing families following disclosure. In addition to personal reactions to learning about or reporting the victimization, parents and chil\u00ad dren frequently have concerns and questions about legal and social service systems. As part of the initial 16 response, counselors and nonprofit service providers can provide accurate information about what to 'ex\u00ad pect. This requires specific knowledge about the practices and procedures in the particular commu\u00ad nity. Families have many misconceptions and fears about the criminal\u00b7 justice system. A major issue is whether children will be required to testify. Since most cases will not result in an actual trial, this worry can often be allayed or at least deferred until it is established whether it will be necessary. Far more common will be delays in the process which will frus\u00ad trate and anger the families. Experienced counselors or advocates can help by explaining the steps in crim\u00ad inal prosecution and offering a supportive outlet for these feelings. Advocacy during the process can be provided by counselors or by system advocates. This may inciude coordinating and consulting with legal personnel, keeping families apprised of events, or accompanying them to interviews. Counselors and NPOs can also help children and families prepare for involvement by education and by teaching anxiety management strat\u00ad egies. There are books and videotapes available as aids for the therapists. If there is a conviction, victim and family input into sentencing can ?Jford a thera\u00ad peutic opportunity. Children and families can be helped to write letters to the judge or to attend sent\u00ad encing. A final way in which counselors can help is to insure that families apply for victims compensation or that restitution is ordered to cover the costs of counseling. Therapy Therapy for the victimization experience usually takes much longer to accomplish. Children are often initially resistant to talking about what hap\u00ad pened and may require many sessions to achieve a level of comfort with counselors and with the material before progress is made. Talking, drawing, playing, reenacting, and writing are all methods of assisting children in approaching the anxiety-producing mem\u00ad ories. They can also learn to recognize the triggers for the memories, develop and practice anxiety man\u00ad agement strategies, and express the related feelings. Individual or group therapy appears to be the best modality for victimization therapy. Helping children understand why they were ex\u00ad ploited is often the most difficult aspect of interven\u00ad tion. Therapists have learned that simply telling chil\u00ad dren that it was not their fault is usually not effective in getting children to internalize the belief. It is im\u00ad portant to explore carefully and sensitively the basis for the children's beliefs to identify the source of the misattribution. Specifically, clarifying inaccurate be\u00ad liefs and providing meaningful explanations is neces\u00ad sary. This includes helping children understand the process of victimization as well as why sex offenders commit offenses. It is especially important to uncover -------------~ --------- --- - -------~~------------- ----any fears about the consequences of telling-conse\u00ad quences that may have been threatened by offenders. Threats to return and get the victim or claims of magical powers of the offender are particularly dis\u00ad turbing. Additionally, children may believe that oth\u00ad ers knew about their victimization and did nothing to protect them. Often this results in anger toward par\u00ad ents, even when they were unaware. For example, children may think that parents knowingly left them in a dangerous daycare center. Since children may have expressed reluctance to go, parental failure to discover the reason can be interpreted as deliberate indifference. In such a case, explanation from the parents about their ignorance and apology for not understanding is helpful in restoring the parents to a supportive role. Even when children have resolved the specific symptoms and attained an adequate understanding of the experience, there are additional tasks of therapy. Prevention education should be incorporated into therapy because abused children are at risk for re\u00ad victimization. Instilling accurate and healthy atti\u00ad tudes about sexuality may reduce the likelihood of sexual problems in the future. Building a large sup\u00ad port system of peers and adults, especially consisting of people who know about the abuse, may prevent stigmatization and social isolation. This gives the child a basis for resuming normal developmental tasks and placing the abuse in perspective. Teenage victims are often the most difficult to treat. In many cases, it is because of maladjustment that the abuse becomes known. The children or their families may not recognize the connection to past abuse, and the focus is simply on ameliorating the problem behavior. A method of engaging the adoles\u00ad cents in therapy is to help them understand how their problems may be related to abuse. The problem be\u00ad havior can be reinterpreted as a coping strategy which is maladaptive but serves an important function. For example, substance abuse may be a form of avoiding or forgetting painful memories. The consequences of this coping response may be harmful, however. Teen\u00ad agers may be assisted in confronting and overcoming the aversive aspects of their memories and learning healthier ways of handling internal distress. Parental involvement in their children's therapy is almost always a necessary component. They need to learn how to assist their children in recovery. Ed\u00ad ucation about the nature and impact of abuse is one component. A more difficult aspect is teaching par\u00ad ents to be available to the children. Many parents find it painful to know exactly what happened and inad\u00ad vertently communicate that they cannot handle hear\u00ad ing about it from the children. Therapists can facili\u00ad tate the process by encouraging and assisting children in describing their experiences to the parents. This can be done through joint sessions, sharing artwork and writings, or videotaping or observing interviews. In addition, the reasons why the children did not feel able to immediately report abuse to parents must be explored. Parents may learn that they missed cues from the child, were too busy or preoccupied to no\u00ad tice, or in some way conveyed to their children that they were not receptive or could not handle the re\u00ad port. In some cases, significant disturbance in the parent-child relationship or in family functioning has created a distance which inhibited the children. Fo\u00ad cused family therapy may be required to address these problems. Parents' responses may be highly influenced by factors other than their relationship with their chil\u00ad dren which may require separate interventions with them. An unresolved victimization experience may be evoked by their children's assault. They may be unable to tolerate hearing what happened or project their own feelings on the children. When the offender is known, it frequently produces intense ambivalence or guilt. This may be communicated to the victims as disbelief, disappointment, or lack of support. Provid\u00ad ing direct assistance to parents is indicated to enhance their capacity to be available to their children. This may mean individual counseling sessions, a parents' group, or referral to other services. An often neglected component of tberapy for vic\u00ad timization is inclusion of siblings. Research has shown that a supportive relationship with a sibling is asso\u00ad ciated with reduced impact on victims. Other chil\u00ad dren in the family may be aware of the victimization or be unidentified victims. Disclosure of abuse may precipitate disruption in the family which affects sib\u00ad lings and, in turn, may be negatively directed at vic\u00ad tims. Siblings should be told in general terms about the vil:timization, informed about legal interventions, and offered the opportunity for individual or joint sessions. When all members of the victim's family share a common understanding of what happened, an environment is created that will enhance recovery. Some cases of sexual assault may be resolved with very limited and brief counseling. Most cases, however, are best served by a fairly extended inter\u00ad vention which lasts on average six to nine months. In more serious cases, it may take much longer. Much of the focus is on establishing an accurate and satis\u00ad factory understanding of victimization that is inter\u00ad nalized by all family members. The purpose is to avoici the development of maladaptive coping and dis\u00ad tor(ced beliefs about sexuality, self, and relationships with others. The goal is to place the victimization in perspective as a bad but specific experience which need not have permanent negative effects. Long.term Support and Mtercare It may not be possible to address completely all the important is- 17 sues for child victims shortly after the assault. Some concerns may simply not be developmentally relevant and will not emerge until a later point. For example, establishing positive healthy sexual relationships is not salient for young children. At adolescence, vic\u00ad tims may become anxious and confused about their own feelings. A \"dental\" model of intervention has been suggested whereby checkups occur at certain points to determine whether the victim is experienc\u00ad ing abuse-related reactions. Parents may decide to take the children for periodic assessments to provide an age-appropriate opportunity to reexamine thoughts and feelings. Certainly if children develop problems and are taken for counseling, therapists ought to be apprised of the prior victimization and consider any possible relationship to current function\u00ad ing. At the least, parents should not assume that chil\u00ad dren have forgotten about what happened. By asking children directly how they are feeling or whether they have been thinking about the assault, they create an envhonment which is conducive to children seeking assistance. Sexual assault and exploitation are not the only traum<!tic events which may influence children's growth and development, and it appears that most 18 victims do not develop severe disturbances as adults. Excessive focus on the abuse may communicate an expectation of negative outcome. The most danger\u00ad ous is to convey that the children are likely to become offenders. While an increased risk exists, parental or community attitudes might be incorporated by the children and serve to actually promote such a result. Few adults have a completely trouble-free childhood, and difficult experiences-when handled properly\u00ad can be a basis for the development of effective coping strategies, the capacity to survive aversive experi\u00ad ences, and finally to emerge stronger and more resilient. Therapists and advocates can have a major influ\u00ad ence on how children and families cope with abusive experiences. Sexual assault continues to be a problem which is surrounded by denial, misconceptions, and fears. Knowledgeable intervenors are necessary to provide families with a framework for understanding and responding. As the social climate changes, we can look forward to a time when children will recog\u00ad nize abusive and exploitive behavior, will report it immediately, and will receive a supportive response. Counseling will always be important, but the job of helping the children recover will be easier. ----- ----~ --~~-4. Providing Services Georgia K. Hilgeman, M.A. Vanished Children's Alliance Service providers playa crucial role in assisting the families and the children affected by the missing ehil\u00ad dren experience. l() fulfill their role, it is imperative that service providers develop a good understanding of the missing and exploited children's issue. how the \"system\" works. and how to run a nonprofit organi\u00ad zation (NPO). This chapter is meant as a guide. Each NPO will assist families in its own unique way. See the Appen\u00ad dix for sample copies of all the forms referred to in Chapter 4. Inta~e/Registration Process The initial contact with the searching parent. whether by phone or in person, is called the intake process. At this point. designated and trained staff should ask the searching parent or guardian certain key ques\u00ad tions, using an intake form. The intake process is designed to obtain preliminary information. to pro\u00ad vide some immediate technical assistance and, if ap\u00ad propriate, to begin the registration process. At no time during the intake process should the NPO search for the reported missing child, since the client's legal status or relationship to the reported missing child is unknown. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children suggests that parents make a report to the National Center's hotline: 1-800-843-5678. The Na\u00ad tional Center can help provide media attention and photo distribution on the child and will work with state clearinghouses, other NPOs, and law-enforce\u00ad ment. Many existing NPOs and the National Center have a protocol for opening or registering cases. Cer\u00ad tain criteria must be met before the organization will involve itself with the distribution of missing children photographs, posters, or searches. Some basic re-quirements might indude verifying that 1) a police report was filed ami law-enforcement has entered the missing child into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer; 2) the registering parent in parental abduction cases is the custodial parent; 3) the organization's registration forms and releases have been completed. dated, and signed hy each reg\u00ad istrant; and 4) photographs of the missing child are provided. Since the person's legal status or relationship to the reported missing child is unknown, caution must be exercised regarding what information is given dur\u00ad ing this intake stage. Technical Assistance Technical assistance occurs at all stages of involve\u00ad ment with searching families. This assistance may oc\u00ad cur at the intake or registration stage (the missing stage), at the location and recovery stage, or at the post-recovery stage. The families' needs will vary de\u00ad pending on the stage and case particulars. Give basic advice at this stage, since the legiti\u00ad macy of the case is as yet undetermined. Parents should in all instances be encouraged to file police reports and to keep a case log of all events, all people contacted, and their instructions, including dates and times. If the client is the custodial parent, it is appro\u00ad priate for him or her to request entry into the NCIC computer. Recommend that parents complete the NPO's registration process, and explain what services the NPO will provide. At this point, give the parents information regarding their legal rights so that they know what to expect from law-enforcement. Since most technical assistants in NPOs are not attorneys, make sure that your NPO is not attempting to prac\u00ad tice law without a license. Instead, the NPO might give examples of how other victim parents were able 19 to achieve certain forms of help in the state from which they are seeking help. No names of other cases should be disclosed when giving examples. Once the parent completes the registration and release forms, the NPO must go through its protocol checklist. If the protocol is not met, the parents should be notified immediately of the additional in\u00ad formation needed. If the ca'ie can be opened, again the parent should be immediately informed. When the case is opened, more technical assistance can be given the parent, since at this stage the legitimacy of the case has been verified. Posters can be developed, and the parent can be directed on how to assist in their distribution. Discussions with the parent and law-enforcement about possible warrants for known abductors and search methods might be advisable. Additional assistance may include dealing with the media, protecting the parent from callers soliciting funds, and referral to other agencies. Working with Law-Enforcement Law-enforcement is one of the most important agen\u00ad cies in the missing child case. It is. imperative that a positive working relationship is established between the missing children NPO and law-enforcement agency. If possible, NPOs should take time to visit police agencies in the surrounding area. NPO leaders can introduce themselves and their agency to officers handling missing juveniles. Keep the visit short, and leave information on the NPO with the officers. Com\u00ad municate your wish to work with law-enforcement and to be recommended to searching families. Em\u00ad phasize that all cases coming into the NPO in the officer's jurisdiction will be verified with the agency and, if new information is received or obtained on these cases, it will be immediately turned over to the police. Since many NPOs work on cases nationally, it is impossible to interact with each law-enforcement agency around the country. As a case approaches the registration process, you should make contact with the originating law-enforcement agency. Offer the NPO's assistance in the case and, as a follow-up, mail the officer an information packet on the NPO. If the NPO receives a lead or sighting on a miss\u00ad ing child, the officer handling the investigation should be notified at once. It is not the role of the nonprofit service provider to investigate leads but, rather, to provide the investigative agencies with the informa\u00ad tion and encourage them to follow up. NPOs should not involve themselves with surveillances or ruses. Such activities could prove detrimental, unprofes\u00ad sional and, in some instances, illegal. The NPO is a liaison between the searching parent and law-enforce\u00ad ment and is there to supplement the work of law\u00ad enforcement, not to replace it. 20 Photo Dissemination Photo dissemination is an effective technique used to locate missing children. It is the most widely recog\u00ad nized locate tool and, most important, requires the public's involvement. We depend upon businesses and the media to display photographs and descriptive data on missing children. The public is often involved in the distribution and mailing of missing children posters. And, the leads that pour in as a result of photo dissemination are most often from the general public. It is extremely important that NPOs develop a policy on photo distribution. It is commendable that so many people and businesses are helpful and wish to circulate information on missing children. Most of these trUlj care about the children, and it can be beneficial to their businesses to show a sense of com\u00ad munity participation. It is important, however, to es\u00ad tablish the legitimacy of the business. This can be done by requesting copies of previous publications or videos, checking with the Better Business Bureau, and checking references. All photo requests from the NPOs should be made by the businesses in writing. Some visual or written products might have a philo\u00ad sophical difference with the goals of the NPO. For example, an NPO might not wish for missing chil\u00ad dren's photographs and the agency name to appear in a publication dealing with child exploitation topics or other controversial issues. Inclusion of missing children photographs in the \"wrong\" publication could affect the credibility of the NPO. The criteria for those distributing posters need not be as stringent, but some information on these individuals should be obtained. NPOs might request that such individuals complete a volunteer application or sign a log with the person's name, address, and telephone number. The nonprofit service provider should check the person's ID. Sometimes people that are involved in the abduction of children or have some association with the abductors may want to know what progress is being made on the case. Therefore, whenever possible, the NPO should obtain some basic details about who wants to help and why. Location Assistance There are many ways to assist in the location of miss\u00ad ing children. Each NPO will define location assis\u00ad tance in its own way. First and foremost, the location and recovery of every missing child usually requires the interaction and cooperation of more than one agency or individual. Thus, it is most difficult to credit only one source. From the beginning of a case until its conclusion, a great deal of information and action by many agencies and individuals has taken place. To attribute one piece of information or action as solely responsible for the location of a child is incorrect. Equally incorrect is to discard any infor\u00ad mation or action as of little or no value if even in a small way it assisted parents in their search. The NPO's role in location assistance usually falls into the categories described below. Providing Emotional Support Providing emotional support to parents should not be underestimated. After all, no one involved in the search loves the missing child as much as the family. Therefore, one of the responsibilities of the NPO is to help keep the family going. If the family falls apart, who then will provide the impetus to keep the search alive? Technical Information NPOs must provide search\u00ad ing families with information about their legal rights; what they can expect from law-enforcement; what they can do; and how they can obtain information about other people or agencies that can help. Usually, the more help and knowledge that parents have, the greater the likelihood of child recovery. Search Assistance This may mean physically being out in the field looking for the missing child or work\u00ad ing out of the office coordinating searches and inves\u00ad tigations. Of course, all on-the-scene search activity must be cleared with the appropriate law-enforce\u00ad ment agencies. Search assistance may include distrib\u00ad uting photographs or posters of the missing child. It might include looking for patterns in the abductor's (and accomplices') lifestyles or pursuing these indi\u00ad viduals' \"paper trails.\" Such searches prove to be the most effective in missing children cases. A lead to the abductor is often a lead to the child. Taking telephone sightings or leads regarding the missing child's where\u00ad abouts is another critical tool. Working with Law-Enforcement It is important to keep the originating law-enforcement agency in\u00ad formed on the progress of the case. The NPO should turn over all leads or sighting information to law\u00ad enforcement agencies immediately. No determination of the invalidity of any sighting or lead should be made by the NPO. In some instances, NPOs may need to encourage the law-enforcement agencies ac\u00ad tually to investigate certain leads or sightings: Law\u00ad enforcement personnel are usually extremely busy (as are NPOs) in the missing and exploited children's field. Cooperation can reduce the workload for both; law-enforcement, if they are unaware of your NPO, might be suspicious of you or your group's motives. Do not be angry at this attitude; make sure that you turn the relationship into one of interaction and in\u00ad formation exchange. The officer who is initially most suspicious can become one of your best allies. The Child's Recovery Parents and families will have their own ideas on how their child will respond to them once reunited; it is important to prepare them for what the child's responses might actually be. Give them some pointers on what they might do to increase positive interaction between themselves and the child; this, in turn, will reduce the trauma expe\u00ad rienced by the child and parent. It is essential that parents know what documents to bring with them when traveling to recover their child. The regulations vary from jurisdiction to juris\u00ad diction. Some basic information might include three certified and exemplified copies of their custody or\u00ad ders (for parental abduction cases); the child's birth of the child; and information re\u00ad garding law-enforcement agencies, warrants, police reports, and NCIC entry. Parents need to know that in some instances before the child is released to their custody, they will be required to make court appear\u00ad ances. They may also need to retain an attorney li\u00ad censed to practice law in that state. The goal for all in the child location field is the recovery of each missing child no matter how large or small the role we play. Satisfaction is gained from realizing the important part each of us plays in reu\u00ad niting families and giving them the opportunity to become whole again. Follow-up Because case variables may change, a follow-up pro\u00ad cedure is essential to case management. Changing variables in the child's recovery may include the fact that a parent's custody order has expired or been modified; the searching parents have moved; a child has reached the age of majority; the law-enforcement investigation has ended; or new leads have been de\u00ad veloped. Such factors, if not determined in a timely manner, could affect the victims of the case, the cred\u00ad ibility of your organization, and the time invested in search activities. When a case meets the NPO's protocol and is opened, the searching family and law-enforcement are informed immediately. NPOs can use this oppor\u00ad tunity to request immediate notification of any changes in the case as well. Regular, ongoing contact with the registered case families is important. Let the families know what is being done on their case. From time to time, send them samples of publications in which their child's photograph appears. This increases their confidence that the organization is working on their case. Once information is obtained that a child has been recovered, this information should be verified with law-enforcement. In some instances, a parent might inform an NPO, but not law-enforcement, of the child's recovery. Information exchange saves everyone time and money. Another reason for veri\u00ad fying the recovery is to eliminate any ruse of a recov- 21 ery by others in order to stop the search activities. Recovery follow-ups should include the mailing of a missing child location-recovery form to the parents that requests more specific details on the child's re\u00ad covery, the current and past condition of the child, what other people or agencies were of assistance, and how the parent felt about the help received by the NPO. Follow-up includes not only obtaining current in\u00ad formation regarding the validity or the standing of the case but also includes immediate response to leads or sightings. Within the NPO, a \"checks and balances\" system must exist. Caseworkers who open or close cases, give technical assistance to searching families, and take leads or sightings should be supervised and monitored by more experienced and knowledgeable staff mem\u00ad bers. These supervisors should review the paperwork before a case is opened or closed and do random checks for accuracy of the information provided. Many NPOs intake case information that does not, for a variety of reasons, become a registered case. After an adequate waiting period, attempts should be made to update case status. Simply send a standard form letter to the person making the initial intake report, inquiring about the status of the case and offering assistance. Or, if for some reason parents do not meet the organization's protocol, send a form letter informing them of what specific information or documentation is required in order to open the case. While case follow-up does require time, the ben\u00ad efit to. missing children and their families is indeed well worth it. Working with the Legal System Important legal considerations are to make sure that 1) your organization is truly not-for-profit and that all reports and filings are completed in the allocated time; 2) all proper licenses are obtained in the city, county, or state(s); 3) all information given is correct and legal; 4) only verified legitimate cases of missing children are worked; 5) signed registration and re\u00ad lease forms are kept on file; 6) law or investigation is not practiced without the proper licenses; 7) all sight\u00ad ings or leads are immediately turned over to the ap\u00ad propriate law-enforcement agencies; 8) all other case information and records are confidential except under subpoena; 9) caution is taken regarding information given over the telephone; 10) you do not misrepresent yourself or your organization or use ruses; 11) appro\u00ad priate fund-raising policies and contracts are devel\u00ad oped and proper financial ethics and responsibilities are exercised; 12) adequate personnel policies and practices exist; and 13) all illegal acts are avoided. 22 ------------------------- Prosecutors NPOs will often work with prosecu\u00ad tors in missing children cases. The primary purpose of the prosecutor is to prosecute criminals and rep\u00ad resent the people of the state. Crime has historically been viewed as an offense against society rather than against an individual. The prosecutor is not the at\u00ad torney for the victim. This at times leaves the victim feeling that his or her needs are not being repre\u00ad sented. Therefore, the NPO plays a significant role of support to the victim during the prosecutorial stage. Prosecutors decide what, if-any, charges are filed; make recommendations to the judge regarding bail; participate in plea negotiations; and prosecute or re\u00ad solve the case. The prosecutor is usually an elected official and may be influenced by public opinion. A common approach for the NPO is to meet with the prosecutor and encourage an aggressive stance from his or her office regarding the prosecution of family and non-family abductions. In some states and jurisdictions, investigators from the prosecutor's office will actually be involved in the location of missing children. In parental ab\u00ad duction cases, the prosecutor can request assistance from the U.S. Attorney's office. If the case facts merit, the D .S. Attorney will issue an Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP) warrant for the ab\u00ad ducting parent. Such an agreement can only be reached if the prosecutor has issued a state felony warrant and agrees to extradite and prosecute the abductor after apprehension. If a UFAP warrant is issued, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will become involved in the missing child case in order to locate the absconding parent. NPOs should encourage victim parents to coop\u00ad erate with the prosecutor. Parents might be asked to assist in the investigation, help identify the abductor, and act as a witness at a hearing or trial. In turn, prosecutors should keep victims informed regarding case status-including notice of hearings, plea nego\u00ad tiations, verdicts, rights to have input into the pro\u00ad bation report and to make a victim impact statement, sentences imposed, paroles, and appeals. NPO representatives having particular knowl\u00ad edge of specific cases could be called as witnesses for the prosecution. Your files may be subpoenaed. It is therefore imperative that case files are complete, or\u00ad ganized, up to date, and easy to understand. Judge and Jury The role of the judge varies de\u00ad pending on the stage of the criminal proceeding. Roles include 1) conducting an initial evaluation of the evidence and deciding whether or not there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a criminal prose\u00ad cution; 2) when necessary, issuing bench warrants; 3) acting as arbiter of the law, deciding issues of law; and 4) imposing sentences on those convicted of crimes. Juries, consisting of selected people from the community, are empowered to be the \"trier of fact.\" In other words, the jury decides whether the evidence presented during the trial establishes guilt. Witnesses NPO representatives may be called as witnesses. If called, the following suggestions might prove helpful: 1) listen carefully to the questions; 2) think before answering; 3) give only the information requested; 4) avoid showing anger; 5) avoid glancing at the prosecutor; 6) dress appropriately for court; and 7) most important, tell the truth. A nonprofit service provider might be called to report specific facts about the case or might be called as an expert witness. Once someone has been quali\u00ad fied in court as an expert witness, future qualifying is relatively automatic. As an expert in the missing and exploited children's field, general questions con\u00ad cerning those issues will be addressed. Court Monitors Court monitors follow selected missing and exploited children cases through the criminal justice process to find the positive aspects or loopholes in the system. They make these findings known to their respective NPOs. The designated NPO representative can make the findings known to the public, keeping in mind at all times that the first priority is to protect each individual victimized child. The court monitor program can involve itself with advoc;acy for necessary policy change. The presence of court monitors has an effect on case adjudication and dispositions. Court monitors, usually volunteers from the com\u00ad munity, typically have the following responsibilities and qualifications: 1. An empathy for missing and exploited children 2. No criminal convictions in background 3. Average or above-average writing and commu\u00ad nication skills 4. A willingness to learn about the criminal justice system 5. Time and transportation to attend court on a regularly scheduled basis 6. Completion of the NPO's court monitoring train\u00ad ing program (usually a minimum of 15 hours) Individuals who are involved in the criminal jus\u00ad tice system, such as judges, prosecutors, and law\u00ad enforcement officials, should be invited to speak to people going through the court monitoring program so that trainees will develop an understanding of the criminal justice process and policies. Key represen\u00ad tatives from the criminal justice community need to learn that court monitors have legitimate goals. Train\u00ad ing will include guidelines on acceptable activities and courtroom decorum. Training should include guidelines on who within the NPO may talk to the press and what information can or cannot be disclosed. Court monitoring forms and protocols for form completion should be re\u00ad viewed. The most crucial part court monitors can play is to accompany the victim or victim's family to court. Because the courtroom appearance involves so many sensitive issues and emotions, proper training is im\u00ad perative. A trained and qualified court monitor can be an asset to specific victims and their cases as well as assist in creating necessary attitudinal and policy changes. Referral and Networking The missing and exploited children's issue is too vast a problem to work on in isolation. A nonprofit service provider's effectiveness is dependent upon the knowl\u00ad edge and ability to utilize all available resources, refer families to other appropriate agencies, and network with child-serving organizations within the commu\u00ad nity. Victimized families often need help on many dif\u00ad ferent levels, in the areas of emotional, technical, legal, and financial support. The most common re\u00ad ferrals given to families are to 1) law-enforcement agencies, 2) other missing children assistance pro\u00ad grams, 3) attorneys, 4) private investigators, 5) ther\u00ad apists, 6) social service agencies, 7) victim/witness and compensation programs, and 8) support groups. When making a referral to those who require fees, give families at least three referrals. Care should be taken that those on the NPO's referral list are known to have expertise and good ethics in their areas. If you know of other capable missing children nonprofit service providers, refer them. The more help families can get, the better. Bui~ding a Referral List If your NPO serves only local victims, then the referrals will only need to be local. If, on the other hand, services are provided to victims nationwide, a nationwide referral list will be necessary. A referral list consists of professionals who can provide various levels of service to missing children and their families. Developing standards for referral list inclusion is essential. Include the following: 1) national, state, and local public agencies; 2) other NPOs; 3) attorneys; 4) ther\u00ad apists; and 5) victim-witness programs. Make sure that the list contains the type of service or expertise provided; the organization's or professional's name, address, and phone number; geographic service area; languages spoken; and fee structure, if any. Referrals can be given without endorsing the credibility or quality of those sources. Victims need to be encour\u00ad aged to de. kie for themselves whether or not they wish to use those organizations or individuals. 23 Networking Networking is one of those buzz words that almost everyone uses. In the missing and ex\u00ad ploited child field, it is difficult, at times, to assess who is who, what are the different philosophies, and what is the competence level of various groups. With no commonly agreed upon standards, difficulties will continue to exist for some time. Simply, networking de\\ elops as people within organizations have oppor\u00ad tunities to get to know one another and understand the effectiveness of the services the organizations pro\u00ad vide. Networking is an ongoing process. Interaction between groups in the future will be based more on the competence level of the organizations and less on personalities of the leaders. Victim families truly need all the help they can get, and the goal of every NPO is to insure it is given. Networking includes some level of information exchange, whether it be major or minor. Networking can take place among the NPO and other NPOs, the state clearinghouses on missing persons, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, law-en\u00ad forcement agencies, other victim service providers, and many others. Monitoring and Improving Services NPOs are often so busy that one may ask why take precious time to review what already has been done. NPOs can hardly keep up with the present. Though this is an understandable position, the significance of organization self-examination cannot be stressed enough. Your organization's mission statement, approved 24 -- --~-~ -- ----~ by your Board of Directors, should be reviewed an\u00ad nually. Yearly goals and objectives can be extremely helpful in keeping organizations on track. Defining goals and listing measurable objectives for each goal can prevent personnel from spreading themselves too thin and confusing the NPO's public identity. Review\u00ad ing organizational activities will provide shortcuts and improve ways of doing things. Maintaining statistics on services provided and clients assisted will clarify additional staff needs and assist with budget plan\u00ad ning. When financial resources are needed, clarity and numbers of services provided in the past are es\u00ad sential for proposal requests and allocation of re\u00ad sources. Organizational self-assessment and planning in\u00ad cludes the input of the staff, people served, and the Board of Directors. A team approach offers the greatest likelihood for a successful and continuing NPO. NPOs should continue to grow and improve. No matter how effective the NPO, new ideas and activi\u00ad ties can substantially improve child location, reduce trauma, prevent the victimization of children, and alter public policy. It seems the tasks that can be undertaken are unending. Improved services involve doing a good job, knowing your limits, and letting those you service know what they can expect. The challenges that NPOs have ahead of them are indeed vast and will not be easy to overcome. NPOs will have to increase their level of profession\u00ad alism in order to survive long term, work coopera\u00ad tively with other reputable agencies, and stay focused on the most important part of their work: the protec\u00ad tion of the children. - ----------------------- 5. Prevention, Education, and Pu bl ic Awa reness Julia Caughey Cartwright National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Jean Rustemeyer Southern California Adam Walsh Child Resource Center Michelle P. Spring National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Prevention and Education Programs In choosing or developing a personal safety program for children, a number of factors need to be consid\u00ad ered. A successful program must have the flexibility to generalize to a variety of populations and yet also contain specific components for each group. Another important aspect to consider is the education of par\u00ad ents and school staff. The ideal prevention program includes instruc\u00ad tions for every child, parent, and professional in the school setting. We can teach children to be more aware of their surroundings and to develop assertive\u00ad ness skills, but we cannot make children fully respon\u00ad sible for their own safety. Thus, the adults in their lives also need to be educated in the areas of child abuse. An effective personal safety program will en\u00ad courage parent and teacher participation. A parent or staff workshop will include infor\u00ad mation in the following areas: 1. Definitions of child abuse (emphasis on sexual abuse and exploitation) 2. Statistics on child abuse (especially in the local area) 3. Myths about abuse 4. Characteristics of an abuser (with an explanation of pedophilia) 5. Indicators of abuse (physical, behavioral, and emotional) 6. Crisis intervention techniques 7. Prevention education 8. Overview of classroom programs 9. Community-based resources and programs Parent workshops should emphasize communi\u00ad cating basic safety skills which will enhance self-es\u00ad teem and help prevent abduction and abuse. Staff workshops should emphasize reporting laws and pro-cedures, identification, crisis intervention, dealing with parents, and referrals. Ideally, the parent and staff workshops are given prior to the children's work\u00ad shops. In the children's workshops, the goal is to en\u00ad hance self-esteem and reduce the vulnerability of children to abuse, exploitation, and abduction. Pro\u00ad grams designed to indude a high level of student par\u00ad ticipation, with age-appropriate materials and infor\u00ad mation, can accomplish this goal. A positive approach with reinforcement from well-informed, supportive adults will help children attain safety skills that are instinctive and habitual. The basic underlying components of children's programs include those described below. Positive Approach A positive approach builds self\u00ad esteem and self-confidence. The goal is to enhance children's self-concept so that they can learn to trust themselves and act assertively in potentially danger\u00ad ous situations. Safety Awareness The goal is to increase the child's level of awareness about situations and actions that may be dangerous. Teach the children basic safety procedures in a variety of areas of their lives-i. e. being home alone, talking to people they do not know well, accepting rides, making phone calls, and han\u00ad dling unwanted attention. Personal Safety The goal is to let the children know that their bodies belong to themselves. Teach the dif\u00ad ferences among good touches, bad touches, and con\u00ad fusing touches (and what to do about the bad and confusing touches). Assertion Skills The goal is to encourage children to follow safety rules comfortably. Give children per\u00ad mission to say NO to adults. Let them know they can be assertive to help keep themselves safe. Reporting Abuse The goal is to encourage children to say NO, get away, and tell someone they trust. 25 Teach children that they do not have to keep secrets about touching and that it is never the child's fault. Stress the importance of telling a trusted adult. Safety Strategies The goal is to enhance adoption of safety procedures by encouraging participation in the learning process. This includes open-ended ques\u00ad tions for discussion, role plays, and skits to allow children the opportunity to develop their own strat\u00ad egies for safety and practice the skills they have learned. Age-Appropriateness All information needs to be chosen carefully with the age of the children in mind. When developing materials, attention must be paid to the developmental issues and stages for each group. These components of a basic prevention program are guidelines. Much has been written about, and many programs have been developed for, the preven\u00ad tion of child abuse, exploitation, and abduction. Sur\u00ad vey and study as many programs as possible before choosing or developing one that will fit the needs of the children, presenters, and community in any given area. School Curricula The Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, Inc., and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Chil\u00ad dren cooperated in a three-year effort to research and develop a state-of-the-art personal safety curriculum for children. The end product is entitled KIDS AND COMPANY: Together for Safety and was produced with the support of the Digital Equipment Corpora\u00ad tion. KIDS AND COMPANY is a comprehensive per\u00ad sonal safety curriculum for grades K-6 which can be used in both school and community group settings. The program provides children with skills, informa\u00ad tion, self-confidence, and support that will enhance their self-esteem and help prevent abduction and abuse. Key highlights of the curriculum are its approach, style, instructional design, and components: 26 Presents information in a positive and construc\u00ad tive manner Helps children develop commonsense safety habits through role play and practice Emphasizes skills needed in personal safety sit\u00ad uations and avoids impractical and misleading rules about strangers Teaches children how to help each other and how to identify other helping people Promotes self-esteem as children's competence and confidence grow Invites parental involvement Its colorful and appealing art reinforces posi\u00ad tive messages Engaging activities include puzzles, songs, and games Introduces video-based role playing Definite scope and sequence of skills Easy-to-follow lesson plans Clear objectives Step-by-step instructions Attractive and easy-to-read layout and design Teacher's guide (K, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/6) Student activity sheets (K, 1,2, 3, 4) Videotape for role playing and discussion (K, 112, 3/4, 5/6) Parent kit, including introductory letter, parent guide, poster, and stickers Ancillaries, including materials for games and activities and visual aids Teacher training video KIDS AND COMPANY meets state criteria set by school adoption committees, boards of education, and state legislation. During the development of KIDS AND COM\u00ad PANY, the Southern California Adam Walsh Child Resource Center used the Safety Education Program (SEP) which evolved from the Orange County CAPP (Child Assault Prevention Program), educating the sector of that county. SEP provides services for the private agencies in Orange County, California. For further information about safety curricula and programs, please call the National Center. Publications Producing and disseminating publications can be one of your most effective means of outreach to the com\u00ad munity. Your publications can take the form of edu\u00ad cation and prevention guidelines for local schools and libraries; newsletters for parents, including such vital information as what steps to take if their child is miss\u00ad ing; brochures for law-enforcement outlining the ser\u00ad vices of your nonprofit organization and encouraging a network with the criminal justice system; a colorful printed sheet of safety rules for children; or a typeset version of testimony you wish to present to your state legislature. Publications Policy and Planning In addition to your statement of purpose or mission statement for your organization as a whole, you should prepare a short publications policy statement for all printed ma\u00ad terial disseminated to the public. Such a statement should include the following: Objectives of your publication program (long\u00ad term and short-term) Your intended audience Your desired image Topics of importance you intend to address Send your publications policy statement to your Board of Directors or Board of Trustees for review. When you have developed a publications policy for your entire program, write a brief descriptive plan for each individual publication. Such a description should include the following: Specific purpose of the publication Intended audience Format (brochure, book, leaflet) Length Possible authors Number of copies needed Finding an Author If you do not have the time or expertise to write the publication yourself, to whom do you turn? First, turn to the experts in your com\u00ad munity-in law-enforcement, social services, legal services, medicine, and so on. Do not leave too much to chance with your writers, however. Provide a de\u00ad tailed outline for them, and include length restric\u00ad tions, intended audience, reading level, and firm deadlines. Make sure that you have reviewers lined up to examine the material for form and content. Scheduling and Budgeting Once you have written a plan and found an author for your publication, de\u00ad velop a schedule to determine a timeline that extends from the initial assignment to the author to completed distribution to your audience. Depending on the length of your publication, this timeline could encom\u00ad pass anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Your schedule should look like the one on page 28. The budget on each individual publication can vary greatly, depending upon its length, format, paper stock, number of ink colors used, and number of copies printed. When you have determined these var\u00ad iables, compare prices of various typesetters and printers in your area. _ Of course, you may only need a typewriter, a writer, an editor, and a duplicating machine. Several ways to save money on your publication include the following: Type the manuscript by hand, but use typeset headlines or headings for a professional look. Hire an artist to design a logo or nameplate for your-organization. Use a desk-top publishing system. Obtain advertising from local businesses. The best way to save money and promote net\u00ad working and information exchange is to produce a publication in cooperation with another organiza\u00ad tion-whether it be a law-enforcement agency, an\u00ad other nonprofit service provider, community resource center, or local business. Writing the Publication While it is not the purpose of this section to teach exposition, following are a few tips on good writing that you may have forgotten since high school or college: 1. Before you begin writing, \"brainstorm\" and take notes on your ideas for the publication. This will develop into a working outline. 2. Write a complete formal outline of your publi\u00ad cation. 3. Write a first draft, without spending an inordi\u00ad nate amount of time finding the precise word and exact phrasing. 4. Several hours-or several days-later, reread and revise your first draft. You will find yourself rewriting sentences and paragraphs, adding ma\u00ad terial to improve the flow, adding transitions, omitting needless words, and rewriting to im\u00ad prove clarity. 5. Write the introduction. 6. \"Fine tune\" your publication-edit and proof\u00ad read. Now is the time to determine the precise wording and exact phrasing. 7. Choose an effective title. S. If you are using photographs, write the captions, keeping them strong and concise. Editing If you are simply editing your author's writ\u00ad ing, make sure that the text is structurally sound, flows well, is grammatically correct, and makes logi\u00ad cal sense. Make sure that the text conforms to your organization's style and usage. Design and Typesetting Once you have completed your manuscript and it has been approved by review\u00ad ers, it is time to prepare your manuscript for the typesetter (if you are using a typesetter). Follow these guidelines to prepare the manuscript for the typeset\u00ad ter: 1. For short publications, you need not submit the text on a computer disk. For longer publications, it is less expensive and more accurate to use a computer disk. Check with your typesetter to determine what software they can \"read.\" 2. Even if you submit a computer disk, enclose a copy of the manuscript. 3. Use 8% X 11\" paper, double-spaced. 4. Type the name of your publication on every page. 5. Distinguish between italic type and underlining. 6. Draw a circle around any directions that are not to be typeset. 7. \"Spec\" the type, which means that you will in\u00ad dicate on the manuscript 1) what typeface is used, 2) the type size, 3) the space between lines, and 4) the width of the line. If you are unfamiliar with typefaces and sizes, 27 L PUBLICATION SCHEDULE (Name of Publication) First draft Manuscript review and approval Editing and copyfitting Copy spec'ed and to typesetter Paste-ups (page proof) proofread Paste-ups to printer Bluelines approved Printing Distribution talk to a designer or typesetter to determine what kind of type is appropriate for your publication. You may want a different kind of type for your headings than the one used in the text. Standard typefaces include Times Roman and Century Schoolbook for text, and Helvetica (a sans serif typeface) for head\u00ad ings. A standard type size for text is 9 points on 10, or 9110, which means that the type size is 9 points and there is an extra point of space (called leading) be\u00ad tween the lines-giving you 10 points total. Photo captions are generally set in smaller (8 point) type in boldface (a darker version of the original type). The width of the line, or column width of the type, is generally measured in picas (approximately V6 of an inch). If you do not have a pica ruler, measure your column in inches, and consult with your typesetter. 28 Date Completed Note: If you want to know exactly how many lines your publication will run, you will need to ask your typesetter how many characters of type will fit on the line width you have chosen. Then, set the margins on your typewriter or computer so that the number of characters per line matches the typeset line. In \"spec'ing\" type, make sure to mark such de\u00ad tails as space between paragraphs, paragraph in\u00ad dents, justified or ragged text, etc. Remember that the typesetter will charge you for any alterations you make after the text is set. The first set of type is usually run on long sheets of paper, called galleys. When the type is set and returned to you, proofread it carefully. Proofreading is not simply reading closely, it means reading letter for letter, checking every detail of the text for errors large or small. Some proofreaders go over a text twice-once to catch larger flaws in overall design and spacing, and a second time to proofread letter for letter. Final Proofs The proofreading process may take you through several stages of proof. Once your gal\u00ad leys are exactly as you want them, your typesetter or designer will make a final paste-up of camera-ready copy to sent to the printer. The type will be cut up and placed in columns on art boards exactly as it will appear on the printed copy. The final paste-up will also indicate for the printer the placement and size of photographs and artwork and the color breaks, which show where different ink colors are placed. Then, all camera-ready copy, artwork, and photographs are sent to the printer. The final stage of proof you will see is the blue\u00ad line, which will come from the printer. Look this over carefully for any broken type, covered type, color breaks, and alignment. When you have approved the blueline, the publication is ready for printing. Photographs Using black-and-white photographs is a fairly inexpensive way to enhance the visual appeal and human interest of your publication. A few guide\u00ad lines on choosing effective photographs are given be\u00ad low: 1. Choose photos with strong visual appeal that \"make a statement.\" 2. Crop your photos to eliminate unnecessary or uninteresting parts. 3. If possible, send black-and-white photos with a glossy finish to the printer for reproduction. 4. Choose photos with good contrast-strong darks and lights as well as a wide range of grey tones. 5. Choose prints with sharp detail, not blurred. Working with Typesetters The following advice in working with publication production specialists has been taken from the course manual for \"Newsletter Editing, Design, and Production,\" a Promotional Perspectives seminar. (For more information about Promotional Perspectives, their seminars and publi\u00ad cations, call (313) 994-0007.) Teamwork is an important concept to remember when working with typists, typesetters, and printers. Both you and the individual or group that prepares the work have responsibilities that have to be met if the task is to be completed to your satisfaction. With typists and typesetters, your first duty is to provide clean copy from which to work. When these professionals state that they are \"paid to set type, not to unravel dirty copy,\" they are not being fussy, but practical. Handwritten copy, messy misplaced correc\u00ad tions, and scrambled script can slow the process and cost you money-especially with the more expensive typesetting. Do everything you can to keep the typesetter from being confused or delayed by your copy. This may mean re-keyboarding sections or pages of copy, but it will help insure a minimum of errors and will help the typesetter stick to the quoted price. Remember that the quoted price is based, ac\u00ad cording to a universal code in the profession, on \"the receipt of original copy or manuscript clearly typed, double-spaced on 8Vz x 11/1 uncoated stock, one side only. Condition of copy which deviates from this stan\u00ad dard is subject to re-estimation and pricing review at time of submission of copy, unless otherwise specified in the estimate.\" Another rule to remember is one concerning al\u00ad terations: \"Alterations represent work performed in addition to original specifications. Such additional work shall be charged at current rates and be sup\u00ad ported with documentation upon request.\" Think twice, then think again before you change typeset copy. To avoid costly alteration charges, make sure the copy you submit is exactly what you want in con\u00ad tent, form, and style. In submitting copy to a typesetter, provide a com\u00ad plete spec (specification) sh.;ct that indicates the name of the typefaces, the point sizes for type and leading, and the line width. Include also whether the copy is to be set flush left, flush right, centered, jus\u00ad tified, ragged, indented, and so on. With recent advances in computers and typeset\u00ad ting equipment, new capabilities are available that can minimize headaches ~n creating typeset copy from typed text. Interfacing enables a word processor operator to capture keystrokes on a floppy disk, then deliver the disk to the typesetter. A typesetting ser\u00ad vice equipped to interface can insert the disk to pro\u00ad duce the typeset galleys, ready for paste-up. Some typesetters have optical character readers that \"read\" type from an IBM Selectric or certain other type\u00ad writers. Typed codes are inserted by the typesetter, converting the manuscript to typesetting. In either of these methods, there is no re-keyboarding by the typesetter and, therefore, less proofeading required and less opportunity for error. Some services can re\u00ad ceive the information by telecommunicating manu\u00ad scripts over telephone lines, thus eliminating the disk delivery. Working with Printers Printing services abound, so find those whose size and capabilities fit your needs. \"Quick print\" shops offer speedy delivery and ade\u00ad quate quality for many short publications, such as newsletters. Because they often use less sophisticated equipment than a commercial printer, you need to be concerned about maximum paper size, halftone qual\u00ad ity, ability to print and register two colors of ink, and paper requirements (some cannot accept coated stocks). 29 Commercial offset printers have varying capabil\u00ad ities as well. Some stay just one jump ahead of the \"quick\" printers, while others have huge six-color presses and are totally inappropriate for a 2,000 run of a two-color brochure. A web press is a possibility for long-run jobs. These are the same presses used for newspapers. Huge rolls of paper, rather than pre-cut sheets, are fed through rollers that print both sides of the paper at once. The continuous paper is cut and folded all on one machine. Some local weekly newspapers like to fill in their schedules with commercial jobs. They often offer very low rates to jobs with press runs as low as 2,000. Usually, however, you cannot specify special paper stocks, and you will have to take what\u00ad ever newsprint is on the press. One initial consideration is to avoid relying on one printing service for all your work. The printer that produces your letterhead or invoices may not be the best choice for producing other publications. If the printed quality of your publication has not been satisfactory or if you struggle to communicate with that printer's staff for each issue, get quotes from other firms and talk at length with the key people who would be working on your job. But be sure to give your choice a chance to prove itself, rather than jumping from one firm to another. It takes time to build the rapport and understanding that can lead to effective, efficient production. Submit your work to the printer in as clean and camera-ready condition as possible. If a designer pre\u00ad pares the artwork, that designer will be responsible for the quality of the submission. If you prepare your own paste-ups, make sure the copy is well secured and that special instructions are noted on the margins of the art boards or on tissue overlays. Measurements of size, folds, photo crops, and photo sizing must be accurate. Avoid surprising the printer with final art that does not follow il1formation supplied for quoting. As for typesetting, provide a complete instruction sheet with specifications for every detail. Stick to your deadlines, and your printer's staff should be able to honor theirs. As a general policy, typesetters and printers are not responsible for verbal instructions. If it is impor\u00ad tant enough to mention, put it in writing. Keep a copy of all your instructions. You will feel more at ease, and your supplier will know exactly what you expect. Nonprofit Organizations and the Media \"One man awake can waken another. The second can awaken his next door brother. The three awake can rouse the town by turning the whole place upside down. And the many awake make such a fuss they finally awaken the rest of us.\" [Helen Kromer] 30 Although the relationship has been an unpre\u00ad dictable one, there can be no doubt that since the early 1980s, issue-oriented organizations and the me\u00ad dia, working hand in hand, have played a tremendous role in raising public awareness about crimes against children. More specifically, in hundreds of cases they have together played a direct part in the location and recovery of missing children. The press has a responsibility to report news of interest to the community, and few subjects touch the hearts of the reading and viewing public more than the victimization of an innocent child. But, for the staff of nonprofit organizations that deal with missing children's issues, it has become clear that the public and the press have much to learn about the complex\u00ad ity of such crimes-that the term missing child means much more than the case of the \"stranger-abducted\" youth-and that it is our responsibility to educate them. Developing a Media Plan Working with the press can be a rewarding experience, but it must be a job you take seriously. Take the time to determine what your communications goals are in conjunction with your organization's long-range plan. o Determine the realistic picture of your NPO's current image and the message you are now delivering. o Develop a clear vision of the image and mes\u00ad sage your Board of Directors and management want to project. o Prepare a flexible one-year plan aimed at ad\u00ad dressing the discrepancies between the two and propose a strategy for delivering that message. Designating a Spokesperson Determine who from your organization is both knowledgeable about the child victimization issue and comfortable enough with the press to serve as a spokesperson. It may perhaps be the president or founder of your NPO, chairman of the board, or an experienced staff member-you! Help educate that individual about the local press. Learn print and broadcast media deadlines. Respond as quickly as possible to media inquiries, and gather as much information on their requests as you can. This will be as useful in preparing your spokesperson for the interview as it will be in addressing the needs of the reporter. The more you know about your local press and what they need to cover their story, the easier your job will be. Keep a log of completed in\u00ad terviews for your files. Press Materials: Tools of the Trade Prepare a back\u00ad ground information package about the issue and your organization's role in it. Keep the language simple and the message concise. If you have not done so already, consider mailing these packets or scheduling brief meetings to deliver them to introduce yourself to the appropriate press contacts at your local public affairs or news departments. 1. Press Release. Although an often overused me\u00ad dium, the press release can be an effective way of delivering your message. Release a media ad\u00ad visory only when you feel you have truly news\u00ad worthy information to deliver. Your release should be brief-keep it to one page, if possible, and address the classic \"Who, What, When, Where, and Why\" details of your chosen topic. Do not forget to date\u00b7 your release, and list a contact name and telephone number, in case the recipient of your advisory needs to contact you for more information. 2. Public Service Announcement (PSA). Develop\u00ad ing PSA messages for print and broadcast media can prove an ideal communications vehicle for the nonprofit organization on a budget. The Fed\u00ad eral Communications Commission requires ra\u00ad dio and television stations to designate a portion of air time to broadcast public sei. vice messages that are in the community's interest. Competi\u00ad tion for the time is stiff, but it is well worth the time invested to develop a variety of messages and make them available to the local media. Some periodicals (daily and weekly newspapers and magazines) also will print PSA messages as \"filler.\" Contact the public affairs director of the publication for more information. 3. News Conference. Call a news conference only if the subject of the briefing is of major importance to your organization, its programs, or the issues you address. Prepare a brief statement which your designated spokesperson, president, or chairman should deliver. Have press packets on hand, including a copy of the written statement, and background information about the issue. Limit the conference to a half hour-leaving plenty of time for a question/answer period. Building a Working Relationship with the Media Many missing children NPOs are organized by victim parents or by community members touched by child victimization personally. Naturally, these individuals can deliver the sincerest perspective on the need for increased public awareness, but knowledgeable child advocates who have never been touched personally by such crimes can also be tremendous resources for the media. If you are uncomfortable addressing cer\u00ad tain issues you feel might be better addressed by an expert in the field, refer your local press to your net\u00ad work of other NPO spokespersons or staff at the Na\u00ad tional Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The more responsive you are in getting your contacts the best information available, the more trust they will place in you, and the higher the likelihood that they will continue to contact you for your input. Building a strong reputation as a credible and reliable resource should be one of the most important facets of your communications strategy. Representing the Best Interests of the Missing Child Many of the interviews your spokesperson may accept will involve specific cases of abducted children from your community or state. The reporter may also re\u00ad quest to interview the parents of the missing youth. Although maximum exposure on the case can prove invaluable to the investigation-as well as raising public awareness about the issue-it is of vital im\u00ad portance to consider the wishes of each victim family. This may mean that, at some point, you serve as broker between press and parent. Parents of a missing child have an equal right to sensitive treatment by the media, without preempting the public's right to be accurately informed about the news. As a go-between, it will be your responsibility to remind reporters of the special needs of the family and attempt to ensure that they are adequately ad\u00ad dressed. At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, we share a policy many NPOs operate by, and we have incorporated it into our Policy Opera\u00ad tions Manual. The public affairs director or case man\u00ad ager handling the case in question will contact the parents to determine their interest in participating in an interview each time a request is made by the me\u00ad dia. Even in cases in which the parents may be inter\u00ad viewed repeatedly in a short period of time, never assume that they will always want to talk with the press. Arrange for the requested interview just as you would for the spokesperson for your organization, and reconfirm or decline the interview on the family's behalf as soon as possible. Although many journalists contend that one family's suffering may be another's prevention, always remember that it is each parent's prerogative to decline press coverage for any reason. In tllte Crise of a Recovery In the happy situation that a missing child is safely located and recovered, an interesting dilemma presents itself to the NPO involved in the search for the child. Certainly, recov\u00ad eries are powerful examples to the press and public that there can be positive resolutions in the missing children issue and that the system in place to assist in their recovery can work successfully. Media coverage of the actual reunification, however, may in some cases cause further trauma to an already victimized family. Work with the parent in such a situation and keep the best interests of the child first and foremost in your plans-most especially in cases where the child may have suffered physical or sexual abuse at the hands of the abductor. Just as an adult victim of rape has the right to anonymity, so does the child victim of abduction and sexual assault. As advocates 31 for children, we may have to remind reporters-and parents-of the rights of the recovered child. When Things Go Wrong: Crisis Communication With all your plans in place, and programs in full swing, you can never predict a media crisis-or an\u00ad ticipate the damage it can do to the credibility of the missing children issue or your organization's efforts to address it. It may be the hotly debated statistics question, a problem with a local fund-raising project, or a mis\u00ad understanding locally with a family of a missing child. Whatever the crisis, you must be ready to act quickly and decisively to head off the flow of misinformation and diffuse the controversy. 1. Meet with the principals of your organization\u00ad Board of Directors or management team-and determine all the known facts about the situa\u00ad tion. 2. Designate one specific staff member to handle incoming press calls, and arrange interviews with the designated spokesperson. 3. Brief your staff on the truth about the situation and make it clear who is to talk with the press and who is not. Then, encourage them to return to their normal job responsibilities. 4. Depending on the nature and degree of emer\u00ad gency of the crisis, plan to release a statement to the media which can be delivered by hand to local press contacts or announced at a news con- 32 ference. Prepare the statement, making a full disclosure of the situation. Being completely honest about the problem and your plans to ad\u00ad dress it will help to retain your credibility with the media. S. Never say \"Off the record ... \" today unless you are prepared to see it in print tomorrow. Never say \"No comment .... \" This often implies wrongdoing and can be easily avoided. It is much better to answer a portion of the question asked, promise to get back with the reporter with more information, and follow up immediately. 6. Touch base with your press contacts following the release of your organization's statement and as\u00ad sure them that you are there to answer their questions or address their concerns. Encourage them to visit your organization and meet with your president. The more willing your organiza\u00ad tion is to cooperate with inquiries, the faster the crisis will be diffused. Conclusion As members of the network of missing children's organizations, we all know too well how much damage one badly handled crisis in this issue can do to the years of our combined dedicated efforts. Along with working more closely with the media, we need to work more closely with each other. Draw\u00ad ing from each other's strengths, we all stand to benefit from this network and pass the successes of our labors on to the children we are charged to serve. 6. Keeping the Nonprofit Organization Going Dr. Stephen R. Block Institute for Nonprofit Organization Management It starts with a great idea: A problem in the commu\u00ad nity needs addressing, and neighbors and other inter\u00ad ested parties pull together in a true American fashion to create an organization to solve it. Shortly, the vol\u00ad untary efforts necessitate the need for more money, materials, and visibility. Collective problem solving has once again fashioned itself beyond the capabilities of a loose association of individuals into the need to form a new corporate entity-i.e., a nonprofit orga\u00ad nization. Determining the need for a nonprofit organiza\u00ad tbn (NPO) to solve a problem in the community is the simplest part of the collective problem-solving ef\u00ad fort. Shaping and maintaining the organization will be the most challenging of responsibilities. The Great Mistakes By their nature, nonprofit organizations are formed with intentions to deliver programmatic services to assist individuals in need. Program services may bt: focused in areas of prevention, education, counsel\u00ad ing, and advocacy, among many others. The fact that successful nonprofit services require attention to ef\u00ad fective management principles generally escapes the attention of most founders of nonprofit organizations. In fact, organizations that have been in existence for several years often also rely on the strengths of the program to carry the organization forward and lack the proper stewardship that is required to manage a nonprofit organization. Nonprofit organizations may face several types of problems in their attempt to maintain or grow. The problems are actually symp\u00ad toms of the organization's lack of management skills. The symptoms may include the following: Lack of funds Reliance on one funding source Lack of a clear organizational direction for the future Overwhelmed by prisis after crisis No ability to recruit volunteers No ability to keep active volunteers No ability to attract appropriate Board mem\u00ad bers Uninterested or inattentive Board members Lack of adequate financial data to make appro\u00ad priate decisions Lack of knowledge and information about whether services are making a difference Beyond Survival The leaders in the nonprofit organization should strive towards the development of a strong, vibrant, purposeful entity. The same features that go into cre\u00ad ating a strong nonprofit organization are essentially the same elements for maintaining the nonprofit or\u00ad ganization. Ke~ping the nonprofit organization going will require attention to two halves of the nonprofit's world: the inside and the outside. The inside world of the nonprofit organization includes the internal op\u00ad erations, such as finances, program management, staffing, the Board of Directors, the budget, office facilities, and resource development activities. The outside world, on the other hand, represents organi\u00ad zations and individuals that may have some' influence over the nonprofit organization, either currently or potentially in the future. They include funding sources, policy makers, the media, and other non\u00ad profit organizations who may be considered compet\u00ad itors or potential collaborators. Often, nonprofit or\u00ad ~anizations believe they are attending to both their Internal and external forces at the same time but in reality, they are dealing with these elements one ~t a time rather than in some integrated or planned way. 33 The following is a brief examination of both the internal and external forces affecting the nonprofit service provider. It will be up to each individual non\u00ad profit organization to examine these elements and determine how best to integrate their own findings and devise what may become part of the organiza\u00ad tion's plan for continuation, or the strategic plan. Internal Focus The Organization's Foundation Just as we would not want to build a house on a cracked or eroding foundnt;on, maintenance of the nonprofit organiza\u00ad tion requires a solid foundation built upon its mis\u00ad sion. The mission is the focal point of the organiza\u00ad tion from which all other decisions should be based, including fund raising and program development. The mission is usually represented by a statement that provides a common vision for the Board, staff, and volunteers. The Board and management staff must periodi\u00ad cally review the organization's mission statement and reaffirm its meaning as the driving force for the or\u00ad ganization. Indeed, the mission statement may ceed revision from time to time. Corporate Papers It is the responsibility of the Board's secretary to hold and maintain the corporate papers of the organization, which should be main\u00ad tained in a safe place. This includes the articles of .incorporation, minutes of the organization, annual reports, bylaws, and other documents that are re\u00ad quired for the sound management of the organiza\u00ad tion. It is always a good idea to keep a copy of all these records off premises in the event a fire or theft should occur. There are several documents that are very im\u00ad portant to a nonprofit organization. One of the first steps in becoming recognized as a nonprofit organi\u00ad zation is to file a set of articles of incorporation through a state government agency, usually under ',I,le auspices of the office of the Secretary of State or state Attorney General. Completing the paperwork and paying the small fee to apply for recognition as a nonprofit corporation is itself an uncomplicated task. Often, an outline is provided by the Secretary of State's office which indicates the type of information needed for completing the articles of incorporation. Usually, articles of incorporation contain the foIlow\u00ad ing information: 34 Name of the organization Purpose of the organization How long the organization will exist Location of the organization and its registered agent Names and addresses of the initial Board of Directors A statement that the Board of Directors will not personally gain financially or share in the profits of the organization Provisions for dissolving the organization and distributing its assets Occasionally, management staff and the Board of Directors will find it necessary to amend the articles of incorporation. This is particularly true if the pur\u00ad pose statement requires significant or radical changes. Otherwis'e, the articles of incorporation, particularly the purpose statement, will serve as the initial guiding force for the organization. Maintenance of the organization also requires re\u00ad examination of the organization bylaws, which serve as the constitution of the organization. They provide the guidelines and rules for running the organization and are necessary for managing its daily affairs. The following provisions are sometimes found in a non\u00ad profit organization's bylaws: Organization name Principal location Description of management requirements- i.e., powers of the Board of Directors The number of Board members Annual meetings Required notice of meetings Quorum requirements Voting rights Proxy requirements Board terms of office Board powers Nominating procedures Attendance requirements Waivers of notice Board liability Committee establishment Requirements for corporate contracts Indemnification Requirements for keeping records Corporate seal designation Fiscal year designation Procedures for amending the bylaws Maintaining the organization also requires keep- ing a set of records, such as Board minutes, which detail the organization's policy decisions. The min\u00ad utes, in fact, provide a historical record of the orga\u00ad nization's activities, and it is based on this history that the organization may move forward and establish its agenda. Tax Exemption Establishing a set of bylaws and maintaining a set of minutes following the filing of the articles of incorporation does not, by itself, pro\u00ad vide a nonprofit organization with a waiver to avoid paying taxes. ~~ ________________________________ -~_c ___ --____ ,,-. The next step in becoming recognized as a tax\u00ad exempt organization is to complete Form 1023, ob\u00ad tained from the Internal Revenue Service. Based upon a nonprofit organization's response to the ques\u00ad tions found in Form 1023, the Internal Revenue Ser\u00ad vice will determine whether an organization should be recognized as a tax-exempt entity. The most pre\u00ad ferred recognition is a Section 501(c)(3). The 501(c)(3) label not only provides the organization with the exemption from paying taxes on related in\u00ad come, it also allows contributors to the organization to write off a portion of their giving on their own personal tax return. Becoming recognized as a tax\u00ad exempt organization increases the opportunities for the organization to receive charitable contributions from individuals, corporations, foundations, and other granting institutions. An applicant must dem\u00ad onstrate, through Form 1023, that the intention of the nonprofit organization (which has already filed its ar\u00ad ticles of incorporation with the state) has a charitable mission generally falling within the categories of ed\u00ad ucation, science, health, human services, or religion. In addition to determining whether an applicant fits within the definitions of the Internal Revenue Ser\u00ad vice Code for a nonprofit organization, the Internal Revenue Service may, during the nonprofit organiza\u00ad tion's existence, examine whether the organization has operated for the benefit of the general public and within the boundaries of the organization's purpose as stated on its Form 1023. Another form of tax exemption that a nonprofit organization should explore once it has received rec\u00ad ognition by the Internal Revenue Service is the ex\u00ad emption of payment of state taxes, both on revenues and on goods purchased. Application for this type of exemption is available through the State Department of the Treasury, sometimes referred to as the De\u00ad partment of Revenue. Recognition by the Internal Revenue Service does not automatically provide for the exemption of paying sales tax to a state or a city. In fact, some states and cities have a more narrow definition of a charitable organization, making tax exemption at a city or state level more difficult to achieve. Once the nonprofit organization receives recog\u00ad nition as exempt from federal taxes, it does have some obligations in order to maintain this special status. Specifically, the organization is required to file Form 990 no later than five and a half months after the end of the organization's fiscal year. The Form 990 is a vehicle by which the Internal Revenue Service ac\u00ad counts for the organization's income and expendi\u00ad tures. As referred to earlier, the 990 is used to dem\u00ad onstrate that the nonprofit organization has received sufficient support from the general public to meet certain \"support tests\" required by the Internal Rev-enue Service for the nonprofit organization to main\u00ad tain its tax-exempt status. Another form of tax that an organization may need to pay and may seek exemption from is personal property tax for items such as desks and furnishings in an office. If a nonprofit can demonstrate that the property is used to further the charitable mission of the organization, then it may be in a position to apply for exemption of payment of person~l property taxes. It is best to check with local taxing authorities on this matter. There are other tax requirements that a nonprofit organization must adhere to in order to stay in busi\u00ad ness. The nonprofit organization, like other busi\u00ad nesses, might have to collect taxes for unemployment programs and for workmen's compensation. The amount that the organization is required to pay into such funds may depend on the number of employees and the level of salary and wages that are paid. Non\u00ad profit organizations are not exempt from paying this form of levy. In some states, however, a nonprofit organization may put up a bond or letter of credit in lieu of payment of state unemployment taxes. The nonprofit organization would still be responsible for payment of unemployment funds to the state, should a former employee file for unemployment insurance and be granted payments by the state. One last point about the payment of taxes. Al\u00ad though a nonprofit organization may have been granted tax exemption, it may still be required to pay taxes on unrelated income in the amount of $1,000 or more earned. If an organization is selling items or earning funds that are not directly connected to the organization's mission, it is always best to check with a tax accountant to determine the organization's lia\u00ad bility for the payment of taxes. Governance Organizing and perpetuating a Board of Directors is one of the most difficult of tasks in the ongoing maintenance of an effective nonprofit orga\u00ad nization. The nonprofit's Board of Directors has a responsibility for planning, controlling, and evaluat\u00ad ing. In the area of planning, the Board is responsible for establishing the mission and program direction for the organization. It is also responsible for reviewing program plans and monitoring the progress of the organization's activities. The controlling function encompasses the estab\u00ad lishment of policies and financial controls. The Board has a fiduciary responsibility in how money is ex\u00ad pended as well as collected. The Board also has a responsibility for approving annual budgets and re\u00ad viewing periodic financial statements. They must in\u00ad sure that there are proper financial controls, such as how checks are handled when they come into the office and that they are deposited in a timely manner. Policies established by the Board become a set of 35 guidelines or instructional rules for how activities should be performed in the organization. The evalu\u00ad ation function of the Board is to review the critical components of the organization's programs that de\u00ad termine its success or failure. In addition, the Board is responsible for evaluating the performance of its paid chief executive officer. Perpetuating the Board of Directors is critical to the life of the nonprofit organization, including re\u00ad cruiting appropriate members. Poor recruitment pol\u00ad icy usually results in unmotivated and uncommitted Board members. Nonprofit organizations should take more care in recruiting and nominating members that are reliable in attending meetings, committing to serving on committees, and assisting in resource de\u00ad velopment. The success of the organization is largely due to a successful Board of Directors. The individuals invited and chosen for the Board should help to fill gaps of skill and knowledge. It was once said that a Board of Directors should comprise individuals who collectively make up the following three Ws: wealth, wisdom, and work. The organiza\u00ad tion needs workers-individuals who will assist in or\u00ad ganizational tasks and events. In the area of wisdom, the Board members should have issue expertise that will contribute to decision making and program de\u00ad velopment. The notion that Board members should participate in fund-raising activities is often a contro\u00ad versial topic of discussion, but the third W does in\u00ad dicate that it is the Board's responsibility t6 help raise dollars. A Board of Directors should closely examine its own policy about resource development. It is al\u00ad ways a sound requirement for a Board member to contribute a certain dollar level, even if it becomes a token amount for those with more modest means. In some arenas, it becomes more difficult to raise dollars unless the organization's Board of Directors has been unanimous in its own financial giving to the organi\u00ad zation. Maintenance and ongoing development of a non\u00ad profit organization also requires a planned educa\u00ad tional program for the Board of Directors. Board training and skill development allow members to un\u00ad derstand their basic roles and responsibilities of stew\u00ad ardship and their relationship to the organization's staff. Board training is also a mechanism for improv\u00ad ing the Board's use of committees, which can be an effective tool for examining and completing some of the work of the organization. Liability and Financial Management Nonprofit or\u00ad ganizations often operate in a risk-filled environment characterized by non-quantifiable services which af\u00ad fect people's very lives as well as depend upon a mul\u00ad titude of funding sources. These kinds of risks make NPOs unique-and vulnerable. Proper financial management, effective internal controls, and an ad- 36 equate accounting system can eliminate or at least mitigate many of these risks and liabilities. The actual liability for running a nonprofit orga\u00ad nization falls into the hands of the Board of Direc\u00ad tors. Board members often believe that having the protection of directors and officers liability insurance protects them in their work with the nonprofit orga\u00ad nization. This may not be the case. In order to elim\u00ad inate risk, the Board must act properly in its role as the organization's legal guardian. Board members can limit their liab.ility by attending Board meetings, reviewing the organization's records, and ensuring that Board minutes are accurate and that a full dis\u00ad cussion and understanding of polick~s, programs, con\u00ad tracts, and other areas requiring the Board's decision receive full discussion and examination. Many states are now passing legislation to protect citizens in their participation as volunteer Board members. These laws are relatively new and un\u00ad tested, however. There is no protection for volunteers who misguide the organization by using \"bad judg\u00ad ment.\" One of the most important functions of the Board is to control the organization's financial position. Fi\u00ad nancial management, in many ways, is the corner\u00ad stone of any organization. As a basic requirement, all Board members should insist on routinely receiv\u00ad ing financial reports that clarify the current fiscal health of the organization. These reports should in\u00ad clude a statement of the monthly restricted and un\u00ad restricted expenses and revenues and year-to-date re\u00ad ports for the statement of revenues and expenses. A current reading on the organization's assets and lia\u00ad bilities will give further clues to the organization's overall fiscal health. In addition, Board members should insist on cash flow reports and budget variance analyses, which can be used in forecasting the future cash needs of the organization. Financial reports give meaning to the organization's budget, which is a man\u00ad agement tool for helping guide the organization's strategic plan, and also reduce the Board's liability. All but the smallest of organizations should be audited from time to time, and most should be au\u00ad dited once a year. An audit is not an examination of every financial transaction that has been recorded in the organization but is, rather, a test designed to make a judgment on how effectively the records were kept and the degree of reliance one can place on the internal controls of the nonprofit organization. The audit provides credibility for the financial statements, which are used for making important decisions within the organization. Likewise, funders often are further influenced by a solid audit report and \"clean opinion\" of the nonprofit organization. Resource Development Fund raising is a manage\u00ad ment function. The determination of how much cash the organization requires to function and the meth\u00ad ods by which the organization will seek those dollars is determined, in part, by the Board of Directors and is tied to the organization's mission. Unfortunately, for many nonprofit organizations, the ability to succeed in raising dollars is directly linked to today's trends and giving patterns among social causes or particular problem arenas. When the tide falls, the NPO often suffers financially. Nonprofit organizations who have longer-term success in re\u00ad source development are generally those that approach fund raising as a planning process. Among the many types of fund-raising activities are the following: Special events Planned giving Earned and venture income Big donors Acquisition of grants and contracts Direct mail The sources for targeting fund-raising activities include individuals, government agencies, founda\u00ad tions, corporations, and religious institutions. The decision to target a resource development campaign and the goal amount of dollars required is made through the management staff and Board of Direc\u00ad tors' resource development plan, which is also a prod\u00ad uct of the organization's strategic plan. The resource development plan will include a description of the organization's activities and the goals of the organi\u00ad zation in dollar terms. Grants Every year the nonprofit sector has wit\u00ad nessed a growth in the amount of dollars given to nonprofit organizations. In 1988, for example, more than $100 billion was donated to nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions from private-sector sources. This amount in\u00ad cludes approximately $12 billion from foundations and corporations, each giving approximately $6 bil\u00ad lion to nonprofit organizations. The balance of the funds comes from individuals. Despite the fact that individuals give more money to nonprofit organizations, nonprofit organizations spend a great deal of time and energy soliciting funds from foundations and corporations as their main source of dollar-seeking activity. The reason that non\u00ad profit organizations seek support from foundations and corporations is understandable. If they should receive a grant, the dollar amount is usually larger than it would receive from a private individual. Seeking a grant from a foundation or corporation requires much homework. Nonprofit organizations seeking grants from foundations and corporations must research whether their organization's goals fit within the interest areas of the foundation or corpo\u00ad rate giving program. There are directories available in libraries to assist the grant seeker in this task. The Foundation Directory, for example, contains a listing of foundations by geographic region and subject area and allows the grant seeker to determine whether a foundation may be ripe for receiving a grant pro\u00ad posal. In addition to using the information in the Foundation Directory, it is always a good idea to write directly to the foundation or corporation and ask for instructions for submitting a proposal. Annual re\u00ad ports from corporations and foundations also are use\u00ad ful as a tool for learning about the amount of giving from the funding source. The Internal Revenue Service requires founda\u00ad tions to file Form 990. The 990s are available for inspection on microfiche at the Foundation Center in New York City and in their regional depositories throughout the country-often located in major pub\u00ad lic libraries. The Form 990 completed by the foun\u00ad dation will indicate the amount of dollars given by the foundation and a description of the recipient's program. This will give the reader of the 990 a better clue as to the areas of interest of the foundation. Using the directories, the 990s, and annual reports, one can learn a great deal about the foundation's giving program. Corporations and foundations may have other \"agendas\" which will not appear in catalogs and di\u00ad rectories. It is always a good idea, therefore, to get to know the funder better. Nothing beats meeting the foundation director or corporate giving director face to face. In fact, if a goal of the nonprofit organization is to survive, stabilize, or move forward, it will re\u00ad quire the ongoing cultivation of relationships among funding sources. Billions of dollars are also given away annually by government agencies. The same principle applies for government funding sources as does for the foun\u00ad dation and corporation. Get to know the require\u00ad ments of the funding source and the individuals in\u00ad volved in the giving programs. If it is impossible to fly to Washington, D. C., or to meet with state or regional representatives, using the telephone is an alternative. Do your homework. Some useful tools include the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, which covers listings for government grant programs. The Federal Register, which is published daily, rec\u00ad ords rule changes and allocations for grants. The Commerce Business Daily is another good source for learning about contract opportunities with federal government agencies. Make sure to follow all grant regulations to the detail. .- Some nonprofit organizations are much more ca\u00ad pable of generating grant support than others. The reason for this is not just in the organization's ability to write proposals but is a result of a better grasp of the problems at hand and an ability to evaluate pro- 37 gram limitations and strengths. A strong proposal will usually focus on the following key areas: 1. An introduction to the organization, demon\u00ad strating its credibility and capability to get a job done. 2. A problem statement that demonstrates an or\u00ad ganization's understanding of a particular prob\u00ad lem. The problem usually relates to the reason why the nonprofit organization was formed. 3. A goals and objectives section that addresses the types of solutions and measurable objectives the nonprofit organization seeks. 4. A methods section, which describes in detail how the nonprofit organization will achieve the goals and objectives. It is in this area that you should describe the type of management and staffing that will be required to get the job done and the time lines, charts, and illustrations to support the planned effort. 5. An evaluation tool, which will demonstrate ac\u00ad countability to the funding source as well as the organization's own commitment to learning and growing. The evaluation tool should describe how the organization seeks to monitor its work. 6. Description of future funding sources, as foun\u00ad dations or corporations do not want nonprofit organizations to become too reliant on only them. Describing future funding sources is also a mechanism for the nonprofit organization to scrutinize its future needs. Nonprofit organizations should seek to find out which federal agencies and divisions may have pro\u00ad grams with available grant dollars. Reading directo\u00ad ries, attending conferences, using consultants, sub\u00ad scribing to newsletters, and contacting Congressional offices are among a variety of mechanisms for learn\u00ad ing about funding opportunities and leads into differ\u00ad ent governmental agencies. Once the federal agency is identified, the nonprofit should request to be placed 38 on a mailing list to receive future announcements of requests for proposals and solicitation notices. For example, the Department of Justice has a victim's assistance division that awards grants to nonprofit or\u00ad ganizations for specific categorical or demonstration project programs. External Focus Trends Nonprofit organizations that not only pay attention to their internal development but also ex\u00ad amine outside trends have a better survival rate. Out\u00ad side the organization there are various individuals, organizations, and changing events that can impact the nonprofit organization. Determining who the in\u00ad dividuals and organizations are that can influence your nonprofit organization is a starting point. This can include policy makers, funders, media represen\u00ad tatives, client groups, or other nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions-your competitors. Cultivate a positive and co\u00ad operative relationship among these \"key publics\" in order to seek advice, support, and opportunities. Competitors/Collaborators Nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions indeed compete-for funds, for volunteers, and for visibility. Examining the strengths and weaknesses among the competition can clue your organization into areas it should enter-or avoid. Our competition can also be our \"best friend,\" and working together can be advantageous. Pooling resources can assist or\u00ad ganizations in achieving their mission. Collaboration is viewed positively among funders. Conclusion Solving a problem in the 'community requires more than a good idea. It requires meeting the challenges of managing the nonprofit organiza\u00ad tion, which was formed to solve the problem and to fulfill a mission. For an organization to survive, main\u00ad tain, develop-\"keep going\"-the management staff and Board of Directors must pay attention not only to quality program services, but also to how they manage both policy and resources. 7. Networki ng Cherisse L. Luxa King County (Seattle) Police Department Martha H. Maxwell New Jersey State Police Carolyn Zogg Child Find of America, Inc. Networking with Other Organizations Because of the complexities of child custody, it is necessary to work with legal, judicial and, in many cases, social service agencies. Legal Services It is most important that the search\u00ad ing parents have competent legal assistance and ad\u00ad vice to know how to go about finding the child and returning the child to the legal jurisdiction of their state. In their counseling, nonprofit organizations must gU\\lrd against giving legal advice, which is con\u00ad sidered the unauthorized practice of law when done by a non-lawyer. Organizations can work with state bar associa\u00ad tion pro bono committees as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the National Organization for Women (NOW), law school clinics, or local women's bar associations to service searching parents in all states. These com\u00ad mittees can be contacted through organizational di\u00ad rectories, lawyer contacts, or directory assistance. Some state bar associations have a reduced fee pro\u00ad gram, and some law firms have pro bono committees willing to take custody cases or give advice. A new organization should contact all its state pro bono legal resources for names and phone num\u00ad bers of individual attorneys. Victims Services Victims services for parents can be found through local United Way listings, through Volunteer (a national organization with state listings of charitable groups), and the National Victim Center in Fort Worth, Texas. There are five hundred runaway programs throughout the country. Parents of runa'Nays can tele\u00ad phone the National Runaway Switchboard at 1-800- 621-4000. Covenant House, in New York City and around the world, provides runaways with shelter, food, and other services. Their hotline number is 1- 800-999-9999. Children can call Child Find's toll-free 800-I-AM-LOST telephone number, the National Center's hotline-1-800-843-5678-and the local 911 number. Child Find offers support to searching par\u00ad ents through its all-volunteer Friends of Child Find in many states. Other Nonprofit Organizations Some nonprofit or\u00ad ganizations specialize in certain services, such as the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services, which works with runaways. Child Find has built a reputation for handling parental abduction cases and has introduced a unique mediation program to en\u00ad courage the return of parentally abducted children. Networking with other nonprofit organizations in the field involves finding common ground to build a relationship to exchange ideas and wor;c together to\u00ad ward the common goal of finding missing children. Unfortunately, no common criteria govern the credi\u00ad bility and accountability of charitable organizations that would enable them to work together. Criteria should follow the Better Business Bureau Charitable Solicitation Standards for public accountability, use of funds, solicitation and information materials, fund\u00ad raising practices, and governance. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Chil\u00ad dren The National Center is very helpful to NPOs as a resource for technical assistance and publica\u00ad tions, especially in the area of state parental kidnap\u00ad ping legislation and as a training program for law\u00ad enforcement on a national level. State clearinghouses are coordinated by the National Center. The National Center can also be helpful in international abductions through the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Defense. 39 Networking with Law-Enforcement Agencies Law-enforcement agencies and nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions can effectively work together to resolve cases of missing children. To establish a good working relationship with the police, it is important that nonprofit service providers become aware of local laws and state statutes regard\u00ad ing the handling of missing children cases as well as each police agency's policies, procedures, and man\u00ad power constraints that could affect the handling of these cases. Make sure that you understand what po\u00ad lice officers can and cannot do. Trust and communication must be developed be\u00ad tween nonprofit organizations and law-enforcement agencies. The nonprofit organization should contact each agency they will be dealing with and determine how they can assist that agency. This must be done before a major case breaks, as it is difficult to do during the heat of the investigation. Guidelines should be developed and agreed upon that will be mutually beneficial to both the nonprofit organization and the police agency. Trust can be easily destroyed by either party breaking the agreed-upon terms. If a problem arises, direct and honest communication is the best solution. When dealing with a law-enforcement agency, nonprofit service providers must remember that it is a paramilitary organization with a chain of command. If inappropriate action is being taken, concerns should be expressed to the investigating officer. If his or her reply is not satisfactory, then begin the process through the chain of command by speaking with that person's immediate supervisor. Nonprofit service pro\u00ad viders should never start at the top by discussing prob\u00ad lems with the chief of police or the sheriff, as this will alienate people at the bottom who work with that organization on a regular basis. Nonprofit service providers should understand that during a missing persons investigation, some facts must be withheld from the family and the public. This may cause frustration to families and nonprofit service providers, who may show their dissatisfaction by \"cop bashing\" in the media. This hurts not only that organization's relationship with the particular law-enforcement agency, but also with all police de\u00ad partments, and the police will avoid working with that organization. A good working relationship with a law-enforcement agency, however, will result in that organization receiving positive referrals from that po\u00ad lice department. As relationships between nonprofit organizations and law-enforcement agencies develop, the police will see the value of networking with nonprofit service providers. The following are some ideas for improving 40 those relationships and the services that nonprofit or\u00ad ganizations provide to law-enforcement agencies. Dealing with the Family Besides providing crisis intervention, referral, advocacy, support services, and other assistance to the families of missing children, the nonprofit service provider can be a liaison among the family, the police investigator, and the criminal justice system. In addition, as the relationship be\u00ad tween the nonprofit service provider and the family evolves, a family member may confide information to the service provider that may be beneficial to the case. The service provider should encourage the family member to provide the information to the police in\u00ad vestigator or get permission from the family member to relay the information to the investigator directly. Dealing with the Media Should the nonprofit ser\u00ad vice provider decide to issue press releases and pro\u00ad vide other information to the media regarding a miss\u00ad ing child case, there should first be discussions with the police investigator and the police agency's public information officer on what information should be made public. Failure to coordinate the release of in\u00ad formation with the police can jeopardize the location and recovery of the child and, in some instances, may put the child at further risk. Additionally, the non\u00ad profit service provider should keep the investigator apprised of media inquiries and publication of inter\u00ad views with the parents. Photo Dissemination If a nonprofit organization intends to distribute posters on a missing child, the staff should coordinate this with the police investi\u00ad gator. The nonprofit service provider should deter\u00ad mine if the police agency is also distributing posters so as not to duplicate efforts. In addition, the service provider needs to find out what information the law-enforcement agency wants on the posters and if the posters for the police de\u00ad partments should include information different from that on the posters given to the general public. All posters sent to law-enforcement agencies should include the child's full name and date of birth. It can be confusing if only the child's age is used and the child has been missing for several years. If posters are to be distributed to the public out\u00ad side the jurisdiction of the agency handling the case, the poster should include the telephone number of the National Center and the investigating agencies\u00ad including the police and, if applicable, the FBI. If a nonprofit organization puts up posters in a community, the organization should determine where it is legal to do so. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to affix such material to utility poles or to the posts of traffic signs. Contact the local police to determine what locations are appropriate. (See the Appendix for a sample missing child poster.) Dealing with Leads If a nonprofit organization is going to obtain leads on missing child cases, the ser\u00ad vice provider assigned to the case should ask the law\u00ad enforcement investigator what specific questions should be asked. All information, whether it seems significant or not, should be given to the police inves\u00ad tigator. Information that may seem insignificant at the time may later be the crucial piece needed to locate and recover a child. All leads should be given to the police in a timely and understandable manner and in written form. If the nonprofit service provider believes that informa\u00ad tion needs immediate follow-up, he or she should call the police immediately and provide a written report later. The personnel at nonprofit organizations should keep in mind that, when taking information on leads, they are always interviewing a potential witness. On any call it is important to obtain as much information as possible when the information is fresh in the call\u00ad er's mind. Because of workload, there may be a delay in the police investigator getting back to the caller, and the person may forget important facts. It is critical that lead receivers become skillful, especially if the caller wishes to remain anonymous, since the police will not be able to recontact them for further information. To improve nonprofit service providers' inter\u00ad viewing techniques, training should be provided. Lo\u00ad cal community colleges with law-enforcement/police science programs may offer classes. Other options include contacting the police training unit or the local police academy and asking the trainer to volunteer to train the staff of the nonprofit organization. Ground Searches If nonprofit organizations under\u00ad take ground searches for missing children, training must be provided to the searchers and the organizers prior to the search. This is imperative to ensure thor\u00ad ough, organized searches, documentation of what areas have been searched, and assurance that no evi\u00ad dence crucial in locating the missing child is over\u00ad looked or destroyed. If the search is done in conjunction with the po\u00ad lice agency, coordination should be done by the po\u00ad lice. If not done in conjunction with the police, infor\u00ad mation on what areas were searched and the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all organizers and searchers should be provided to the investigator han\u00ad dling the case. All information gathered during the search should be given to the police. Training in how to coordinate and execute searches can be obtained from local search and rescue organizations. Local community colleges with police science/law-enforcement programs will offer classes on the laws regarding the handling and preservation of evidence. Police academies or training units pro\u00ad vide instructors as well. NCIC The service provider can assist the law-en\u00ad forcement investigator in ensuring that all informa\u00ad tion possible about the missing child has been entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer system. To ensure this, the nonprofit ser\u00ad vice provider should become familiar with the NCIC missing person packet. Some law-enforcement agen\u00ad cies have found it beneficial to give this packet to the nonprofit service provider to obtain this information from the family. Also, the service provider can some\u00ad times assist in obtaining the missing child's medical and dental records so this information can be entered. At times, not all relevant information is entered be\u00ad cause no one thought to ask the family, or the person obtaining the information was unaware of the poten\u00ad tial of the system to accept it. VICAP The Violent Criminal Apprehension Pro\u00ad gram (VICAP) was established by the Federal Bu\u00ad reau of Investigation to gather information nation\u00ad wide on violent crimes to determine if crime patterns exist. Nonprofit organizations should encourage law\u00ad enforcement investigators to submit VICAP Crime Analysis Report forms to the FBI on all non-family abduction cases. Missing person cases in which there is a strong likelihood of foul play can also be submit\u00ad ted. Submitting these cases may result in a coordi\u00ad nated effort among law-enforcement agencies that could lead to the apprehension of the offender and the location of the missing child. Unidentified Children If the police are investigat\u00ad ing a case of an unidentified child-either living or deceased-the staff of the nonprofit organization should research their files for missing persons that may match this child's description. Even if the police enter the unidentified child into the NCIC Unidenti\u00ad fied Persons File to be compared with missing chil- ~ dren of similar description, the actual missing child may not be in that system. The missing child may not have been entered into the NCIC or the entry may have been removed in error. Provide the police with all information on missing children that may match the child they are trying to identify. Police Crime Prevention Unit Contact local police agencies with child safety programs and determine if your nonprofit organization can be of assistance. Nonprofit organizations with prevention and educa\u00ad tion programs may be able to join forces with the police to provide these sf'>:vices to both children and their parents. Police Officer Training Nonprofit organizations should find out what training is being given to police officers in their area in the handling of missing child cases and what they can do to help. Nonprofit service providers should notify the missing person investiga\u00ad tors of upcoming conferences regarding the handling of these cases. Service providers can also ensure that 41 the police are given written materials, such as the National Center publications. It may be beneficial as weU to provide this same information to the training units of the police departments and to the staff of the area police academy. Advocacy Nonprofit service providers often feel frustrated that many police department missing per\u00ad sons units are understaffed and that the personnel lack training. This is usually the result of budget cuts by the local governing body. Contact the missing persons unit and develop a plan on how your organization might be able to help get its budget increased and approved. Some options are: 1) find out when there will be public hearings, and go and offer testimony; 2) write letters to elected officials with the power to approve the budget; 3) mobilize members of your organization to do the same; and 4) encourage families of missing children to get involved. Several days before there is a vote on the budget, the nonprofit organization can hold a press conference to show its support. On the day of the vote, call the elected officials to reaffirm that you want this budget passed. This type of involvement by a nonprofit organi\u00ad zation will not only improve its relationship with that police agency, it will result in better trained and ad\u00ad ditional police personnel to investigate missing child cases. Support and Recognition Police investigators han\u00ad dling missing child cases attempt to do a good job but often have large caseloads. Nonprofit service provid\u00ad ers should remember that police officers are human. They do not remain unaffected and may suffer from stress and burnout. Just as nonprofit service providers offer support and advocacy services to families of missing children, they can also provide similar ser\u00ad vices to the police officers they deal with on these cases. If a police investigator does an exemplary job on a missing child case, take the time to write a letter to the chief of police or the sheriff of the investigator's agency to show your appreciation. Also, if the family of the missing child wants to show their appreciation as well, the nonprofit service provider can encourage them to write a letter. Some missing persons organizations also pick a police officer of the year and present him or her with a certificate or a plaque at an awards ceremony. Any kind of recognition for a job well done will be appre\u00ad ciated by the police recipient and will encourage that officer and others to excel in the future. Networking with State Missing Persons Clearinghouses While several states had already established state missing children clearinghouses prior to the Missing 42 Children's Assistance Act of 1984, a majority of the other states have since followed suit. To date, 42 states and the District of Columbia have missing per\u00ad sons or missing children clearinghouses. Established under the authority of state statute, administrative directive, or executive order, the clearinghouses are primarily located within state law-enforcement agen\u00ad cies. Two exceptions are the state clearinghouses in Ohio and Louisiana. In Ohio, the clearinghouse is located within the State Department of Education and, in Louisiana, within the State Department of Health and Human Services. The role of state clearinghouses varies from han\u00ad dling only missing children cases to handling all miss\u00ad ing persons, unidentified persons, and child sexual exploitation cases. Depending on the authority of the clearinghouse, its responsibilities range from serving as an information repository and disseminator to con\u00ad ducting proactive/reactive investigations. An the clearinghouses share one common goal: to serve as the central points of contact in their respective states regarding missing persons. A majority of the clear\u00ad inghouses are staffed eight hours a day. During other than regular working hours, clearinghouse personnel are generally on call when needed. Staffing varies from one to greater than 50 personnel. State Clearinghouses and the Nonprofit Service Pro\u00ad vider The process of recovering a missing child can be a long, complicated, and difficult one. An individ\u00ad ual's reasons for being missing and the effect that episode has on him and his family are complex, re\u00ad quiring the assistance of a number of different profes\u00ad sionals. Many times the successful recovery of an in\u00ad dividual may greatly depend upon the cooperation and coordination of numerous local, county, state, federal, private, and public agencies. Because the role, resources, and staffing of state clearinghouses vary greatly from state to state, there are instances when comprehensive services cannot be offered. Many times there are a host of services that a nonprofit service provider can furnish to a family that a state clearinghouse may not be able to pro\u00ad vide-for instance, counseling and support services, media assistance, legal and financial aid, and advocacy. Networking with a State Clearinghouse Upon es\u00ad tablishment, nonprofit service providers should con\u00ad tact the state clearinghouse in their state. Developing an early contact is imperative in cultivating a good working relationship. When making initial contact with the clearinghouse, it is recommended that the nonprofit service provider be able to give the follow\u00ad ing kinds of information: Agency overview and purpose Service plan: who, what, when, where, why, and how Names of staff members and backgrounds Copies of incorporation or nonprofit papers A state clearinghouse is the primary contact point for missing persons in the state. The general public will often coptact the clearinghouse seeking all types of information, including information on nonprofit service providers. Therefore, the more information which can be provided to the clearinghouse, the bet\u00ad ter the service provider's representation to the public. Furnishing such information will also help to establish the nonprofit organization's intent and credibility. At the time of initial contact, it is also important for the nonprofit service provider to learn about the role and responsibilities of the state clearinghouse. Ascertain if there is one individual in the clearing\u00ad house who acts as a liaison for service providers. In\u00ad quire to see what services the clearinghouse can pro\u00ad vide and how the service provider could assist the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse may also be able to provide training (initial and advanced) and contacts or listing of services in the state (including youth ser\u00ad vices, shelters, and other resources that might be helpful). While most clearinghouses will not make direct referrals, the agency will generally provide an inquiring party with a list of service agencies. Inquire as to how your nonprofit organization can be included on this list for future reference. DeveRoping a Good Working Relationship Many times the clearinghouse, in working a missing persons case, will find itself in the role of coordinator, acting as a liaison between the different involved parties, both public and private. Teamwork and communica\u00ad tion between all parties is vital to ensure a recovery process and prevent mishaps. Developing a good working relationship is crucial. The following guide\u00ad lines are provided to foster a better relationship: Establish if there are areas in which you as a nonprofit service provider can assist the clear\u00ad inghouse. Coordinating activities will not only help to minimize duplication of efforts but pro\u00ad vide a more effective system. The sharing of information among all the professionals involved in a case is imperative. Misinformation or withholding information could cost someone his or her life. Be honest and give all the facts as you know them. Be careful not to jump to conclusions before all the facts are verified. It is also important to understand that there are legal constraints that prohibit law-enforcement and other profes\u00ad sional service agencies from disseminating cer\u00ad tain kinds of information. Do not interfere with the investigation of a law\u00ad enforcement officer. Be sure your independent investigation does not jeopardize the recovery and possibly the life of the missing person. If parents believe that the investigating agency is not doing everything possible, they should con\u00ad tact the state clearinghouse or the next higher authority in that state. It is important to keep in mind that most law-enforcement agencies have limited resources and numerous respon\u00ad sibilities. Generally, law-enforcement profes\u00ad sionals are doing the very best job they can under the circumstances. The relationship between state clearinghouses and nonprofit service providers is an important one. A strong working relationship can greatly enhance the recovery process and provide victims with the best possible services. It is a relationship that should be taken very seriously. 43 8. Legislative Advocacy Linda Barker-Lowrance National Victim Center Our government, established by the United States Constitution, is a government by the people and for the people. Through the ballot process, the people elect local, state, and national representatives to en\u00ad act laws that protect and govern. Unfortunately, many Americans believe that their responsibility ends at the voting booth. Few pay at\u00ad tention to what their elected officials do until, at some point, the voter's life is impacted by the efforts or non-efforts of the legislator. Most citizens have little or no knowledge regarding the process of how to pass legislation or utilize the power of the elected official to benefit their cause. This chapter is designed to help you understand and utilize the legislative process to protect and en\u00ad hance the lives of our country's children. Note: The guidelines included in this chapter are derived from the Victims' Rights Opportunities for Action and Con\u00ad stitutional Amendment for Victims' Rights curricula developed by the National Victim Center. Reprinted with permission. (See also the National Center's pub\u00ad lications Child Protection Priorities in State Legisla\u00ad tion and Selected State Legislation.) Building Coalitions Before you develop a legislative agenda, there are few things you should take into consideration and know about your state legislature. First, if you represent a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization, familiarize your\u00ad self with the federal laws regarding lobbying efforts of nonprofit organizations. There are specific guide\u00ad lines that dictate how much time and money nonprofit organizations may spend lobbying public officials. In an effort to protect their nonprofit status while seek\u00ad ing legislative change, many grassroots organizations have formed statewide coalitions for the express pur-pose of legislative advocacy. You should find out what coalitions currently exist in your state. Working with pre-existing coalitions or forming a new coalition for the purpose of legislative advocacy is not only desirable, but it makes good sense. Coa\u00ad litions help protect the nonprofit statu.s and increase the number of persons working toward the passage of a piece of legislation. For instance, if your orga\u00ad nization has one hundred members supporting a par\u00ad ticular bill, that is effective. If your organization, however, is part of a coalition that has twenty-five agencies, and each agency has one hundred members, you have increased your support of the pending leg\u00ad islation twenty-five time~. Realistically, not every member of every organization is going to work ac\u00ad tively on the legislation, but elected officials know the coalition represents many, while one organization represents far fewer. Numbers are important to poli\u00ad ticians; the more people supporting your effort, the more likely you are to succeed in obtaining your goal. Also, working within the coalition structure equally distributes the duties and responsibilities of a legislative campaign among more than just a hand\u00ad ful of dedicated people. For instance, one agency may be responsible for establishing a \"phone tree\" and insuring that those involved in the legislative effort are kept up to date on the bill's progress through the legislative process. Another agency may be respon\u00ad sible for garnering public support for the measure. Another advantage to working within a coalition is the expansion of resources. Other groups may have cultivated valuable relationships that could prove beneficial to your legislative agenda. Your Legislature and the People in It Each state legislature is unique and functions under its own system of governing. Much of what is dis- 45 cussed in this chapter is applicable to most states. Terminology may differ, but for the most part you will find the information useful regardless of where you live. For instance, the length of legislative sessions dif\u00ad fers from state to state. Some states may have a full\u00ad time legislature that meets year round. Others meet during the first four months of the year, while other state legislatures meet every two years. All legisla\u00ad tures take a break (hiatus), and it is during that time that much of the work on pending legislation is done. The legislative hiatus is the perfect time to con\u00ad tact lawmakers who are potential sponsors of your legislation. Developing a relationship with senators and representatives provides an opportunity to edu\u00ad cate lawmakers on issues pertinent to you. Many leg\u00ad islators offer concerned citizens the opportunity to visit district offices and share their concerns with the legislator. Since it '\" much more difficult to gain the full attention . .;gislator while he or she is in ses- sion, it is be. -tal to take the opportunity to meet with your statt, representatives during this time. Your efforts will be appreciated and remembered when the lawmaker returns for the next session. Once the relationship is established and culti\u00ad vated, your concerns will be given greater consider\u00ad ation when the legislature reconvenes. Also, in the future, you will find that the legislator will seek your opinion and assistance in the passage of other pend\u00ad ing legislation he or she is working on. Remember, do not limit yourself to one lawmaker! Take the time to establish a relationship with a multitude of legis\u00ad lators. The bill with numerous cosponsors has a greater chance of passing and becoming law. After you have met the legislator, meet his or her staff. Each senator and representative maintains an office staff. Frequently, these are the people who will assist in drafting legislation and working the bill through the legislative process. During the hectic leg\u00ad islative session, it is the office staff that will see that your concerns regarding the progress of the bill are shared with the legislator. Use the \"quiet time\" while the legislature is ad\u00ad journed to meet and familiarize staff members with your concerns and any legislation for which you are seeking support. Their knowledge and experiences are valuable to your legislative agenda. A good rela\u00ad tionship with staff members will increase accessibility to individual legislators. When seeking bill authors, identify the most powerful legislative member. Occasionally, a newly elected legisla.tor will take the state capitol by storm, quickly gaining power and support. Most often, how\u00ad ever, power is determined by the majority party in each house. Clearly, the party with the majority mem\u00ad bers is the most powerful, but do not ignore the mi- 46 nority members. A bipartisan bill (cosponsors from both political parties) increases the bill's chance of passage more than a bill that is favored by one polit\u00ad ical party. It is also important to know the length of terms served by the members of both houses and when they are up for reelection. A politician that knows he or she is going to have to face constituents in an upcom~ ing election will be looking for legislation to sponsor that will accomplish great good and also appeal to voters in their districts. Child-related bills achieve both ends. How many times have you said, \"There ought to be a law ... \"? Laws are written and passed as so\u00ad lutions to problems. For instance, crime victims be\u00ad lieve it is their right to be in the courtroom during trial. Defense attorneys, however, often barred their attendance by pleading to the judge that the victim's presence during trial would prejudice the jury. There\u00ad fore, many victims sat outside the courtroom, while inside justice was (or was not) served. The accused, his or her family, and any number of spectators wit\u00ad nessed this process, but the victim was denied the only means of justice offered by the system. Victims were determined to exercise what they believed to be their right to attend court proceedings. To achieve this goal, activists passed laws that provided victims with the right to attend the trial. Many laypersons have little or no knowledge about drafting legislation. A good idea will remain just that-an idea-unless someone drafts the bill in appropriate language. A Good Idea Becomes Law Some legislatures have a legislative counsel office which provides bill drafting services to members, or a member may have a staff person with a legal back\u00ad ground and the ability to draft the legislation. Bills are also written by professional lawyers' associations, law schools, lobbyists, and special interest associa\u00ad tions. It is always helpful to determine if the law you wish to enact has been passed in another state. Model legislation serves as an example, and it can be mod\u00ad ified to fit your state's unique personality. Note: For model legislation and criteria for drafting legislation, see the National Center's publication Selected State Legislation. Once a bill has been drafted, it goes to the state senate or house desk, where it is introduced, assigned a bill number, and read for the first time. After the bill is printed, it is assigned by the senate rules com\u00ad mittee to a standing committee (the committee which assigns bills may vary from state to state). In order to consider the hundreds and sometimes thousands of bills that are introduced during each legislative session, a system of committees exists to analyze and \"weed out\" proposed legislation. Each bill is subject to the scrutiny of a principal policy committee and, if the bill involves an appropriation of money, a fiscal committee. Remember, the process is repeated twice, once in the senate and again in the house of representatives or assembly. The committee system gives you the opportunity to express your views and opinions. A major portion of a policy com\u00ad mittee's responsibilities involves calling for and hear\u00ad ing testimony from those who are concerned with a particular piece of legislation. Familiarize yourself with the legislative committees that typically hear is\u00ad sues that concern or interest you or your group. For example, if you are seeking to change your state's laws regarding the introduction of hearsay evidence in a court of law, that bill would typically be heard by the committee that deals with criminal justice issues. Some states provide legislative committee mem\u00ad bers with staff to research and interpret bills pending in committee and organize hearing schedules. The staff provides a valuable service by keeping those in\u00ad volved informed of the bill's progress, any changes or amendments to the bill, hearing dates, and opposi\u00ad tion-if any-to the legislation. Getting to know committee staff members will increase your bill's chance of receiving a favorable committee vote. How a Bill Becomes Law Many laws are a direct result of the work of concerned citizens who saw a need for change and, instead of lamenting about the ills of society, sought to solve a problem through leg\u00ad islative change. Learning how to pass a bill is not difficult but, without knowledge of the process, it can be confusing. The following process is based upon the California legislature and may differ slightly in other states: 1. A concerned citizen, organization, special in\u00ad terest group, lobbyist, or legislator can suggest potential legislation. This is your initial oppor\u00ad tunity to be involved in the legislative process. Make sure your ideas for legislation are pre\u00ad sented to a legislator. Present your proposition during the interim period prior to the s~ssion or during the session. Allow for time to develop the legislative concept. Offer resources .and plenty of support. It helps if several groups or a coalition of organizations supports the mea\u00ad sure. 2. The senator authors the bill. Often, the bill at this stage is merely a concept written in layper\u00ad son's terms. Offer to help with the wording. Ask for final review if the bill is one you or your group suggested. Remember, be willing to com\u00ad promise if necessary! 3. The legislative counsel drafts the bill. If you have done your work well, the concept of your bill will be developed into an excellent piece of legislation by legal experts. 4. The drafted bill is returned to the senator. At this point, you and the other bill supporters should review the content and context of the bill. If there are any revisions or additions you recommend, inform the legi&lator or key staff assigned to that bill. It can be revised by legis\u00ad lative counsel upon request from the bill's au\u00ad thor. 5. The bill goes to the senate desk where it is in\u00ad troduced, assigned a bill number, and read for the first time. Prior to the bill's introduction, you should alert senators about the bill and its goals. Help the primary author obtain coau\u00ad thors (also known as cosponsors). Make sure all your supporters help out with these tasks. 6. The bill is printed. Once the bill is printed, you can usually obtain a free copy either from the bill author or from the bill room in the capitol. 7. The bill goes to the senate rules committee, where it is assigned to a standing committee. Remember, committee assignments can \"make or break\" your bill. Know the members of your rules committee. Do not hesitate to ask them to assign your bill to the committee where it has the best chance of passing. 8. After thirty-one days, the bill is heard in com\u00ad mittee. Here is where you can have a tremen\u00ad dous impact on the outcome of a bill. Commit\u00ad tee hearings are usually open to the public. 9. The committee may decide to: 1) pass the bill as is; 2) pass it with amendments; or 3) hold the bill in committee (this means the bill hal'; failed). 10. If your bill has an appropriation, it is sent to the standing committee. Here, the committee approves financial consideration of pending leg\u00ad islation. 11. The passed bill is then sent to the senate floor for a second reading. A bill passed \"as is\" is ready and prepared for a third reading on the senate floor. A bill passed with amendments is read, amended, printed with the amendments, and prepared for a third reading on the senate floor. (A bill may also be amended and returned to a committee for further consideration.) This is your \"last chance\" to encourage all senators to vote for or against a bill. Personal contacts\u00ad in person, by telephone, or by letter-are es\u00ad sential here. Make sure all your supporters are working on key members. Obtain a tally of how members think they are going to vote. Confirm your support; work hard to gain the support of undecided members, and focus your remaining 47 resources on getting opponents to support the measure. 12. Bills that survive the second reading are again sent to the senate floor for a third reading. A roll call vote is taken at the third reading. Bills that do not contain any appropriations require a simple majority for passage. Bills with ur\u00ad gency or appropriations clauses attached re\u00ad quire a two-thirds majority. 13. Bills that are passed out of the senate are then delivered to the desk of the house or assembly. The bill follows practically the same process through the second house: 1) introduction and first reading; 2) rules committee assignment; 3) committee hearings; 4) second reading on the house floor; and 5) third reading on the house floor. Likewise, your advocacy efforts should follow the same process you used in the senate. 14. If the bill is passed out of the house on third reading without amendments, it is \"enrolled\" and then sent to the governor for signature. When the bill is enrolled, it is important to ob\u00ad tain the governor's support. Letters of support are vital at this stage. If time is critical, organize a telephone or opinion-gram campaign among the bill's supporters. Ask the bill's authors and principal coauthors to request the governor to sign the bill or to let it become law without his or her signature. 15. If the bill is passed out of the house with amend\u00ad ments, it is considered \"unfinished business.\" The senate can vote to concur in the amend\u00ad ments-this sends the bill to enrollment for the governor's signature-or the senate can refuse concurrence. 16. If the senate refuses concurrence, a conference committee composed of three members from each house reviews the bill. The conference committee can refuse to pass the bill or adopt a two-house conference report which allows the bill to be enrolled and sent to the governor. At this point, your efforts should be focused on the members of the conference committee. Major compromises often take place in conference committees. You must decide how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve passage of the bill. 17. The final version of the bill passed out of both houses is then sent to the governor. The gover\u00ad nor has twelve days to sign the bill. If the bill is of major public interest, ask for a \"bill signing\" ceremony. These events provide great public awareness opportunities for the author, princi\u00ad pal coauthors, and all the victims and advocates who worked to make the passage of the bill a reality. The governor could also approve the bill without signing it or may veto the bill. 48 18. If the governor vetoes the bill, a two-thirds vote in both houses is required to override the veto. It is never easy to override a veto, especially if the governor is popular or a member of the majority party in either house. But you have come this far; do not ever give up! 19. A bill which is signed, approved without sig\u00ad nature, or approved by overriding a guberna\u00ad torial veto is then sent to the secretary of state, where it is chaptered into law. 20. Most bills become law on January 1 of the fol\u00ad lowing year. Bills with urgency clauses take ef\u00ad fect immediately. Regardless of the outcome of your bill, it is important to thank the people who worked the bilI through the legislature. Now is the time to regroup, restrategize, and start planning your legislative agenda for the next session. It is also important at this stage to work and insure that the intent of the law is followed. Get in touch with the agencies or individuals that will enact the new law. Offer your resources and assistance. Make sure the law is enforced or implemented in accordance with its intent and purpose. Contacting Your Legislators Legislators may be contacted by telephone, letter, or personal visits either to their capitol or district offices. The following guidelines offer general tips and proper etiquette for contacting elected officials. Always treat him or her as you would like to be treated. Understand the pressures and constraints that affect your legislators. Recognize that different people have different opinions. Be willing to compromise. ,Avoid contacting your legislators only when you need something. Offer your services, or those of your organiza- tion, as resources. Be rp.alistic in your expectations. Do hot hesitate to commend your legislators. Be knowledgeable. Make certain your information is factual. Always \"give credit where credit is due.\" Never pester your legislators. Never be confrontational. Our forefathers left us a legacy, our Constitution. By designating a mechanism for the people to gov\u00ad ern-our legislatures-they challenged us to make America better. In order to insure that this country remains free, each American must accept the respon\u00ad sibility of a government for the people and by the people. The legislative process provides us the means with which we can accept the challenge.

President and Chief Executive Officer National Center for Missing and Exploited Children We have reached a pivotal stage in our efforts to serve and protect America's children. It is a time for reflec\u00ad tion upon the tremendous good that has been accom\u00ad plished and a time to look forward to new challenges. It is a time for self-assessment and a time of commit\u00ad ment to greater coordination, cooperation, and team\u00ad work as we strive to do more. Many of our organizations were born at a time of high emotion and intense media spotlight. The early 1980s was a time in which a nation discovered the victimization of its children, a segment of the population referred to in the title of a well-known book of the period as \"hidden victims.\" The names and images of the period were burned into the conscience of an entire country: Adam Walsh, Etan Patz, Yusef Bell and the other missing and murdered children of Atlanta, the victims of John Wayne Gacy in Chicago and Dean Corll in Houston, and many others. And America responded. Federal and state laws were changed, law-en\u00ad forcement and criminal/juvenile justice agencies were trained and sensitized, elected officials and candi\u00ad dates for public office based their campaign strategies on the child victimization issue, the private sector stepped forward eagerly and willingly, and great prog\u00ad ress was made. As with other issues in the public policy arena, however, the emotional peaks are diffi\u00ad cult to sustain. Media shifted its attention to new causes, and nonprofit organizations addressing social ills began to face an era of scarce resources. Our new challenge was to institutionalize the process and programs cre\u00ad ated in a time of high emotion and to build structures and systems which protected children and responded to their victimization as a normal part of doing busi\u00ad ness. It should not require the tragic story of a victim\u00ad ized child to provoke action. Yet, there can be no question that Adam, Etan, Yusef, and countless oth\u00ad ers were the catalysts for a movement and that their legacies are the fundamental changes which have taken place in virtually every city, county, and state. There was national action as well. In 1984 the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was established to serve as a clearinghouse of infor\u00ad mation on missing or exploited children. The Na\u00ad tional Center provides technical assistance to citizens and law-enforcement agencies; offers training pro\u00ad grams to law-enforcement and social service profes\u00ad sionals; distributes photos and descriptions of missing children nationwide; coordinates child protection ef\u00ad forts with the private sector; networks with nonprofit service providers and state clearinghouses; provides information on effective state legislation to ensure the protection of children; and disseminates publications to professionals and the general public. It has been an extraordinary five years. More than 388,000 telephone calls have been handled by our hotline. The photo distribution network has worked with more than 1,200 companies and 30 federal agencies to distribute more than 77,000 missing children's photographs throughout the country. This does not include the millions of photo\u00ad graphs sent out by our large-scale photo distri\u00ad bution partners, such as ADVO-System and the American Gas Association. To date, a total of 130 children have been recovered as a direct result of the use of photo distribution nation\u00ad ally. More than 28,000 law-enforcement and crimi\u00ad nal/juvenile justice personnel in 44 states and Canada have completed the Center's law-en\u00ad forcement training program. There was only one clearinghouse for missing 51 persons when the Center opened. We have helped make it forty-three. The Center has been used as a resource in the recovery of more than 14,000 children. More than 3 million of the Center's award-win\u00ad ning publications dealing with various aspects of the missing and exploited child issue have been distributed. Much has been accomplished, but the challenges are greater than ever. In this era of scarcity, it is essential that we seek new opportunities for collabo\u00ad ration, for information sharing, for joint ventures. Each child-serving organization has unique skills and resources which could be brought to bear on our problems. Let me cite a few examples: 1. Long-Term Missing Children. The NCMEC has more than 4,000 active cases involving children missing for more than two years. The problem of the long-term missing child frustrates Center per\u00ad sonnel, law-enforcement, friends, and family. It is particularly a source of pain and anguish for parents, who must go about their lives without resolving the inevitable doubts, fears, and anger. In many cases involving long-term missing children, the early grief and anxiety felt by par\u00ad ents is replaced by anger, disillusionment, and a sense that nobody cares, nobody is looking. The early glare of the media spotlight dims. Police tend to move on to new and higher priorities. Even the Center, in its role as champion of such children, advocate for parents, and mobilizer and coordinator of law-enforcement and justice sys\u00ad tem response, becomes a symbol of impotence. It is imperative that we reexamine such cases, provide appropriate and meaningful support and information to parents, and access all available methods and techniques for resolution of these cases. We are beginning an effort to develop a data profile, perform aggressive case reviews, work with other organizations, involve school systems in photo distribution and records screen\u00ad ing, keep media attention and publicity high, and promote new and special approaches in working with and supporting the parents of long-term missing children. The solution of some of these long-term cases could be a \"shot in the arm\" for the issue and for our organizations. This team approach could also serve as a case study for how we can work together and collaborate in other ways as well. 2. Counseling/Treatment for Child Victims. The Na\u00ad tional Center has played a key role in increasing 52 sensitivity and awareness of crimes against chil\u00ad dren. It has trained professionals, worked closely with police and prosecutors as successful cases have been made against adult offenders, and campaigned for increased reporting, more ag\u00ad gressive enforcement, and meaningful prosecu\u00ad tion. Yet, there are huge gaps in the United States regarding treatment, follow-up counseling, and therapy for the child victims. Too often, the same justice system which puts offenders away is un\u00ad able to provide assistance for the trauma and long-term burdens of the child victim. Our organizations should act as catalysts to bring attention to the problem. The Center hopes to work with prosecutors and prosecutorial or\u00ad ganizations to develop programs to seek offender resources to pay for the treatment of the victim, including it as an element of a plea bargain, con\u00ad dition of probation, restitution order, and so on. Here again, we must work together and coor\u00ad dinate our efforts. We can tap existing networks of counselors, psychologists, and other appropri\u00ad ate professionals, identifying those willing to as\u00ad sist. 3. Hotline Coordination. The heart of the Center's operation and the key to its effectiveness and impact is its hotline. The Center's management is currently reviewing the hotline, both in terms of operations and technology, and is committed to upgrading and amplifying the importance of the hotline. As we pursue this process, it becomes more im\u00ad perative than ever that we look at the Center's hotline and its relationship with other child-serving hotlines to maximize information sharing and eliminate ser\u00ad vice or information gaps. We are actively exploring linkages with the National Runaway Switchboard and envision similar linkages with other hotlines. There are many other areas and many new op\u00ad portunities. Because of the collective effort of count\u00ad less organizations and caring, dedicated people, American children are safer and smarter than a dec\u00ad ade ago, law-enforcement and the justice system are better prepared and more sensitive to the unique fea\u00ad tures of child victimization cases, laws are better, and the scope of the problem is less hidden. Yet, every day brings new awareness that the progress made has barely scratched the surface. To\u00ad day's challenges seem greater and more formidable than those a decade ago, and look what we hav.e done. More important, imagine what we can do if we can truly work together. We have corne a long way for America's children, but we have only just begun. Appendix Georgia K. Hilgeman, M.A. Vanished Children's Alliance Missing Child Case Procedure 1.
