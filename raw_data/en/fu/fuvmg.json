The underlying principle of traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture is that illness and pain occur when body's Qi (vital energy , also known as Prana in Ayurveda) , cannot flow freely. Qi is the animating force behind all forms of life which can become obstructed due to emotional and Physical stress , poor nutrition , infection or trauma. By inserting ultra fine , sterile (single use only) needles into specific acupuncture points , a traditional acupuncturist seeks to re-establish the free flow of qi to restore balance and trigger the body's natural healing response . What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda means 'science of life' it is a philosophy based on a deep understanding of external truths about the human body , mind and spirit. Ayurveda is the oldest healing system known and it's also the most complete . It's logical common sense approach to health and living is combined with philosophy , psychology and spiritual guidance . Three principle bio-energies known as the doshas exist in all matter and are composed of different combinations of the five elements . Most individuals have a predominant dosha , which then determines the body type and temperament. Ayurveda examines the disturbance of the dosha equilibrium and encourages the body to return its natural state of harmony through diet , lifestyle guidance , marmapuncture , herbal preparations yoga and meditation . During consultation Acuvedic practitioners will examine your tongue , observe your pulse , take notes of your past and current medical history & medications and tailor a treatment plan best suited for your constitution . At The Acuvedic Clinic we work alongside Western Medicine , treating the whole person and not just the condition Because Ayurveda is a complete system of healing, encompassing philosophy, psychology and spirituality as well as a deep understanding of the disease process, it often succeeds where orthodox treatment fails. A unique programme of treatment can be devised for every patient. The approach is never narrowly mechanistic. No two patients, even if they appear to be suffering from the same illness, are the same to an Ayurvedic doctor. Ayurvedic practitioners obey the ancient medical injunction to do no harm. Although the remedies they prescribe are highly effective, none has adverse side effects and are all made from natural substances and are non toxic. No artificial materials or chemicals formulated in a laboratory are used. In order to benefit from Ayurveda, patients do not have to subscribe to the spiritual beliefs on which it is founded. All they need to do is come with an open mind and a genuine wish to be healed. Although still in the process of being fully accepted in the West as an authentic branch of medicine, Ayurveda is presently viewed (albeit with a degree of scepticism) by orthodox practitioners as complementary medicine and clinics are proliferating. It is popular because it works, and it works with, rather than against Western medicine. A complete system of healing With over 40 years of practice, Dr Godagama has acquired immense knowledge, experience and expertise in Ayurveda.
