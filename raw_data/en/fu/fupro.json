Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical medicine, founded in the early part of the twentieth century, renews the origin of Western medicine. But unlike many modern medical practices based on reductionist, materialistic thinking, Steiner's holistic system encompasses a picture of the human being as an entity of body, soul, and spirit. Anthroposophical medicine brings harmony to these different aspects of the human constitution. Victor Bott, MD, offers a comprehensive overview of this remarkable system of medicine. He presents a new approach to understanding various types of diseases, including a discussion on the stages of human development; the roles of organs such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart; specific diseases; and indications about why people become ill. He also discusses the increasing prevalence of cancer and specific phenomena such as the menstrual cycle. This volume will illuminate medical practitioners and therapists who want to learn more about anthroposophical medicine and anyone who would like a deeper understanding of diseases and a key medical approach to dealing with them. This book is a translation from French of La M\u00e9decine Anthroposophique : Un \u00c9largissement de l'art de gu\u00e9rir (3rd ed., Triades, 2003).
