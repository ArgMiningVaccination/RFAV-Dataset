In continuation with the earlier explanation about causative factors, patho-physiology and clinical features have been described in [Apasmara Nidana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Apasmara_Nidana), with another definition provided here in this chapter in greater detail. Specific features of dominance of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) are explained and involvement of exogenous factors is mentioned. Management of apasmara depending on the predominance of [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), influence of agantu (exogenous) factors ghrita, jeevaneeya ghrita, various etc are given. Etiological factors, pathogenesis, features and management of an important disease called atattvabhinivesha (a disease of perversion of intellect) are narrated. Importance of [rasayana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasayana) (rejuvenation) and protection of patient of unmada and apasmara are also emphasized. Keywords: Apasmara, memory, consciousness, epilepsy, atattvabhinivesha, unmada, seizure disorders. Introduction All psychiatric and psycho-somatic diseases find their roots in the two chapters of unmada and apasmara. These diseases are caused by similar etiological factors and both manifest as manasika vikara (psychiatric diseases). Therefore these two chapters are placed in succession. [Manas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Manas) (mind), [buddhi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Buddhi) (intellect), and [smriti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Smriti) (memory) are integral parts combined with [atma](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Atma) (self) in understanding Ayurvedic psychiatry. The series of pathological events that take place to occlude consciousness in heart and loss of memory is distinctive feature of apasmara. As mentioned earlier in [Apasmara Nidana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Apasmara_Nidana), first the aggravation of [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) at somatic level occurs by improper and impure/foul food and excess affliction of negative emotions like worries, passion, fright, anger, grief etc at psychic level. The disease precipitates in the form of paroxysmal attack, then the negative psychological emotions occlude the consciousness at heart and thereafter leading to loss of memory. There is always a possibility of food contamination as a causative factor for epilepsy. A case in point is of endrin-laced taquitos causing seizures in the United States [[1]](#cite_note-1). Balance between [sattva](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sattva), [rajas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rajas) and [tamas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Tamas) is important by avoiding the stressors that precipitate the episode of apasmara. Various animal products like ghee processed with medicinal herbs are utilized for medicine preparation. Atattvabhinivesha is another disease specially mentioned in this chapter. It is termed as the single major disease ,i.e., mahagada, leading to affliction of mind and intellect. Its management is also mentioned in this context. Sanskrit text, Transliteration and English Translation expound the chapter \"Apasmara Chikitsa\"(Management of Epilepsy and other disorders). Thus said Lord 'going away of memory' characterized by black-outs (feeling of entering into darkness) and revolting movements caused by conglomeration of the intellect and the mind. [3] Etiopathology in whom: - The [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)are excessively aggravated and have spread to other sites (vibhranta) due to (habitual) intake of improper/harmful and impure/contaminated food. - In whom, the [sattva](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sattva)(one of the attributes of mind representing purity and consciousness) is suppressed by [rajas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rajas)(attribute of the mind representing energy and dynamism) and [tamas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Tamas)(attribute of the mind representing passivity and ignorance) ; - The heart (site of consciousness) is obscured by aggravated [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha); and - Mind is distressed or annihilated by (affliction of negative emotions like) worry, passion, fright, anger, grief, anxiety etc. [4-5] Pathogenesis and features of pre-ictal phase mentioned factors) [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) located in the vessels (or dhamani, channels that carry nutrients) afflict the heart. Thus person suffers due to bewildered mind.[6] He visualizes non-existent forms (visual hallucinations), falls down, his tongue, eyes and eyebrows become tremulous, saliva discharges from his mouth, his hands and legs are extended / bent.[7] Post-ictal phase of the surge of [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) is over, he wakes up as if he is getting up from sleep (regains consciousness). [8] Types due to separate [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) ( [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)) and due (sannipatika). [8] Features grinding of teeth, frothing from the mouth, and gasping. The patient gets visual hallucinations of objects which are rough, reddish brown or black in color. [9] Apasmara with yellowish froth, body, face and eyes. He gets visual hallucinations of yellow or blood-red objects. He has thirst, hot sensation (sensation of heat), and sees fire all over his surroundings. [10] Apasmara with by whitish froth (from the mouth), body, face and eyes, (feeling of) cold, heaviness due to stiff body. The patient gets hallucinations of white objects and recovers late. [11] Apasmara with mixed features of all [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) dominance is characterized by manifestation of all of above features at the same time. This type of apasmara is incurable. The apasmara, which occurs in emaciated person and in chronic stage, is also incurable. [12] Diagnosis as per frequency of of apasmara once in fifteen days, twelve days or a month. The paroxysm may occur even after a shorter period.[13] mind which are obstructed by [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) shall rouse up or cleared first by strong remedial measures like [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana) (emetic therapy) etc. [14] Paittika apasmara shall [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana) (purgation) therapy and shlaishmika apasmara shall mainly be treated purification is done by all above therapies and well assurance is given, the pacification formulations for relief from apasmara are described henceforth.[16] panchagavya ghee Juice of cow dung, sour curd prepared out of cow's milk, cow's urine in equal quantity and cow's ghee. Indications The medicated ghee shall be taken for treating apasmara, kamala (jaundice) and [jwara](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Jwara).[17] mahapanchagavya ghee be added with two dronas (in the recipe actually one drona is described; it has to be taken double in quantity according to definition) of water, boiled and reduced to one fourth. One aksha [12 gm each prasthas [640 ml] of cow's ghee should be cooked by adding two prasthas of each of the juice of cow-dung, sour curd prepared of cow's milk, cow's milk and cow's urine, This medicated ghee, known as mahapancagavya is like ambrosia in the treatment (of following)[18-22] Indications Apasmara (epilepsy), unmada shvayathu (edema), (piles), pandu (anemia), kamala (jaundice) and halimaka (a serious type of jaundice). This medicated ghee should be used regularly every day to dispel inauspiciousness and evil effects of bad planets. It also cures chaturthaka (quartan) type of shankhapushpi cures unmada, alaksmi (inauspiciousness), apasmara of part) should be cooked by adding (in total) four parts of the urine of bull and goat and the paste of rock salt and asafoetida (l/4th part in total). This medicated ghee cures apasmara (epilepsy), heart diseases and diseases caused by the evil effects of planetary part in total). (Four parts of water should be added according to the general rule, because in present recipe, there is no liquid). This medicated ghee is useful in the treatment of vatika and shlaishmika types actually one prastha is mentioned; double the quantity is taken according to the general rules of definition) of each of oil and cow's ghee should be added with the paste of one pala of each of the ten drugs belonging to jivaniya gana (vide Sutra 4: 9) and two dronas (in the text one drona is prescribed; double the quantity is taken according to general rules of definition) of milk, and cooked. This medicated ghee is an effective recipe for the cure of apasmara (epilepsy). should be added with one kamsa of each of milk and sugarcane juice; sixteen prasthas of the decoction of kasmarya and one karsa of each of the ten drugs belonging to jivaniya group (vide Sutra 4: 9) and cooked. This medicated ghee instantaneously cures epilepsy caused by the decoction of kasha and kusha and the juice of vidari and sugarcane is useful in the treatment of this ailment. [30] ghee should be cooked by adding two dronas of juice of amalaki and two palas of the paste of madhuka. This medicated ghee instantaneously cures the paittika type of apasmara (epilepsy). [31] Drugs for external application | |||| with four times of goat-urine is useful for massage for a patient suffering from epilepsy. Such a patient should use cow-dung for the purpose of unction and cow's urine for the purpose of snana (bath).[32] (Sesame) oil (one part) should be cooked with (goat's) urine (one part) and the decoction of the barks of katabhi, nimba, katvanga and madhushigru (three parts). This medicated oil is very effective for massage.[33] Prepare siddha birds according to their availability.[35] Sesame oil should be cooked by adding four times of goat's urine and the paste (1/4th of the oil) of the drugs. This medicated oil is very effective in curing apasmara (epilepsy). The above mentioned drugs (ingredients prescribed to be used as paste) should also be used for dhupana (fumigation) and pralepana (external application in paste form) (for curing patients suffering from epilepsy).[36] bones, nails and ribs of the dog should be made to a paste by triturating with goat's urine in the constellation of pusya (8th nakshatra, or constellation, per Vedic astrology). Use of this for pradeha (external application in the form of thick paste) and adding (cow's or goat's) urine and made to a paste. This should be used as unction (for the treatment of epilepsy). The body of the patient should be sprinkled with the urine (of cow or goat).[39] Different unction done with the help of the following: - stool of leeches; - ashes of the small hair of the goat. - ashes of the bone of ass; - ashes of the nails of elephant; and - ashes of the hair in the tail of the cow. [40] Drugs for [nasya](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Nasya) urine of cow having reddish brown (kapila) color is extremely useful for the cure of epilepsy. Similarly, inhalation of the urine of the dog, jackal, cat, lion etc., is useful in this condition. [41] | |||| cow's urine. Inhalation of five or six drops of the foregoing three recipes is useful (in the treatment should be cooked with goat's urine (four parts) and the (One fourth part in total). Inhalation of this medicated oil cures apasmara administered in the form of pradhamana [nasya](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Nasya) (in which powders of drugs are blown into the nostrils of the patient.) This is an excellent recipe (for curing epilepsy).[45] Medicated to a paste by triturating with goat's urine. From out of this paste, vartis (elongated pills/wicks) should be prepared. [46] Application of this thin paste (prepared by rubbing with water) in the eyes (as collyrium) works like ambrosia in (curing) apasmara (epilepsy), unmada (insanity), snake-bite, Afflictions by poisonous beverages, internal poisonings and to regain consciousness after drowning a paste by triturating in urines of goat, sheep and bull. From this paste, vartis (elongated pills) should be prepared. (These vartis should be rubbed over a stone by adding water, and the thin paste, thus obtained, should be used as collyrium). This is used in treatment of apasmara (epilepsy), kilasa (a type of leucoderma), be used as collyrium for the cure of apasmara (epilepsy). This (bile) mixed with ghee should be used for fumigation which is excellent (for curing of epilepsy), the physician should give fumigation therapy with the help of the beaks, feather and stool of mongoose, owl, cat, vulture, kita (scorpion etc), snake and crow. [51] Effects [] the help of these therapies, the heart of the patient gets stimulated and the channels get cleansed as a result of which the patient regains consciousness.[52] Treatment of epilepsy, exogenous factors are secondarily involved and in such cases signs and symptoms are manifested over and above those of the [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) (endogenous factors). Such patients should be treated on the lines suggested for exogenous types of unmada (insanity) (refer to Chapter 9 of this section, i.e., [Unmada Chikitsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Unmada_Chikitsa)).[53]. Mahagada chikitsa (management of Lord! In [Sutra Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) (Sutra 19 : 3) you have mentioned in brief as a mahagada (grave disease), that is atattvabhinivesha (pervaded by false principles ). But its etiology, signs and symptoms and treatment are not described there. I want to hear these descriptions. Kindly narrate them in the present context\".[54-55] Having heard this, Lord Punarvasu addressed his disciple who was desirous of hearing and said, \"My child, hear about this mahagada (grave disease) along with its etiology, signs and symptoms and treatment\". [56] Etiopathology and clinical features of atattvabhinivesha | is indulged in habitual intake of impure food, due to suppression of manifested natural urges, excessive intake of cold, hot, unctuous, un-unctuous food (incompatible food with contradictory properties) etc, the (vitiated) [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) afflict channels of mind and intellect and abide into heart. The [rajas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rajas) (one of the attributes of the mind) and moha or [tamas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Tamas) (another attribute of mind), occlude the person's self. Excessively aggravated [rajas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rajas) and [tamas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Tamas) cover mind and intellect, disturbing the functions of heart, making the person stupid and mentally weak. This leads to improper judgment regarding eternal and ephemeral events and wholesome and unwholesome objects. The expert physicians call this mahagada (grave disease) as atattvabhinivesha. [57- 60] Management of shall be treated with oleation and fomentation therapies followed by purification therapies like therapeutic emesis etc. Then after doing samsarjana krama (observing specific dietary regimen after purification), diet and drinks which are promoters of intellect should be administered. Juice of brahmi mixed with panchagavya ghrita described above (refer to verses 16-17) should be administered. Similarly, other medhya [rasayanas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasayana) (promoters of intellect) like shankhapushpi should be given. [61- 62] Friends, sympathizers, preceptors preaching religious sermons, philosophers should inculcate into him knowledge, understanding, patience, memory and the power of meditation. [63] Following medicines shall be administered: - garlic with oil; - shatavari with milk; - juice of brahmi with honey; - juice or decoction of kushtha with honey; and - powder of disease apasmara is resistant to conventional modes of treatment, if it is chronic and if it has acquired a firm footing, then it should be generally treated with the foregoing recipes of rejuvenating drugs. [65] Protection of patients and suffering from apasmara and unmada, should be specially protected from water, fire, trees, mountains and uneven places. These may cause instantaneous death of the patient.[66] - | |||| the mode of vitiation of [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha); - signs and symptoms in general and of different varieties of epilepsy; - treatment of different types of epilepsy; and - etiology, signs and symptoms of mahagada (grave disease). Thus, in this chapter, the sage has described treatment of apasmara, in brief as well as in detail as above said.[68] Thus, ends the tenth Chapter dealing with the treatment of apasmara in the section on therapeutics of Agnivesha's work as redacted by Charak, and not being available, restored by Dridhabala. [69] Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) - Apasmara is a disease in which faculties of mind like memory/consciousness, intellect and purest quality of mind are afflicted. - Diet plays significant role in pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases. - Improper and impure diet is considered to affect mental functions adversely leading to formation of background for disease. The dietary causative factors may act on gut-brain axis to affect the neuro-pathology in case of psychiatric diseases like apasmara. - When this afflicted person is confronted with distressful adverse situation including negative emotions like worries, passion, fright, anger, grief, anxieties, he suffers from apasmara. - The pathophysiology clearly indicates role of somatic imbalances and psychic disturbances as sequential events. The inter-communication between physical entities and psychological entities is very important for continuation of health. Consciousness flows through this co-ordination to make a person alive. Therefore, when this co-ordination is disturbed, it presents as disturbance of psychological faculties. The pathology of apasmara starts with vitiated [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)and ends into bewildered state of mind. - Heart (center of consciousness and emotional intelligence) and brain (center of memory and logical intelligence) together form manovaha srotas (functional system of mind). The co-ordination of these two centers is important for normal functioning of mind. If this is afflicted, it leads to psychiatric diseases. - Removal of obstruction of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)in the heart-brain connection, channels and mind by strong purification therapies is management principle of apasmara. are specific therapies. - Ashwasana (assurance therapy) and psychological counseling are advised to remove psychological stressors that provoke apasmara vega(episode). Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences ) The first principle of [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) states that life is continuum of healthy coordination between body, mind, soul and sensory-motor organs. [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) considers the mind and body work in symbiotic relationship with each other. When one is affected, other is also affected. Both are emphasized as abode for sensation of pain. The mind and body can't be separated in water tight compartment. Relation between diet, [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) specificity and apasmara Role of pure diet is important, because it nourishes mind, enriches senses and motor organs. The Panchakosha theory of Yoga states that the sheath of mind (manomaya kosha) is nourished through sheath of food (annamaya kosha) only. Therefore, following proper, pure diet and dietary habits is necessary for preventing psychiatric disorders. The physical [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) like [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) are assigned certain psychological functions also. Their rise and accumulation takes place at different stage after taking food. Therefore, the type of disease depending upon type of dominant [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), evoked due to dominant diet specific to a particular [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). Apasmara is also caused due to vitiation of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) owing to improper diet. This clarifies link between diet, [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), mental functions, memory and consciousness. Memory and consciousness The profound relation between memory and consciousness is clearly indicated in apasmara. In [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda), memory is termed as fundamental knowledge based upon experiences acquired through sense and motor organs. In psychology, memory is the mental capacity with which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Consciousness is the state of awareness of internal events and external environment. [[2]](#cite_note-2) In apasmara, consciousness is affected leading to transient loss of memory. The forbearance of mind is based upon intellect (dhi) and pure quality of mind (sattva). Dhi discriminates between right and wrong things. [Sattva](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sattva) is pure quality that might be named as \"mental immunity\" which protects mind in all adverse conditions. In apasmara, both the intellect and pure quality of mind are afflicted leading to poor forbearance. Brain and heart connection Neurocardiology Heart (cardiac region) has been considered as site of consciousness and emotions. The heart in context of apasmara is essentially meant by the abode of consciousness and it doesn't signify anatomical heart. This is functional heart which is involved in emotions, feelings of the self. Brain (head region) is considered as origin of all sensory and motor organs. The term dhamani has been used to denote abode of aggravated [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). This literally means the artery, vein, nerves which carry impulses. This is very important as it channelizes consciousness from site of consciousness i.e. heart to site of intelligence i.e. brain. This canal of heart-brain connection is manovaha srotas. The brain and heart work in co-ordination with each other for maintaining equilibrium between logical intelligence and emotional intelligence. If these are hampered, the consciousness, memory, sensory and motor co-ordination as well as emotional behavior will be affected. This establishes the theory that disturbance in cardiac functions can result into neurological disorders. The heart-brain connection has been authenticated by many researches on neuro-cardiology. [[3]](#cite_note-3) The theory of heart-brain connection has been well known to [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) scholars in context of apasmara. Signs and symptoms of apasmara Transient nervous system collapse of a person which leads to various signs and symptoms enlisted in the verses 7 to 13. The cluster describes features of paroxysmal stage of apasmara. The features include somatic as well as psychological subjective symptoms experienced by patients self. The dreams specific to predominance of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) can be important measures for diagnosis of predominance of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). The symptomatology has been described elaborately of [Apasmara Nidana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Apasmara_Nidana). Gut-brain connection in apasmara Gut-brain dysfunction is proved to play role in many psychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, autism, schizophrenia. [[4]](#cite_note-4) The figure shows physiology of gut-brain connection. As discussed earlier in [Apasmara Nidana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Apasmara_Nidana), many of the somatic symptoms are related with the dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract.Therefore the possibility of gut-brain dysfunction cannot be denied. Similarly, as seen above, many of the animal products like medicines formulated with cow's urine, cow's ghee, goat urine that are rich in micro-organisms are enlisted in management of apasmara. The exact pharmaco-dynamic behind action of these medicines in management of apasmara with focus on gut-brain axis needs to be investigated. Etio-Pathogenesis of Atattvabhinivesha The grave disease atattvabhinivesha is considered as affliction of discrimination power of intellect leading to severe perversion of mental functions. The pathophysiology includes affliction of mind and intellect simultaneously. Therefore this disease comprises disturbance of mind and intellectual functioning. Decisive and discriminative power of the afflicted person is completely lost. This leads to improper judgment regarding eternal and ephemeral events and wholesome and unwholesome objects. Coordination of mind, intellect, sense-motor organs is disturbed. Patho-physiology of atattvabhinivesha Differential diagnosis The diseases with convulsive movements of the body and loss of memory can be considered for differential diagnosis for apasmara. Though apasmara is a manasa vikara, the diseases with presentation of kampa(tremors), gatra vikshepa (abnormal body movements), vepathu(trembling), etc in the form of paroxysms can be thought of for discussion under differential diagnosis. They include akshepaka (vata vyadhi), dandaka vata vyadhi in [Vatavyadhi Chikitsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vatavyadhi_Chikitsa), characterized by repeated convulsive movements of body when vitiated vata affects muscles and tendons of hands and legs. (Verses 51, 52) Dandaka is denoted in the same context as stambha (stiffness) manifested in pani (hands), pada (legs), shira (head), prishtha (back) and shroni (pelvis) making body stiff like wooden log. (verse52) Ardita caused when [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu) does upashoshana (dries up) of bahu (arm), pada (leg) and janu (knees), is characterized by vakrata (curved) of mukhardha bhaga (half face) and also shareerardha (torso). The attacks of ardita do not include convulsions as presenting feature. (Verses 38 to 42) Apatanaka is also a disease caused by vitiated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) either independently or due to avarana (obstruction) caused by [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) characteristically manifests with frequent unconsciousness, antarayama (forward bending of the body) and bahirayama (backward bending of the body). Because of this bending the disease is otherwise known as dhanustambha. (Verses 43 to 48) Vepathu or kampa vata are characterized by kampa (tremor) of either single part/multiple parts/entire body. In any of the above explained conditions either the involvement of hridaya (heart) or [manas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Manas)(mind) are not specified. Hence they implicate more of neurological pathology rather than psychological disorder. Apatantraka , explained in [Trimarmiya Siddhi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Trimarmiya_Siddhi)(verses 12 to 15), is very similar to the description of apasmara here in its clinical presentation. Avarana of hridaya by [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) lead to paroxysm of the vyadhi with pain in shira, shankha body bending like a bow, akshepa (convulsions), dyspnea, hoarse expiratory cry like that of a pigeon, unconsciousness, etc. Once the avarana to hridaya by the [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) is clear the person looks healthy. Apatantraka is a hridaya marmashrita vyadhi which indicates variation in emotional intelligence of the person. The theory of neuro-cardiology differentiates apatantraka from apasmara the latter being a disorder (smriti budhi sattva to loss of [smriti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Smriti) (power of recollection), [buddhi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Buddhi) vyapoha (declining of logical and analytical understanding). The person becomes moodha (stupid). This holds appropriate to say \"the loss of logical intelligence in the person\". Management of apasmara The holistic management of apasmara includes three stages as discussed below: I. Purification therapies Apasmara is to be treated with strong elimination therapies like [Panchakarma](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Panchakarma). The strength here directs towards deeper level of penetrability of the therapies to remove the toxins from micro-channels. Important pathological milestone is occlusion of consciousness. Therefore to remove obstruction at heart (site of consciousness), channels of heart-brain connection, and mind is the treatment objective. [Vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) dominant apasmara is to be treated with medicated enema, [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) dominant with purgation therapies and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant with therapeutic emesis. Role of these purification treatments like [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana), etc. in normalizing functioning of heart (consciousness mechanism and emotional intelligence), heart-brain connection, and mental functions is important to be studied. This may prove a major breakthrough in prevention and management of psychiatric disorders. The changes in memory/awareness level, mind functioning, emotional quotient, improvement in forbearance power are bio-markers for the assessment. II. Assurance and consolation therapies The episodes of apasmara occur on exposure of distressful events or psychological trauma due to negative emotions like worries, passion, fright, anger, grief, anxieties etc. This indicates poor emotional quotient. Affliction of mental [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) like [[[rajas]] and [tamas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Tamas) also need to be corrected basically. Therefore it is important to improve the emotional intelligence through positive training and programming of mind and brain to cope with the adverse situation. If the mental immunity is good, then apasmara episode will not occur, even if, the bodily [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Doshas&action=edit&redlink=1) are aggravated. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), REBT (Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy) can be useful supportive treatments for management of apasmara to reduce frequency of episodes as well as effective management of disorder. III. Pacification (shamana) therapy After purification and consolation therapies are done, various formulations useful in treatment of apasmara have been enlisted. If we see the general medicines prescribed by Charak, all of the formulations are either ghee based or oil based formulations. Ghee is considered as best vehicle for management of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)- [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) dominant disorders. Oil is the best for [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)- [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant disorders. Ghee has been proved to be effective in treatment of many neurological disorders owing to its capacity of maintaining cellular integrity. The animal products like ghee, urine, bile are used in most of the formulations. Cow's ghee and goat's urine is widely used as processing media for formulations. The route of administration is [nasya](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Nasya) (nasal drug delivery), anjana (for intra-ocular drug delivery through conjunctivae), and dhupana (fumigation). The properties of drugs used are mainly pungent to ensure higher penetrability in lower dosages. The possibility of crossing blood brain barrier with these routes might be higher for the herbs used in apasmara treatment.
