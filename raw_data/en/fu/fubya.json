Our goal is to connect our youth with culturally based self-esteem activities that support wellness through cultural events, such as pow-wows, sweat lodge ceremonies, Indigenous arts and crafts, healing talking circles, and Universal Intertribal gatherings and cultural functions. We also support our youth within their educational path in life from grade school to college as our youth will be our future generations in Indian Country. Good Medicine- Youth Dance/Drum Group SDAIHC Wellness team supports the youth with Intertribal Native American Powwow dancing and drumming as prevention and early intervention. The youth will be instructed with traditional protocol and etiquette of how to carry themselves during dancing and singing within the circle of life. Generation Red Road Youth Curriculum The Generation Red Road Youth Curriculum consists of Indigenous culturally evidenced-based practices for healing historical trauma and intergenerational trauma in Native American communities. The curriculum-driven programs braid Prevention, and Early Intervention, focused on substance use disorders, suicide prevention, mental wellbeing, and healing through traditionally based activities such as our Generation Red Road Talking Circle, where youth can partake in being in balance spiritually mentally, emotionally, and physically.

The groups utilized are \"Let's Get Crafty\" and Art class in person and on virtual platforms.

Youth Intertribal Council We empower our youth to step up and use their voices to learn how to advocate for themselves, their families, and their communities. By uplifting our youth and including them in the significant matters that Native Americans face in Urban communities and Indian Country, our youth will be able to support our people as they are our future generations and will transition into leaders in our communities and Nations. The age of our youth council will be 18-24. Youth and Elder Mentorship The SDAIHC Wellness team promotes bonding with our Youth and Elders through cooking, learning, playing sports, mentorship, and cultural teachings. The youth will also bond with our Elders and strengthen honoring our Elders in a good way by building relationships and learning from our Wisdom Keepers. Indigenous Storytelling The Wellness team at SDAIHC would like to honor our elders and adults passing on Indigenous Oral Tradition through storytelling to our youth. The youth will learn about Native American history that may be dismissed. We do not blame our past; however, we must acknowledge it for healing. Storytelling will provide bonding with our youth and pass on cultural teachings and stories to uplift our youth and help them walk in a good way with mind, body, and spirit. Let's keep our traditions alive for our future generations!
