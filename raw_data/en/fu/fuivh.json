The law enabled the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to develop a pediatric palliative care pilot program for children eligible for full-scope Medi -Cal to be delivered concurrently with curative care and regardless of the child's life expectancy. Calif ornia's pediatric palliative care initiative was implemented through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \u00a71915(c) waiver option, which allow s states to explore the provision of long -term care services in both home - and community -based settin gs. The waiver program encourages testing of innovative strategies to reduce the need for costly institution - based care and to increase quality of care and life through more extensive care coordination and therapeutic services. In line with these goals, DH CS designed the Pediatric Palliative Care Waiver to improve the quality of life for child ren and their famil ies through the provision of supportive home -based services , and to minimize hospital ization and length of stay through the use of community -based care . A three -year pilot program, known as Partners for Children (PFC), was approved in 2008 and the first children were enrolled in January 2010. The s tate contracted with the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research (UCLA) to provide an independent evaluation of the operational, financial, clinical, and humanistic outcomes of the waiver. Findings The findings presented in this report are based on claims and quality assurance data provided to UCLA by DHCS from 2007 through 2 012, as well as data UCLA collected from surveys of families and providers who participated in PFC. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Executive Summary 8 Operational DHCS served as the administrative authority over PFC and the primary waiver liaison with CMS. Quality assurance activities included onsite program compliance reviews, level -of-care (LOC) determination reviews, health and welfare assessment reviews, comprehensive care plan reviews, provider qualification reviews, and financial audits. Over the three -year course of the program, DHCS identified a number of deficiencies, most frequently pertaining to the LOC determination component. Care plans were another source of deficiency. DHCS staff attempted to prevent deficiencies and address exist ing ones by providing technical assistance and training, review ing corrected care plans and LOC forms, and clarif ying program polic ies through official program notices. The percentage of enrollees using PFC services was used as an indication of engagement with the program. Expressive therapies, including m usic, massage, and art therapies , were all utilized by at least 40% of enrollees. Less utilized services included pain and symptom management, home respite, and play therapy. Over the three -year pilot peri od, 151 children enrolled in PFC. The average enrollment duration was about 11 months (328 days).1 Of the 151 total enrollees, 132 spent at least 60 days in the program and were included in the cost analyses. E nrollees were most likely to be male and Latin o. The most frequent primary diagnoses included neurologic conditions and cancers. Financial Comparing the health care costs of enrollees in the two years leading up to enrollment with costs while enroll ed demonstrated substantial savings, including: Mean reduction of $3,331 per enrollee per month ( PEPM ) based on paid claims analysis . This reduction was driven by a major decrease in inpatient care costs of $4,897 PEPM , an indication of the success of PFC in providing home - and community -based services instead of costly hospital -based care. Mean reduction of $3,133 PEPM when including the estimated unpaid claims related to program services. Mean reduction of $2,15 4 PEPM when i ncluding the estimated unpaid claims and administrative costs of the pilot. Return on investment of $2.20 for every dollar spent on PFC ($1.20 when including unpaid claims and administrative costs) . Nearly $7 million in health care costs avoided as a result of PFCs bending of the cost trend from two years prior to enrollment through the pilot period. 1 This includes time from enrollment to disenrollment as well as time from enrollment to the end of the study period for individuals who remained enrolled in the pilot when it ended in December 2012. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Wa iver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Executive Summary 9 Estimated p otential savings of more than $12 million if PFC enrollment were to increase to 200 participants and continue for another three years. A difference -in-differences approach comparing pre -post enrollee costs to pre -post costs o f a control group with similar disease severity would have been ideal, but PFC enrollees proved to be a unique group for which a comparable set of children could not be identified. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the savings shown in the pre -post analysis su ggests that PFC was financially successful. Utilization Utilization measures also demonstrate PFC's success, including: A nearly 50% reduction in the number of inpatient days PEPM from 4.2 prior to enrollment to 2.3 during the pilot period. A major decrease in the average length of stay for each hospitalization, from 16.7 days pre-enrollment to 6.5 days during the pilot period. Overall increase in the number of outpatient visits PEPM from 35 to 39, an indication of improved care coordination and the substitution of hospitalizations with outpatient and home -based care. Small reductions in emergency department use, from 0.23 PEPM to 0.20 PEPM , and ED visits leading to hospitalizations, from 0.15 PEPM to 0.12 PEPM . Humanistic Providers were largely satis fied with PFC overall , though satisfaction varied by provider type and numerous barriers to care provision were reported . California Children's Services nurse liaisons (CCSNLs) , who were responsible for the authoriz ation of all services at the county level , demonstrated greater satisfaction than h ospice and home health agencies , which were the main providers of home -based care . All of the CCSNLs and agency/hospice providers believed that PFC services were helpful in reducing family stress and worry, and increasing family confidence about their ability to care for their child. Referring physicians were generally positive about PFC, but a broader survey of California Children's Services ( CCS) paneled physicians in counties participating in PFC suggested that program visibility was a problem and may have been a barrier to program referral. Nearly two - thirds of physician respondents reported no familiarity with PFC. In addition to the widespread lack of knowledge, physicians reported the following barriers to care: Patient/family perceived stigma associated with palliative care Family unwillingness to participate Physician uncertainty about the most beneficial plan of action California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Executive Summary 10 Burdensome paperwork Belief that PFC participation interferes with curative care CCSNLs echoed some of these barriers, including stigma, incorrect referral by physicians due to lack of knowledge of program eligibility requirements, and paperwork. Further perceived barriers to c are once enrolled in the program included family inability to acknowledge the life - threatening nature of their child's illness, conflict among family members about treatment goals, agency staff shortages, and communication problems based on language differ ences. The most pervasive barrier for hospice/home health agencies was the low reimbursement rate for many PFC services . This issue may have been partially ameliorated for the future by the consideration in December 2012 of a roughly $300 PEPM increase in service reimbursement f or participating agencies. Satisfaction among family member caregivers was consistently high. Caregivers reported that PFC services were helpful in reducing or controlling their child's pain and other symptoms. Participation in the program also helped reduce caregivers' trouble sleeping and feeling worried about their ability to manage their child' s health. All 50 surveyed caregivers said they would recommend PFC to a family member or friend who had a child with a life -limiting condition. Conclusions and Recommendations UCLA's evaluation of th is program demonstrates positiv e results in achieving the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim of improved care, better health, and lower costs. (1) Analysis of the three -year PFC pilot suggests that California's Pediatric Palliati ve Care Waiver demonstrated a cost -effective way to provide home -based palliative care to children with life - threatening conditions that was satisfying to most enrollees' primary caregivers and their health care providers. PFC enrollment led to health care cost savings of $ 3,331 PEPM on paid claims , and overall savings of $2,154 PEPM when including all estimated administrative costs of the pilot . The lack of a comparison group makes it difficult to eliminate other possible explanations for these cost savings, but an examination of the source of the cost savings speaks directly to the goals of PFC. Most of the savings were the result of the dramat ic decrease in inpatient and a relatively smaller increase in outpatient costs. This major shift - from costly inpatient care to more coordinated and less expensive outpatient care - is the result of PFC's home -based care model. Overall savings totaled nea rly $7 million, an indication of the potential continued cost effectiveness if PFC were to expand to more counties and eventually statewide. Beyond its financial success, PFC achieved important utilization changes and received high satisfaction scores from caregivers, who reported improvements in their children's pain and other symptoms as well as their own experience and quality of life. PFC p roviders also expressed widespread satisfaction, though their concerns highlight important areas for California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Executive Summary 11 improvement moving forward. Concerns about reimbursement rates among hospice and home health agencies would be particularly important if enrollment in PFC increases. The lack of knowledge about PFC among prospective referring physicians is a concern and underscores the importance of increasing program visibility. Based on these issues, UCLA offers the following recommendations: Assess continuously the financial viability of providing services to PFC enrollees for hospice and home health agencies to ensure a sufficient supply of providers. This w ill be particularly important if enrollment in PFC increases. Increase the visibility of PFC among prospective referring providers to increase enrollment . Grow operational capacity and strategy to match program expansion. This c an be achieved by build ing on existing partnerships and develop new ones among the state and county CCS programs, specialty care centers, other medical and community services, and hospice and home health agencies. Shar e best practices among program partne rs to seek ways to simplif y referral protocols across medical settings and enrollment procedures at the county level. Assess enrollment processes and procedures to minimize the time between referral and enrollment. Support providers in educating families to reduce perceived barriers to enrollment and receipt of services. PFC gained program status and was extended for five years, to 2017, at the end of the pilot period. As the program grows to include more providers and enrollees, operational capacity and s trategy must grow with it. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC ) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 12 Introduction According to t he Institute of Medicine , pediatric palliative care seeks to relieve symptoms associated with a serious medical condition or its treatment , and to enhance the quality of life for children and their families by addressing their unique psychological, social , and spiritual needs. (2) Based on a similar definition, t he American Academy of Pediatrics recommend ed in 2000 that pediatric palliative care begin upon the diagnosis of a child's life -threatening condition and continue for the duration of the disease , alongsid e curative care or life -saving treatment. (3) Children ages zero through 20 have age -specific diseases, and consequently have age -specific treatment goals and needs. From the time of diagnosis with a life -threatening disea se and as a supplement to clinical treatment, pediatric palliative care provides children with holistic care that considers every aspect of the effect the diagnosis will have on the child's and family's physical, psychological, and spiritual health. (4) For the child, palliative care may include pain and symptom management resulting from disease and treatment side effects, and child life counseling and expressive therapies that provide the child with coping mechanisms and tools for self -expression. For the family, palliative care may include training on how to navigate the health care system, make the best treatment decisio ns, provide optimal care for their child, and bereavement counseling before and after the passing of a child. Having the option to continue palliative care during treatment can alleviate the pain and side effects that a child may have to endure during cont inued treatment and also reduces the dilemma parents face when weighing treatment and the pain of their child. (2) Pedi atric Palliative Care Waiver Background In response to the need for comprehensive pediatric palliative care, California passed the Nick Snow Children's Hospice and Palliative Care Act (AB 1745) in 2006. The law enabled DHCS to develop a pediatric palliativ e care pilot program offering hospice -like services for children eligible for full-scope Medi -Cal to be delivered concurrently with curative care and regardless of the child's life expectancy. The last feature was a departure from the federal Medica re stipulation that pediatric hospice care only be covered during the last six months of life. California's pediatric palliative care initiative was implemented through the CMS \u00a71915(c) waiver option, which allow s states to explore provision of long -term car e services in home - and community -based settings. The CMS waiver encourages testing of innovative strategies to reduce the need for costly institution -based care and to increase quality of care and life through more extensive care coordination and therapeu tic services. In line with these goals, DHCS designed the Pediatric Palliative Care Waiver to improve the quality of life for child ren and their famil ies through the provision of supportive home -based services , and to minimize California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 13 hospital stays through the us e of community -based care . A three -year pilot program, known as Partners for Children (PFC), was approved in 2008 and the first children were enrolled in January 2010. In the interceding years, numerous other initiatives made portions of concurrent care s tandard for children with life -threatening conditions. In 2007, children enrolled in the CCS program became eligible for case management to integrate curative and palliative care ( though not for all of the therapeutic and counseling services covered by PFC ). On a federal level, the Concurrent Care for Children Requirement (CCCR Section 2302) of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) cemented in law concurrent pediatric and curative care for ill children, thus sparing families the difficul t choice to forego all curative treatment before receiving hospice benefits. Despite these developments, PFC retained unique characteristics that are still not in place in all state Medicaid programs. Perhaps most notably, the ACA did not change Medicaid's stipulation that children have no more than six months to live before gaining eligibility for palliative care benefits. PFC provide d access to comprehensive in -home palliative care services as early as at the time of diagnosis and throughout the course of the disease as long as the child met the necessary level of care (described below) . The program wa s a collaboration among DHCS' CCS program at the state and county levels, special ty care centers where children receive curative treatment, and local licensed private home health agencies, hospices or contracted agencies that decided to voluntarily participate in the prog ram. Eleven counties participated in PFC. Five - Alameda, Monterey, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and San Diego - joined in the first year of the program (2010). Four others - Marin, Orange, San Francisco, and Sonoma - were added in the second year (2011). Los Angeles and Fresno counties joined in 2012, the third and final yea r of the pilot program. On December 28, 2012, CMS granted PFC a five -year extension that allows the program to continue through March 2017. However, this report covers the pilot period only, from January 2010 t hrough December 2012. Covered services PFC provide d the following palliative care services: 1) Comprehensive care coordination . 2) Expressive therapies , including art, music, play , and massage for the child . 3) Family education, including instruction on providing care and operatin g medical equipment. 4) Respite care in and out of the home to provide needed rest for the primary caregivers . 5) Family counseling and bereavement counseling . California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 14 6) Pain and symptom management. Participating hospice and home health agencies also operated 24/7 on -call nursing support services t o provid e advice on urgent care questions and to further facilitate access to care . Where applicable, these services were available to a denominated \"family unit,\" which varied by the individual case and could include parents, legal guardians, siblings, an d significant others. Care coordination Each child and family w as assigned a care coordinator and a multidisciplinary team of providers at the contracted care agency. Within 48 hours of a child's assignment to an agency, t he care coordinator contacted the child and family to start developing the Family -Centered Action Plan (F-CAP) , a comprehensive care plan that highlight ed each child's and family's needs and desires . F-CAPs were to be completed within 14 days and were one of the waiver's main tools in limiting the need for hospitalizations while improving quality of life . They allow ed the care coordinator to manage most aspects of the child's care with the child's and family's self -reported needs in mind, relieving the family of many duties . F-CAPs were designed to be updated at least bimonthly to ensure the accuracy of information on demographics, medical diagnosis and condition, physical assessment, pain assessment, nutritional risk screening, information on family composition, spiritual/religious affi liations and cultural issues, and the risk/home environment. Additionally, all family member s, including the child, were asked about their perceptions of the illness and health care goals. The F -CAP was translated to accommodate Spanish -speaking families. CCSNL s were ultimately responsible for approving F -CAPs. CCSNLs were also responsible for authorizing all services at the county level and ensuring that w aiver services met the needs of enrolled children and families and program requirements. In conjunction with the hospice/home health agency, CCSNLs were responsible for monitoring hospice/home health care coordinators' comprehensive coordination of enrollees' care. The hospice/home care agency care coordinator, either a registered nurse or medical social worker, coordinated all medical and community services for the child, accompanied the child and family to scheduled appointments, and generally facilitated co mmunication between the family and all service provide rs. In addition to 22 hours of initial assessment services, the program covered 4 to 12 hours of case management hours per month . Eligibility and enrollment Children and their families either self -referred to PFC or were referred by a physician, another health care provider , such as a hospice or home health agency , or a CCSNL. To be enrolled in California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 15 the PFC program, children and young adults had to be 20 years of age or younger, live in one of the 11 participating counties, and have full -scope, no share -of-cost Medi -Cal and a CCS-eligible , life-threatening condition . Eligible children also had to meet the necessary level of care (LOC), by which a physician had to declare , on the required Physician Referral Form, that a child was at risk of having at least 30 inpatient days during the subsequent 12 months as a result of his/her qualifying condition if the child did not enroll in PFC . CCSNLs ultimately determined eligibility in all cases , at times with the assistance of county CCS medical consultants or a PFC program physician to establish the LOC requirement . If a CCSNL determined a child was eligible, the child and family completed paperwork to select a hospice or home health agency and connect with a care coordinator. If ther e were no participatin g hospice s or home health agencies available in the county of residence at the time of referral, otherwise eligible children were placed on a waiting list. Some counties that participated in the waiver and set up other structural components of PFC never enroll ed any children because the county was unable to contract with a local hospice or home health agency (see Exhibit 3 for the distribution of cou nty of residence of all enrollees). Once enrolled, a child could be disenrolled for any of the following reasons: There was a significant positive change in health status , such that the child no longer meets the LOC requirement , The child moved to a county that did not participate in PFC , The child or family decided to withdraw fro m the program unilaterally, The child was hospitalized for 30 days continuously (for more information on the \"30 - day rule,\" see the Program Design section below ), The child lost eligibility for full -scope, no share -of-cost Medi -Cal, The participant/family/home environment posed a health and safety risk to PFC providers and 30 days passed without successful remediation , The child/family missed three confirmed appointments for PFC services despite CCSNL and care coordinator ef forts to accommodate the family, The child enrolled in another CMS \u00a71915(c) waiver (simultaneous enrollme nt in multiple waiver programs is not permitted), The child turned 21 years of age, or The child died. (5) If eligible to later re -enroll in the program, the child and family were required t o complete the enrollment process from the beginning. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 16 Review of Pediatric Palliative Care L iterature The e stimated prevalence of children with life -threatening illness es worldwide is 10-16 per 10,000 .(6) In the U .S., this translates to approximately 500,000 children, of whom 50,000 die annually. (4, 7-9) Because life -threaten ing illnesses in children are much rarer than in adults, families often find themselves financially and emotionally unprepared to deal with the illness. Pediatric conditions are also different from the more prevalent term inal illnesses in adults and may require different modalities and plans of care, in particular more aggressive care up to the end of life. (10) Length of illness varies widely in children because of differential development and resilience, and end -of-life care can extend over many years and through several developmental phases . (10-12) Pediatric palliative care is a much newer phenomenon than the adult version, and there are few models of care and even fewer analyses of the cost, clinical, and quality -of-life effectiveness of pediatric palliative care program s. Though the palliative care model for end -of-life care has traditionally centered on outpatient hospice care, caring for children with life -threatening illness may be more resource -intensive than for the elderly, and hospices may not be willing or prepared to care for a population with potentially different needs from their usual patient population (13, 14). According to a 2007 survey of 378 hospices, about 78% accept pediatric patients (15, 16). Among the 20 -25% of hospitals in the U .S. that main tain palliative care program s, the proportion with pediatric component s is unknown (17, 18). The needs o f children and families dealing with life -threatening and life -limiting illnesses have been increasingly recognized by states and Medicaid through cost -neutral waiver programs, including those in Florida (the first, in 2005), Colorado, and California. Hom e-based care In the face of rising health care costs, there has been growing interest in moving more patient care out of hospitals and into the home. These efforts to facilitate the delivery of pediatric palliative or hospice care may enable a larger percentage of terminally ill children to receiv e care in their own home. (19) As home health technologies develop, so does the range of services. A growing body of evidence suggests that the location in which child ren receive palliative care has serious implications. When palliative care is provided in the home, parental satisfaction appears to be high, and subsequent adaptation and outcomes for parents and siblings can improve .(20-22) Cost The most established home -based pediatric palliative care ( PPC) program, Florida's Medicaid pediatric palliative care program, estimated that a model combining medical and palliative treatments in inpatient, outpatient, and hospice settin gs could expect to spend $110,000 per infant and $62,000 per child at baseline in the last year of life (23). Preliminary data from California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 17 Colorado's program calculate d saving s of $15,000 -20,000 per enrollee per year by eliminating preventable emergency department an d hospital visits (24). In 2006, Massachusetts created the home -based Massachusetts Pediatric Palliative Care Network , operating through hospices statewide. The c osts to providing hospices per child for one year of care in 2010 ranged widely , from $1,520 -$7,421, and depended in part on per -child overhead costs of hospices, not including medications, equipment, or other personnel such as personal care assistants and home health aides who may have been covered by p rivate insurance or Medicaid . (25) Barriers to care Physicians have reported several perceived barriers to palliative care for children, including uncertain prognosis, f amily hesitation to acknowledge an incurable condition, communication problems , including , but not limited to , language barriers, time constraints, and insufficient staff education and expertise about palliative care. (26) Other perceived barriers include false hope for cure, inappropriate continued use of advanced life-saving technology, limited financial resources for specialized pediatric care, limited access to specialty care in rural areas, ethical and legal issues, inappropriate eligibility criteria, fragmented care, inadequate assessment and management of symp toms, lack of research on pediatric palliative care, and lack of training and expertise even in pediatric oncology. (4, 27-31) Despite formal training, ph ysicians in one study said they do not feel adequately prepared to care for children with terminal conditions .(32) Technology has improved the survival likelihood of pediatric patients with complex medical disorders and rare conditions who might not have previously survived, but many of these children are still prone to repeated li fe-threatening or life -limiting complications. (33) Indeed, advances in pediatric care have led to an increase in the prevalence of children with life - threatening conditions. (34) Despite technological improvements, there are several potential barriers to support ing a critically ill child in a home environment, incl uding lack of health care providers experienced in home extubation, inaccessibility of pediatric critical care transport teams, medical equipment for transport and use in the home , supportive hospice services , difficulties in insurance payment for transpor t and procedures performed in the home, and lack of long -term home care support if the child survives his/her illness longer than expected .(35) Pediatric Palliative Care Outcomes - Determining Effectiveness Previous research has measur ed the effectiveness of palliative care interventions in improving outcomes related to patient sympto m burden, provider satisfaction, reduced percentage of patients dying in -hospital when desired , pain and symptom control, reduced resource use, increased family satisfaction, and the successful transitioning of patients to less intensive sites of care .(36-44) However, most of this clinical effectiveness research focuses on adults and there is a lack of outcomes -based research dedicated to pediatric programs and interventions. For California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 18 example, symptom -related interventions are rarely studied in pediatric end -of-life care despite evidence that pediatric oncology patients experience symptoms that are different from, and more intense than, those experienced by children dying of other diseases. (45) Initial attempts to measure outcomes in PPC have revealed many complexities. Complications can arise from the short life spans of many PPC patients, potentially small and geographically dispersed patient samples, identifyi ng a comparison group with a similar level of severity, identifying the right instruments for measuring costs and benefits, variability in outcomes due to the wide range of diseases and the variation in prognoses of those diseases, and moral and ethical de bates about whether effectiveness studies should even be conducted for PPC recipients facing end -of-life care (46). Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) has been proposed as a tool for measuring PPC outcomes, but selecting the best instrument is complicated. Children in PPC programs present with a variety of diseases, making generic meas urement preferable. These generic HRQOL instruments assess physical, emotional, and social constructs, but often miss less generalizable domains like pain, fatigue, depression, spirituality, social interaction, and desire for autonomy. Many studies have us ed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scale (PedsQL) in asthma, cancer, heart disease, rheumatology, and diabetes patients .(47-52) However, there are other indications that standard quality -of-life instruments such as PedsQL lack validity for measuring health -related quality of life in children with life -limiting conditions. (53) Family support Research finding s underscore the importance of considering the needs of all family members when providing care to children. Care teams should pay particular attention to parents with depressive symptoms, who in some cases can receive supportive care through their children 's pediatric palliative care programs. Parents are generally more involved as direct caregivers and decision makers than in the adult setting. (53) When a child becomes fatally ill and dies, parental grief is more intense than the grief experienced in response to other forms of loss such as the death of a spouse or friend, and this intense grief can affect parental health outcomes, including increased mortality in bereaved parents .(54, 55) To assist patients and their families through the palliative care process, promoti ng shared decision -making among patients, caregivers , and doctors can better inform all parties about the risks and benefits of health care interventions and offer them an opportunity to make an informed choice. (56) Evidence suggests that compared to their counterparts, patients who engaged in shared decision -making had greater patient -doctor communication and higher satisfaction with their doctors, improved adherence with treatment regimens , and a greater sense of personal control and self -esteem .(57-60) In addition, shared decision -making is associated with better quality of life or self -reported health status .(60, 61) California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 19 Program Design PFC waiver service agencies had to be licensed hospice agencies or home health agencies. The care team generally consisted of referring physician s, CCSNL s, agency care coordinator s, child life specialists, massage therapists, art therapists, music therapists, home health aide s, licensed clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and licensed psychologi sts. PFC was designed , in part, to provide in -home services. As such, a \"30 -day rule\" was implemented whereby children who were hospitalized for 30 or more consecutive days were automatically disenrolled from the program. These children were generally eli gible to re -enroll once they were discharged from the hospital, but they were not considered part of PFC during the period of extended hospitalization. The purpose of the rule was to temporarily disenroll children who could not utilize PFC's in -home servic es rather than to exclude severely ill children. To reflect the spirit of the rule in the cost analysis, we attempted to prevent an undercounting of the costs associated with these extended hospitalizations by including all costs for children who had multi ple enrollment periods, including the time between enrollment periods, if the original disenrollment was the result of the 30 -day rule. Exhibit 1: Timeline of Waiver Implementation Evaluation Design AB 1745 mandated an evaluation of the PFC program. DHCS contracted with UCLA to conduct the evaluation with the following goals in mind: 1) Assess the impact of the program on financial outcomes, including r eturn on investment (ROI) and cost savings , and p rojections for future p rogram savings, if any, in the budgets of state and local governments if the PF C program were expanded statewide. 2) Provide an estimate of whether the actual total expenditures for home - and community -based waiver services and other Medi -Cal services provide d to individual s California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Introduction 20 under the PPC Benefit Waiver program fall below or exceed 100 percent of the amount that would be incurred in the absence of the waiver. 3) Assess humanistic outcomes, including child and family quality of life and satisfaction with the program. 4) Evaluate operational factors in program administration through providers' assessment of the ease of navigating the program, referring patients, and providing services. The results described in this report assess the main components of the evaluati on - operational quality assurance and financial, utilization , and humanistic outcomes. Design The cost analysis utilizes a pre-post design in which the health care claims costs up to 24 months prior to PFC enrollment were calculated on a per enrollee per month ( PEPM ) basis and compared to the PEPM costs of enrollees during their time in PFC. In the absence of an appropriate control group (described in greater detail in the Limitations of Financial Outcomes section below), t he two -year pre -enrollment period served to stabilize the cost trend prior to program participation. The extended pre -enrollment period minimize s the potential for major events that led to referral an d enrollment in the program disproportionately affecting the pre - enrollment period and inflating cost savings in the post period through a bias in the timing of referral . Humanistic outcomes were measured by pre -post analysis of family quality -of-life and satisfaction measures included in the family surveys designed by UCLA and administe red to enrolled children's primary caregivers by CCSNLs. UCLA provided CCSNLs with training on survey administration to ensure reliability of results. Data sources The evalu ation analyses were conducted using data from Medi -Cal claims files, CCS enrollment files, F -CAP files, and survey data collected by DHCS from questionnaires designed by the UCLA evaluation team. The pre -enrollment period for each child was the 2 4 months p rior to their first enrollment in PFC. Given that the first child enrolled in PFC in January 2010, we used claims data from as early as January 200 8 and up to the end of the pilot period in December 2012. Enrollment files applied to the same period as the claims data. F-CAP and the survey data on family satisfaction and quality of life were collected on a continuous basis by CCSNLs and transmitted to UCLA via DHCS from the beginning of enrollment in January 2010 through December 2012 . Other survey data , including UCLA questionnaires for CCSNLs, provider agencies, and CCS physicians , were collected through SurveyMonkey. For a more detailed explanation of the development of the questionnaires an d survey processes, see Appendix A : Survey Methodology . California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 21 A six -month run -out was applied to the claims data , such that any claim with a check (payment) date more than six months from the service end date was dropped. The run -out period wa s necessary due to the standard delay between service provision and claim payment in Medi -Cal. We also allowed an extra three months to account for the l ag caused by Medi -Cal claims file production . The claims data for the final analys es in this report were obtained in October 2013, accounting for the run -out and lag on claims up to December 2012, when the PFC pilot ended. Over the course of the program, concerns were raised by provider agencies and DHCS that claims related to PFC serv ices may have been systematically denied and thus did not appear in the paid claims file DHCS was contracted to deliver to UCLA. As such, DHCS investigated separately the unpaid or denied claims pertaining to PFC enrollees and provided an overall estimate of the amount of unpaid claims. This number was added to the total program cost as a lump sum and was included in the post -enrollment costs. DHCS also provided UCLA a separate estimate of the administrative cost of PFC to the state via reports that each pa rticipating county submitted declaring the amount spent on PFC -related staff and activities. These estimated annual expenditures were also included as a lump sum in the post -enrollment costs. Findings Operational Waiver Quality Assurance DHCS served as the administrative authority over PFC and the primary waiver liaison with CMS , including submission of CMS Form 372, the annual report required of all CMS home - and community -based services waivers . The quality assurance information reported here is based on DHCS' final CMS Form 372 of the waiver period, submitted in December 2012. DHCS monitored the implementation and administration of PFC by CCS ' county -level programs via DHCS' Children's Medical Services Branch , which includes CCS . Quality assu rance was handled through \"a system to monitor quality control, provider standards, care plans, and services provided to clients to ensure that the health and welfare needs of individuals served in the PPCW [were] continuously met and protected ,\" as mandat ed by CMS quality assurance guidelines. DHCS performed on site program compliance reviews, level -of-care (LOC) determination reviews, health and welfare assessment reviews, comprehensive care plan reviews, provider qualification reviews, and financial audits as part of its quality assurance and improvement responsibilities. County CCSNLs held monthly phone calls wi th enrolled children and their families to ensure satisfaction , discuss health and welfare issues, and review reasons for program disenrollment. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 22 Over the three -year course of the pilot , DHCS identified a number of deficiencies, most frequently pertaining to the LOC determination component of its quality control efforts. While DHCS did not provide specific numbers of different types of deficiencies, c ounty CCSNLs were found to be significantly noncompliant in submitting complete d LOC forms in a timely manne r and in reporting the date of the LOC determination. CCSNL s were also found to be noncompliant in requiring providers to complete appropriate sections of care plans and documenting monthly calls to families to ensure services were received as expected. Care plans were another source of deficiency. Providers did not address or complete some health and safety assessments , physicians did not sign care plans in a timely manner, providers did not always forward care plans to CCSNLs, who in turn did not always s ubmit care plans to DHCS, and families were sometimes excluded from multidisciplinary team meetings. H ospice and h ome health agencies were also found deficient in submitting completed provider applications, including documentation of participating staff. DHCS attempted to prevent deficiencies and address existing ones through technical assistance, reviews of corrected care plans and LOC forms, and clarifications of p rogram policy through official p rogram notices. At the beginning of the waiver period, DHCS trained all CCSNLs, their backups, and other interested county administrators on all aspects of their PFC -related scope of work, including overall expectations, F -CAP, case management, health and welfare monitoring responsibilities, and database use. DHCS also conducted monthly conference calls with CCSNLs in all participating counties and quarterly calls with hospice and home health agencies to discuss ongoing concerns. PFC Service Requests The percentage of enrollees requesti ng PFC services provides an indication of engagement with the program. Other than care coordination, which was provided continuously, expressive therapies were the most request ed services ( Exhibit 2). Music, massage, and art therapies were all request ed by at least 40% of enrollees . Less frequently requeste d services included pain and symptom management, home respite, and play therapy. P FC services were the principal source of the concern about systematic denial of claims described above, so the claims data on these services were considered unreliable. The data reported here are from F -CAP results logged in the PFC database maintained by DHCS throughout the pilot period , which indicate services requested but not services utilized .

Note: N=151 Demographics Over the three -year pilot period, 151 children enrolled in PFC. The overall program population was diverse in terms of age, race/ethnicity, county of residence, and primary diagnosis (Exhibit 3). Enrollees were most likely to be ages 6 -10 (32%), male (56%), and Latino (59%). More than one-third of enrollees lived in San Diego County (34%). Neurologic disorders (27%) were the most frequent primary diagnoses of enrolled children, followed by cancers (22%) and pulmonary disorders (11%). The mean number of days enrolled in PFC was 328, or approximately 11 months.

There were 13 2 children enrolled for at least 60 days for whom complete claims data were available. This group 's demographic and other descript ive information is presented in Exhibit 4. The overall demographic, geographic, and disease distributions are similar to those of the overall enrollee population. The mean enrollment period of nearly one year ( 361 days) was about one month longer than in the overall enrollee population.

California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 26 *** Other includes gastrointestinal conditions and enrollees whose primary diagnosis was \"Other and unspecified postsurgical nonabsorption.\" Financial Outcomes Cost Savings and Return on Investment PFC lowered the per-enrollee per-month ( PEPM ) cost of providing care to the 132 children enrolled in the prog ram for at least 60 days by $ 3,133 (Exhibit 5), based on pre -post analysis of paid claims and an estimate of incorrectly denied claims for PFC services. This figure does not include the administrative cost to DHCS of running the program or the roughly $300 PEPM increase in service reimbursement for participating agencies that was proposed in late 2012, near the end of the pilot period. While th is increase was not in effect during the pilot period, it has since been recognized as a necessary part of providing appropriate care to PFC enrollees because it attempts to ensure a sufficient supply of provider agencies by making PFC care provision financially viab le. The increase should be included in future calculations to more closely reflect the expected program cost moving forward. Incorporating the $300 PEPM reimbursement increase and the administrative cost to DHCS of running the program , the pre - post savings would be $2,154 PEPM .

Examining cost s by service type, most of the savings were realized through a reduction in inpatient (IP) care costs of $4,897 PEPM , with an additional small decrease in emergency department (ED) care costs (Exhibit 6). In line with PFC's goal of providing more care in the home and community settings, the reduction in inpatient care costs was accom panied by a n increase in outpatient (OP) services of $1,242 PEPM and a smaller increase in pharmacy (RX) services of $367 PEPM . The net savings underscore the financial benefit of programs such as PFC that move care from the relatively costly IP setting into home - and community -based care.

Note: E D = emergency department ; RX = pharmacy; OP = outpatient; IP = inpatient. Note: The total savings of $3, 331 is higher than the savings cited in Exhibit 5 because these numbers include only paid claims and do not account for unpaid claims , which were provided by DHCS in a lump sum and could not be disaggregated by service type. Note: Long -term care was examined as a separate service type but was too small to report separately and was included in the IP service category. The proport ion of costs attributable to IP care dropped from more than half in the pre period (57%) to one -third in the post period (33%; Exhibit 7). The proportional decrease in IP service costs was accompanied by a n increase in the proportion of OP service costs from 33% pre- enrollment to 52% post -enrollment , and a proportionally similar increase in Rx service costs. ED costs were small compared to the other service types and did not change substantially between the pre and post periods as a proportion of total PEPM costs .

Note: E D = emergency department ; RX = pharmacy; OP = outpatient; IP = inpatient. The change in costs differed acc ording to enrollees' primary diagnose s. Children enrolled in PFC as a result of a transplant or cardiac or pulmonary condition showed marked PEPM cost savings from the pre -enrollment to post -enrollment periods , including more than $14, 000 PEPM savings for transplant -related enrollees (Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9). Enrollees with cancer or a neurologic condition showed more modest savings, while those with neuro muscular and metabolic conditions exhibited mean cost increases from the pre to post period s. In terms of overall cost (the diameter of the bubbles in Exhibit 9), enrollees with neurologic conditions represented the largest proportion of cost in the pre - and post -enrollment periods, in part because they comprised the largest diagnosis category and had the most enrollee months.

Note: Bubble size represents total cost for the diagnosis category . Note: Other includes gastrointestinal conditions and enrollees whose primary diagnosis was \"Other and unspecified postsurgical nonabsorption.\" The cost savings by diagnosis category are most evident in the reductions in IP costs from pre - to post -enrollment. Enrollees with transplants or cardiac or pulmonary conditions all reduced the proportions of their costs attributable to IP services by at least 27% and as much as 40% in the case of those with cardiac conditions ( Exhibit 10). However, a reduction in the proportion of costs associated with IP services d id not neces sarily guarantee overall cost savings, as evidenced by enrollees with neuromuscular conditions, who had a 17% reduction in IP services but whose total average costs nonetheless increased slightly from pre - to post -enrollment. This may have been caused in p art by the costly nature of OP services for neu romuscular conditions .

Note: Other includes gastrointestinal conditions and enrollees whose primary diagnosis was \"Other and unspecified postsurgical non absorption.\" The return on investment (ROI) of PFC was $ 2.20 (Exhibit 11). That is, for every dollar that was spent on the program, the state and federal governments (because the pilot was jointly funded) recouped the original dollar and saved an additional $ 1.20.

If the cost trajectory for the pre -enrollment period had continued post -enrollment, costs for providing care to the 132 children enrolled for at least 60 days during the three -year pilot period would have been an estimated $28.3 millio n,2 as opposed to the actual pilot period paid claims cost total of $2 1.4 million, a difference of $6.9 million .

To project future savings, two major assumptions were made. First, the administrative cost of running the three -year pilot period was assumed to carry over to future three -year periods, with the addition of the $300 PEPM increase in service reimbursement for participating agencies . Second, the pre -post PEPM savings for the three -year pilot period were assumed to continue forward at the same three -year rate. Under these assumptions, if 200 children enrolled in the program for three years, the total cost wo uld be $3.3 million and the gross savings generated from the $ 3,133 PEPM would total $ 22.6 million, resulting in three -year savings of $1 9.3 million. Limitations of Financial Outcomes The analyses presented here suggest that PFC was highly successful from a cost -savings perspective. However, the strength of the results is limit ed by the pre -post design utilized. This methodology did not allow for consideration of environmental or historical factors, including other changes in policy, reimbursement, provider supply, or inflation, all of which could have contribute d to changing Medi -Cal and CCS costs ov er the period of the PFC pilot. A difference - in-differences approach, in which the enrolled children would be compared over the same time period to a similar gr oup of CCS -eligible children (claim s on all CCS children were available to the evaluation team) who did not enroll in PFC, would have controlled for these outside factors by comparing the pre -post change in the enrolled group to the pre -post change in the control group. While a difference -in-differences approach would have been preferable to the pre -post design, UCLA was unable to identify an appropriate control group, mainly because the level of disease severity of PFC children prior to enroll ment was substantially great er, on average, than any other group of children identifiable through the CCS program. UCLA attempted to compare the enrolled children to the sickest children in CCS using health care costs as a proxy for severity , but even limiting the potential control group to the top 1% of CCS children nonetheless resulted in average costs that were an order of magnitude lower than those of the enrolled group. The evaluation team conducted extensive ICD -9 and CPT code mining to attempt to determi ne potential control children's level of severity, but the costs remained substantially lower than those of enrolled children. Children who were on the waiting list at some point during the program but never enrolled in PFC appeared to be a promising contr ol group because they had met the criteria for program eligibility , but sensitivity analyses showed them to be a highly unstable group in terms of cost . Given that they were never enrolled in the program, the cut California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 33 point for their pre -post comparison had to be determined arbitrarily, and slight modifications in the selected date led to drastically different results. The most rigorous attempt to identify a control group involved a search of the entire CCS population to find matched controls for the children e nrolled in PFC . This process utilized the Chronic Illness & Disability Payment System (CDPS), a diagnostic classification system that predicts expenditure levels for specific disease categories .(62) In consultation with medical experts, UCLA grouped enrolled children's primary and secondary ICD -9 codes into broader disease categories according to the CDPS system . CDPS codes generally range from \"extra low\" to \"extra high ,\" with slight variations across disease categories. UCLA compiled a list for each PFC enrollee of all disease categories of at least \"medium\" severity that appeared in the three months prior to enrollment and then searched the entire CCS database to identif y children who had the same CDPS codes in any given three -month period in the claims file, which ran from 2007 to 2012. CCS c hildren also had to roughly match PFC children on age (a proportional calculation such that matched children could not be more than 25% older or younger than enrolled children). This diagn osis-based matching strategy left a substantial number of PFC enroll ees with no exact matches in the entire CCS population. Despite the exact matches on CDPS diagnoses and age for the remaining enrollees , the PFC group still had PEPM costs that were about 50% greater than those of the control group (Exhibit 13). Furthermore, the PFC children for whom matches could not be found tended to have higher costs than the rest of the PFC group, suggesting that the highest -cost ch ildren were the hardest to match. The results are fairly consistent with at least some of the limited data available from previous studies summarized in the literature review above, specifically Colorado's Medicaid -based pediatric palliative care program. Extrapolating PFC's savings of $2,154 PEPM , the average annual savings per child are close to $26,000, while estimates for Colorado's program range from $15,000 to $20,000 per enrollee per year.

PEPM (pre) n Avg. n controls matched on age (25% flex) NOTE: There are 69 enrollees rather than the 132 in the final cost analyses because the attempt to find a control group occurred prior to receipt of the final data set in order to determine the cost analysis strategy. Given the impossibility of matching so me enrollees from the outset, UCLA determined it was unnecessary to conduct additional matching analysis with the final group of 132. *Control group calculations are based on the average PEPM of 500 repetitions of randomly selecting up to five controls (where possible) for each enrolled child from the 9,879 eligible matches Utilization Outcomes The drastic reduction in inpatient (IP) services described in the Demographics section led to a nearly 50% reduction in the average number of IP days per month among program enrollees , from 4. 2 to 2.3 ( Exhibit 14). The reduction was driven by major changes in the three primary cost-saving diagnosis categories - cardiac, pulmonary, and transplant. The average number of hospitalizations was also reduced in the program period, from 0.26 PEPM prior to enrollment to 0.20 PEPM during the program. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings Exhibit 14: Mean Number of Inpatient Days PEPM , Pre - Post -Enrollment, by Diagnosis Category , 200 8-2012 Source: UCLA analysis of MIS/DSS claims, MEDS and CMS Net data . In addition to reducing the need for hospitalizations through enhanced care coordination and the 24/7 nurse line, PFC also reduced the amount of time enrollees spent in the hospital on each visit from an average of 16 .7 days prior to enrollment to 6.5 days while in the program (data not shown). Further, the 30 -day readmission rate (hospital admission within 30 days of the previous discharge) was reduced from 45% of admissions to 37% of admissions (data not shown). The decrease in the latter may be partially explained by the more intensive care coordination provided to PFC enrollees. As was the case with the financial outcomes, in which reduced IP costs were associated with increased OP costs, the decrease in the time P FC enrollees spent in the hospital was accompanied by an increase in the average number of OP visits from 35 PEPM prior to enrollment to 39 PEPM while enrolled in the program. There was wide variation in the change in OP visits across the different princip al diagnosis categories (Exhibit 15). 5.0 7.6 1.5 2.0 2.8 4.7 9.2 4.5 4.2 3.6 1.5 2.2 1.3 1.3 1.4 4.8 3.5 2.3 Cancer Cardiac Metabolic Neurologic Neuromuscular Pulmonary Transplant Other Total Pre PostCalifornia Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 36 Exhibit 15: Mean number of Outpatient Visits PEPM , Pre - and Post -Enrollment, by Diagnosis Category, 2008 -2012 Source: UCLA analysis of MIS/DSS claims, MEDS and CMS Net data . While ED use was relatively minor compared to IP and OP throughout the pre -enrollment and pilot period, there w ere slight reductions in average E D use and the average frequency of E D visits leading to hospitalization. The former dropped from 0. 23 visits PEPM in the pre - enrollment period to 0.20 during enrollment, and the latter from 0.15 PEPM to 0.12 PEPM , respectively. Children with severe illnesses such as those that qualified enrollees for PFC are often admitted directly into the hospital , bypassing the ED , which may explain the relatively low overall ER use of a group of children with life -threatening diseases. Underscoring the severity of the conditions of many PFC enrollees, 20 of the 132 children who enrolled in PFC for at least 60 days p assed away prior to the end of the pilot period in 2012. Of these enrollees, nine had a primary diagnosis of cancer, seven had neurologic conditions, three had pulmonary conditions, and one had a primary cardiac condition (data not shown) .

Provider and CCSNL Satisfaction UCLA conducted surveys with CCSNLs, participating hospice and home health agencies, and CCS paneled physicians to gauge program outcomes from the perspective of the providers most involved in enrollees' and providers' PFC experience . All surveys were administered using SurveyMonkey's SSL encryption feature to protect the confidentiality of participants. CCSNL s CCSNLs, the main PFC liaisons to enroll ed children and their families, demonstrated high satisfaction with the quality of the program and its services. All nine CCSNLs responded to UCLA's survey and gave the waiver services overall a mean quality score of 9. 8 out of 10. Ratings for individual services varied slightly and ranged from 8.3 to 10 (Exhibit 16 and Exhibit 17).

These scores were particularly relevant given the value that CCSNLs placed on individual services. When asked to rate the importance of each service for enrolled children and their familie s on a five -point scale from unimportant to very important, all CCSNLs said that pain and symptom management and counseling were very important , and the majority (at least 7 of 9) said that massage, music, and art therapy, family training, and in -home resp ite were very important. Six of the nine CCSNL s indicated that care coordination, child life therapy, bereavement services, the 24/7 nurse line, and out -of-home respite care were very important services (data not shown). CCSNLs provided critical insight into the functioning of the program. The majority said that care coordination wa s an essential component of PFC that provid ed emotional and logistical support to families. Examples of important care coordination tasks inclu ded obtain ing the right medications, acquiring and providing needed repair for durable equipment , such as hospital beds and wheelchairs, organizing transportation, and coordinating financial assistance and respite for parents. CCSNLs felt that some parents would not have been able to effectively coordinate the care of their child on their own given the complexity of most children's conditions. They believed t hat care coordination save d money and time and allow ed for quick resolution of issues to the benefit of the patient , family , and health system . All of the CCSNLs believed that the program services were helpful in reducing family stress and worry and increasing family confidence about their ability to care for their child. In open -ended questions, CCSNL s said that parents felt \"less alone\" and \"grateful\" knowing that someone else 10.0 9.9 9.3 9.3 Massage therapy Music therapy Child life therapy Art therapyCalifornia Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 39 knew about their child's condition, listened to their concerns, and could help with any issue that arose. The 24/7 nurse phone line was viewed by CCSNLs as another important resource to alleviate parents' stress and worry, as well as an effective service to reduce hea lth care costs by preventing unne cessary ED visits and identifying problems early on in the home to prevent longer hospital stays. Hospice and home health agenc ies Hospice and home health agencies showed lower satisfaction than CCSNLs with the quality and utility of program services, but the scores on the 10 -point rating scale were nonetheless high. Representatives of the four agencies that responded (of five total pa rticipating agencies at the time of the questionnaire) gave PFC program services an overall rating of 7.8. Ratings for individual services varied and ranged from 6.7 to 8.3 (Exhibit 18 and Exhibit 19). Exhibit 18: Average Hospice and Home Health Agency Ratings of Select Waiver Services, 2011 Source: UCLA hospice and home health agency survey. 8.3 8.3 7.8 7.8 7.5 7.3 6.7 Pain management servicesEmotional support24/7 nurse phone lineBereavement counselingOut-of-home (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 40 Exhibit 19: Average Hospice and Home Health Agency Ratings of Therapeutic Services, 2011 Source: UCLA hospice and home health agency survey. Hospice/h ome health agency providers all agreed that care coordination, massage therapy, pain and symptom management, bereavement services, art therapy, and music therapy were either very important or important services , while counseling, family training, and the 24/7 nurse line were considered to be of at least moderate importance. All of the hos pice/home health agency providers believed that the program services were helpful in reducing family stress and worry and increasing family confidence about their ability to care for their child. Like CCSNLs, agency/hospice providers suggested that care co ordination and the 24/7 nurse phone line were particularly helpful in reducing family stress and worry . Family training , pain and symptom management , and emotional support were also credited with increasing confidence of families in caring for their child. Physician s Fifty -four CCS paneled physicians completed a survey about their knowledge, experience, and opinions of PFC (descriptive characteristics of respondents available in Appendix A, Exhibit 1). Based on their responses, program visibility appeared to be a problem. Thirty -four of the 54 respondents, or 63%, reported no familiarity at all with PFC (Exhibit 20). Among the 20 physicians who expressed at least so me familiarity, only 13 were somewhat familiar with the eligibility criteria and only 11 had previously referred children to PFC . In considering how best 8.5 8.3 8.0 7.5 Massage therapy Art therapy Music therapy Child life therapyCalifornia Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) W aiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 41 to disseminate information about PFC and other palliative care programs in the future, respondents who had previously referred children to PFC were asked how they learned about the program. Ten of the 11 learned from another physician, seven from another employee at their instituti on, three from social workers, two each from grand rounds and the original program request for action, and one each from CCSNLs, the physician's own patient, advoca tes, and CCS workgroup meetings. Exhibit 20: Number of CCS Physician s with Knowledge of Partners for Children, by Level of Familiarity, 2013 Source: UCLA physician survey. Note: Based on a total of 54 responses. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of providing individual PFC services to children with life -threatening or life -limiting illnesses (Exhibit 21). Family training was deemed the most important service, with all 54 respondents saying training was important or very important. Care coordination and pain and symptom management were considered nearly as important (53 each), followed by counseling and in -home and out -of-home respite care (all 52), bereavement services (49), child life therapy (47), a 24/7 nurse line (44), massage therapy (26), art therapy (26), and music therapy (24). 34 10 4 1 5 Not familiar at all Slightly familiar Somewhat familiar Moderately familiar Very familiarCalifornia Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 42 Exhibit 21: Number of CCS Physicians who Consider PFC Services Important, by Type of Service, 2013 Source: UCLA physician survey. Note: Includes all physicians who considered each service to be \"important\" or \"very important.\" Based on a total of 54 responses. Physicians varied in the timin g of referral to palliative care relative to a child's diagnosis. Twenty -four respondents (44%) said they were most likely to refer patients at the end of life, while 20 (37%) said they were most likely to refer early or in the middle of the child's diagno sis. Among those who had pre viously referred patients to PFC, s ix of the 11 (55%) said they were most likely to refer early or in the middle of diagnosis. Referring physicians also varied widely in the number of referrals they made to PFC. Two of the 11 respondents referred a single patient, while four others referred at least 10 and as many as 30 children. One possible cause of variation in the frequency of referrals was physicians' reaction to the referral process. N ine of the 11 referring physicians said the process was at least slightly effective , but had multiple comments about how to improve it, including shortening the process and expanding the program to absorb m ore frequent referrals. Respondents were also critical of the eligibility and enrollment process, which four physicians said was too le ngthy and rigid. Specific barriers to care noted by referring physicians included the stigma associated with terms like hospice, end -of-life care, and palliative care (5), uncertainty about whether a patient would benefit more under the standard concurrent care program or PFC (4), the belief that participation in PFC would interfere with a patient's curative care (2), paperwork (2), and the family's unwillingness to participate in PFC services (2 ; Exhibit 22).

Exhibit 22: Number of Referring Physicians with Perceive d Barriers to Care, by Type of Barrier, 2013 Source: UCLA physician survey. Note: Based on a total of 11 responses from physicians who had previously referred patients to PFC. Physicians were allowed to select more than one response. Despite these barriers, seven of the 11 referring physicians said they were likely or extremely likely to continue to refer patients to PFC, and the eighth respondent was unlikely to continue only because PFC had temporarily stopped in the county where the provider practices . Willingness to continue participating in the program may have been tied to broad s atisfaction with care coordination and other services. Eight of the 11 referring physicians said PFC coordinated enrollee care well or very well. Six respondents credited PFC with improving communication between themselves and others providers, particularl y hospice/home health care agencies and other non -physician staff. Of the eight referring physicians who responded to questions about the usefulness of individual PFC services, all found the care coordination and family training services at least somewhat useful, followed by the 24/7 nurse line, bereavement services, and pain and symptom management (7), in -home and out -of-home respite care, music therapy, massage therapy, and child life therapy (6), and art therapy (5). Enthusiasm about future participation in PFC extended to those physicians who had no previous experience with the program.

Of the 41 respondents who said they were unfamiliar with PFC , 32 (78%) said they were likely to refer patients in the future and 25 said they had patients at the time of the survey who they believed met the PFC eligibility criteria. Barriers to enrollment and provision of services Eligible children were not always referred to PFC, and children and families who were referred to PFC did not always enroll in the program. While it was impossible to determine the reasons for refusing enrollment, UCLA surveyed CCSNLs and providers to und erstand their perspectives on barriers to enrollment and barriers to providing care once families were enrolled. At least five of the nine responding CCSNLs considered lack of family knowledge about program services and unwillingness to allow service provi ders into their homes as barriers to enrollment. They also identified the stigma of terms like hospice, end -of-life care, and palliative care and the perception that PFC services would interfere with curative care as additional barriers. CCSNLs also ident ified logistical issues, including incorrect referral by physicians who were unaware of the full -scope Medi -Cal requirement and lack of referral of eligible children because of physician misunderstandings about the difference between concurrent and palliat ive care. From both the physician and the CCSNL perspective, the amount of paperwork required to refer and screen potentially -eligible children was prohibitive. PFC administrators attempted to mainstream the process , but CCSNL s continued to view paperwork as a barrier in enrolling children and providing timely care. The mean time elapsed between referral and enrollment was 76 days, or about 2.5 months. Once enrolled, CCSNLs also noted a number of barriers to coordinating and providing services. Seven of the nine CCSNLs believed that families were not ready to acknowledge that their child's condition was life -threatening and considered this a barrier to c are. At least five of the nine respondents identified conflict among family members about treatment g oals, staff shortages, insufficient family knowledge about program services, language barriers, and stigma as further barriers to care. At least three of t he nine respondents also cited as barriers c onflict between staff and family about treatment goals , conflict among staff about treatment goals , communication difficulties between staff and families , children's reservations or concerns , and cultural differe nces . Providers at hospice/home health agencies echoed many of the concerns of CCSNLs, and three of four responding providers also considered children's own reservations or concerns to be a barrier to care. The most pervasive barrier to care for hospices a nd home health agencies, however, was the low reimbursement rate for many services. Providers indicated that reimbursement rates for in -home respite care we re too low and that there was an insufficient California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 45 supply of available service providers to offer out-of-home respite care . All four of the responding agencies said they received lower reimbursement for PFC enrollees than through other funding services for four of the eleven main program services - art, music, and massage therapy, and the 24/7 nurse phone line. Three of the providers said that care coordination and pain and symptom management services were also reimbursed at lower rates than other funding sources. Reimbursement rates were unanimously noted as a potential barrier for program sustainability. Family Satisfaction Of the 151 children who enrolled in PFC, 107 had caregivers who completed at least one survey, an overall participation rate of 7 1%. Given the goal of measuring the effect of PFC services over time, only caregivers who had at least two responses were included in the satisfaction and quality -of-life analyses. For caregivers to have completed at least two surveys, children had to have been enrolled for at least six months (enough time to complete a baseline and initial follow -up survey). There were 102 children who met this criterion . Of their 102 caregivers, 50 responded to at least two surveys, for a 49% response rate at first follow -up. Of the 50 caregivers included in the analysis at first follow -up, 36 had children who were enrolled for at least one year, the minimum time necessary to complete a second follow -up survey. Eighteen of the 36 completed a second follow -up survey, for a 5 0% response rate at one year. A small number of caregivers completed additional follow -up surveys, but their numbers were too small to report. Demographic and descriptive characteristics of the 50 caregivers included in the analysis and their children are shown in Exhibit 23. .

Satisfaction among caregivers was consistently high. The waiver services overall garnered average ratings of 9.6 on a 10 -point scale in the first and second follow -up surveys. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 47 Individual services also received high scores from enrollees' caregivers ( Exhibit 24). Care coordination, a central component of the PFC model, received overall average ratings of 9.8 at first and second follow -up. More specifical ly, caregivers' sense of support from their care coordinator and perceptions of the care coordinators' ability to listen and be sensitive to the family's needs scored at least 9.6 at all points. Clinical services , such as a 24/7 nurse line for health consu ltation and the program's pain management service , received slightly lower scores , but were still more than 9 at all points. Therapeutic services, including child life, art, music, and massage, also received high scores throughout the first year of follow -up (Exhibit 25).

Of the 18 caregivers who completed a second follow -up survey, nine answered the child life therapy question, seven answered the art therapy question, 13 answered the music therapy question, and 16 answered the massage therapy question. Child and Family Experience and Quality of Life Enrolled childr en were not asked any questions directly, but caregivers were asked if PFC services helped them reduce or control their child's pain and other symptoms. On a 10 -point scale, the services received an average rating of 8.6 for pain control/reduction and 9.3 for management of other symptoms. While caregivers' perception of a child's pain is a subjective measure, previous research suggests that it can be accurate in populations of chronically ill children. (64, 65) Given evidence that standard qual ity-of-life instruments , such as PedsQL , lack validity for measuring health -related quality of life in children with life -limiting conditions ,(53) a panel of pediatric palliative care physician experts was assembled to support the development of an original survey tool to measu re enrollee and family experience and quality of life . In consultation with the panel, UCLA opted to ask explicit questions about aspects of stress and worry rather than administer longer questionnaires that may have been a burden on families . Caregiver experience and quality of life was operationalized using four potential aspects of the experience of caring for a child with a life -limiting condition - trouble sleeping, feeling tense or nervous, being worried about the ir ability to manage their child's h ealth, and feeling unsure 9.4 9.3 9.4 9.7 8.4 9.4 9.7 9.6 Child life therapy Art therapy Music therapy Massage therapy First follow-up Second follow-upCalifornia Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Findings 49 about the ir ability to manage their child's health. Specific questions were included in the baseline and follow -up surveys to measure change over time in the frequency of feeling each aspect on a five -point scale ranging from neve r to always. Exhibit 26 shows the average frequencies of symptoms in the overall caregiver population. Trouble sleeping (3.16 to 2.73) and feeling worr ied about the ability to manage their child's health (3.16 to 2.71) both show marked declines between the baseline and the first follow -up surveys that are largely sustained in the second follow -up survey. The caregiver population mean scores for feeling t ense or nervous and feeling unsure about the ir ability to manage their child's health varied slightly , but remained essentially flat over the t hree surveys . Exhibit 26: Average Frequency of Caregiver Experience and Quality -of-Life Aspects, Baseline through Second Follow -up, 2010 -2012 Source: UCLA family satisfaction and quality -of-life survey. Caregivers were further asked if they thought specific PFC services contributed to reductions in stress and worry, and increases in confidence, related to their child's care. In 97% of the cases (counting each survey separately), care coordination, family training, the 24/7 nurse line, and pain and symptom management services were considered helpful in all of the quality -of-life areas . In 95% of the cases, child life, art, music, and massage therapies were also helpful in reducing stress and worry. One hu ndred percent of the surveyed caregivers said they would recommend PFC to a family member or friend who had a child with a life -limiting condition. 012345 Baseline First follow-up Second follow-up Worried Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Conclusions and Recommendations 50 Conclusions and Recommendations Analysis of the three -year PFC pilot suggests that California's Pediatric P alliative Care Waiver demonstrated a cost -effective way to provide home -based palliative care to children with life - threatening conditions that was satisfying to most enrollees' primary caregivers and their health care providers. PFC enrollment led to savi ngs o f $3,133 PEPM compared with the two years pre -enrollment for the 132 children who spent at least 60 days in the program. When including the administrative cost of running the pilot and the $300 PEPM increase in service reimbursement for participating agencies , partially a result of DHCS' acknowledgment of early signs of cost savings at the end of the pilot period , savings were still more than $2,000 PEPM . The lack of a comparison group makes it difficult to eliminate other possible explanations for these cost savings, including historical trends in health care costs, but an examination of the source of the cost savings speaks directly to the goals of PFC. Most of the savings were the result of the dramatic decrease in inpatient costs by $4,897 PEPM , accompanied by a relatively smaller increase in outpatient costs of $1,242. This major shift , from costly inpatient care to more coordinated and less expensive outpatient care , is the result of PFC's home -based care model. Overall savings in terms of costs a voided had the pace of costs prior to enrollment continued into the pilot period totaled nearly $7 million, an indication of the potential continued cost savings if PFC were to expand to more counties or even statewide. Beyond the financial outcomes, PFC a chieved important changes in health care utilization, including shorter inpatient stays and less time spent in the hospital, on average. The pilot was also viewed favorably by enrollees' primary caregivers, who reported that PFC helped them reduce or contr ol their children's pain and other symptoms, as well as improve quality -of-life indicators for themselves , such as trouble sleeping and feeling worried about the ability manage their children's health. The objective evaluation of the program demonstrates desirable results in achieving the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim of improved care, better health, and lower costs. (1) Providers participating in PFC also expressed widespread satisfaction with the pilot, although their concerns highlight important areas of improvement to maximize the reach and effectiveness of the pediatric palliative care model moving forward. Concerns a bout reimbursement rates among hospice and home health agencies may have been somewhat addressed by the $300 PEPM increase in service reimbursement for participating agencies , but there may still be trepidation in signing on to provide services. There was a widespread lack of knowledge about PFC among prospective referring physicians in the CCS pool of providers that may have limited the program's enrollment numbers in the pilot period. CCSNLs and referring physicians considered the PFC paperwork process to be burdensome, and more than two Californi a Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Conclusions and Recommendations 51 months passed on average between referral to PFC and enrollment in the program. Providers also noted many barriers to enrollment at the family level, including stigma associated with palliative care, the inability of famil y members to acknowledge the life -threatening nature of their child's illness, and conflicts among family members about treatment goals. Based on these conclusions and remaining concerns, UCLA offers the following recommendations: Assess continuously the financial viability of providing services to PFC enrollees for hospice and home health agencies in order to ensure a sufficient supply of providers. This w ill be particularly important if enrollment in PFC increases . Additional, thorough cost analys es of service provision to children by participating agencies a re needed to potentially adjust reimbursement. This would allow vendors to sustain operations and limit undue fiscal strain. Beyond service costs, participating agencies incur additional costs such as provider training to the unique needs of children enrolled in PFC , billing , and other administrative expenses. Additional reimbursement to support administrative costs may be crucial to recruit and retain provider agencie s. Given the evidence of cost savings of this program, enhanc ed reimbursement would likely still be cost effective . Increase the visibility of PFC among prospective referring providers to increase enrollment . Given recognized barriers to referral, including lack of knowledge among physicians about income eligibility requirements and the difference between concurrent and palliative care, provider education efforts should be increased. Educati on of providers on the potential benefits of referring children and families early in the care process is especially important. Starting care early for eligible children improve s the experience of child ren and the ir famil ies, and could contribute to lowering the cost of care. Grow operational capacity and strategy to match program expansion. This can be achieved by build ing on existing partnerships and develop ing new ones among the state and county CCS programs, specialty care centers, other medical and community services, and hospice and home health agencies. Shar e best practices among program partners to seek ways to simplif y referral protocols across medical settings and enrollment procedures at the county level. This would be especially helpful for adult hospice and home he alth agencies that are interested in expanding care f or children but fac e difficulties in managing the re sulting costs. DHCS should continue its ongoing conference calls with all providers and use this venue for best practice sharing. Assess enrollment processes and procedures to minimize the time between referral and enrollment. The mean time elapsed between referral and enrollment was 76 days, or California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Conclusions and Recommendations 52 about 2.5 months . DHCS should consider the reasons for this delay and address them approp riately. Support providers in educating families to reduce perceived barriers to enro llment and receipt of services. DHCS should continue efforts to address concerns expressed by fami lies, including language barriers and concerns about accepting the nature of their child' s life -threatening condition. It is also important to develop and implement processes that facilitate open and productive communication between family members and staff regarding treatment goals and support in conflict resolution .California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 References 53 References 1.

California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) |201 4 Appendices 57 Appendices Appendix A : Survey Methodology Primary C aregiver Survey We created an original survey instrument (text available in Appendix C) to evaluate families' satisfaction and quality -of-life experience with PFC. Questions gauged caregivers' perceptions of how program services affected their child's health and well -being, and the caregivers' ability to manage their child's life -limiting condition. Caregivers were interviewed upon their child's enrollment in the program and at subsequent six -month intervals as long as their chil d remained enrolled in PFC. CCSNLs served as survey administrators and generally contacted families by phone to conduct the survey or schedule a time to meet in person to complete the survey. If CCSNLs were unable to communicate with a member of the family after three attempts on different days and times, the family was considered to have missed that survey but was still eligible to complete a survey six months later if their child remained enrolled in the program. CCSNL S urvey We created an original survey instrument (text available in Appendix C) to evaluate knowledge and perceptions of the PFC program among CCS Nurse Liaisons (CCSNL). Using our state contacts, we identified and gathered contact information for CCSNLs, all of w hom worked closely with specialty care centers in the 11 participating California counties. We contacted the CCSNLs between January and February 2012 to confirm their email information. We distributed the survey along with an email invitation through Surv eyMonkey and allowed CCSNLs up to eight weeks to complete and return the survey. Of the 17 who ostens ibly received the invitation, nine completed the survey, for a response rate of 53%. Hospice and Home Health Agency S urvey We created an original survey i nstrument (text available in Appendix C) to evaluate knowledge and perceptions of the PFC program among management personnel at CCS provider agencies (hospices and home health agencies). At the time of the survey administration (November - December 2011), th ere were five agencies participating in PFC. W e contacted the organizations by telephone during daytime hours to obtain email addresses for the most appropriate potential participants, in order to send the e -mail based survey. We distributed the survey al ong with an email invitation through SurveyMonkey and allowed provider agencies six weeks to complete and return the survey. Four of the five agencies responded to the survey, for a response rate of 80%. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Appendices 58 Physician S urvey We created an original survey instrument (text available in Appendix C ) to evaluate knowledge and perceptions of the PFC program among CCS paneled providers. Using a publicly -available list of CCS physicians ( http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ccs/scc/Pages/SCCName.aspx ), we identified 2,079 potential survey participants. All physicians on the list were affiliated with specialty care centers in participating counties. Between March and August 2012, we contacted physicians' offices and medical centers by telephone during daytime hours to obtain email addresses for as many potential participants as possible in order to send the email -based survey. Once we had eliminated duplicate names, re tirees, and physicians whose email addresses were unavailable or who had previously opted out of our online SurveyMonkey delivery method, we were left with a sample of 694 physicians. We distributed the survey along with an email invitation through SurveyM onkey in January 2013 and allowed physicians until March 2013 to complete and return the survey. Of the 694 physicians who ostensibly received the invitation, 54 completed the survey, a response rate of 7.8%. The specialty and practice characteristics of t he responding physicians are described in Appendix A, Exhibit 1. Appendix A, Exhibit 1: Specialty and Practice Characteristics of CCS Physician Respondents, 2013 Specialty area n % Pediatrics 30 61% Cardiology 13 2% medicine 1 2% Surgery 1 2% Psychiatry 1 2% Sleep disorders 1 2% Total 74 California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Appendices 59 Practice setting n % Academic medical center 45 90% Hospital and out -patient 14 28% Private practice 4 8% Total 63 Source: UCLA physician survey. Note: Respondents were asked to select all specialty areas and practice settings that apply. Percentages are based on the tot al number of respondents for the given question (not the total number of respondents for the overall survey). Forty -nine physicians responded to the question about specialty area, and 50 responded to the question about practice setting. Appendix B : Data Preparation Methodology Enrollment Enrollment status was determined by the PFC database file sent by DHCS. We implemented a minimum 60 -day continuous enrollment rule and dropped all children who had been enrolled for less than 60 days from the analyses. We further dropped children whose enr ollment data were inconsistent, including those who had two enrollment dates but no disenrollment date, those whose enrollment and disenrollment dates were conflicting (disenrollment date prior to enrollment date), and those whose enrollment dates were mis sing. In order to more accurately calculate per -enrollee -per-month ( PEPM ) costs, we assigned enrollment status on a daily basis to be able to calculate per -enrollee -per-day (PE PD) costs for services that ran across two months. We manually changed the statu s in the partial months after a child was disenrolled because enrollment status was only updated at the beginning of every month. For example, a child disenrolled on May 10 initially appeared to be enrolled until June, so we converted the child's status to disenroll ed for May 11 -31 to calculate PE PD. We then linked the cleaned PFC database file to the CCS eligibility and claims data files, also received from DHCS. Claims The claims required significant cleaning, including moving incorrectly placed decimal p oints (discovered upon comparison with adjustments that nearly matched the original claims) and inconsistent dates between original claims and adjustments (in which case we replaced the adjustment dates with the original claim dates). Adjustments that did not match any original claim were dropped. The total cost of a claim after adjustment was distributed evenly across the total number of days for the given service based on the original claim's start and end dates (for example, a service costing $100 over f ive days was assigned a per -day cost of $20). Finally, we created an indicator variable to show if the claim date occurred prior or subsequent to enrollment. California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Appendices 60 Calculating PEPM from PMPD To calculate PEPM for individual months, we divided the aggregate cost of all services provided to all children enrolled in PFC in the given month (using the daily cost calculations described above) by the number of children enrolled at any point during that month. This mo nthly PEPM is shown in Exhibit XX. To calculate the PEPM cost over the course of the entire program, we summed the costs for each month and divided the total by the total number of enrollee months.

Let us tell you a little bit about this program. T he purpose of the Partners for Children program is to provide pediatric palliative care services to children who have a CCS eli gible medical condition with a complex set of needs. Eligible children and their families have the benefits of comfort care at home while continuing curative treatment. Unlike with hospice, eligible children will not need to be in the last six months of life to participate. The waiver is based on the principle that if curative treatment is provided along with palliative care, there can be an effective continuum of care throughout the course of the medical condition.

CONTINUE TO QUESTION 34) California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Appendices 133 You have answered that you do not know about the Partners for Children program. Let us tell you a little bit about this program. The purpose of the Partners for Children program is to provide pediatric palliative care services to children who have a CCS-eligible medical condition with a complex set of needs. Eligible children and their families have the benefits of comfort care at home while continuing curative treatment. Unlike with hospice, eligible children will not need to be in the last six months of life to participate. The waiver is based on the principle that if curative treatment is provided along with palliative care, there can be an effec tive continuum of care throughout the course of the medical condition. The objective is to minimize the use of institutions, especially hospitals, and improve the quality of life for the participant and family (siblings, parent/legal guardian, and significant others). Examples of the services available include: care coordination, family training, in-home respite care, out-of home respite care, child life therapy, art therapy for the child, music therapy for the child, massage therapy for the child, 24/7 nurse line, bereavement services, and pain and symptom ma nagement. To be eligible for the program, a child needs to meet all of the following: Live in a county that is participating in the program Be eligible for full scope Medi-Cal Be 20 years of age or younger Have an eligible condition The following is a list of medical conditions that may qualify a child to receive services: Neoplasm ICD-9 Codes 140-208, 235-238, 239 Neoplasm, Stage 3 or 4 Any neoplasm not responding to conventional protocol (at least one relapse) Central nervous system tumors Cardiac ICD-9 Codes 745, 746, 747.1, 747.2, 747.3, 747.4 Major cardiac malformations for which surgical repair is not an option or awaiting surgery or transplant Severe anomalies of Aorta and/or Pulmonary Arteries Heart Failure ICD-9 Codes 428.0 - 428.99 Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis with multiple hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the previous year ICD-9 Codes 277 Pulmonary hypertension ICD-9 Codes 416.0 - failure ICD-9 Codes 518.81, 518.83, 518.84 Immune AIDS with multiple hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the previous year ICD-9 Code 042 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disorder ICD-9 Code 279.2 Other severe immunodeficiencies ICD-9 Codes 279 Gastrointestinal Chronic intestinal failure dependent 751.3, 751.5 Liver failure in cases in which transplant is not an option or awaiting transplant ICD-9 Codes 570, 572.8, 751.61 Renal Renal failure in cases in which dialysis or transplant are not an option, or awaiting transplant ICD-9 Codes 585.6, 586 Neurologic Holo prosencephaly or other severe brain malformations requiring ventilatory or alimentary support with at least four hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the previous year ICD-9 Code 742.2 CNS injury with severe comorbidities ICD-9 Codes 851 - 854, 952 Severe cerebral palsy/HIE with recurrent infections or difficult-to-control symptoms ICD-9 Codes 343, 768.7 Batten Disease ICD-9 Code 330.1 Severe neurologic sequelae of infectious disease or trauma ICD-9 Codes 323.6, 331.4, 342, 344, 851 - 854, 952 California Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) Waiver: Evaluation Report September |201 4 Appendices 134 Metabolic Sever and progressive metabolic disorders including but not limited to: leukodystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, and others with severe comorbidities ICD-9 Codes 330.0, 330.1, 330.8 Mucopolysaccharidoses that meets Level Care criteria below ICD-9 Code 277.5 Neuromuscular Muscular dystrophy Codes 359.1 muscular ICD-9 Codes 335.0 - 335.19 Other myopathy or neuropathy with severity that meets Level of Care criteria below ICD-9 Codes 334, 335.2, 335.8, 335.9, 336 Other conditions that meet Level of Care criteria below, including but not limited to: Severe epidermolysis bullosa 996.8 Other non-listed conditions will be given ICD 9 code on case by case basis For more information about the program, please visit the Partners for Children website at: http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ppc/Pages/default.aspx Appendices 135 27.
