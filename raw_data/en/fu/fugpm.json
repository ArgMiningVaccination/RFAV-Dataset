According to CEO and cofounder Craig Elbert, the product development process wasn't easy. \"It took us one year to source ingredients (with multiple trips around the globe) and hundreds of taste tests to find the best protein, fiber, adaptogen, and botanical powders that come with recognizable ingredients and [are] sourced directly from locations where they are cultivated best,\" he says. \"Natural, real ingredients and flavor are of the utmost importance for our customers to happily incorporate powders into their health and wellness routines.\" Read more: [13 startups that make daily rituals like brushing your teeth and taking vitamins more enjoyable](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/startups-that-encourage-daily-rituals) Each under-150-calorie serving of plant protein contains 18 grams of protein, which is derived from organic pumpkin seeds and organic hemp. The plant proteins come in three flavors (chocolate, vanilla, and unflavored), and have coconut MCT oil to make it creamy and enjoyable to drink. I tried it myself and it was noticeably less grainy and gritty than traditional protein powders, though not perfectly smooth. Each 100-calorie serving of whey protein also contains 18 grams of protein and is made with grass-fed whey protein isolate. Whey isolate contains a high concentration of protein that's lower in lactose, carbs, and fat. It comes in chocolate and vanilla flavors. Care/of's chocolate flavor (my favorite) contains cocoa powder, organic cane sugar, and organic monk fruit extract, while its vanilla is made with organic vanilla bean extract, organic cinnamon, and a dash of Himalayan sea salt. These recognizable ingredients make the powders actually taste good, even if mixed with plain water. Overall, I liked the whey protein more than the plant protein because of its thinner texture, but if you're vegan, the plant protein is still a solid choice. Whichever protein you choose, it'll support muscle growth and recovery as well as weight management, and fill in for the missing nutrients from your current diet \u2014 without the unnecessary calories, sugar, and digestion issues. Other new powders that help muscle development and support your fitness routine are the creatine and maca. The vegan, single-ingredient creatine powder helps tone and define muscles, and it's recommended that you mix it with a protein powder. Maca, the Peruvian adaptogenic root, supports energy and stamina. In the middle of or after your workout, you might want to keep a packet of Care/of's electrolyte powder on hand. It tastes like coconut water and contains calcium, magnesium, chloride, sodium, and potassium to hydrate you efficiently. And if you're having digestion issues, there's an organic chia-flax mix that has four grams of fiber per serving and can be added to drinks or sprinkled over breakfast.
