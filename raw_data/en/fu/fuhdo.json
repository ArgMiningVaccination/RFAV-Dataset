TestClear Old Style Aloe Toxin Rid Shampoo The use of hair during a drug test is typical because this part of the body holds onto THC for more time than blood, urine, or saliva. Some tests register THC in hair up to 90 days after the last time that they partook. The detox shampoo from TestClear helps eliminate these trace amounts from the hair and scalp. [TestClear Old Style Aloe Toxin Rid Shampoo](https://onlinehealthstore.org/testclear-old-style-aloe-toxin-rid-shampoo) is relatively expensive at $236 per bottle, but it provides nourishing ingredients to help the hair thrive (like aloe vera).

Macujo [Macujo](https://onlinehealthstore.org/macujo) helps users pass their drug test, regardless of whether they are tested with saliva, urine, or hair. With two decades of industrial research to support it, this formula comes from a brand that offers just about anything that users could think of - pills, drinks, etc. This brand is a project of Mike Macujo, who claims to be an expert in passing THC tests. However, unlike other brands on this list, there are certain ingredients that the user is expected to have already, including vinegar and baking soda. The prices of the products on this website start at $30. Quick Fix Synthetic Urine [Quick Fix Synthetic Urine](https://onlinehealthstore.org/quick-fix-synthetic-urine) has a unique way of helping the user pass a urine test - not urinating. Users get synthetic urine instead to make it more believable with this kit. Every package comes with a disposable heating pad, helping them raise the temperature to a natural number that will seem real on a test.

TestClear Urine Simulation with Powdered Urine Kit The [TestClear Urine Simulation with Powdered Urine Kit](https://onlinehealthstore.org/testclear-urine-simulation-powdered-urine-kit) is another synthetic urine source. While removing THC from urine with these other formulas may be challenging, consumers who use this powdered urine can pass their drug tests easily. Plus, it is a lot easier to transport, and it dissolves completely in room temperature water. However, users will need to use the included heater to make sure that the urine matches what would be typical for someone's urine which had just used the bathroom. The total cost of this kit is $50. Determining the THC Detox Product Rankings Every product for THC detoxification will claim to do the same thing - eliminate THC. However, all of these supplements don't do what they claim to. The following criteria had to be met to find the best remedies in the market: Test Passing Score These THC detox products were tested with applicable drug tests to ensure that they would give the user a passing result. Products with the most reliability earned a higher ranking in these tests. Science-Backed Ingredients Overall, the evidence to back up the use of herbal remedies is limited, which means that products with a lot of these nutrients were less likely to perform as they claimed. The formulas with vitamin B2, vitamin B3, zinc, and antioxidants earned a place on this list instead. Honest Advertised Benefits Some companies exaggerate how good they are to consumers to get new customers. However, it is impossible to guarantee to pass a drug test, no matter how long the user had followed the regimen before taking the drug test. Due to the limited evidence on the market today, there's a minimal chance that any of them will work, especially for a short-term solution. Companies that were realistic about what they could provide were much preferred. Manufacturer Reputation & Transparency The industry that provides THC detox kits is admittedly a little tumultuous. After all, these brands are looking to help consumers hide the fact that they've used cannabis recently rather than abstaining from it. The manufacturers with a proven reputation for quality and performance were chosen for this list over brands who haven't entirely made it in the industry. Customer Reviews, Testimonials, and Success Stories Even though testing these detox products was preferred, customer reviews made it possible to determine the most accurate rankings for these products. Customers voice their opinion when they can see that a product works, which is no different for users of THC detox kits. Fast, Easy, and Affordable Shipping Options Most people who shop for THC products want to get them as soon as possible. The shipping times for these companies were an important consideration, as was the cost of that shipping speed. Many of the products on this list offer free expedited shipping, even overnight. Ease of Use Drinking four gallons of water a day for up to a week is one of the most effective ways to purge the body ahead of a drug test, but this task isn't feasible for everyone. The THC detox tests had to be easy for consumers to spend money on. Money-Back or Pass-Test Guarantee Some products offer a guarantee that gives users a refund if they can't test negative and the product doesn't work. Consumers shouldn't have to pay for remedies that don't work, but each person's physiology can inhibit how effective some supplements can be. How Long Does Cannabis Stay in Your System? The length of time cannabis is in the body depends on which part the user checks. Some traces only last for a couple of days, while others can remain for three months. - Hair: 90 days. - Urine: 3 to 30+ days - Saliva: 48 hours - Blood: 36 hours - Sweat: 7-14 days When a drug test is administered for work purposes, they primarily test blood or saliva. However, individuals who use large quantities are likely to surpass these times. What Remains in the System After Using Cannabis? Using marijuana exposes the body to cannabinoids, which end up in the bloodstream. The cannabis plant is home to over 100 cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds, and users are exposed to every one of them when they partake in cannabis. THC just happens to be the most well-known one amongst them all, creating a psychoactive effect in the user. The \"high\" associated with THC is fleeting, usually lasting no more than a few hours with particularly potent strains. However, the THC remnants are left behind in the body for months after. It can survive so long due to the fat solubility of THC, which means that the THC remains in the stored fat of the body. Side Effects of Cannabis Detox and Withdrawal Though most people focus on the effects that THC and cannabis have on the body, there are multiple side effects associated with stopping the use of cannabis as well. Insomnia and headaches are relatively common, though some people also notice becoming more stressed and anxious. Considering that cannabis use is often used as a natural remedy for these problems, it makes sense that users would experience them once again without any THC in their system. The most common side effects associated with THC withdrawal include: - Depression - Anxiety - Vivid dreams - Nightmares - Anger - Irritability - Stress - Mental fatigue - Difficulty focusing/concentrating - Mood swings - Reduced appetite - Tremors - Shakiness The severity and duration of these side effects will vary from person to person, ranging from a few days or a few months. Individuals who have used cannabis in high quantities for a long time will likely experience side effects with much greater intensity. Natural Remedies for THC Withdrawal Individuals who go through THC withdrawal naturally want relief. To make the withdrawal symptoms less severe, try some of these tips: - Hydrate the body. - Reduce how much fat is in the user's diet. - Reduce or eliminate caffeinated beverages. - Start an exercise routine. - Prepare a warm bath to relax. How Do Drug Tests Work? Before using any THC tests described, it is best to understand how they determine the drugs in the user's system. The primary purpose of the drug test is to sense any trace of cannabinoids using blood, saliva, urine, and other parts of the user's system. The most popular tests are urine tests because they are inexpensive. They are also easy and effective in sensing THC. The use of a urine test allows the person requesting the test to see if the individual has used cannabis within the last three months. Using hair, blood, and saliva are all practical measurement tools. While some people doubt the validity and effectiveness of drug tests, they are sensitive. When the user takes the test, it seeks out THC-COOH, which is naturally created by the body as THC is processed through it. That's why they can detect THC when the user hasn't partaken in weeks. How Do THC Detox Products Work? THC detox products primarily exist to help consumers eliminate any evidence that cannabis was ever in the users' system, ensuring that they can pass a drug test for one of many different reasons. The only question is - how likely is it that any of these remedies will eliminate THC from the system. The effectiveness of any of these detox products will depend on two main factors - the amount of THC that the user consumes regularly and the user's physiology (which is unique from others). Some of the detox products available will flush out the kidneys. With the flushing, urine accumulates contaminants like creatine, giving a positive result on a urine test. While it may indicate that retesting should occur, it buys the user a little more time to get all of the THC from their body. With a detox kit for THC, users get natural ingredients in capsules, oils, or powders. Some of these THC detox kits include: - Dandelion leaf can help the user to release more contaminants in their body through urine. - Rhubarb root reduces inflammation and releases compounds found in the cannabis plant. - Burdock root has been used in traditional medicine to cleanse the blood. - Goldenseal root is meant to clear cannabis from the body. THC detox shampoos are also for consumers who don't want to ingest a detox supplement. An employer often won't use a hair sample to test for drugs. However, how the body releases THC, cannabis can remain in the hair for three months. Individuals who haven't used THC within this timeframe should have no difficulty testing clean, but individuals who use a THC detox shampoo can pass when they have used cannabis within the 90 days prior. The top THC shampoos on the market can purge chemicals, pollutants, and other compounds that accumulate on the hair through exposure every day. Some employers choose saliva drug tests because the cost of the test is cheap, and they are easy to use. Unfortunately (for these employers), these tests tend to be less accurate. They measure the THC found in the mouth, but it won't detect any use further back than 72 hours ago. A saliva test isn't practical, but a mouthwash can help eliminate any THC residue in the mouth. To impact the saliva test, the user should rinse out their mouth with the THC detox mouthwash within 30 minutes of the test commencing to make a difference. Scientific evidence indicates that last-minute solutions for THC aren't practical for the most part. Taking any of these detox formulas on the day of a test isn't recommended because it won't likely impact how much THC is in the user's system. A seven-day cleanse is much more effective, providing the user with the best odds of getting rid of THC for a drug test. Scientific Evidence for THC Detox Products Ever since THC started being legalized from state to state, researchers have sought to understand how different detox methods for THC work. Realistically, the easiest way to pass a drug test is not to use THC at all, but even this abstinence is not the most reliable method. According to one study, individuals exposed to secondhand smoke from marijuana could even test positive. The study placed the participants in a room without ventilation for an hour, finding that the non-smokers tested positive without partaking themselves. These tests are so sensitive that consuming a bagel with poppy seeds can cause them to test positive. Exercise also releases THC, which is not always a good thing. When an individual exercises, they burn through fat. If a test is more than a day away, it can help the user lose weight and ultimately hold onto less fat and THC in the future. However, if they exercise within just 24 hours of having the test, the THC is released within the body and has not had time to be released through urine or feces. This will lead to a positive test with certainty. Drinking water is another good habit that users can take to help them pass a drug test, diluting the urine and causing them to go to the bathroom multiple times to purge THC. Some people believe that the only reason that THC detox products work at all is due to the substantial consumption of water. With a gallon or more water daily, users can improve their chances of passing a drug test. The best way for users to pass a drug test legitimately is to combine drinking water, electrolyte powder, and vitamin B2. Users will need to drink a lot of this remedy to test negative successfully, but they can check their results ahead of a test to make sure it works. Tests will show less THC in the system when the user has to urinate. Using fake urine is one option for consumers, depending on how the drug test occurs. If the user isn't directly supervised, a phony urine sample will lead to a negative test. However, if the user is watched or cannot use synthetic urine, they are out of luck. One of the top recommended solutions for consumers is a niacin flush to beat a drug test with urine. Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, is praised by many people online, even though it doesn't come with much scientific evidence to back it up. It can be pretty dangerous to follow the flush protocols associated with niacin because they can lead to niacin toxicity. Other remedies that consumers swear by include: - Coffee can act as a diuretic and increase the natural antioxidants in the body. - Apple cider vinegar provides antimicrobial benefits and promotes a heightened metabolism. - Cranberry juice promotes better health for the urinary tract and can eliminate toxins in the kidneys, intestines, lymphatic system, and other body areas. - Lemon can help users with internal cleansing. While some evidence agrees that coffee can cleanse the body and help with testing, apple cider vinegar can damage the teeth and gums when consumed in high quantities. Cranberry juice only takes about seven days to make a lasting difference in the body's toxins, and it works as a diuretic. However, there isn't much scientific evidence to show that it rids the body of THC. Though lemon-infused water is a regular part of many dietary cleanses, nothing links it to lower levels of THC. Consumers can find other peer-attempted ways of THC detoxification online, using solutions like cayenne pepper, honey, and more. There are even recommendations that involve the use of broccoli, grapefruit, and mung beans. Ultimately, the evidence behind these options is minimal (if any), but they are all good for ridding the body of toxins. Frequently Asked Questions About THC Detox Q: Will users get THC withdrawal?

Research shows that consuming alcohol can increase THC levels. Q: Does exercising help me pass a drug test? A: Yes, but the effects are not instant. Exercising helps the body to burn fat. Since stored fat in the body can retain THC in the cells, losing weight can reduce THC's amount of time in the body. If the user decides to exercise within 24 hours of the test, the opposite effect is actual. The THC releases from stored fat, but it remains in the body as a detectable compound during this time.
