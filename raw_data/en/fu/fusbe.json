CCO has a complaints and discipline procedure designed to ensure a thorough and fair investigation of any accusation of professional misconduct, consistent with the requirements of the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991.\" In response, CCO has issued several cease-and-desist orders to chiropractors, which have effectively curtailed these claims. However, the Regulated Health Professions Act is not clear on the evidentiary and practical considerations that should guide regulatory bodies' responsibilities for oversight of health benefit claims by health professions. CCO commissioned the Accessing Centre for Expertise (ACE) to examine the evidence base for claims of immunity due to chiropractic care to inform the regulatory body's policy considerations as it exercises its statutory mandate to regulate all of chiropractic in the public interest. CCO noted that ultimately this report is intended to \"...help move forward one of CCO's strategic objectives, namely to ensure standards and core competencies promote excellence of care while responding to emerging developments.\" CCO provided ACE with funding and the request to focus on chiropractic care and immunity. Beyond that, ACE was given full independence to pursue this study without interference and the assurance that the final report would be made publicly available. APPROACH ACE employed multiple methods, including (i) a scoping review and targeted scan, (ii) key informant interviews, and (iii) deliberative dialogues. The scoping review identified 1743 articles across the multiple databases searched. This ultimately resulted in 70 articles being included in our final results, of which 40 were based on empirical research (9 experimental studies, 31 observational studies), 17 were evidence reviews (4 systematic reviews, 3 narrative reviews, 2 scoping reviews, 1 rapid review, and 7 reviews of unstated type), and 13 commentaries, essays, and other types of study. We invited 33 individuals to participate in a key informant interview, with 18 agreeing to participate (including chiropractors, researchers, regulators, educators, and advocates with 13 from Canada and 5 from international jurisdictions). We conducted 2 deliberative dialogues with (i) 8 chiropractic patients, and (ii) 21 health profession regulators in Ontario. KEY MESSAGES 1. Most fundamental to this project was the results of the review of research evidence. There is a lack of high quality empirical research studies supporting a positive relationship between chiropractic and iii immunity. We did identify four reasonably good quality systematic reviews published in the last four years, three which focused on spinal manipulation therapy for treatment or prevention of non-musculoskeletal disorders or immune system function and each found no evidence of effect, while the fourth systematic review also focused on spinal manipulation and concluded that there is moderate quality evidence that spinal manipulation can influence biomarkers but the clinical importance of the findings is unknown. More importantly, there appears to be broad consensus that more research is needed. However, a common call for more research does not necessarily equate to consensus on what the research priorities should be. Our interviews with key informants suggested that there are distinct views on where scarce research funds should be directed, and importantly, who should play a central role in directing those funds. Overall, chiropractic research lacks dedicated infrastructure, capacity and clear leadership for developing a relevant research agenda. 2. Our interviews with a range of chiropractic experts and stakeholders echoed the literature - there are two camps that are at odds with one another, have distinct philosophies, epistemologies and orientations towards chiropractic practice that reflect entrenched professional positions. One camp was characterized as privileging vitalistic chiropractic values (e.g., drawing on the natural healing force within the body that is expressed through the central nervous system), while the other camp was characterized as privileging scientific values and the contemporary evidence-based paradigm (e.g., emphasizing the relative quality of research evidence through adherence to an explicit hierarchy based on the risk of bias for different study designs). While these opposing camps are well-documented, their differences underscore key challenges in the profession, particularly when considering the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. Key informants disagreed on the possibility of reconciling the differences between the two camps, with the relative immaturity of the prevailing research evidence base yielding considerable commentary that seems to feed tensions within the profession. The two camps do not agree on what types of knowledge or information are relevant and how it should be appraised, interpreted or applied to inform decision-making. Beyond these two camps is an important middle group, but it is not clear what proportion of chiropractors this represents or how homogenous or heterogeneous their views are. While the two camps may have outsized influence on ongoing dialogue within the profession, there is an apparent need for the profession to speak collectively and giving greater voice to the middle group may facilitate this. 3. Our work highlighted a critical need to develop greater clarity on key concepts, including 'chiropractic', 'immunity', 'evidence', and 'risk', to inform policies and actions. A key challenge in providing clarity on these fundamental terms for the chiropractic profession appears to be an underlying disagreement about what constitutes 'chiropractic' and what 'immunity' impacts are deemed to be important. But without the ability to apply some common conceptualizations to these key terms, the prospects for prioritizing research and solidifying the evidence base appear daunting. Similarly, the lack of consensus on what should constitute 'evidence' for chiropractic may not be surprising given that a scientific orientation is core to the scientific camp, but we observed several examples from putative members of the vitalist camp that acknowledge forms of evidence hierarchies, suggesting there may be some room to develop greater consensus on the term. Conceptual clarity for the multidimensional concept of 'risk' was also noted. Health profession regulators, including CCO, use the concept of risk as a foundational principle, but the multiple ways that risk can be framed (e.g., from the perspective of the patient, public, health system, public and private payers/insurers, researcher, chiropractic profession and individual chiropractor) can create confusion. Particularly in light of the tensions in the chiropractic profession, efforts to unpack the nature of risks associated with avoiding potential harms vs. neglecting potential benefits would be helpful in guiding efforts of the research community to contribute to a more relevant evidence base. iv SUMMARY Our review results align with other well-conducted reviews that the current research evidence base does not provide sufficient justification for claiming a positive, clinically relevant relationship between chiropractic and immunity. Our interviews and deliberative dialogues with stakeholders provide further insight, pointing to some core challenges, including entrenched professional positions and the lack of a clear voice for the majority middle of the profession, ambiguity surrounding key concepts that underscore challenges developing a relevant evidence base, and consensus on the need for more research but not necessarily on how research priorities should be set. In the short-term, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCO should be confident in fulfilling its regulatory role to protect the public from unsupported immunity claims related to chiropractic interventions. In the longer-term, CCO may wish to consider what role it can/should play in (i) supporting the development of conceptual clarity of key chiropractic terms, (ii) advocating for and/or informing the prioritization/ targeting of dedicated research funding for chiropractic, (iii) contributing to the reduction in professional tensions and/or identify opportunities for collaboration, and (iv) assessing the multidimensional risks related to shifting the positionality of chiropractic within the broader health and higher education systems. 1 CONTEXT COVID: UNDERSTANDING THE EVIDENCE, POLICY AND REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHIROPRACTIC AND IMMUNITY 1. INTRODUCTION The field of chiropractic has been characterized by deep rifts on the nature and scope of chiropractic practice and associated tensions over the role of evidence.1-4 Based on Ontario's Regulated Health Professions Act, chiropractors \"...assess conditions related to the spine, nervous system and joints. They diagnose, prevent and treat, primarily by adjustment: (a) dysfunctions or disorders arising from the structures or functions of the spine and the effects of those dysfunctions or disorders on the nervous system; and (b) dysfunctions or disorders arising from the structures or functions of the joints.\" In the context of the once-in-a-lifetime COVID-19 pandemic, the professional regulatory agency in Ontario, the College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO), has noted: \"...an unprecedented number of complaints relating to claims involving chiropractic and immunity. CCO has a complaints and discipline procedure designed to ensure a thorough and fair investigation of any accusation of professional misconduct, consistent with the requirements of the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991. The Inquiries, Complaints and Reports Committee, and in some cases the Discipline Committee, relied on existing standards of practice in exercising their statutory mandates, which did not necessarily reflect the best available information concerning chiropractic and immunity.5 In response, CCO has issued several cease-and-desist orders to chiropractors, which have effectively curtailed these claims. However, the Regulated Health Professions Act is not clear on the evidentiary and practical considerations that should guide regulatory bodies' responsibilities for oversight of health benefit claims by health professions. Therefore, CCO commissioned the Accessing Centre for Expertise (ACE) to examine the evidence base for claims of immunity due to chiropractic care to inform the regulatory body's policy considerations as it exercises its statutory mandate to regulate all of chiropractic in the public interest. Ultimately this report is intended to \"...help move forward one of CCO's strategic objectives, namely to ensure standards and core competencies promote excellence of care while responding to emerging developments.\" 5 2. APPROACH ACE provides evidence-informed policy guidance to a range of health sector stakeholder organizations. We focus on policy and system level questions and apply a broad conceptualization of evidence to our work. We conceptualize evidence based on an adaptation of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework which considers three types of evidence: research evidence, contextual evidence, and experiential evidence.6 Research evidence includes the best available scientifically produced research that is typically published in peer-reviewed academic journals, original research such as surveys or analyses of existing quantitative data sets, and systematic reviews or other types of knowledge synthesis of published research. Contextual evidence includes available practice, demographic, geographic and economic data as well as reports and other grey literature produced by a wide range of organizations with particular jurisdictional, practice or policy relevance. Experiential evidence includes knowledge and experience gathered from key stakeholders and a range of local and global experts. ACE strongly supports the role of 2 research evidence as a critical and necessary part of most policy processes, but acknowledges that it is, by itself, insufficient to inform policy. We believe our broad and comprehensive approach to conceptualizing evidence provides balance among the spectrum of chiropractic perspectives to study the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. To examine the evidence base for the relationship between chiropractic care and immunity, we employed multiple methods, including (1) a scoping review and targeted scan, (2) key informant interviews, and (3) deliberative dialogues. Drawing on multiple methods allows for methods and data triangulation to enhance the validity of the findings.7 This is important as it was clear from the outset that this is a highly sensitive topic. CCO provided ACE with funding and the request to focus on chiropractic care and immunity. Beyond that, ACE was given full independence to pursue this study without interference and the assurance that the final report would be made publicly available. 2.1 Scoping Review and Targeted Scan Scoping reviews involve iterative search strategies, informed by ongoing review of results and expert consultation. Unlike systematic reviews, the scoping review approach allows us to unpack the question of the relationship between chiropractic and immunity by identifying important related topics and key sources of evidence (beyond a sole focus on published research studies or literature reviews). We followed the six-phase methodology set out by Arksey and O'Malley8 and expanded and refined by Levac et al.9 and Daudt et al.10 (i.e., (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying the relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) charting the data, (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and (6) consultation). Ultimately, our aim was to identify and map the scholarly and grey literature to address the review question: what evidence, conceptualized broadly, exists on the relationship between chiropractic care and immunity/ immune system function? We searched four databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Index to Chiropractic Literature, as well as structured searches of Google Scholar and Google. We also searched the reference lists of two recent reviews on the topic by the World Federation of Chiropractic and the International Chiropractors Association and reviewed sources provided to us by CCO and key informants. We included any type of article, except for published abstracts and news articles, published after 1990, in English or French. Articles were included if they focused explicitly on an element of chiropractic care and an aspect of immune system function. We did not define 'immune system function' a priori. Given the complexity of the concept, we chose to limit our search to broad keywords rather than, for example, a list of immunologically modulated health conditions, in order to capture a generalized concept of 'immune system' as it is employed in the chiropractic literature. To complement the scoping review, we conducted a targeted scan of chiropractic organizations to identify evidence used, if any, to inform existing standards of practice, policies, or guidelines regarding claims of health benefit related to immune system function. Using Google advanced site searches and manual searches of the targeted site's available search functionality, we scanned the websites of 45 Canadian and international chiropractic regulatory bodies, associations, specialty colleges, and educational institutions for relevant documentation. Where standards of practice, policies, or guidelines on the topic of chiropractic care and immune function were found, we sought to identify any cited evidence, which was incorporated into the final set of studies included in the scoping review. See Appendix A for additional details on our approach. The scoping review identified 1743 articles across the multiple databases searched. This ultimately resulted in 70 articles being included in our final results. Table 1 outlines the search, screening and review results. 3 Of the 70 articles included in our review, 40 were based on empirical research, of which nine were experimental studies (including randomized controlled trials (n=6), basic science (n=2), and quasi-experimental (n=1) studies) and 31 were observational studies (including case studies (n=12), case series (n=3), case control (n=2), cohort (n=2), cross-sectional surveys (n=6), and social media analyses (n=6)). In addition, we identified 17 literature reviews. Seven of these reviews did not provide a methodology or methods; where methodology/methods were provided, these included systematic reviews (n=4), narrative reviews (n=3), scoping reviews (n=2), and one rapid review. Thirteen commentaries, essays, and other types of study were included to provide additional contextual insights. See Appendix B for list of included articles.

Six organizations published standards of practice, policies, and/or guidelines on the topic of chiropractic and immunity. Of these, four cited supporting evidence. Supporting evidence included 55 unique sources, of which 38 sources had not been captured by the scoping review. Full text PDFs were available for 28 sources. However, ultimately, none of these sources met our review eligibility criteria. 2.2 Key Informant Interviews and Deliberative Dialogues We used both key informant interviews and deliberative dialogues to collect expert and stakeholder perspectives. Key informant interviews allowed us to draw on the knowledge and experience of a range of chiropractic experts and stakeholders from Ontario, the rest of Canada and international jurisdictions. Key informants were identified through the scoping review/targeted scan, by members of our research team, and input from CCO. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we probed key informant knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of chiropractic care and immunity/immune system function. Interview topics included: (1) conceptualization and definitional challenges, (2) understanding of the relationship between chiropractic care and immunity, (3) knowledge of the evidence base regarding such claims, and (4) professional communication issues (see Appendix A for interview guide). Key informants were also asked to recommend articles that fit the requirements of our scoping review. We invited 33 individuals to participate in a key informant interview, with 18 agreeing to participate. These included chiropractors, researchers, regulators, educators, and advocates. Often these roles overlapped. Most informants were located in Ontario (n=9), but we also spoke with four informants from the rest of Canada, and five international informants. Of the 16 who did not participate, three formally declined to participate, three were lost to follow-up (i.e., they initially responded, but did not return our repeated requests to schedule an interview), and nine never responded to multiple invitations to participate in an interview. 4 Deliberative dialogues were conducted to bring together (i) eight chiropractic patients to discuss their experiences seeking chiropractic care, and (ii) 21 health profession regulators in Ontario to compare and contrast their experiences regulating different health professions in the same health system context. Recruitment of patients was through website and social media postings while recruitment of health profession regulators was facilitated by CCO whereby a standing meeting of all Ontario health professions regulators was extended to allow participation in the deliberative dialogue. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted the two deliberative dialogues remotely via videoconferencing with each conducted under the Chatham House rule whereby participants are free to discuss the content of the dialogue but not to identify or attribute any specific comments to a particular individual (see Appendix A for further details on the deliberative dialogues). 3. FINDINGS To study the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, we analyzed the scoping review/targeted scan, key informant interview and deliberative dialogue results thematically. We start by assessing how the key terms (chiropractic and immunity) were described, conceptualized and understood. We then focus on the nature of the research evidence, perspectives of stakeholders and evolving professional tensions, and the risks and responsibilities for regulating the communication of evidence on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. Each theme is outlined below. 3.1 Key Terminology and Conceptualizations Based on our preliminary work, it was clear that the key terms of focus (i.e., chiropractic; immunity) are not consistently defined or understood, thus creating challenges for assessing the relationship between them. To inform the analysis of this relationship, we drew on the review results and key informant interviews to unpack each term. We also consider how 'evidence' is understood by key stakeholders, given its overarching relevance to the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. 3.1.1 What is 'Chiropractic'? Most studies we reviewed framed chiropractic care as spinal adjustment or manipulation (although there were a few studies that explored non-spinal adjustment/manipulation-based interventions such as nutrition and supplementation). Often, the use of 'adjustment' versus 'manipulation' signalled the philosophical position from which the authors approached their article, with the language of 'adjustment' suggesting an alignment with vitalistic chiropractic values (e.g., drawing on the natural healing force within the body that is expressed through the central nervous system11,12), while the language of 'manipulation' suggested an alignment with scientific values and the contemporary evidence-based paradigm (e.g., emphasizing the relative quality of research evidence through adherence to an explicit hierarchy of evidence based on the risk of bias for different study designs13,14). The use of 'subluxation' for example, marks a point of tension among the chiropractic community. McCoy and colleagues (2020)15 state that: Language should be a tool for minimizing ambiguity, and establishing precision in communication. [...] The use of terms that homogenize rather than differentiate foster ambiguity and imprecision. The practice of conflating terms, such as vertebral subluxation, joint dysfunction, adjustment, and spinal manipulation has ethical and political implications. [...] They are not the same thing. Others, have different perspectives on the use of subluxation. Simpson (2012)14 views subluxation as an anachronistic element of chiropractic discourse that should be retired. As part of his future-oriented 5 recommendations for the profession, he states that: Organizations such as the World Federation of Chiropractic and all major chiropractic associations will need to agree upon and adopt a position statement identifying the chiropractic subluxation as an historical construct that remains a hypothesis, which cannot form the basis for patient care until and unless there is a body of scientific evidence to support it. [...] Further, educational accrediting bodies will have to modify their standards to clearly state that subluxation is not a concept upon which to base patient care. We also asked key informants to characterize 'chiropractic'. Several key informants emphasized that \"chiropractic care is a profession, it's not a treatment\" [Key Informant (KI)-102] or that \"chiropractic care is not a modality, it is a health profession\" [KI-118]. As one key informant said: ...even calling it chiropractic care is a little bit problematic for me, other than defining something by profession. Because what's physiotherapy care? I mean, what are the specific interventions? [KI-101] Interestingly but also unsurprisingly, the scope of practice in Ontario was perceived as both \"quite broad\" [KI-103] and \"fairly narrow\" [KI-118], with some disagreement among key informants about what exactly chiropractors do, and ought to do. For some, \"chiropractors deal with musculoskeletal [MSK] issues\" [KI-101] and ought experts in MSK care\" [KI-112], because \"that's where the evidence is and where we can do our best in terms of helping the population\" [KI-111]. These key informants highlighted the burden of neck and back pain as \"the number one cause of disability in Canada today\" [KI-115] and felt that chiropractors ought to focus on MSK issues only. However, some maintained openness to the potential for benefits beyond MSK-related issues: \"I'm a very MSK practice [...] I'm very much on that side of the equation, but at the same time, I will tell you that I've treated people and seen crazy things happen\" [KI-105]. Others took a broader interpretation of chiropractic care, that \"ranges from manual therapies to healthful lifestyle promotion\" [KI-101]. \"exercise and nutrition\" [KI-106]. These key informants tended to take a \"whole health perspective instead of a local phenomenon of back pain management\" [KI-113]. While spinal manipulation/adjustment may be \"the defining intervention for the profession\" [KI-102], in one key informant's view, \"chiropractic care isn't just about a manipulation, it is a whole clinical encounter\": Chiropractors are also extremely good at making a patient feel seen and heard, and there's a lot of research out there on positive psychology...if a patient feels seen and heard, that immediately starts the healing process. [KI-104] Ultimately, given the lack of consensus on what constitutes 'chiropractic', it is important to unpack and qualify existing evidence and cautiously consider its impact on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. 3.1.2 What is 'Immunity'? Similar to the challenges defining chiropractic, there are different ways to interpret the term 'immunity'. It is important to note that the nature of immunity is a contested area of research and scholarship. At the 6 simplest level, there is the contrast between innate immunity (what is inherited at birth) and acquired immunity (what is collected through a lifetime of exposures). Debate on these two basic 'types' of immunological functioning is not as controversial as the ongoing, historical tension between two broad scientific 'concepts' of immunity. The first concept of immunity is a kind of Darwinian 'host defense' system in which the organism, measured best through a series of biomarkers, is able to differentiate between the 'self' and 'other', 'insider' and 'outsider'; and if the organism is 'strong', it effectively 'makes war' upon the 'other' by launching into a series of defensive and offensive strategies. The second concept of immunity is a dynamic 'ecological' system, in which inside and outside factors to an organism interact with each other in a kind of complex (less 'war like') interactive synergy; some relations between organisms, or between organisms and environment, are seen as symbiotic, whereas others are characterized by differential power relations in which some species do better than others at a given moment because of contextual factors. The latter concept of immunity seems to be accepted as the more sophisticated bioscientific model today, but it is very difficult to measure these kinds of complex, multifactorial phenomena.16 Few studies we reviewed provide explicit definitions of 'immunity'. Most described specific biomarkers as a proxy for immune system function, and many emphasized a neuro-immunological link between chiropractic intervention and immunity. Some other studies framed immunity as resistance to or reduction in infectious and non-infectious disease. Considering the ongoing scientific questions related to the concept of immunity, and particularly the established tensions in the field of chiropractic, this general lack of definitional clarity in published literature is problematic. Key informants were often hesitant to provide a straightforward definition of immunity, seeing it instead as something \"very broad ranging\" [KI-112]. For some, immunity was understood as \"circulating neurology\" [KI-113] and that regular spinal adjustments will \"optimize the functioning of your nervous system\" [KI-105]. For others, immune system function was put in a \"colloquial way\" [KI-114], as the ability to \"fight off infection\" [KI-101] and an \"internal innate ability to keep the body free of harmful organisms or entities that would cause disease\" [KI-102]. Some key informants extended the definitional issues by reflecting on the challenges of measuring immunity. As one key informant put it, \"we have a lot of loose ideas about how to test immunity, but I don't think we figured out how to drill down on that\" [KI-107]. Immunity is a \"nebulous concept\" with \"no baseline\" [KI-105] by which to measure it. Further, as one key informant explains, even when there is a measurable change, its clinical significance is far from clear: Measuring immunity, that's something that has been a challenge [...] When we're looking for inflammatory markers or other biomarkers, what is the norm? And it's difficult to come to consensus on that. And even when there are changes, it's difficult to know what do those changes mean? Are they even clinically meaningful? [...] Everything targets physiological factors. Everything. You touch my skin, and you'll find that my inflammatory markers probably react. What does that mean? It usually doesn't mean much. [KI-101] A key implication of the different and inconsistent approaches to defining immunity as it relates to chiropractic is that the way we think about evidence also changes. At one level, immune response is aligned with specific changes to biomarkers, while at another level, immunity can be viewed as a proxy for broader health benefits. The former level may generate legitimate biomedical research questions that lead to higher quality research studies, but presents challenges extending findings to health outcomes or clinical relevance. The latter level positions immunity as aligned with broad and positive health outcomes but 7 presents many scientific challenges to account for the plethora of other confounding factors that can contribute to health outcomes that, without employing research methods that minimize bias (such as randomized controlled trials), are difficult to rule out. The extensive literature on challenges measuring patient experience and outcomes is a relevant example. Similar to the definitional inconsistencies for 'chiropractic', the definition of 'immunity' lacks broad consensus and needs to be considered cautiously when studying the relationship with chiropractic. 3.1.3 What is 'Evidence'? As noted above, ACE uses a broad conceptualization of evidence that includes research evidence, contextual evidence and experiential evidence. While it is beyond the scope of this report to provide a detailed conceptualization of evidence, it is important to acknowledge the origins and evolution of evidence-based medicine (EBM) over the last three decades, which led to an immediate paradigm shift in the field of medicine and has influenced most other health professions and health systems. Djulbegovic and Guyatt17 published a review of EBM in the Lancet in 2017 that \"...disseminated three major tenets: an increasingly sophisticated hierarchy of evidence, the need for systematic summaries of the best evidence to guide care, and the requirement for considering patient values in important clinical decisions.\" In the early years of EBM, evidence hierarchies ranked the quality of evidence based primarily on study type (Figure 1A). However, this has evolved to allow for a more nuanced assessment of evidentiary quality through a tool called GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) that considers not only the study type, but also how the study was conducted and the nature of the results (Figure 1B). While the 'evidence-based' paradigm has been transformational for health systems globally, it is still evolving and growing in sophistication, which has important and relevant implications for the chiropractic profession. When we spoke with key informants and deliberative dialogue participants about the concept of evidence, they revealed varying perspectives. Key informants often noted clear philosophical and epistemological framings that aligned professional tensions either with or against a scientific orientation towards evidence. The deliberative dialogue participants also saw evidence differently. For most patient participants, a basic conceptualization of evidence was followed, with videos and social media postings highlighted as key sources of evidence and limited appreciation for the need to appraise the relative methodological quality/rigour or value of different sources of research evidence. Health profession regulator participants discussed how the concept of evidence is influenced by the existing evidence infrastructure that varies by profession. For example, some health professions (e.g., medicine, nursing) have educational/training programs/settings that are well-integrated with formal academic environments/universities, which helps to build and support ongoing and sustainable research capacity/productivity that can contribute to the relevant professional evidence base. Other professions, including chiropractic, face more challenges in their ability to build and sustain a high quality evidence base to support clinical decision-making. Overall, the chiropractic field highlights a contested orientation towards the conception and role of research evidence. While there have been three decades of significant advancements in how evidence is conceptualized and operationalized for clinical decision-making, those advancements are context and profession specific. Without greater consensus on the understanding and function of evidence for chiropractic, assessing and applying policy to questions like the relationship between chiropractic and immunity will inevitably pose major challenges. 8 Figure 1: Evolution of the Hierarchy of Evidence Djulbegovic, B. & Guyatt, G. Progress in evidence-based medicine: A quarter century on. Lancet, 390, 415-423 (2017).17 3.2 Understanding the Relationship between Chiropractic and Immunity While it is important to acknowledge the definitional variability for both 'chiropractic' and 'immunity' noted above and the inconsistencies for conceptualizing 'evidence' when assessing the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, we wanted to draw on multiple data sources, including research literature, expert opinion, and stakeholder perspectives. To explore this relationship further, we reviewed the nature of the existing research evidence base on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, considered prevailing stakeholder perspectives and professional tensions, and assessed the risks, responsibilities and regulatory role for communicating evidence. 3.2.1 Nature of the Existing Research Evidence Base To assess the research evidence base on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, we drew on our scoping review and targeted scan to identify the extant literature including evidence reviews and empirical studies. Evidence Reviews The 17 evidence reviews we identified all assessed some aspect of the relationship between chiropractic and immunity and varied considerably in terms of review quality. We aimed to categorize the reviews by type and could do so for 10 of the reviews (four systematic reviews, three narrative reviews, two scoping reviews, one rapid review) with the remaining seven articles representing a range of informal or unclear types of review. The four systematic reviews were each assessed using the Amstar 2 critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews,18 which indicated that each was conducted with reasonably high rigour and quality. Three of these four systematic reviews tackled research questions that assessed the effectiveness of spinal manipulation 9 therapy (SMT) for prevention or treatment of non-MSK disorders19,20 or on infectious disease/immune system outcomes.21 These systematic reviews were challenged by the paucity of good quality primary studies, with Gonclaves et al.20 identifying eight clinical studies (including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs)), Chow et al.21 identifying six RCTs, and Cote et al.19 identifying six RCTs for their respective research questions. Each of these systematic reviews similarly concluded that there was no evidence of an effect of SMT on prevention/treatment of non-MSK disorders or infectious disease/immune system outcomes. The fourth systematic review focused on the impact of SMT on changes in biochemical markers.22 The researchers identified eight RCTs for their respective research question. They concluded that spinal manipulation could increase some biochemical markers but future RCTs on symptomatic populations would be required to understand the clinical importance of their results.22 The three narrative reviews provided some methodological details for how their reviews were conducted, including databases searched and basic search terms or search strategies used. Both Colombi and Testa23 and McDowall24 add to a general conclusion that more and higher quality research on varying relationships between chiropractic and immunity is needed. Colombi and Testa23 state: Although spinal manipulations seem to trigger the activation of the neuroimmunoendocrine system, the evidence supporting a biological account for the application of [high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust] in clinical practice is mixed and conflicting. Further research on subjects with spinal MSK conditions with larger sample sizes are needed to obtain more insights about the biological effects of spinal manipulative therapy. McDowall24 notes further on the need for more higher quality research: The claim that SMT can affect the patient beyond muscle and joint pain cannot be substantiated due to the methodological bias and inconclusive evidence of the current literature. Improvements for future evidence quality may increase with better objective outcome measures, specified topics of research, double-blinding in randomised controlled trials and more controlled cohort studies to improve reproducibility. The third narrative review by Zhang and Yao25 focuses on a physiological response to SMT and concludes that: Conflicting reports on the relationship between TNF [tumour necrosis factor] and SMT were identified. Based on the newly discovered interaction between TNF and regulatory T cells, we proposed a putative biphasic TNF response to SMT, which may resolve the conflicts in the reported observations and interpretations. Beyond the four systematic reviews and three narrative reviews, the quality of the remaining evidence reviews was generally poor, with the majority providing minimal to no details on how their reviews were conducted. The one rapid review we identified published by the World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC)26 focused on assessing the effect of spinal adjustment/manipulation on immunity. Rapid reviews are characterized by the intent to provide transparent methodological trade-offs that sacrifice degrees of quality in order to produce results in constrained timelines. However, this review did not comply with basic guidance on the conduct or reporting of rapid reviews (e.g., WHO guidance on rapid reviews27). The WFC report provides minimal details on how the review was conducted or how the conclusions were determined and has been roundly critiqued by multiple sources since it was published in March 2020.15,28-31 10 We identified two reviews labelled as scoping reviews,31,32 both by the same core author group (we initially identified three scoping reviews but two were essentially duplicate articles published about a year apart).15,31,32 Neither of these reviews referred to scoping review methodologic guidance (e.g., Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al., Daudt et al. 8-10) nor did they provide any detail on how the reviews were conducted, including basic elements of the standard six-phase approach to scoping reviews. Thus, without greater transparency regarding how papers were identified, selected or synthesized for each of these reviews, the findings need to be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, both reviews are positioned to inform future research on the use of biomarkers following chiropractic interventions, with the two studies similarly concluding that the \"...results of the already available research demands that we further explore the neuro-immuno-regulatory effects of chiropractic, adjustment and spinal manipulation...\",15 and that the \"...results of this scoping review reveal the potential use and utility of salivary tests as measurements of immune biomarkers to explore the neuro-immuno-regulatory effects of chiropractic, adjustment and spinal manipulation\".32 Finally, we identified seven reviews that did not clearly acknowledge any particular review type, including three that did not provide any methodological details,33-35 and another four that provided only basic details of a review approach taken (e.g., databases searched, key words searched).36-39 These reviews addressed a range of topics linking chiropractic and immunity, including basic science research, neuro-immunity linkages to chiropractic, the role of alternative/complementary treatments for asthma and allergies, and patient education during the pandemic, however, given the limited methodological detail of these reviews, we have not weighted them further in our review. Empirical Studies In addition to the 17 reviews, we examined 40 experimental and observational studies. The nine experimental studies were inconclusive in their findings regarding the benefit of chiropractic intervention on immune system function. Two basic science studies examined the effects of chiropractic therapeutic interventions on animal models.40,41 Results were favourable but cannot be easily extrapolated to a clinical context. One quasi-experimental study examined SMT on inflammatory biomarkers in human subjects and found mixed results.42 Six randomized controlled trials examined impacts of chiropractic intervention on human subjects.43-48 All RCTs examined effects of SMT on biomarkers, except for one study that tested a biopsychosocial approach.43 The 19 observational studies we reviewed included two case-control studies,49,50 two cohort studies,51,52 12 case studies,53-64 and three case series,65-67 and, interestingly, all documented a positive relationship between chiropractic and immunity. While it is important to acknowledge the potential impacts of publication bias that may result from challenges disseminating negative results, it is also important to note that only one of these observational studies, a case-control study,50 clearly employed rigorous methods to address other potential biases in assessing chiropractic interventions. The remaining 18 observational studies, of which nine case studies or case series focused on pediatric or youth populations for a range of clinical concerns (e.g., allergies, asthma, chronic colds, fever, dermatitis, idiopathic arthritis, recurrent otitis media, respiratory syncytial virus, scoliosis, Prader Willi syndrome),53,54,57-59,61-64 and the nine other studies focused on adult populations for a similar range of clinical concerns (e.g., allergies, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, extramedullary plasmacytoma, psoriasis, salivary levels, blood indices),49,51,52,55,56,60,65-67 did not describe the methodological rigour required to address the important limitations of the study types employed to avoid biases from influencing their results. Therefore, the findings from these observational studies should be interpreted with considerable caution. In addition to the above noted observational studies, six other studies examined issues related to chiropractors and misinformation, with four studies focused on COVID-19-related misinformation involving 11 chiropractic websites and social media.68-71 All found some instances of what were deemed by the researchers to be inappropriate or misleading claims regarding chiropractic care and immune system function. The fifth study,72 conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, assessed the association between media attention and how vaccine information was presented on over 3,000 Canadian chiropractor websites, with the results indicating that only a small minority of these websites presented vaccination information and those that did mostly portrayed it negatively. The sixth study, published before the COVID-19 pandemic, assessed the nature of debates and critiques on Twitter of the efficacy and risks of SMT, including for immune system function, and concluded that while there is an abundance of tweets promoting chiropractic and SMT, there is minimal apparent critical debate on its efficacy or risks73. We also reviewed six survey-based studies that examined perceptions of various chiropractic stakeholder groups including chiropractors, chiropractic trainees and patients.74-79 Two studies involved surveys of chiropractic students.75,77 One of these survey studies aimed to determine the level of chiropractic conservativism (defined as the adherence to traditional and philosophical chiropractic values) among Danish chiropractic trainees.77 The researchers found that the more conservative the trainees' views on chiropractic the more 'inappropriate' their responses regarding the indications, non-indications and contra-indications of chiropractic for a number of representative scenarios (e.g., can spinal adjustments help the immune system). The other student-focused study aimed to develop a survey instrument to assess immunology knowledge among Australasian chiropractic students, and concluded that immunology training is deemed important to chiropractic students but that this training did not contribute to knowledge retention.75 Another two of the survey-based studies sought insights from chiropractors.74,79 An older survey of chiropractor practice patterns found that 43% reported treating patients under 18 for their immune system.79 A more recent cross-sectional survey of US chiropractors aimed to understand how they had been impacted by the pandemic, with a majority of respondents indicating that there was insufficient evidence to support claims of immune system benefit related to spinal manipulation, while 13% indicating that chiropractors should be advertising immunity benefits of chiropractic during the pandemic.74 And finally, two studies surveyed patients with cancer on their use of complementary and alternative medicines, including chiropractic care.76,78 One of these studies found that 56% of breast cancer patients believed these therapies would \"boost their immune system\",76 while the other found only 15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients held the same belief.72 3.2.2 Stakeholder Perspectives and Professional Tensions Regarding the Research Evidence Overall, the evidence base on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity suffers from both limited quantity of research evidence and limited quality of research evidence. The relative immaturity of the research evidence base was also observed to yield considerable commentary and contribute to tensions within the chiropractic profession. To capture the evolving professional tensions, we have summarized how the COVID-19 pandemic has put the relationship between chiropractic and immunity more sharply in focus and how the evidence base is interpreted and understood by key stakeholders. Professional Tensions On 19 March 2020, the World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC) published its rapid review of relevant research on the effect of spinal adjustment/manipulation on immunity and the immune system (cited above).26 In the WFC rapid review, the authors concluded that \"[a]t the time of writing, there exists no credible, scientific evidence that would permit claims of effectiveness for conferring or enhancing immunity through spinal adjustment/manipulation to be made in communications by chiropractors\" (p. 4). Ten days later, the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) published its own report on the evidence on immune function and chiropractic.80 While the ICA report echoed the WFC in asserting that \"no claims may be asserted that chiropractic is a prophylactic or cure for COVID-19\" (p. 2), the two reports differed in their 12 framing. Where ICA presented its findings in a \"vitalistic\" (p. 7) framework and argued for the importance of \"anecdotal evidence\" (p. 12),80 the WFC's report was framed in terms of the \"scientific method\" (p. 4).26 Both reports generated considerable attention and reaction. A number of articles have been published in support of the WFC's position4,69,71,81 and against the ICA report, specifically.4,81 There have also been several published rebuttals to the WFC report,15,28-31 and further rebuttals to the rebuttals,35,82 that primarily attack the methodological and epistemological credibility of the WFC report. In addition to the WFC and ICA reports, and in parallel to our research study, Chow et al.21 published a systematic review of scientific literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT in preventing infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes, and to examine the association between SMT and selected biomarkers. The authors found no clinical evidence from \"high- or acceptable-quality RCTs\" to \"support or refute claims\" (p. 6). They conclude that given this lack of evidence, further study is warranted to justify any such claims regarding chiropractic care and immunity. Shortly thereafter, The Chronicle of Chiropractic published a news brief on their website calling the review a \"hit piece\".83 In total, of the 13 commentaries identified through our scoping review, four were negative or critical about the connection between chiropractic care and immune system function.4,81,84,85 Two of these commentaries were written in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,81,84 including a united statement of the global chiropractic research community against unsubstantiated claims that chiropractic care boosts immunity.81 The signatories called for regulatory authorities and professional leaders to take political and regulatory actions against such claims. Similarly, a united statement of chiropractic students warned that regulatory inaction will result in damage to the credibility and reputation of chiropractors.84 Nine other commentaries, of which two were essentially duplicates,29,30 were more positive or favourable of the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. For the most part, these commentaries were tempered in their enthusiasm, but optimistic. One cautioned that chiropractors operate in a marketplace that demands research to substantiate claims, and chiropractors must be responsive to research results in order to maintain credibility.86 The author acknowledges a \"dynamic tension between our art, science, and philosophy\". Another commentary author asserts that chiropractors have observed that adjustments seem to improve immunoregulatory function, but at the same time chiropractors must view research results as preliminary and use them to open doors to further exploration of the issue.87 However, three of these commentaries were explicit critiques of the WFC and the united statement against unsubstantiated claims that chiropractic boosts immunity.30,82,83 These recent conflicts are not new to the chiropractic profession, with several key informants reflecting on the current controversy during their interview. Many acknowledged that the \"huge split in the profession\" [KI-103] from \"vitalism to non-vitalistic\" [KI-112] is a longstanding issue that has been \"amplified\" [KI-101] by the COVID-19 pandemic. In trying to be diplomatic, one key informant describes it as: You have two sides of this narrative. For one, those who are proponents of, '[w]e say yes, we do boost immunity.' Then ones who are on the very... skeptic, is the right word. [...] I think in this particular episode [COVID-19 pandemic], the chiropractic profession has a lot of political mess, spectrum-wise. [KI-110] While this tension in the profession is \"highly philosophical\" [KI-108] and goes back \"for a century\" felt that the \"age of social media\" given a \"megaphone\" [KI-102] to the [who] 13 want to maintain those roots\" [KI-111]. As one key informant said, \"[t]hey feel like they're being pigeonholed into the [musculoskeletal] world\" [KI-105], but as said by another: ...people have anchored to those philosophical roots and have never let go. And yet the majority of us have moved on and looked at science and, for the most of us, the profession has matured to scientific principles and scientific investigations... [KI-111] The two diametrically opposed camps of chiropractors do not readily trust nor accept the positions or commentary from the other group. These camps can be characterized along a spectrum of perspectives that culminate in polarized positionalities at their extremes. However, as Villanueva-Russell's work has previously observed in the context of the United States,2,3 frontline practitioners may be less polarized than professional leaders, and likely account for the majority of chiropractors. Nevertheless, the polarization derives from distinct epistemological positions, which reflect longstanding tensions between the vitalistic underpinnings of D.D. Palmer's original vision of chiropractic,11,12 and several decades of increasing pull towards a scientific orientation espoused by the broader 'evidence-based' paradigm shift in health care practice and policy.4,13 These epistemological tensions can often lead to unresolvable philosophical positions that tend to define ongoing discussion and debate and represent a defining feature of how evidence and context is understood in the field of chiropractic. Stakeholder Perspectives on the Research Evidence Given the professional tensions, we sought insights from a range of chiropractors on their interpretation of the evidence on the relationships between chiropractic and immunity. Generally, key informants accepted biologically plausible mechanisms in the link between chiropractic intervention and immune system function. As one key informant said, \"if you wanted to make the claim about mechanisms, you are on really decent ground\" [KI-104]. However, most were quick to say that biological plausibility does not confer clinical significance. While there may be promising basic science studies, clinical significance has yet to be demonstrated. One key informant cautions against basing policy decisions on biological plausibility alone: \"you can make a plausibility argument for almost anything, really...it's so remote from the realities of a clinical practice and a clinical trial\" [KI-111]. Further, key informants highlighted the \"multifactorial\" [KI-101] nature of immune system function and the \"million ways\" [KI-110] in which the immune system can be affected. In one key informant's view, \"it's disingenuous at least, and perhaps unethical, to say you're having those effects where there are many other reasons why those effects may have come to be\" [KI-102]. Most key informants, despite their personal beliefs or experiences, were clearly aligned with one informant's view that \"there is absolutely no indication of any clinical effectiveness in terms of immune stimulation\" [KI-117]. Further, some also argued that \"there's absolutely no reason to support treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders\" [KI-118]. Despite the resounding agreement that there is a lack of high quality clinical evidence, some key informants wanted to call attention to clinical and patient experience, which, in their view, is suggestive of a link between chiropractic care and immunity. As one key informant explained: You can't discredit all those stories. These are very intelligent people; they are not stupid... So, this thing about the immune system, every single chiropractor will tell you they've had cases where they 14 got some strange results with things that technically they might not have been treating [...] and I've interviewed so many patients who have told me about it, you just can't write it off. [KI-103] Many key informants were open to the idea that further research is needed to translate biological plausibility into clinical relevance. They felt that this is a \"healthy line of investigation\" [KI-106] that \"as all good researchers\" [KI-116]. In the opinion of one key informant, research on immunity and other non-MSK conditions is where the profession needs to go: I think we're done studying low back pain, all right? Let's figure out some other stuff, because we know that works. That's cool, but what else is going on? ... I do want to push the dial. I think it's important for our profession, and I think we get stuck in a corner sometimes. [KI-107] Others were more equivocal in their view on pursuing research on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. As one key informant said, \"does it deserve investigation? I think as a curiosity, yes. Should it be a priority? No.\" [KI-115]. Some questioned the value of such research and wondered \"why do chiropractors need this?\" [KI-101]. In some cases, key informants were quite adamant that this line of research should not be pursued: [T]o look at chiropractic care for immunity is so out in left field, given the evidence... There's nothing there. Why even go to second base when the evidence is clear that there's nothing there? [KI-115] Key informants identified several challenges to conducting randomized controlled trials for chiropractic interventions and its impact on immunity, including challenges for incorporating sham/placebo interventions [KI-103], blinding providers [KI-101], and subgrouping participants based on clinical characteristics [KI-105]. An overarching challenge noted by some key informants was the lack of research funding: \"I think the only real thing that's holding us back is funding\" [KI-104]. Where research is well funded, chiropractic researchers \"get kind of locked into studying pain\" [KI-107]. As one key informant explains, \"the marginalized stuff out there, like immunity, infantile colic, asthma, those types of things just haven't had the same type of funding funneled into because it's not really our bread and butter\" [KI-108]. Some key informants were cynical; in their view, chiropractic research is underfunded because \"there's no money in it\" [KI-105]: What I'm seeing is a very entrepreneurial approach by the contemporary college leaders to say, \"There's no money in research. Why should we be doing that? Let's focus on enrolment.\" ... As a result, most people gravitate towards the more easily acquired funding projects, such as for neck and back pain, disability conditions, pain disorders, and so forth. It would be very difficult to get funding for something other than that from an outside agency. [KI-118] 3.2.3 Risks, Responsibilities and Regulating the Communication of Evidence Beyond understanding the evidence base on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, there is considerable interest in how the relationship is communicated by chiropractors and what role regulators should play regarding misinformation and the risks to the public, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to our scoping review, targeted scan and key informant interviews, we sought to address these issues in our deliberative dialogues with chiropractic patients and health profession regulators. 15 The scoping review identified several articles that highlighted the potential for harm to patients and the public due to misinformation regarding the effects of chiropractic intervention and immune system function.69-71,73,81,84 In the context of COVID-19, several key informants commented on the public health risks related to communications on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, and in particular the challenges for public health messaging during a pandemic: I think about public health risk, and I think individual risk, not in terms of direct adverse events that [we] would expect from the intervention itself, but about the consequences and really the bio-psycho-social ramifications in these claims [...]. [I]t creates a lot of confusion in the public. [KI-115] Another key informant suggested that \"vaccination drives can be totally compromised\" [KI-117]. This kind of \"chaotic messaging\" runs the risk of \"jeopardiz[ing] the public\" [KI-110]. Beyond the public health perspective, several key informants commented on the risks to patient safety. The main concern for most key informants was the \"delay of care\" [KI-118], and that patients may \"not seek proper medical care\" [KI-117]. Other risks may be \"economical\": \"they're going to be coming in and paying for care that they did not need\" [KI-118]. One key informant was extremely concerned with the risk to public safety, especially given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: We're not talking about a toenail or inconsequential conditions here, we're talking about immunity when we have no evidence that [chiropractic] can [have impact]. Then patients are at risk of doing that at the expense of getting the care that they need. And that's the issue, and now that's where the public is at risk. And so, I think it's totally irresponsible to even go down that path [...] we're not talking about a sprained ankle here, we're talking about issues that [...] can impact life and death [...] so, we should close the door on not allowing any chiropractor to promote the using of chiropractic care to boost immunity, particularly in the time of COVID. [KI-111] However, the chiropractic patients who participated in the deliberative dialogue did not express major concerns about the risks associated with chiropractic claims that lack high quality evidence. It should be noted that despite our efforts to invite a diverse mix of chiropractic patients, the group that participated in the deliberative dialogue were relatively homogenous, with the patients self-characterizing as long-term chiropractic patients, supportive of the profession, and several either worked in chiropractic clinics or had close family members who were chiropractors. Nevertheless, the patients we spoke with did not fret about the risks and were more likely to focus on the perceived benefits of chiropractic. Most did not describe overly sophisticated approaches to finding a chiropractor or to seeking or appraising information on chiropractic treatment, and the consensus of the group was that social media was not an important influence. When questioned about the lack of high quality research evidence to support some chiropractic claims or the potentially excessive costs of regular and ongoing treatments that lack strong evidence of effectiveness, most did not recognize this as a problem and several asked why patients should not have ultimate responsibility for their treatment decisions. This issue of responsibility for professional communication is a major consideration for chiropractic and other health profession regulators. From the regulator perspective, the responsibility is complex and multifactorial. There is clearly an onus on the individual chiropractor grounded in their responsibility to obtain informed consent to provide treatment. Similarly, as the patients in the deliberative dialogue noted, there is always the patient's responsibility for individual decisions. However, health profession regulators are mandated to protect the public interest. This regulatory role is more challenging for chiropractic communications conducted via private and direct channels (e.g., for a typical clinical visit), while in contrast, 16 communications via public and indirect channels (e.g., via websites, blogs, social media postings) are much easier for the regulator (and other stakeholders) to monitor. In the health profession regulators' deliberative dialogue, several participants emphasized that the regulator role should be premised on a risk-based model that addresses context, relationships and consent, whereby greater risks require greater attention. While regulators must be reactive to professional transgressions, regulators can use a variety of proactive tools and levers to regulate communication. This can include general policies, standards or guidelines for advertising (e.g., https://cco.on.ca/wp-content/ uploads/2020/02/S-016.pdf; https://www.chirobc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CCBC-Professional-Conduct-Handbook-FEBRUARY-2021.pdf)) and the use of social media (e.g., https://cco.on.ca/wp-content/ uploads/2019/12/G-012.pdf) as well as more targeted policies such as CCO's provisional advisory on vaccination and immunization (https://cco.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Professional-Advisory-Vaccination-April302019.pdf) and the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia's 'efficacy claims policy' that specifically addresses the communication of evidence. This latter policy states that (https://www.chiro bc.com/standards-legislation/standards-of-practice/efficacy-claims): Due to the absence of acceptable evidence supporting such claims, registrants must NOT represent to patients or the public that chiropractic: a. can be used to treat diseases, disorders or conditions such as: Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, infections, infertility, or Tourette's syndrome, or b. has any beneficial effect on childhood diseases, disorders or conditions such as ADHD (or ADD), autism spectrum disorders including Asperger syndrome, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, or developmental and speech disorders. c. has any beneficial effect on fetal development or position such as breech/breech turning or position and intrauterine/in utero constraint. d. has any beneficial effect on labour or birth such as easier or shorter labour, preventing the need for medical interventions and preventing premature or traumatic birth. e. has any beneficial effect on hormone function or postpartum depression. These policies are inherently controversial and highlight the conceptualization, role and expectations of research evidence in regulating the profession. The health profession regulators participating in our deliberative dialogue noted that each profession has a different context and relationship to academia. Those professions that have strong and active research streams (e.g., medicine, nursing) can operate with different expectations for the role of evidence than professions where the research capacity is less developed. However, in either context, the regulators emphasized the importance of partnerships with other professional stakeholders and the important role of regulators acting as a conduit to relevant expertise and evidence. In addition to the above considerations of risks, responsibilities and regulating the communication of evidence on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity, risks to the chiropractic profession were also identified.20,84,85 As one key informant put it, this is a question of professional integrity across the country\" [KI-112]. Not only is public trust damaged, but \"it hurts our trust factor within the healthcare system\" [KI-106]. Some key informants felt that communicating publicly about chiropractic care and immunity \"paints the whole profession in a bad light\" [KI-108] and is \"a big risk to the credibility of our profession\" [KI-111]. One key informant summed up the situation with a stark warning that there is a grave risk to the existence of the chiropractic profession: \"Having a chiropractic profession is not a God given right. If you don't realize it has to evolve with the science and with the times, you can lose the entire profession\" [KI-102]. Another key informant added that there are chiropractors who aim to: 17 ...add credibility to our profession by doing medical reviews, clinical trials, publishing in high-ranking journals and then we get these people there that for every two steps we go forward, we're going five steps backwards because the public perception is that we're really not out there to protect the public. We're out there to line our own pockets... [KI-111] However, some key informants pondered what might be permissible to communicate publicly. As one key informant said, \"I don't think there's any harm in teaching and giving patients strategies to live as healthfully as possible\" [KI-101]. These key informants saw a role for chiropractors to \"be part of the public health movement by sharing how they support exercise, increase nutrition awareness...I think we can say we can be partners\" [KI-106]. Another key informant felt that there was a risk to the public by not discussing this issue publicly: I think it's great that there's open dialogue. The fact that people are talking about whether immunity is correlated to a chiropractic relationship is a really important discussion to put into a public domain. [KI-113] 4. DISCUSSION The context for this project is COVID-19 - a pandemic that goes beyond a generational occurrence to present a once-in-a-lifetime challenge; a pandemic where immunity and vaccinations are controversial topics and central to ongoing narratives and broader social debate; a pandemic context that exacerbates already existing and deep tensions in the chiropractic profession where any type of consensus seems far away. Ultimately, this project was commissioned by CCO to examine the evidence base for claims of immunity due to chiropractic care to inform the regulatory body's policy considerations as it exercises its statutory mandate to regulate all of chiropractic in the public interest. We employed multiple methods to produce a range of insights that have been described above. There are several key takeaways from our work. First, it is almost impossible to ignore the professional tensions and the spectrum of chiropractic views when assessing any issue affecting chiropractic. Our interviews with a range of chiropractic experts and stakeholders echoed the literature - there are two camps that are at odds with one another, have distinct philosophies, epistemologies and orientations towards chiropractic practice that reflect entrenched professional positions. We characterized one camp as privileging vitalistic chiropractic values (e.g., drawing on the natural healing force within the body that is expressed through the central nervous system), while we characterized the other camp as privileging scientific values and the contemporary evidence-based paradigm (e.g., emphasizing the relative quality of research evidence through adherence to an explicit hierarchy based on the risk of bias for different study designs). While there are other documented ways of characterizing these opposing camps11,93, the underlying tensions underscore key challenges in the profession, particularly when considering the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. Some key informants reflected on the possibility, and desirability, of reconciling these tensions. One skeptic noted that: \"...we've been trying to do it for a hundred years and it's not happening. The more we try to provide evidence and try to unify our profession towards a single goal, the more we get resistance from a small group of people...\" [KI-111]. However, others suggested that \"the two camps have to get together for the good of the public\" [KI-113] and \"there's a place for everybody\" [KI-101]. One key informant argued that the disunity \"...is creating a problem [...] let's move on; let's agree to disagree\" [KI-110]. According to another key informant, there is optimism to reconcile differences if the two camps can build \"....trust among the commonalities [...], that there [are] much greater commonalities than there [are] differences, [...] the 18 dedication of patient care, patient outcomes, [...] values with respect to our personal practices, [...] everybody [is] passionate about the profession...\" [KI-116]. Second, in light of the professional tensions, our work highlighted a critical need to develop greater clarity on key concepts to inform policies and actions. On the face of it, terms like 'chiropractic' and 'immunity' would seem self-explanatory, but this work indicates they are anything but. A key challenge in providing clarity on these fundamental terms for the chiropractic profession appears to be the underlying disagreement about what constitutes 'chiropractic' and what 'immunity' impacts are deemed to be important. But without the ability to apply some common conceptualizations to these key terms, the prospects for prioritizing research and solidifying the evidence base appear daunting. In addition to conceptual clarity for chiropractic and immunity, we observed similar ambiguity surrounding two other key terms - 'evidence' and 'risk'. The lack of consensus on what should constitute 'evidence' for chiropractic may not be surprising given that a scientific orientation is core to the scientific camp, but we observed several examples from putative members of the vitalist camp that acknowledge forms of evidence hierarchies, suggesting there may be some room to develop greater consensus on the term. The fourth term that could benefit from conceptual clarity is the multidimensional concept of 'risk'. Health profession regulators, including CCO, use the concept of risk as a foundational principle, but the multiple ways that risk can be framed (e.g., from the perspective of the patient, the public, the health system, public and private payers/insurers, the researcher, the chiropractic profession and the individual chiropractor) can create confusion. Particularly in light of the tensions in the chiropractic profession, efforts to unpack the nature of risks associated with avoiding potential harms vs. neglecting potential benefits would be helpful in guiding efforts of the research community to contribute to a more relevant evidence base. Third, and most fundamental to this project was the results of the review of research evidence. There is a lack of high quality empirical research studies but a number of low quality research studies that purport a positive relationship between chiropractic and immunity. We did identify a few randomized controlled trials, but they focused on biomarkers that were suggestive of a biologically plausible mechanism between chiropractic and immunity. These studies that focused on biological plausibility are not designed to confer insights of clinical significance, while the low quality studies are highly susceptible to biases and thus their value in building an evidence base in support of a positive relationship between chiropractic and immunity is minimal. We also identified a number of evidence reviews, with the majority not providing clear descriptions of the review method used. However, we did identify four systematic reviews all published in the last four years that were of reasonably good quality and may indicate a positive trend in the field. Three of these reviews focused on SMT and found no evidence of effect for treatment or prevention of non-MSK disorders or immune system function. The fourth systematic review also focused on SMT and concluded that there is moderate quality evidence that spinal manipulation can influence biomarkers but the clinical importance of the findings is unknown. More importantly, although we acknowledge there are different perceptions of the overall value of the available evidence base, there does seem to be some consensus that more research is needed. This consensus is important as it highlights a potential area of commonality among those representing different chiropractic camps and interests. However, a common call for more research does not necessarily equate to consensus on what the research priorities should be. Our interviews with key informants suggested that there are distinct views on where scarce research funds should be directed, and importantly, who should play a central role in directing those funds. Overall, chiropractic research lacks dedicated infrastructure, capacity and clear leadership for developing a relevant research agenda. Fourth, the professional positionality of chiropractic is important. How is chiropractic contextualized within the prevailing health and higher education systems? Is it fair to characterize the position of chiropractors as complementary (sometimes marginalized, non-mainstream) health care providers who have achieved 19 statutory self-regulatory status but not inclusion or integration in prevailing university/academic systems or publicly funded health care like many conventional biomedical providers? This positionality represents a more summative issue, which depends on how the profession collectively positions itself on the other points of contention noted above. And while there are hyper-sensitivities among proponents of both chiropractic camps, is there apathy among chiropractors in the middle of the spectrum of views? How big is this middle group? Are their views homogenous or heterogeneous? Should their voice be louder? Professional identity may give rise to much of the discourse within the chiropractic profession, but is it something that should be driven from the middle rather than the extremes of the chiropractic professional spectrum? Does pursuing improved professional positionality represent an overarching and consensus-supporting aim for the profession? If so, how can it be achieved and which stakeholders are best positioned to support that effort? In conclusion, we aimed to assess the evidence base for claims of immunity due to chiropractic care to inform CCO's policy considerations. Our review results align with other well-conducted reviews that the current research evidence base does not provide sufficient justification for claiming a positive, clinically relevant relationship between chiropractic and immunity. Our interviews and deliberative dialogues with stakeholders provide further insight, pointing to some core challenges, including entrenched professional positions and the lack of a clear voice for the majority middle of the profession, ambiguity surrounding key concepts that underscore challenges developing a relevant evidence base, and consensus on the need for more research but not necessarily on how research priorities should be set. In the short-term, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCO should be confident in fulfilling its regulatory role to protect the public from unsupported immunity claims related to chiropractic interventions. In the longer-term, CCO may wish to consider what role it can/should play in (i) supporting the development of conceptual clarity of key chiropractic terms, (ii) advocating for and/or informing the prioritization/targeting of dedicated research funding for chiropractic, (iii) contributing to the reduction in professional tensions and/or identify opportunities for collaboration, and (iv) assessing the multidimensional risks related to shifting the positionality of chiropractic within the broader health and higher education systems. 20 REFERENCES 1.

Scoping Review Scoping reviews involve iterative search strategies, informed by ongoing review of results and expert consultation. The scoping review approach is both feasible and flexible and allowed us to identify important topics and key sources of evidence on the relationship between chiropractic and immunity. The scoping review was based on the six-phase methodology set out by Arksey and O'Malley (2005)8 and expanded and refined by Levac et al. (2010)9 and Daudt et al. (2013)10. The aim of the scoping review is to identify and map the scholarly and grey literature on chiropractic care and immunity/immune system function. The specific review question is what evidence exists on the relationship between chiropractic care and immunity/immune system function? Databases We searched four databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Index of Chiropractic Literature, as well as structured searches of Google Scholar and Google. Search strategies The specific search strategies for each database searched are included below. For Google and Google Scholar, we conducted three separate searches and pulled the top 100 results for the first search and the top 50 results for each subsequent search. We also searched the reference lists of two recent reviews on the topic by the World Federation of Chiropractic and the International Chiropractors Association. We also reviewed articles that were provided to us by CCO and key informants.

For the Google and Google Scholar results, we screened the titles and clicked through links to determine articles eligible for full-text review. These articles were also reviewed by one researcher (JB), with 10% screened by a second researcher (CL). Discrepancies were reviewed by a third researcher (MJD). For the Index to Chiropractic Literature search results, titles and abstracts were screened and full text articles were reviewed by one researcher (JB), with all full text articles reviewed by a second researcher (MJD). A2. Targeted Scan We conducted a targeted scan primarily of peer chiropractic regulatory organizations to identify the evidence used, if any, to inform their standards of practice, policies, or guidelines regarding claims of health benefit for immune system function. Using Google advanced site searches and manual searches of the targeted site's available search functionality, we scanned the websites of 45 Canadian and international chiropractic regulatory bodies, associations, specialty colleges, and educational institutions for relevant documentation. Where standards of practice, policies, or guidelines on the topic of chiropractic care and immune function were found, we looked for any cited evidence. Cited evidence was pulled and incorporated into the final set of studies included in the scoping review. A3. Key Informant Interviews Using a semi-structured interview guide (see below), we probed key informant knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of chiropractic care and immunity/ immune system function. Topics included: 1) definitional challenges, 2) understanding of the relationship between chiropractic care and immunity, 3) knowledge of the evidence base regarding such claims, and 4) public communication issues. With consent, interviews were video recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interviews ranged from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. Transcripts were managed using NVivo qualitative data management software.89 We used a qualitative descriptive approach to data analysis.90,91 An initial coding framework was derived from the interview guide and new codes emerged from the data in the process of coding. Interview Guide Preamble: The Accessing Centre for Expertise (ACE) at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, has been contracted by the College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) to conduct an evaluation of policy-relevant evidence on regulatory standards of practice regarding claims of health benefit from chiropractic care. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCO has observed an increase in the number of complaints regarding chiropractors making health benefits claims due to chiropractic, specifically claims related to immunity benefits that are deemed to lack both a scientific evidence base and expert consensus. CCO would like to develop a policy for how to address what is 28 permissible and what is not permissible in relation to chiropractors making health benefits claims regarding immunity and, in particular, what constitutes a sufficient evidence base for such claims. To consider these challenges, this study will proceed in three phases, (i) scoping review and targeted scan of policy documents, (ii) key informant interviews, and (iii) deliberative dialogues with stakeholders. The Principal Investigator for this study is Dr. Mark Dobrow (Associate Professor at IHPME, and Director of ACE). My name is Jessica Bytautas and I'm a Research Assistant with ACE and a PhD student in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.

Deliberative Dialogues Each deliberative dialogue was conducted under Chatham House rule (https://www.chathamhouse.org/ about-us/chatham-house-rule). With consent, deliberative dialogues were video recorded. The dialogues ranged from 90 minutes to 150 minutes. Each dialogue followed a similar agenda opening with an overview of the deliberative dialogue process, introductions, overview of the project and findings to date, main discussion, and then summary and wrap-up. The deliberative dialogue with chiropractic patients included two main discussion topics. The first discussion topic focused on patient perspectives on seeking chiropractic treatment, including the types of health problem/concern that would initiate a chiropractic visit, how chiropractors were identified, and the characteristics and qualities of chiropractors that were liked best/least. The second discussion topic focused on patient perspectives of the communication of information on chiropractors and chiropractic treatment, including where patients typically look for information on health/wellness, approaches to assessing the quality of this information, considering the relative importance of various communication channels and modalities, and responsibility for protecting patient interests. The deliberative dialogue with health profession regulators in the province of Ontario focused on four questions, including (1) what they saw as the main roles that health profession regulators can play regarding health professionals' communication of evidence to patients and the public, (2) how different communication factors (channels, modalities, content complexity) impact on the feasibility and effectiveness of the health profession regulator role to regulate the communication of evidence to patients and the public, (3) how different health professions compare regarding evidence requirements, standards, thresholds or expectations, and (4) their general advice on how the communication of evidence to patients and the public should be regulated? Data from the deliberative dialogues were analyzed thematically and integrated with the analysis from the scoping review and key informant interviews. 30 APPENDIX B: SCOPING REVIEW - LIST OF INCLUDED ARTICLES Primary Studies Experimental Basic Science 40Conesa-Buendia, F. et al.
