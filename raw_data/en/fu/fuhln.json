No objection was received by this Collectorate in response to said notification. The Indenting Department, in the above mentioned indent, has requested this Collectorate to acquire the said land under PNC mode as the same is urgently needed for the public purpose i. e. erection of transmission line towers. Accordingly, the case was placed in the Collectors meeting held on 17-10-2018 under the Chairmanship of District Collector, Reasi. PRINCIPLE OF COMPENSATION UNDER PNC MODE The Tehsildar, Reasi has submitted that the average sale deed rate for the last three years in Village Reasi is Rs. 4,50,640/-. The Stamp Duty rates for the year 2018-19 for the said village are Rs. 16.00 lacs for residential and Rs. 18.00 lacs for commercial land per local kanal. On the basis of Stamp Duty rates and average sale deed rate, the Collector concerned recommended a rate of Rs. 27.00 lacs per local kanal for approval in the Collectors meeting under PNC mode, with the justification that a rate of land compensation to the tune of Rs. 27.00 lacs per local kanal irrespective of classification of kind of soil was appraoved in the same village in the Collectors meeting held on 02-12-2017. Thereafter, the case of land acquisition was placed in Collectors meeting held on 17-10-2018 under the Chairmanship of District Collector, Reasi in which Executive Engineer, S&O, PDD, Jammu on behalf of Indenting Department and land owners were present. The land owners demanded exorbitant rate on the pretext that even though only small piece of land is being acquired for installation of towers but the land that has actually been rendered less useful under the corridor of transmission line is much more in quantum. The proposed rate of land compensation and rate demanded by the land owners were discussed in the said meeting and after thorough negotiations with the land owners and Indenting Department, the committee stick to the rate of land compensation already approved for the same purpose for the same village and hence, Rs. 27.00 lacs (Ruppes twenty seven lacs only) per kanal irrespective of clssification of kind of soil is approved by the committee, for which land owners also expressed their willingness.
