Although these positions do not have general line management responsibility they are a catalyst to draw together local Managers from various Divisions to solve Corporation-wide problems. To that end, they leadState Executives and facilitate information flow to staff and management. In early 2001 State and Territory Directors were allocated responsibility for major property projects, such as Canberra, Sydney and Perth. They also oversee significant program developments like the plannedreintroduction of TV News to Canberra and the commencement of Stateline in the national capital in 2001.The Corporation maintained a firm focus on its public broadcasting responsibilities during a year in which digital broadcasting became a reality. Looking to the future of digital media, the Board has taken steps to ensure that ABC services adequately reflect the needs and interests of all Australians,no matter where they live, and thus remain of relevance and value. The Board reallocated resources to establish new digital television services and to continue the growth of the ABC's new media services. Later in theyear, with the assistance of additional Government funding, it added furthersupport to the Corporation's commitment to non-metropolitan Australia inallocating resources for new local and national programming. As this annual report describes, the year was one of significant achievement. The Corporation successfully introduced digital televisiontransmission technology in accordance with the timetable mandated by theGovernment. Among programming highlights was the highly valued radiocoverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and associated events such as theOlympic Torch Relay through Australia. On television, the ABC made an outstanding contribution with its presentation of the Paralympic Games which attracted unprecedentedaudiences. ABC Online continued to grow strongly as more Australiansbecame regular Internet users and the quality of the Corporation's sitesproved a powerful attraction. The Centenary of Australian Federation wascelebrated throughout the year with specially produced high qualityprogramming on radio, television and online. The new divisional structure for the Corporation, endorsed by the Board and announced in late June 2000, was implemented during the year. The Board gave renewed attention to the Corporation's responsibilities to provide innovative and comprehensive high standard broadcasting serviceswhich inform, educate and entertain. It agreed to the statement ofprogramming and development genres, discussed elsewhere in this report,which properly reflect the Corporation's public broadcasting obligations andagainst which the output of the ABC's television, radio and new mediaservices will in future be considered. Funding the Corporation While the Corporation has some clearly defined opportunities to raise revenue to support its activities, it remains the case that the principal sourceof funding for public broadcasting in Australia must continue to be theFederal Government. It is the Board's responsibility to ensure that theCorporation's needs are properly assessed and represented to theGovernment. The reporting year was the first covering the ABC's current Triennial Funding Agreement with the Federal Government. In the detailed fundingsubmission made by the Corporation to the Government in late 1999,additional operational funding of $194 million over three years was sought toYear of achievement 18Statement by ABC Board of Directors 19Statement by ABC Board of Directors support Corporate Plan objectives of expanded Australian content, services to local communities, provision of additional online content and establishmentof digital services. The 2000 Federal Budget essentially maintained ABC funding in real terms, while providing assistance with the second phase of the ABC'stechnical preparation for digital broadcasting. In expressing disappointmentthat the Government had not at that stage committed to the additionalfunding sought, the Corporation indicated it would continue to demonstrateto the Parliament its enthusiasm about the opportunities presented by digitalbroadcasting and the pivotal role the ABC must play in extending the choicesavailable to all Australians in the digital era. As a result the Board in December 2000 approved a new submission to Government seeking additional funding for programming and contentinitiatives of national significance. This submission resulted in additionalfunding of some $71.2 million over four years being provided in the 2001Federal Budget \u2014 the first such additional funding for programming since themid 1980s. The Board determined that this funding would be allocated inaccordance with the priorities set out in its statement of National InterestInitiatives. The Board is continuing to give attention to the issue of quantifying proper funding levels to support the full range of ABC activities. It has indicated itsintention of engaging further with the Government on this issue. Australian content In the face of globalisation trends and concerns about the impact on Australia's national cultural interests from domination by the world's largestmedia content producers, the issue of Australian content on televisioncontinues to be an important one for the national broadcaster. The ABC has over the years had success with high quality Australian-made television drama. This is inherently very expensiveprogramming to produce. While drama production is continuing and anumber of new projects are in production or development, withoutadditional funding the Corporation's production of television drama mustremain limited to a level lower than the Board would wish. During the year ABC Television has also focussed on its strengths in other program genres. At year's end Television announced a major revision to itsschedule, bringing forward a host of new programs in a variety of formatsand genres \u2014 some for the first time on the public broadcaster. The changesmean that almost 70 per cent of programming screening on ABC Televisionbetween 6 pm and 11pm will be Australian. This represents an increase inlocal content of more than 18 per cent over the week. International broadcastingThe requirement for the Corporation to broadcast outside Australia programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment is aspecific provision of the ABC Charter included in the ABC Act. The Act requiresthat these broadcasts encourage awareness of Australia and an internationalunderstanding of Australian attitudes on world affairs. They are also to enableAustralian citizens living or travelling outside Australia to obtain informationabout Australian affairs and Australian attitudes about world affairs. In previous annual reports the Board has indicated its continuing dissatisfaction with the effect of the reductions to Radio Australia servicesbrought about by the cutbacks to ABC base level funding in 1996-97. At atime of continuing social, political and economic volatility in Australia'simmediate neighbourhood, the Board remained concerned that existingresource levels were not enabling the Corporation to meet adequately itsinternational broadcasting responsibilities. Of most concern was the decisionto shut down from July 1997 the short wave broadcasts from facilities at CoxPeninsula in the Northern Territory, which left large traditional RadioAustralia audiences without their regular broadcasts. Radio Australia achieved outstanding results in finding alternative means of program distribution through significantly expanded rebroadcastingagreements with local broadcasters in the target areas and the provision withAusAid funding of satellite downlinks to enable local broadcasting of RadioAustralia programs. Adequate short wave broadcasts remained an unfulfilledbut nonetheless essential requirement. The Board was delighted therefore with developments during the year which have put the ABC's international broadcasting activities into a stronger,more positive framework. The Government's agreement in August 2000 to provide additional funding to enhance Radio Australia's shortwave transmissions, expandedsatellite capacity and additional downlinks for rebroadcasting purposes wasvery welcome. It has enabled expanded transmissions in Indonesian,Mandarin, Vietnamese, Khmer as well as English, from Cox Peninsula andthree offshore sites. The allocation of financial assistance in March 2001 to prevent disruption from the unexpected cessation of the satellite distribution facility used forRadio Australia services was a further welcome indication of theGovernment's renewed commitment to international broadcasting which waswelcomed by the Board. In a most significant further development, the Government announced in June 2001 that the ABC would be funded to re-establish in a new andenhanced form an international television service to the Asia Pacific region.Due to ongoing funding difficulties the Corporation had disposed of its thenexisting international television service in 1997. The new service, expected tocommence from late 2001, will provide a high quality programming mix,including original news and current affairs programs, and a cross mediastrategy building on existing ABC and Radio Australia websites. 20Statement by ABC Board of Directors21Statement by ABC Board of Directors The Board is especially pleased to note this recognition of the importance to Australia's national interest of the availability of quality, distinctlyAustralian, international broadcasting services in our region. Community consultationThe ABC Advisory Council provides an important source of community advice about ABC programs to the Board and to ABC broadcasters. The Board'sSubcommittee met with the Council's Convenor following each of Council'sfour formal meetings during the year and and the Subcommittee and Councilalso met jointly in May 2000. The Board encourages ABC networks to considercarefully the recommendations and assessments provided by Council whosemembers represent a diversity of listener, viewer and online user opinionfrom around Australia. Each year new Council members are appointed by the Board to replace members who have completed their three year terms. The Board is gratifiedthat appointment to Council continues to interest so many Australians, withover two thousand inquiries received in relation to the most recentvacancies. The Board is also seeking to further develop the profile of Council, including the provision of an improved more accessible Council website. The Corporation has extensive communications with its audiences, through written and telephone contacts to corporate as well as individualprogram areas and increasingly through electronic mail to the ABC commentsaddress. During the year these contacts continued at a high level, asindicated elsewhere in this report, due to community interest in thestructural changes taking place in the Corporation and developments in radioand television programming. The Board values this contact and notes that itsextent and nature reflects the continuing significance and position of theCorporation in the life of Australians. The development of online forums has proved to be a valuable and growing method of communication between the ABC and its audiences.Selected individual programs are now regularly followed by an online forumin which program makers are able to talk directly with their audiences andintroduce other experts and commentators into an expanded discussion ofthe topic dealt with in the program itself. Renewed attention is also being given to the Corporation's audience and program research capabilities, to assist with future evaluation of programdevelopment and performance. Corporate PlanThe Corporate Plan sets out the Corporation's national public broadcasting objectives and priorities and the quantitative and qualitative measures bywhich it assesses how succesfully it has achieved these objectives. The existing ABC Corporate Plan 1999-2002 is being revised to take account of the many developments in the Corporation's activities over theintervening period, the new divisional structure for the Corporation and to give effect to developing accountability and governance processes. The Board held a separate corporate planning forum, including a valuable session in which the Corporation's Executive Directors participated.The outputs from these planning sessions will inform the revised three-yearABC Corporate Plan which will take effect in 2001-2002. The development of the new Corporate Plan is part of a general realignment of the ABC's planning and reporting processes. This work willassist to strengthen the Corporation's governance practices, provide greatertransparency and further contribute to accountability. Editorial PoliciesUnder the provisions of the ABC Act, it is the Board's duty to maintain the Corporation's independence and integrity, to ensure that gathering andpresentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according tothe recognised standards of objective journalism and to develop programcodes of practice. In this respect a review of the ABC's Editorial Policies is being completed. Last reviewed and approved by the Board in 1998, the Policies set out theprinciples and practices to be observed by ABC broadcasters and programmakers which underpin the work of the national broadcaster. The Policies arereviewed in the light of experience, changing needs and circumstances andare generally reviewed every three years. The review of the Editorial Policies is a comprehensive and consultative exercise, involving an internal working party with representatives of alldivisions, comments being sought on proposals from staff, staff associationsand the ABC Advisory Council prior to consideration by a Working Group of theBoard and finally by the Board itself. The review will be completed in late 2001. The BoardThe five year term of appointment of Board Director Russell Bate concluded on 20 December 2000. The Board records its great appreciation forhis valued contribution to the Board's work over that term. During the yearthe Government also appointed Board Director Professor Judith Sloan asDeputy Chair, and Leith Boully and Maurice Newman AM as Board Directors. The Board commends this report to the Parliament and the people of Australia.

In October 1999, the Board determined that it would be more proactively involved in guiding the policy directions of the Corporation. Specifically theBoard wished to make an ongoing assessment of the ABC's performance inkey strategic policy areas such as program accountability, editorial issues,meeting the needs of regional Australia and international broadcasting. In general, a more active approach to corporate governance acknowledges the trend to increased accountability, required of public andprivate sector organisations throughout Australia. More particularly, it reflectsthe desire to re-define public debate about the role, effectiveness andfunding of the ABC in the context of a fast-changing media environment. Since his appointment in March 2000, Managing Director, Jonathan Shier has instigated wide-ranging changes to the organisation structure andmanagement teams; and has strengthened planning, performancemeasurement and accountability processes. Management structure Strategic support Corporate planningThe Managing Director is responsible for managing the affairs of the Corporation, subject to policies and directions determined by the ABC Board.The divisional organisation structure for the Corporation is included in thisreport. The Managing Director chairs fortnightly meetings of the ExecutiveDirectors. In addition the following meetings of Executive Directors are heldfortnightly: Operations, Content, and Corporate Development. A Marketingand Communications group also meets fortnightly. Through these meetingsthe Executive Management of the Corporation considers issues anddetermines directions to be taken in the respective areas of the Corporation'sactivity. The Corporation has established a high-level Corporate Planning and Governance unit attached to the office of the Managing Director. Its role is toprovide strategic support to the Managing Director and coordinate corporategovernance activities through mechanisms like corporate and divisionalplanning, policy co-ordination, the oversighting of performance processesand cross-divisional liaison. The Finance, Funding and Support Servicesdivision has also established two specialist units to support enhancedCorporation-wide performance \u2014 Business Development and Performance;and Risk Planning. The preparation of a new Corporate Plan, for implementation in 2001-2002, has been an opportunity to revitalise the link between the Boardand management in discussing and endorsing overall strategic direction. Thishas proceeded in parallel with the development of key performance25Corporate Governance indicators that will underpin corporate and divisional plans. Together these will result in improved strategic alignment of the ABC's three mainaccountability instruments: the three year rolling Corporate Plan, the annualPortfolio Budget Statement, and the Annual Report. International benchmarkingThe ABC is collaborating with a group of five other comparable national broadcasters to develop what will be the first system in the world to providea common benchmarking currency for national broadcasters. The groupacknowledged the particular mission and characteristics of national publicbroadcasting. These meant it was unsatisfactory to rely entirely oncomparison with the performance of commercial broadcasters working todifferent expectations in their respective countries. Further information onthis project is provided in the Funding Finance and Support Services sectionof this report. AccountabilityOverall the new organisation structure provides for more direct accountability of functions and individual managers. As a general principle,ABC managers are individually accountable for performance in theirrespective areas, whether editorial or administrative in nature. Accountabilityis under-pinned by a new Corporation-wide performance managementsystem that embodies individual job planning and performance assessmentacross all staff classifications. Internal auditDetails of the Corporation's internal audit arrangements are set out in Appendix 5. Ethical standardsIn October 2000 the Corporation published an important statement of ABC workplace and conduct principles: ABC Workplace Values and Code of Conduct . The Code establishes the principles of conduct to be observed by ABC staff in keeping with the ethical standards expected of and by theCorporation. The Code sets out specific conduct requirements and providesinformation on issues of judgment both within the workplace and when staffare representing the Corporation externally.To fund its activities in 2000-2001, the ABC received $764.3m (including $100m of borrowings) from Government and $113m from other sources.Government Appropriation comprises a number of elements, including funding forTransmissionin digitaland analog,Capital UseCharges, andDigitalCapital. The chart, left, demonstrates theABC's vs actualsources for funds for 2000-2001 and its budgetedsources for 2001-2002. Sources of ABC Funding Application of fundsThe chart below broadly represents the ABC's application of funds by function for the 2000-2001 financial year. 26Financial Summary The ABC operated within the limits of its total sources of funds and Government appropriations for the 2000-2001 financial year.

The divisions of NationalNetworks and Local and RegionalServices were disbanded and theCorporation organised alongmedia output lines. As a result,national, local and regionalservices are now supportedacross the Corporation ratherthan being the responsibility ofspecific divisions. Output 1.1 and1.2 are assessed briefly below,and in greater depth throughoutthis report, in particular inDivisional reviews of the year'sactivities. Output 1.1 -National NetworksThe ABC will through its nationalnetworks, satisfy diverse audienceneeds, nationally andinternationally, through the deliveryof innovative and distinctiveprograms and services acrosstelevision, radio and online media.Performance indicators 1.1 Quality \u00b7 Positive qualitative audience response \u00b7 Community and peer recognition Quantity\u00b7 Audience share and reach\u00b7 Geographic reach of Radio Australia measured by deliverysystem capabilities \u00b7 Australian content levels on each network (music on radio)Outcome one The ABC will create and deliver distinctive programming and services; inform, entertain and educate its audiences; anddevelop cultural and communityidentity .

Following a review of the methodology of past surveys, the ABC isdeveloping a new style of quality survey designed to provide morecomprehensive and useful information. Community and peer recognition is also assessed through other means such as: \u00b7 The number and importance of awards won by the ABC \u2014 these are shown in Appendix 17 and include a range of prestigious peer reviewawards such as at international film and television festivals, nationalWalkley awards, cinematographers' awards, Internet awards, writers'awards. . Audience response through telephone calls, letters and emails, and personal contact between the ABC local radio stations and thecommunities which they serve, also provide the ABC with input about itsprograms and services. \u00b7 Reviews of programs published in newspapers, magazines and online throughout the nation \u2014 including metropolitan newspapers, nationalmagazines, websites, and local and regional newspapers, these reviews arenot quantified but are monitored and kept for reference by program makers. Quantity Audience reach and share - ABC Television Audience reach and share for all networks are shown in Divisional reports for Radio and Television. During the year two different systems ofmeasuring reach and share for television were used \u2014 ACNielsen and, fromJanuary 2001, OzTam. Both systems are reported on below. \u00b7ABC Television average weekly reach across the five major Metropolitan areas was 68.1 per cent from July to December 2000 (ACNielsen) and73.9% from January to June, 2001 (OzTam). In the previous year thefigure was put at 69.9 per cent. \u00b7Average regional weekly reach was 70 per cent, an increase of 1.7 per cent over the previous year's 69.9 per cent. \u00b7Average five-city weekly share using ACNielsen data from 1 July to 31 December 2000 was 15.5 (6.00pm to midnight) and, from 1 January to 30June 2001 using OzTam data was 14.8 (6.00pm to midnight). In 1999-2000 the average five-city share was 15.3 (6.00pm to midnight) andin 1998-99 this figure was 14.9. Full details of ABC Television average reach and share is in the Television division report. Geographic reach of Radio Australia measured by delivery system capabilities See details of coverage and delivery systems in map on page 56.Assessment30Outcomes and Outputs Australian content on Television Australian content on television in 2000-2001 increased to 58 per cent between 6.00am and midnight and 57.8 per cent between 6.00pm andmidnight.

A new ABC Corporate Plan, compatible withthe new structure and with appropriate performance measures, will comeinto effect in 2001. The following summary has been adjusted to reflect thenew structure and, together with the Outcomes and Outputs data andDivisional activity reports throughout this document, presents an accurateillustration of the ABC's performance under the five objectives of its CorporatePlan 1999-2002 during the past 12 months. Objective oneFulfilling the Charter and other responsibilities under the ABC Act Measures: audience surveys; scale and quality of programming; audience reach and share. Audience surveys During the year the ABC focussed on methodologies for a broader range of qualitative research to be undertaken in the future. A research specialistwas appointed to review and expand the Corporation's overall researchcapacity. During 2000-2001 some smaller audience surveys undertakenincluded the following. A survey of the ABC Online audience provided a demographic profile of users as a benchmark for future purposes. Usability testing and user surveyswere conducted prior to redeveloping online gateways, The Backyard and The Space to facilitate navigation and user-friendly design. A survey undertaken by ACNielsen found that 38% of Australians who listened to radio coverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games onradio, tuned to ABC Local Radio. Radio National conducted a listenersurvey to obtain views on changes and proposed initiatives. Scale and quality of programming The scale of ABC programming on all platforms was sustained with increased local content, wide diversity of programming genres and highproduction standards. Details and data illustrating this can be found inDivisional activity reports throughout this document. Audience reach and share In 2000, ABC Radio achieved its highest ever annual average weekly audience of 4.012 million listeners across the eight major cities, equating to35.5 per cent of the population over 10 years of age. The Radio Division reporthas more information on audience share and reach. ABC Television achieved an average weekly reach (24hours x 7 days) across five metropolitan markets of 8.760 million (68.1%) in the period July toDecember 2000 (ACNielsen), and in January to June 2001 (OzTam) 9.685million (73.9%). In the previous financial year, average reach was measuredat 8.928 million or 69.9%. In Regional markets, ABC Television reached anaverage of 4.103 million people (70%), an increase of 125 000 (1.7%) over1999-2000. See Television Division report for details of television share and reach.Objective twoABC Online page impressions increased from an average of 3.4 million per week at the end of June 2000, to an average 6.6 million at the end of June2001. This represents a weekly increase from an average of two million to 3.4million. In 2001 the weekly page impressions reached a record 10 million inthe first week of March. See New Media Division report for more information on page impressions. Transforming ABC services in the digital age Measures: increase in range of programs and services; installation of digital equipment and facilities. Increase in range of programs and services The ABC commenced digital television broadcasting on 1 January 2001 in the capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide on VHFChannel 12 (223-230MHz) in line with the Government implementationtimetable. Two new digital television services, acbkids andFly, were developed to commence in the second half of 2001. ABC New Media launched new high quality gateways including The Public Record , Go Asia-Pacific , and Centenary of Federation ; expanded into broadband news and children's services; and participated in an interactivetelevision trial. Ten new radio and television analog transmission services commenced broadcasting during 2000-2001, and two new Local Radio satellite serviceswere established in remote communities. With additional funding from the Commonwealth Government the ABC launched a new subsidy scheme for communities located in cyclone incidentareas in Northern Australia. The scheme gives residents the opportunity toapply for funds to establish a rebroadcast facility for ABC Local Radio so thatthey can receive news and weather warnings. News and Current Affairs established web sites for all current affairs television programs, other than Stateline , increased bi-media training and conducted some online training. Installation of digital equipment and facilities All capital city ABC premises are now equipped with digital television facilities. The installation of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWS) continued with 232 workstations deployed at 23 regional and four capital city sites replacing taperecorders and endless loop cartridge machines with PC based workstations. ABC's Television Network Presentation and Master Control operations relocated from Gore Hill to Ultimo in Sydney on 12 June. The ABC delivered 127 technical training courses in the 2000-2001 financial year and 54 additional courses conducted on digital audio 34Corporate Plan Performance Summary35Corporate Plan Performance Summary Objective threeworkstations. Courses also delivered to journalists for the introduction of new Avstar system. The ABC joined with three commercial radio operators in Sydney to form a consortium, known as Digital 2000, to trial digital radio broadcasts fromParramatta and North Sydney using the European Eureka 147 system. The ABCClassic FM signal commenced transmission from Parramatta on 15 September1999 and followed a program of technical tests and evaluation on the digitaltransmissions. Developing Australian content Measure: level of Australian content; ratio of first run to repeat local content; local programs in the top 100; access to ABC Online. Level of Australian content ABC Television's overall Australian content increased to 58 per cent, the highest in over a decade. ABC Radio content is all Australian. Measures of Australian Music Performance targets were exceeded in 2000-2001 by each ABC Radio networkwhich broadcasts music. Triple J's target of more than 30 per cent was exceeded with the network achieving 44 per cent. Local Radio's target of an increase from 25-30 per cent was exceeded with the network achieving 30.8 per cent across metropolitan andregional stations. Radio National's target of 25 per cent was exceeded with the network achieving 28.8 per cent. ABC Classic FM's target of 25 per cent was exceeded with the network achieving 32 per cent. ABC Classic FM's Australian composition target of 5 per cent was exceeded in 2001-2002 with the network achieving 9 per cent Australiancomposition. ABC New Media content is all Australian. For full details see Outcomes and Outputs section and Divisional reports. Ratio of first run to repeat local content on television The Television Division report shows details of Australian and overseas first release and repeat programming. In 2000-2001 the number of hours of first release Australian content exceeded that of 1998-99 but were fewer than in 1999-2000. Local programs in the top 100 Australian programs in the top 20 ABC Most Popular Programs included The Paralympics 2000 opening and closing ceremonies; series three ofSeaChange ; Late Edition News ; drama series, The Farm ; Budget 2000 ; ABC Evening News ; SeaChange series two and the Donald Bradman Memorial Service.Access to ABC Online The number of accesses to ABC Online in 2000-2001 significantly exceeded those in 1999-2000. See New Media division report for details. Objective fourExpanding Services to Local and Regional Communities Measures: regional upgrading; local television content; local radio content; online site for each station; regional online accesses benchmark. Regional upgrading Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems have been installed in all regionals to support digital equipment. New emergency power generatorsystems installed at Mt Isa, Gold Coast, Wollongong and Broome. Premises refurbished at Bunbury, Longreach, Newcastle, Townsville. Land purchased at Port Macquarie (to move Kempsey Branch to Port Macquarie)and additional land at Albany for expansion of operations. Local television content Television content produced locally for National transmission included: Calypso Summer , a two part cricket documentary, and three arts programs from South Australia; Radio Pictures , a series produced in Western Australia; an 11 part series Sunday Spectrum in the ACT; and two documentaries produced in Queensland. Local radio content Local content on Local Radio, which had increased to more than 100,000 hours during 1999-2000 was maintained at that level in 2000-2001. Online site for each local radio station Each ABC regional and metropolitan station is represented on The Backyard \u2014 the ABC's local online gateway. All ABC stations in regional Australia have been equipped with access to the Internet. ABC New Media is working towards decentralising operations, with production now located in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide andLismore. Regional online accesses benchmark From its launch in September 1999, The Backyard site grew to over 125 000 accesses per week by June 2000 and increased to 298 071 by the endof June 2001. This provides a benchmark for future annual reporting. Local reach and share See Divisional reports for details. 36Corporate Plan Performance Summary37Corporate Plan Performance Summary Developing efficiencyand effectiveness Measures: identify appropriate range of benchmarks related to \u2014 utilisation of assets; revenue generation; content transmission and production; returnon investment. During 2000-2001 the Corporation continued to focus on improving efficiency and effectiveness. Following is a selection of the measuresintroduced: \u00b7 Establishment of Content Rights Management division as a centralised, cross platform unit responsible for the business management of contentand rights for ABC services on ABC and third party platforms. \u00b7 Establishment of Development division to assess and provide funding to develop new programming across all media. \u00b7 Business Development and Performance Unit established within the Funding Finance and Support Services division to focus on performancemeasurement, efficiency and productivity. \u00b7 Successful upgrade of the ABC's Finance Information system to SAP 4.6c on time and within budget. \u00b7 Launch of new domestic and overseas travel policy.\u00b7 Delivery of cost effective and flexible finance training materials across the ABC's Intranet. \u00b7 New security measures introduced to protect around 20 000 assets.\u00b7 Revaluation of ABC property, plant and equipment undertaken.\u00b7 Maintenance of finance and television systems including labour and facility costing interfaces. \u00b7 Relaunch of new, more user-friendly Procurement Intranet site.\u00b7 A programming commissioning process developed by ABC Radio.\u00b7 Upgraded production facilities in all States and Territories.\u00b7 New sports scoring computer systems in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, upgraded sports graphics and data systems and sports computersystems introduced enabling animation and live web updating for ABCOnline. \u00b7 Conversion of regional broadcast centres to multimedia production centres capable of contributing programming to radio, television, online anddatacasting services. \u00b7 Replacement of ABC's news and current affairs equipment in Australia and London, providing better integration for program production. \u00b7 New audio syndication system developed for automated schedule delivery which will reduce labour and enable transfer of audio items around thenetwork. \u00b7 Provision of legal services to facilitate the delivery of ABC services and minimise risk exposure; in particular, provision of training and 24-hourlegal advice for program makers, provision of legal advice in relation todigital conversion and in relation to new media and content rightsmanagement.Objective fiveThe ABC values its strong connection with audiences and welcomes the many comments, enquiries, suggestions and complaints it receives each year. As well as providing an insight into the audiences' likes and dislikes, these contacts provide valuable information that assists the ABC to monitorits own performance. The ABC is conscious of the fundamental importance of an effective complaints mechanism in maintaining its accountability to the Australianpeople and to Parliament. The ABC Board takes a strong interest in this areaof performance, particularly as it relates to the Board's statutoryresponsibility to ensure that the gathering and presentation by theCorporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according tothe recognised standards of objective journalism. While comments and complaints are received by all program departments ofthe ABC, by far the greatest number areaddressed to Corporate Affairs and Newsand Current Affairs. Both Divisions keeprecords of audience contact and recordthe nature of the complaint or comment. Comments Most of the audience contacts the ABC receives are from viewers and listenersrequesting information about programcontent and program schedules. Many ofthese enquiries are answered by referringaudiences to ABC Online which containsan enormous amount of informationabout ABC programs and services. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of contacts made directly to program areas, networks and regionaloffices, ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs logs audience feedback andcoordinates responses where required. Generally audience feedback goes directly to program makers and much of this is now publicly available on the many guestbooks published on theABC website.

Part of the huge crowd at Central Queensland Multicultural Fair inRockhampton in which the ABC participated Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the Corporation's Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC'sresponse or the handling of their complaint may seek review from theAustralian Broadcasting Authority (ABA). During 2000-2001, the ABA finalised its investigations into 20 such matters. In eight of these cases, the ABA's investigation concluded that therehad been no breach of the ABC's Code of Practice. The ABA was unable tomake a determination in one case, and in a second case, found that theissue raised by the complainant did not meet the definition of a complaint. The ABA found that the ABC had breached its Code of Practice in 10 cases. In each case, the ABA was satisfied with the action already taken by the ABCto address the issue.Australian BroadcastingAuthority Commonwealth Ombudsman Independent Complaints ReviewPanelThe Ombudsman's office finalised its investigation into one complaint about the ABC with a finding of no defect on the part of the ABC. The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) reviews written complaints alleging serious cases of bias, lack of balance or unfair treatmentarising from an ABC broadcast or broadcasts. Complainants may seek a panelreview once the ABC's normal complaints handling procedures have beencompleted and if the complainant is dissatisfied with the ABC's response.ICRP findings and recommendations are carefully considered by the ABC,particularly when updating the ABC's Editorial Policies. The ICRP consists of Ted Thomas (Convenor), Margaret Jones (Deputy Convenor), Professor Michael Chesterman, Stepan Kerkyasharian AM and BobJohnson. Members of the Panel are appointed by the ABC Board for theirknowledge of or experience in journalistic ethics and practice, mediaoperations and program production, complaints handling and other reviewprocesses. In its tenth year of operation, the ICRP received 14 requests to review complaints. Many of these complaints did not meet the Panel's criteria asthey had not been dealt with by the ABC or involved matters outside thePanel's area of responsibility. During the year the ICRP accepted one requestfor review and at the end of the reporting period, two further requests forreview were still being considered. In addition, a review was completedduring the reporting period for a complaint accepted for review the previousyear. The two reviews completed during the year were requested by Mr Hisam Sidaoui and Mr Glyn May.

Initially, as the Pronunciation AdvisoryCommittee, it was concerned with maintaining standard Englishpronunciations. In 1952 a Standing Committee on Pronunciation wasestablished, and from then on the ABC started to make some departuresfrom BBC practice and to recognise Australian English. In 1954 theCommittee's title was changed to its present one. SCOSE is a constant monitor of the language used in ABC programming. The aims of the Committee are twofold: to provide a reference source for broadcasters and journalists through the Language Research Unit where they can check all aspects of spokenand written English \u2014 pronunciation, grammar, spelling, usage andstyle, and to provide a constant watch to ensure that ABC standards of language comply with editorial policy and perceived community standards. Inparticular the committee is concerned that language used in ABCbroadcasts should be accurate, non-discriminatory and impartial. Committee members are unpaid and are drawn from ABC output divisions and from among academic experts. The Committee is currentlyprivileged to have Professor Pam Peters, Associate Professor of Linguistics atMacquarie University, as a member. Professor Peters is a member of theMacquarie Dictionary Advisory Board and is the author of the CambridgeAustralian English Style Guide. The Language Research Unit is maintained by News and Current Affairs on behalf of the Corporation. The Language Research Specialist maintains adatabase (STRINE) and produces daily word lists for broadcasters. Thedatabase is accessible on the ABC Intranet and via the News and CurrentAffairs production system, Avstar. The Committee meets once a month to discuss language policy and usage, queries from staff and any complaints or observations from thepublic. The community feedback forms a substantial part of the materialdiscussed at each meeting. The Committee's advice on specific points ofusage is accessible through SCOSE Online and frequently takes the form ofinformation about the history of a usage, or the current Australian practice,on the basis of which the user may make an appropriate choice. Staff are informed of SCOSE deliberations through pronunciation lists distributed electronically on a daily basis, special briefing papers on specificareas of usage or debate as they arise, and a monthly report distributedafter each SCOSE meeting, highlighting the highs and lows of the ABC's on-air performance during the previous month.Development ABC Development was established in June 2000 to assess and fund program ideas for development. The Development Division responds to requests from the ABC's output divisions and considers unsolicited proposals from inside and outside theCorporation, including international coproductions. The best ideas that meetthe scheduling needs of ABC Radio, Television and New Media may beselected for development. Once the idea has been further developed it isassessed by output divisions and the program may then be commissionedand funded for production. As a first point of review Development is well-placed to assess the cross- media viability of proposals through a process of liaison across outputdivisions. 76Development Advisory GroupsDuring the year the ABC established an Education Development Advisory Group, chaired by Professor Peter Swannell, the Vice Chancellor of theUniversity of Souther Queensland; and an Arts Advisory Group, chaired byProfessor Margaret Serres, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the University of WesternAustralia and outgoing Chair of the Australia Council. The Advisory Groups have been established to draw ideas, inspiration and expertise from the broader education and arts communities to assist the ABCin developing programs across radio, television and online that satisfyaudience needs as well as complementing the work of the education andarts communities.Development contributed to thedelivery of outputs1.1 and 1.2 Development projects During the 2000-2001 financial year more than 70 projects were supported. The Division funded development of the drama series Changi , anticipated as a highlight of the 2001-2002 schedule. Changi describes the personal journeys of six prisoners of war between 1942 and1945, in contrast to the lives of the same six mentoday as they reflect on their experiences. The Division also funded work to develop the second series of Grass Roots , a continuation of the story of the fictitious Arcadia Waters Counciland the people who work there. Programs developed for Radio included piloting Bush Telegraph , a Radio National program produced in Melbourne and launched inlate April 2001. Bush Telegraph provides metropolitan as well as regional audiences with adaily national view of regional and rural issues. Development also funded an innovative drama project for Radio National called The Third Eleven , based on the idea of an amateur cricket team somewhere in suburban or country Australia and On the set of ABC drama series Changi, developed during 2000-2001, wardrobistJill Guice winds a Sikh turban. Changi isscheduled for broadcast later in 2001 77broadcast from 2 April 2001. The work was created with the assistance of ABC Radio listeners - with the audience invited to phone in and help developcharacters, plot and storylines. As a New Media Development project, a number of online initiatives were trialled during the Western Australia and Queensland elections on 10 and 17February 2001 respectively, including a video webcast discussion forum and adaily web-log diary. Also trialled in February 2001 during the ABARE conference in Canberra was the video-streaming of proceedings from the main auditorium. Development projects by genreBy genre, the largest number of projects and the largest expenditures occurred in comedy and drama development. This is unsurprising - costsassociated with developing fiction tend to be higher than for factualprograms, where lead times are much shorter and the development phasecomparatively simpler. In some cases with factual programs, developmentmay not be deemed necessary at all, with a commitment to productionmade on the basis of track record, program concept and the quality of talent involved inthe particularproject.

Audience Research provides one assessment of the ABC's performance and is a valuable tool in the evaluation of programs and assisting in programdevelopment and scheduling. During 2000-2001 the ABC used major researchsources which are outlined below. Television Audience measurement data is collected using a panel of homes with peoplemeters. The most advanced tool available, it provides viewing dataminute by minute, every day and tracks who is viewing, by channel andSpecialist Science Journalists prepare for the August 2001 launch of the new weekly television science program Catalyst. L to R: Graham Phillips, Karina Kelly, Robyn Williams, JonicaNewby, Paul Willis and Norman Swan 78Development when. This information is reported as the share of viewing achieved by individual channels and the percentage of the population reached. ACNielsen provided this research for the five major State capital cities until the end of December 2000. Since then a new measurement service,commissioned by OzTam and carried out by ATR Australia has been inoperation. Predictably, when the new service started there was considerablevariance in the reported performance of the various channels as a result ofthe change in panel. There were also start-up problems that contributed tothe differences. The ABC continues its dialogue with OzTam and ATR to effectimprovements to the new service. ACNielsen continues to measure theregional markets. Ad-hoc studies are also available which provide opportunities to explore what viewers think about the programs they watch. The ABC is currentlyreviewing its arrangements for obtaining program research on an ongoingbasis to provide a qualitative dimension to the existing quantitativemeasures. Radio Radio research for the major metropolitan markets is carried out eight times a calendar year by ACNielsen with listening captured on a quarter hourbasis for eight four-week blocks across the year. Less frequent data iscollected for other major towns and regional surveys are carried out on an ad-hoc and irregular basis. From time to time, as with television, ABC commissions qualitative studies to aid program development. The ABC hopesto formalise this into a regular ongoing service. New Media Previously, research reported the total of number of page impressions but in June 2001 ACNielsen introduced theirNetRatings service, using a panel that provides more in-depthdata on the number of users (both at home and work), reachand demographic profiles. 79News and Current Affairs News and Current Affairs provides high quality programs and content to radio, television and online. Original news and current affairs output acrossradio and television totalled more than 20 000 hours. Output remained highin the past year as a result of improved management, more bi-mediatraining and cross media assignments, and the collocation of newsrooms. A restructure abolished divisions between News and Current Affairs, replacing them with Heads of National and Local Coverage with authorityacross genres. The International Unit was also restructured to better co-ordinate the competing coverage requirements of news and current affairsprograms on radio and television. News Online has developed strongly and new Broadband bulletins reflect the synergies between television news and online. Stateline on ABC TV moved from 6.30pm to 7.30pm Friday and received more resources to reportand analyse state issues. A revamped Lateline blended the late night news with interviews and current affairs. Landline was given an additional Saturday timeslot and has managed to keep its traditional Sunday audiencewhile building a new following on Saturday. News highlightsComprehensive coverage of election campaigns in Western Australia and Queensland reflected the deployment and commitment of ABC reporters andproducers throughout our biggest states. Leaders' debates were mounted inboth states and the election night coverage on all output platforms waspopular and critically acclaimed. The Olympic and Paralympic Games represented a significant organisational challenge. Radio News and Current Affairs deployed more than30 reporters and producers. They generated thousands ofstories, ranging from race results to complex features.Television had less access to the Olympics because ofrestrictions imposed by television rights holders. A smallABC TV News and Current Affairs team produced the bulk ofOlympic television news and current affairs programming,winning a Logie for its coverage. Before, during and afterthe games, AM, The World Toda y, PM, 7.30 Report ,Lateline and Four Corners provided valuable analysis of, among other issues, the cost of staging the Olympics, the stresseswithin the organising body, the International OlympicCommittee, and the prevalence of performance-enhancingdrugs in top level sport. National stories of note throughout the year included: the death of 15 backpackers at a hostel fire in Childers inQueensland; the death of eight people in an aircraft crash in Queensland;floods in New South Wales and Queensland; the introduction of the Goodsand Services Tax, the death of Aboriginal leader Charles Perkins; revelations ofelectoral malpractice in the Australian Labor Party in Queensland; the deathof Sir Donald Bradman; allegations of child abuse, riots and hunger strikes at The ABC election broadcast team in the Tally Room in Perth during the Western Australian elections News and Current Affairs contributed to the delivery of outputs 1.1 and 1.2 Kerry O'Brien, Presenter, 7.30 ReportJane Hutcheon, Presenter, World at NoonMichael Maher, Asia-Pacific editorLinda Mottram, Presenter, AM 80News and Current Affairs detention centres for asylum seekers and escapes from the centres; the anti- globalisation rallies in Melbourne; the appointment of Archbishop PeterHollingworth as Governor General; the death of a boy bitten by dingoes onFraser Island and the subsequent cull of dingoes. The ABC's specialist business and finance reporters were particularly busy covering the collapse of HIH Insurance, OneTel, Harris Scarfe and a plethora ofless well known enterprises; the merger of BHP-Billiton; the fall of the dollarand interest-rate fluctuations. Following the elections in Western Australiaand Queensland, Federal political reporters found themselves covering anundeclared election campaign featuring government policy shifts on GST-related tax changes and fuel excise. The government moved to stimulate thehousing and vehicle industries. Other significant political stories included thepublication of a controversial analysis, by Liberal Party President Shane Stone,of the Government's performance during the Queensland State electioncampaign. SLIDE LINDA MOTTRAMSLIDE jANE HUTCHEONcorrect cropping whenscanning in approx30%International coverageInternational coverage stretched resources during the months of political and military instability in the Pacific with major stories in Fiji, the SolomonIslands and Papua New Guinea. ABC reporters and camera crews were stationedin Fiji for almost three months during the worst of the upheaval. Indonesiaremained in turmoil and the ABC presented front line accounts of thesecessionist struggles in Aceh, Ambon and West Papua, also known as IrianJaya, as well as developments in East and West Timor. ABC reporters coveredother long running stories such as the detention of an Australian couple inLaos, the tension between the US and China after an American spy plane wasforced to land in Chinese territory and the massacre of Nepal's royal family. The ABC's Washington-based reporters provided extensive coverage of the US presidential election campaign. The PMteam was on air for a marathon eight-hour program on election night. The breakdown in relations betweenthe Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority has resulted in anextremely violent situation in the Occupied Territories. Jerusalem-based ABCstaff have been under fire while reporting the conflict, as have Europe basedreporters covering the insurgency by ethnic Albanians in Macedonia. Coverageof the fall of the Milosevic government in Yugoslavia maintained the ABC'sreputation for outstanding coverage of the Balkans over the past 12 years.Journalist, Tim Palmer and cameraman/editor, Louie Eroglu reportingfrom Jerusalem 81News and Current Affairs Foot and mouth disease was the dominant story from Britain, overshadowing the national elections. Editorially it was a strong year for News and Current Affairs and high standards have been maintained. A survey conducted for the AustralianBroadcasting Authority found that ABC TV News was the \"most credible newsand current affairs program, column or internet site\". ABC was the most usedradio station for news and current affairs while ABC News Online was thesecond most accessed site. The 7.30 Report's presenter Kerry O'Brien was the \"most preferred journalist for news and current affairs\". ( Sources of News and Current Affairs , ABA 2001) The audience for News and Current Affairs programs has remained fairly steady through the year with the 7pm TVN e w s averaging a 22 per cent share of audience or about a million viewers in the five major cities, plus manyhundreds of thousands more in the regions. The revitalised 7.30 Report has built its audience to a 19 per cent share. The 7.45am radio news delivers asignificant increase in the local radio audience in the five biggest cities, mostof which is retained during AM(8.00am-8.30am). Audience response Lateline at 10.30pm five nights a week, has settled firmly into its redefined role as a hybrid program featuring up-to-date news and exploringcurrent issues through feature stories, interviews and debates. The audienceshare averages around 10 per cent. Four Corners in the past year has investigated electoral fraud by the Queensland ALP; money-laundering by the Russian mafia in the SouthPacific; the death of an Australian intelligence officer inWashington; conflict between building unions; the politicsof digital television and the collapse of HIH. Four Corners has embraced web-based interactivity, puttingconsiderable emphasis on post-program forums andestablishing special sites to provide backgroundinformation and encourage debate on issues such as landmanagement and salinity. There were more than 200 000accesses to that particular site. Foreign Correspondent has tackled some of the toughest international stories \u2014 an hour long special onthe jailing of the former Malaysian Deputy Prime MinisterAnwar Ibrahim; mercenaries in Sierra Leone; the powerstruggle in Indonesia; presidential corruption in thePhilippines and several graphic reports on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Australian Story has strengthened its reputation as the program that persuades the famous and relatively unknown to reveal their innermostthoughts. The most compelling example was an exclusive interview withKerry Packer about the kidney transplant made possible by his helicopterpilot, Nick Ross, and the relationship between the two men.Current Affairs highlights Sally Sara, Africa correspondentMark Colvin, Presenter, PMJacinta Tynan, News PresenterEleanor Hall, Presenter, The World TodayPaul Lockyer, Regional Affairs correspondent 82News and Current Affairs News and Current Affairs is keen to extend local radio news coverage throughout the day and to provide regional reporters with the means tocreate product for television and online. Eight cadet journalists were takenon in 2001 and are being trained in all areas of reporting and production,including online. The ABC is committed to training more journalists in onlineproduction and to decentralise the production of local news. Ten years after the ACT News was cancelled because of budget restrictions, the Canberra-based news bulletin is scheduled to resume inSeptember 2001. The ACT will also have its own Stateline program, analysing local affairs. Insiders , a new Sunday morning program with an emphasis on national politics, will start in July 2001. Planning is also well advanced for a national weekly business program on television which would appeal to a broad audience interested in financialmatters, as well as people working in the markets. This program would drawon the expertise of the national business desk in Sydney and specialistreporters in Melbourne and other capitals. The collocation of journalists in Melbourne originally envisaged for the end of 2000 was deferred until the new financial year due to a revisedschedule of construction work at the ABC Southbank Centre. Collocation inSydney - transferring hundreds of journalistic and technical staff from GoreHill to the Ultimo Centre - has similarly been a significant managementissue. The move is scheduled for the end of the 2002 financial year. Workplace reform has also been a priority. Performance managements systems were introduced and the writing of individual job plans began.Single person crewing has been trialled extensively. Proposals to reduce thenumber of people required for studio crewing have also been advanced. News and Current Affairs maintains an extensive system of tracking and responding to the views of the audience (see Audience Contact). The Divisionaims to uphold rigorous standards of fairness and balance and breaches ofeditorial policies are to be dealt with promptly.Future directions slide eleanor hallslide jacinta tynanslide mark colvintranparency sally saraThe new ABC television production centre in Sydney opened during the year 83Production Resources The Production Resources Division contributed significantly to sustaining ABC programs and services, performed to plan and operated on budgetduring 2000-2001. The Division's major function is to provide television production resources and services for ABC produced and coproduced programs across all genres, tooperate presentation facilities for television transmission and to generaterevenue through the Division's marketing arm, ABC Productions. The Division operates television production centres and transmission centres in the capital city of each state and territory of Australia. It is thesingle largest employer of the ABC workforce and a major operator of ABCproduction facilities and equipment. Programs produced using the Division's resources filled a major portion of the ABC television network and local schedules. In addition to broadcast usethese programs also providedopportunities for international programsales and sourced additional productsand services for ABC Enterprises. During the year the Division completed a restructure that broughtall production centres together underthe control of the Division and tooknational responsibility for presentationoperations. The ongoing workforce wasreduced by over 10 per cent with twothirds of the reduction from the GoreHill production centre. These changesenabled a better and more flexiblematching of production resources tothe requirements of productionprojects. The Production Resources Division operates on a user pays basis with itsmajor users, the Television Division andthe News and Current Affairs Division.This requires operations to be plannedand managed to achieve efficientresource utilisation in each productioncentre. It also ensures a level of cost accountability that would not have beenachieved if funds were directly assigned to the Production Resources Divisionwithout accountability for delivery. In terms of expenditure control andutilisation the Division met its budgets while responding to variations in thelevels and in the timing of production. Production Resources contributed to the delivery of outputs 1.1 and 1.2 ABC Productions, the external marketing arm of the Division, provided production services for local, national and international external clients whileoperating in an extremely competitive commercial environment. During theyear ABC Productions improved the utilisation of ABC resources and facilitiesand generated revenue, which offset some production resources costs. Thisyear ABC Productions continued to win jobs through the reputation, qualityand the capability of the services offered. Important Australian content produced with production resources from the Production Resources Division during the year was the coverage of theCentenary of Federation Parade and Ceremony. The Division supported the maintenance and development ofworkforce skills through internaltraining, external forums, suppliervisits and work assignments withcoproducers. Training forwidescreen production was animportant workforce trainingprogram during the year thatcontributed to the successfultransition to widescreenproduction. Other broadcastersused the ABC widescreen trainingprogram in preparing theirproducers for widescreenproduction. Field and Outside Broadcast (OB) operations have reached out to local and regional communitiesover the past year with suchproductions as Territory Sport at The ABC Outside Broadcast van and camera used at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics at Ultimo during the 2000 Olympics. The van and camera are now an exhibit in the National Museum in Canberra afterbeing restored by Barry Lambert (left front) and Jurgen Schmidt (left behind) 84Production Resources New facilities brought into operation during the year have, in some areas of production, facilitated improvements in productivity. For instance theDivision has achieved a significant reduction in editing time with new editingequipment. Also new facilities such as the Sydney ABC Studio Centre atLanceley Place, Artarmon, replace outmoded facilities and improve thecapacity and capability for production. During the year, the Division continued to bring digital production equipment into operation, raising both the capacity and capability for digitalwidescreen production. Field production has converted to digital widescreenaspect ratio and two studios, one in Canberra and the other in Melbourne,have been converted to full digital operation. Pending the completion of newproduction facilities to be located in the new building currently underconstruction at Ultimo, the Division has established partial digital productioncapabilities at Gore Hill. Outside broadcastsNew facilities85Production Resources various locations in the Northern Territory including Gove, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, as Stompem Ground at Broome and as Naiyu Nambiyu , a documentary on the community at Daly River and coverage of such events asAnzac Day and State Elections. Production Resources field crews have worked on assignment at many international destinations and brought footage of international events andincidents back to Australia for viewing by national, local and regionalaudiences. A highlight of the year was participating in the Sydney 2000 Olympics. ABC Productions managed the provision of ABC crews and Outside Broadcastvans from around Australia for this event. Also the Production ResourcesDivision provided staff and equipment resources to the Paralympics. GenresIn total the Production Resources Division workforce provided over 1.6 million hours to the production of programs. Over 90% of resources (as measured byworkforcehours) Local Regional 8.0% Indigenous 0.8% General Special Events 0.5% Current Affairs 14.1% News 27.4%Production Resources Workforce Hours byGenre Local productionProduction centres located in Sydney and Melbourne are the main providers of production resources for the production of network programs.The other six production centres located in the Australian Capital Territory,the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and WesternAustralia provide resources primarily for the production of News and Current86Production Resources Affairs programs. However they also provide resources for the production of a wide range of general television programs for their local state or territoryaudiences and, in some cases, for network audiences. For network transmission, these centres produced a number of regular programs such as Sunday Spectrum (ACT), Australian Story and Landline (Qld), Behind the News and For the Juniors (SA), Gardening Australia (Tas) and Consuming Passions and Hopman Cup (WA). For local transmission, these centres produced a number of specials and sports programs each year. These include coverage of State Elections, AnzacDay marches, Annual Football Awards and Local Sport and such programs as A Nation United (ACT), Arafura Games Opening Ceremony (NT), The Peoples' Anthem (Qld), Christmas Pageant (SA), Recollections (Tas) and WA Election (WA). Future directionsFor the future the Division is working to improve its effectiveness and further develop a skilled workforce operating modern equipment, facilitiesand systems. For instance the Division plans to introduce a new resource management system. During the year the Division called for expressions of interest andselected a supplier for the system. When implemented the system is plannedto improve the management, assignment and use of the resources andservices the Division provides for the production of programs. Also considerable progress has been made in re-equipping The full realisation oftheseimprovements will assist the ABC to further develop Australian content while achievingimproved productivity. ABC Production Resources provided facilities for many special events during the yearsuch as the opening ceremony of theParalympics 87Content Rights Management The Content Rights Management Division was established in July 2000 as an independent, centralised and cross-platform unit responsible for thebusiness management of content rights for the ABC and potential third partyplatforms. In a converging media environment the issue of content rights becomes increasingly complex and the ABC needs to have maximum rights flexibility. Itis important that the ABC is able to use its content on diverse deliveryplatforms in order to reduce overall production costs, and to be able to sellcontent to third-parties to create revenue for new productions. ContentRights Management was established to deal with these activities and relatedissues, such as the constant reinterpretation of rights required by newdelivery platforms, the negotiating of blanket licence agreements withunderlying rights holder groups and the collection of rights metadata. The Content Rights Management Division comprises the following departments: Rights Management \u2014 responsible for the collection of rights metadata, and the standards, concepts and business systems associated with rightsthroughout the Corporation; the negotiation and management of ABCblanket agreements with underlying rights holder groups. Business Affairs Development Production Coproduction \u2014 responsible for the negotiation and contracting of financing, production elements andtalent associated with commissioned content including sourcing andraising development/production finance for ABC output platforms. Business Affairs Acquisitions \u2014 responsible for the negotiation and contracting of completed or near completed third party programming forABC output platforms. Archives and Library Services \u2014 responsible for providing efficient access to ABC content through appropriate research, cataloguing, preservationand access systems. ABC Content Sales \u2014 responsible for the business to business sale of content in the worldwide marketplace. Business Management \u2014 the financial management and accounting functions for the Division. Marketing and Publicity \u2014 the marketing and positioning of the ABC and its content in the worldwide marketplace. Rights ManagementContent Rights Management contributed to the delivery of outputs 1.1 and 1.2 Incorporating the already existing Copyright and TV Inventory Unit departments, Rights Management has been restructured. The restructuredRights Management Service offers: expert rights advice for rights issues impacting on editorial and budgetary considerations for new projects being developed by ABC program makers, one central collection point for rights documentation relating to ABC content, a one stop 'Content Availabilities Service' for ABC program makers and exploiters of ABC content, a specialised 'Rights Clearance Service' to negotiate and clear third party copyright material for ABC content makers, ABC Content Sales and ABCEnterprises. A new organisational structure was developed and implementation has begun. This structure reflects key strategic directions by focusing the ABC'sarchives and libraries' activities around four main units - collectiondevelopment, research services, collection management and technicalsupport services. In Sydney, the restructure underpins the establishment of a cross-media facility in the new custom-designedbuilding at Ultimo. It will deliver a streamlinedservice to ABC program makers, broadcasters, revenuegenerating activities and clients. Research services to program makers have been enhanced by providing interfaces to archivesdatabases and direct access to information throughthe ABC Intranet. Television archives databasesinclude JPEG images from Sydney's 7.00pm news forretrieval and re-use on ABC News Online. Program makers are making greater use of archival material and increasing the cross media useof audio and visual content. ABC archival materialwas featured in many Centenary of Federationprograms including ABC programs 100 Years-The Australian Story and Beyond the Fatal Shore .Archives and Library Services The ABC stand at MIPTV in Cannes, a major international television marketplace where the ABC promotes and sells programs 88Content Rights Management Business Affairs - ProductionThis unit has established a set of procedures outlining the way in which the new Business Affairs unit will work with the development andproduction units throughout Australia. Standard deal-memos, letters of offerand contracts are being developed incorporating a standardised set of rightsdefinitions. The Unit is working closely with the new Commissioningprocesses in Television, New Media and Radio. Business Affairs - AcquisitionsThis unit has enabled the ABC to secure a broader range of rights at competitive licensing fees when acquiring programming for each of theoutput platforms. The unit has worked very closely with Television inacquiring for the primary channel as well as for new digital channels abckids and Fly. Procedures are being developed to acquire programming for Radio and New Media.This department comprises three sales units: Program Sales (sale of general television programming); Content Licensing (acquisition and sale of news and current affairs, sport, online/interactive, and radio/audio content); and Library Sales (sale of footage, segments of audio, video, graphics, text, stills, from the archives). In the past year the Program Sales unit generated 58.2 per cent of the gross revenue of ABC Content Sales. Gross revenues in Program Sales were 30 per cent higher than for the same period last year. Bananas in Pyjamas has continued to sell successfully into key international markets in Asia, LatinAmerica and Europe. Other key international partnerships have beenstrengthened with sales of major factual programming to NationalGeographic Channels and Discovery Networks. Representatives from Program Sales participated in the major international television marketplaces of MIPTV (France), MIPCOM (France),NATPE (USA), and Asia Television Forum (Singapore). The Content Licensing unit generated 18.2 per cent of gross revenue. The unit built on the success of previous years by increasing the client base by30 per cent including Telstra and National Australia Bank, for ABC News Online content. The international reach of buyers for key ABC current affairs programs such as Foreign Correspondent was broadened through a range of partnerships with broadcasters in the Asia Pacific region such as CNN. The Library Sales unit generates 23.6 per cent of gross revenue. The unit previously known as ABC Footage Sales incorporates radio tape sales and saleof other archive content. Negotiations have begun with the Australian CricketBoard and Australian Rugby Union to formalise the ABC's representation offootage held in ABC's archives. Library Sales has won the tender to supplyfootage to the CHOGM 2001 Media Task Force Centre. 89Content Rights Management Digital Asset Management (DAMS) Project The Content Rights Management Division has been the key sponsor for the ABC's Digital Asset Management (DAMS) Project. Over the past year, the Archives & Library Services and Rights Management departments have beenworking closely with ABC Information Services to ensure the Corporation can efficiently and effectively implementDAMS for the whole organisation. This work includes:- a Metadata Standards Workshop involving key users from all areas of the ABC, an Expression of Interest Market Scan to identify what DAM products were available in the marketplace. The final report produced following presentations to an ABC DAMS Focus Group identified six shortlisted DAM products whichrequire further analysis, a number of strategic database projects have been undertaken by CRM aimed at developing better workflow and business processes for the next stage of DAMS. These include front end intranet web browsers on keycontent databases, the planned expansion of the TV Rights documentation database to include all outputdivisions and the development of a content metadata usage report for online content. ABC Content SalesABC Enterprises Accrued ProfitABC Enterprises ABC Enterprises contributes to the role and performance of the ABC and achievement of Outcome 1 through the creation, licensing, marketing andretailing of quality consumer products associated with the ABC's broadcastingand new media activities. In this way, ABC Enterprises extends the life of ABCprogramming, assists in fostering and developing Australian talent andcreativity, and makes a valuable financial return to the Corporation forinvestment in programs. In the financial year 2000-2001 ABC Enterprises made a cash contribution of $8.48 million to the Corporation, against a budget of $10 million. Theshortfall in budget can be attributed to a number of factors including thelower than expected returns from film distribution; the impact of the GST,particularly on the book retail sector; and generally poor trading performancein the retail industry in the first half of the financial year. In 2000-2001, over 547 products related to ABC programming activities were released and a total of 187 awards were won, 24 for creative excellenceand 163 for business performance.

The graph indicates that funding fell significantly since themid 1980s but that the downward trend has been reversed in recent years, tothe extent that it is now equivalent to funding levels prior to the cuts to baselevel funding in 1996-1997 and 1997-1998. The level of real comparative operational funding across the threeyears 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 hasincreased due to depreciation fundingreceived of these $28.3m & $36.81mrespectively), Digital TransmissionFunding, and the National InterestInitiatives received in the 2001-02financial year.The Corporation undertook a longitudinal analysis of Appropriation Funding over more than 15 years. ABC operational funding peaked, in realterms, in the 1985-86 Financial Year \u2014 based on CPI index levels applied atDecember 2000. It has since declined by 29.5 per cent. Comparative Operational Funding sourced from the ABC's Appropriation is defined as: Total Appropriation received (Outcomes 1, 2 & 3) less Tied, One-Offand Loans Funds (but includes Capital and Depreciation funds). As announced in the May 2001 Budget, for the 2001-2002 Financial Year, using the above definition, the Comparative Operational Funding availablesourced from Appropriation Funds is: $m Total Appropriation per Outcomes 1, 2 & 3 745.17 Less NTA Transmission Fund -73.39Less Digital Transmission Funding -29.43Less Capital Use Charge Tied Funding -59.26Less Loan Funds -20.00Total Comparative Appropriation Funds 563.09 ABC Operational Appropriation 400490580670760850 02 01 00 99 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 Financial year$563$799$millions 94ABC Appropriation Operational Funds95ABC Appropriation Interactive Curriculum Support for Schools $0.7m Childen/Family Initiative TV $1.4m, New Media $0.23m Business Initiative NewsCAff Program $1.25m, RN Programs $0.52m Content Development $0.3m Project Development Officers $0.61m Outsourced Radio Programs $1m Internet Radio $0.37m RN Regional Programs $0.3m Add'l Regional Radio Content $4m Ballarat Radio Station $0.6m TV Regional Initiatives $3.38m Australia Talks $2.94mFour year comparison of utilisation for Production Resources labour737475767778798081 Total TV Resources Labour Other StatesNSW & Vic 2001 2000 1999 1998per cent Staff numbers, business support areas0100200300400500 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997No. of staff Additional FundingAdditional fundingAs announced in the Federal Budget on May 22, the Government decided to provide additional program funding of $17.8 million per annum for thenext four years. The ABC Board has determined that this funding will gostraight into new programs/program development for Radio, TV and NewMedia in line with the ABC's National Interest Initiatives. This chart shows asplit of how the $17.8m has been allocated for the 2001-02 Financial Year.Increasing EfficiencyThe ABC has attempted to minimise the impact of the decreased funding levels on its output by increasing its efficiency particularly with respect to itssupport areas. As a result of these efforts, the labour utilisation rate forproduction resources has increased and the Corporation's combined businesssupport areas of Finance, Legal, Property, Business, Audit and HumanResources have decreased staffing levels by 14.5 per cent since the businesssupport reengineering in 1997-98. Funding Finance and Support Services (FFSS) The Funding Finance and Support Services (FFSS) Division during 2000- 2001 was restructured to consolidate all financial services into one FinanceGroup and establish two new units \u2014 Business Development andPerformance, and e-Business Strategy. Information Technology Services wastransferred to the Technology & Distribution Division. GST Project The first challenge of the year was to ensure a smooth transition to the new taxation system which was achieved through the use of a special GSTimplementation team which continued to monitor the project to the end ofNovember, training staff and liaising with Government. New budget structure Another focus was the reconfiguration of Portfolio Budgets into the new Divisional structures announced by the Managing Director. This came aheadof a major upgrade of the Corporation's financial system to significantlyimprove user-friendliness, enhance financial management reporting andprovide a base for further streamlining business processes. Extensive trainingsessions were undertaken and training materials posted to the ABC's intranetsite to assist staff in adapting to the new system. Foreign exchange policy The Finance Group introduced a foreign exchange hedging program which successfully isolated the Corporation from unfavourable exchange ratemovements over a volatile period for the Australian currency. This programwas particularly significant to the ABC's digital conversion strategy, which isreliant on the purchase of digital equipment from overseas sources. TheFinance Group also managed the interest rate risk of the Corporation, mostnotably with the swapping of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt at some100 basis points lower than current market at 30 June 2001. Successful completion of annual financial statements Consistent with previous years, the Corporation's Annual Financial Statements were presented to the Audit Subcommittee of the Board withinthe designated time frame and were signed by the Australian National AuditOffice unqualified. e-Business strategyNew e-Business strategy An e-Business unit was established to coordinate overall strategy for the ABC's e-Business activities and to identify and measure the benefits of e-Business initiatives. The focus is on exploring available efficiencyopportunities such as improved productivity, collaboration and levels ofaudience and customer service. Such opportunities include applications tostreamline business-to-business procurement and the development of a trialreverse auction mechanism, in which suppliers bid down prices against eachother over the internet, targeted at maximising the value for money the ABCobtains for products and services. 96FFSS supported the delivery of outputs1.1 and 1.2 Finance servicesExcavations underway for the new building at the Ultimo Centre as part of the SydneyAccommodation Project 97Broadcasting Facilities The Property Services team continued its work consolidating operations to satisfy the requirements of the new digital broadcasting environment.Sydney's TV Presentation suite and Master Control were moved from Gore Hillto Ultimo. In Melbourne the Southbank Centre accommodated new digitaltelevision transmission facilities and a fully integrated News & Current AffairsCentre for Television, Radio and Online. Property has alsoassisted with the upgrading for digital conversion of TVMaster Control rooms in all capital cities. PropertyRationalisation The ABC's program of rationalising its property holdings, begun at the end of 1996, moved toward completion withthe approval of the divestment process for remainingunder-utilised ABC sites. The Corporation invitedExpressions of Interest from potential purchasers of land inHobart, in March 2001, and received a number of offers. TheBoard approved the disposal of the surplus site at its BoardMeeting in June 2001. Divestment of the Gore Hill site in Sydney has been subject to a number of procedures including community consultation and thedevelopment of a conservation management plan in conjunction with theAustralian Heritage Commission. The outcome of a re-zoning application isexpected by July 2002. Major Building Works The Perth building project, approved in December 2000 is due for completion by the end of 2003. In March 2001 the Corporation announcedthe refurbishment of the ABC facilities in Canberra. Sydney Accommodation Project The project to extend the ABC Ultimo Centre is progressing on time and on budget. By the end of June 2001, $92.9 million of the overall budget of$109.5 million had been approved for commitment. The final detailed designof the internal fitout of the new building is expected in September 2001 withpractical completion of the Ultimo complex scheduled for August 2002. During the year, the ABC commissioned a new digital television presentation centre at Ultimo; and construction commenced on thecollocation of radio and television news and current affairs. Progressivealteration of the existing Ultimo building will continue in conjunction withthe major building works. Detailed design for the relocation of the helipad at Gore Hill was completed in preparation for the proposed sale of the majority of the GoreHill site. The helipad will be relocated to the top of a multi-level carparkadjoining the ABC Lanceley Place site and necessary approvals have beenobtained. Construction is planned to commence in late 2001. Property services Funding Finance and Support Services Finance Subcommittee The FFSS Division began reporting to the newly establishedBoard Finance Subcommitteeduring the year. The committeewas set up to enhance financialmanagement processes within theABC and assist the Board andmanagement to establish andmaintain best practice financialmanagement services for theCorporation. On a quarterly basisthe committee considers allfinance related matters includingfinance policy and procedure, ABCfinancial planning, budgets andtreasury activities. Regional support As well as capital cities, much attention has been paid to ABC regional properties, where the Property Services group managed the installation ofUninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) to support digital equipment. Other workscompleted during the year include refurbishments to ABC premises inTownsville, Bunbury, and Newcastle, and the installation of emergency powergenerator systems for ABC Broome, the Gold Coast, Mt Isa and Wollongong.The ABC purchased land at Port Macquarie in NSW (to accommodate therelocation of ABC's Kempsey premises) and additional land at Albany in WA. Energyaudit During the year, an energy management consultancy - Energetics - undertook a detailed energy audit at 14 of the ABC's major properties. Theaudit identified areas for potential improvements and savings that have beenincorporated into a three-year national Energy Management Plan. The Planincludes initiatives to reduce and conserve energy, as well as 'good energyhousekeeping' programs. The ABC continues annually to report all energy consumption data to the Department of Industry Science and Resources . Taking into account thephased program of digital technology conversion, the Corporation is reducingits total energy consumption towards the targets set by the CommonwealthEnergy Guidelines. While the ABC is taking measures to reduce its energy consumption, the progressive deregulation of the electricity market is resulting in price andsupply volatility in some states. Electricity contracts therefore need to beregularly reviewed and proactively managed. Legal servicesDuring the year the Legal Services Department provided the full range of legal advice, representation and assistance to the Corporation while alsoaddressing several out of the ordinary issues. The first of these issues was the introduction of the Goods & Services Tax, in particular the necessity to review existing contracts and provide advice onnew contract agreements as regards the ABC's taxation obligations. With thecommencement of the 2000 Olympic Games, ABC lawyers represented theCorporation's rights as non-rights holders for Television, in protecting itsRadio broadcast rights and in examining the difficult issue of rightsdefinitions surrounding the Online broadcast of Olympic events. Other major projects included the finalisation of contracts for digital transmission and distribution to enable the ABC to commence its digitalbroadcast in January 2001, the execution of a new agreement for the SAPbusiness information system, and negotiations regarding the ABC's proposedrelationship with OZTAM. ABC lawyers became increasingly involved in onlineand multimedia projects, as well as with rights management issues, whichthis year involved the commencement of renegotiation of blanket rightsagreements and the retransmission of the ABC signal.ABC energyconsumption200000210000220000230000 2001 2000 1999 1998Gigajoules (GJ) 98Funding Finance and Support Services99Funding Finance and Support Services While significant resources were involved in the defence of litigation matters against the ABC, the Legal Services department also devotedresources to minimising the risk of legal proceedings by providing training(courses were conducted in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth) forprogram makers in relation to defamation and contempt, and through theprovision of 24 hour pre-program legal advice to program makers. During theyear, a number of defamation issues were settled, with one defamationverdict recorded against the ABC. Improving accountability Performance measurement & benchmarkingDuring the financial year, the FFSS Division focussed on improving corporate governance and accountability and transparency to stakeholders.Members of the Division were involved in a number of governancecommittees and groups: Contracts Review Committee, Editorial PoliciesWorking Party, Enterprises Board of Management, Television CommissioningCommittee, and the News & Current Affairs Review. The division set up a specialist unit to conduct performance measurement, benchmarking and productivity reviews for the Corporation,supporting the ABC Board's commitment to improve overall accountability. The unit is responsible for the establishment, reporting against and utilisation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and domestic andinternational benchmarks. The unit aims to assist the ABC to understand itsperformance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, and identifyingopportunities to further improve performance. In March 2001 the unit hosted an international KPI workshop with participants including the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, RadioNew Zealand, the Danish Broadcasting Company (Danmarks Radio) and NRKthe Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The aim of the benchmarkingproject is to increase the degree of comparability between publicbroadcasters. Workshop participants developed agreed business rules,definitions and classifications to standardise information and feed into thecreation of meaningful benchmarks. One outcome of the workshop was thedecision that the ABC develop a repository for performance data to generateindustry averages for benchmarking purposes. Risk managementThe division also established a Risk Planning unit to facilitate a more Corporate-wide and consolidated approach to risk management. The unit'saim is to promote the awareness and integration of risk management intobusiness practice. After identification of the Corporation's key business risks, the unit briefed more than 150 senior managers on risk management, intended as afirst step in a communication strategy. Risk assessments of various initiatives have also been undertaken using the key principles of the risk standards AS/NZS: 4360: 1999 and theCorporation aims to further embed the principles of risk management acrossall its key processes.The ABC's Human Resources Division provides services to enable the Corporation to best manage and develop its people in a manner thatsupports the ABC to achieve its stated outcomes. Human Resources worked closely with new Divisional Directors to manage organisational change following the new ABC management restructure. Areporting framework was developed for all existing senior managers tosupport the new directions and Divisional structures. Training and DevelopmentABC Executive Directors agreed to allocate not less than 2 per cent of salary budget to training and development. This is a rise from 1.4% in theprevious year and represents a major commitment to staff development andtraining. Divisional development plans will be based on business needs ofthe Corporation and staff as identified by the performance managementsystem. An organisation-wide approach to training has been developed which will enable the ABC to meet its goals in the digital environment by deliveringsuitably skilled staff. Specific training in digital equipment was underpinned by generic training programs on how the new technologieswork. An introduction to widescreen television course wasdelivered to staff in all areas of the Corporation. Other topicsincluded: Bit Rate Reduction, Digital Television Networksystems, Digital Television Production, Digital Video Interfacesand Digitisation Issues. These courses were also made availableto other television networks on a fee for service basis. In December 2000, ABC Training became a Registered Training Organisation and is now able to deliver accreditedtraining, bringing major benefits to the ABC and to staffincluding: Staff undertaking accredited training will gain nationally recognised industry qualifications. The ABC will attract subsidies for eligible trainees, including existing worker trainees. The ABC will be able to seek state funds for delivery of certain training programs to ABC staff and to others. The initial registration is to deliver workplace trainer and assessor qualifications. The scope will be expanded in the next year to includequalifications for industry training packages in film, television, radio andnew media. Equity and DiversityInformation sessions and workshops on the ABC's diversity issues and activities, including discrimination and harassment, were conducted formanagers and staff at a number of locations around Australia. A number of initiatives were introduced to assist in work and life balance, including guidelines to manage flexibility in the workplace. A pilot 100Human Resources Program production trainees are presented with their final BSA certificates: L-R: Bob Connor (Training), Hall(Production Resources), Kylie Pi-Gram,Andreas Krieger, Carl Robertson Human Resources supported thedelivery of outputs1.1 and 1.2 The ABC Employment Agreement 2000-2002 with the CPSU and MEAA came into effect in July 2000 delivering wide-ranging changes to structuresand conditions for the majority of ABC staff. Key features include a reductionin the number of classifications and performance management systems,more consistent employment provisions, more flexible hours, rostering,overtime and penalty provisions. An inter-divisional group to lead implementation across the Corporation was formed and implementation continues to be a major focus. A HumanResources team provides local support and assist in the development ofsystems and guidelines and maximise opportunities to enhance productivityand effectiveness offered by the Agreement. Associated with the new classification structure in the Employment Agreement were a number of key workplace reform projects. The reformsenabled the ABC to streamline production processes and achieve efficienciesand savings in the workplace. They have been undertaken in partnershipwith other divisions and in consultation with staff and their unions. Key among them were reforms in the production of television news, both in fieldoperations and studio production areas. Coupledwith these reforms, production and support areashave made increasing use of streamlined andmore flexible hours, rostering, overtime andpenalty related provisions. The new performance management system is being phased in with Human Resources andTraining managers delivering training workshopsto over 500 managers responsible for managingstaff performance. Over 1 000 staff attendedinformation sessions on the new system. The nextphase of implementing performancemanagement is currently underway. 101Human Resources Men at Work program was conducted in February 2001, with 32 participants to examine the key issues facing men in their work and personal lives.Another pilot Better Life and Work was introduced in June 2001 for staff in NT, ACT, SA, WA and Tasmania for six months. This pilot provides a freeinformation service to assist balancing personal and professional demands. The ABC and the Federal Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business agreed to a project under the CommonwealthGovernment's Indigenous Employment Program aimed at improving theemployment circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.During the year three new Indigenous trainees were appointed under thisscheme in Human Resources, News and Current Affairs and New Media inSydney and Brisbane. Workplace reform Manager, ABC Diversity, Chrissie Tucker, (centre) with other participants in the Focuson Diversity launch in Darwin Female 46.47%Male 53.53% Staff byGenderHuman Resources has refocused its service delivery in the states to provide better and higher level services to managers and staff across the ABC.Human Resources is progressively consolidating routine payroll transactionprocessing in one centre located in Adelaide to service the entire organisation. The centralisation will be complete when payrollprocessing for New South Wales is transferred to Adelaide in October2001. The centralisation of payroll has enabled State Human Resources services to move away from a traditional transactional focus to abroader value-adding Human Resources advisory service whichremains decentralised locally. The current ABC rostering and payroll system (STAR/TIACS) is outdated technology (over 10 years old) and does not integrateadequately with other systems. This means it is expensive to maintainand restricts the ABC's capacity to implement reforms made possible inthe provisions of the ABC Employment Agreement 2000-2002. Over thepast three years the ABC has committed significant resources toimplement HR SAP , the new business system solution chosen to assist the change. This new system will integrate existing human resource functions and other business systems to provide a complete enterprise businessinformation system. It will provide a greater degree of automation andreduce the manual processing of the ABC's current rostering and payrollsystems. This year has seen intensive work undertaken to implement the latest version of HR SAP, a complete new integrated rostering and payroll system.This has been a large and difficult program to implement in terms of bothcomplexity and scope. The project has drawn significantly on HumanResources staff throughout the division. Many line managers have beeninvolved heavily in the system's development. The ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2001 came into effect on 1 January 2001. The Agreement covers approximately 230 senior management jobs. Itprovides a far simpler employment classification system and minimum termsand conditions of employment for senior managers. The new agreementenhances a more individual approach to employment bargaining for seniormanagers in the ABC. 102Human Resources Functional reformsStaff byJob Group Resources No. of 250030003500400045005000550060006500 20012000199919981997199619951994199319921991 NumbersTelevision 2.79% & Distribution 10.52% 0.39% Radio 21.75% Prog Content Development 1. 05% Prod Resources 25.9% News & CAff 17.81% New Media Services 1.83% Human Resources 2.76% Funding Finance & Support Srvs 5.56% Enterprises 4.53% Corp Wide Initiatives 0.04% Tucker, Radio Presenter Elaine Harris (with Dori theLabrador), and Managing Director JonathanShier accept an Equity and DiversityEmployer of the Year Award from the PrimeMinister the Hon John Howard MP 104Corporate In 2001, in a refinement of the Corporation's new organisation structure, the area formerly called the Corporate Affairs division divided into three mainentities: the Office of the Managing Director, supported by Corporate Planningand Governance; and Corporate Affairs. Corporate also provides administrativesupport to the ABC Board. Corporate Planning and GovernanceThe role of the unit is to support the Managing Director and Executive Directors in matters relating to corporate positioning, planning and thecoordination of governance and performance processes. The Chief of Corporate Planning and Governance leads a small team of senior specialists in corporate and divisional planning, corporate policy,Board-management liaison and the interface of ABC governance andcommunity relations (including chairmanship of the ABC's Election CoverageReview Committee).

Details of Audience andConsumer Affairs activities for the year are included under Audience Contactin this report. Review of Editorial Policies The ABC review of its Editorial Policies and Code of Practice continued this year and is due for completion and distribution in early 2002. A cross-Divisional team has undertaken considerable work on the current reviewto address changes to the media environment, legislation and ABCstructure. 106Corporate Government and ParliamentaryRelations The Government and Parliamentary Relations unit was established to oversee the Corporation's relationship with the Parliament of Australia andCommonwealth Government Departments. Key functions of the unit are to co-ordinate and respond to Parliamentary and Departmental requests forinformation, develop collaborative working relationships and to monitordevelopments in Parliament of interest to the ABC. Main activities for the yearincluded the Corporation's Budget submission, the proposal for the provision ofa television service to the Asia-Pacific, the coordination of the ABC appearancesat Senate Estimates and responding to subsequent questions on notice. In addition to Senate Estimates, the ABC appeared and prepared submissions for a number of Parliamentary Inquires for both the Senate andthe House of Representatives, including the Regional Radio Inquiry, PublicWorks Committee hearings and various Senate reference Committees. The ABCalso provided answers to 26 Questions on Notice through the Minister tovarious Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. Corporate Communications Corporate Communications is responsible for internal and external communications, including media liaison on issues involving the ABC; thepublication of a weekly internal newsletter abcXchange, cross-media promotions and the ABC Intranet. A free external newsletter, The National Broadcaster , published fortnightly is widely distributed by mail, ABC Shops, by email and on ABC Online. There was intense media interest in the ABC this year and significant demand from the media for information. Anautomated system of delivery for information was constructed toassist the media. A free subscription email service now exists forautomatic delivery of ABC media releases, statements, speeches,policy documents and the fortnightly external newsletter, The National Broadcaster . ABC Corporate Communications manages and coordinates publicity and media relations for many of the Corporation's major announcements andpolicy launches. This year it included management of issues surrounding therestructure of the ABC, staff movements, additional funding received forRadio Australia and the ABC's successful Federal budget submission. International Relations The ABC's involvement with major overseas broadcasting unions and associations has been redefined to maximise involvement in the Asia-Pacificregion through the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, the Asia-Pacific Instituteof Broadcasting Development and the Pacific Islands BroadcastingAssociation. Australia's geographical location makes it important for the ABCto nurture relationships with broadcasters in the region. This contributes tothe objective of the ABC Charter to encourage awareness of Australia and theunderstanding of Australia's attitudes on world affairs.ababcxchangehange Also on the intranet. Click on abcXchange on the front page.107Corporate The ABC has continued to be an active participant in the operation of other international broadcasting unions and associations: theCommonwealth Broadcasting Association, the European Broadcasting Union,the Royal Television Society, the National Association of Broadcasters (USA),the International Telecommunications Union, and Public BroadcastingInternational. During 2000-2001 the ABC received a large number of delegations from overseas broadcasters. Delegations are provided with tours of ABC facilitiesand take part in workshops with ABC executives and producers, facilitatingthe exchange of information between broadcasters. The ABC Performance Measurement and Benchmarking unit in the Funding Finance and Support Services division has been working with publicbroadcasters in other countries to establish meaningful benchmarks. In2000-2001 representatives of the BBC, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,Radio New Zealand, Danish and Norwegian Broadcasting Corporations cameto Australia to workshop and agree on Key Performance Indicators. The ABC isbuilding a database of performance information to assist in establishingindustry benchmarking averages. Freedom of Information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI) Act gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. Schedule 2 part 11 of the Act gives the ABC an exemption in relation to material which is program related. During the year the ABC received 20 requests for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act. One request was denied as it related to program resources, two other requests were refused in part due the natureof the requests and the lack of resources. Access was granted in part to 17 requests and in full to one request. Onerequest is still being processed. There were two requests for internal review where subsequently further materialwas released in part. Categories of documents The ABC holds documents under three broad categories: general records including correspondence, reports and minutes of meetings relating to ABC policy, program development, external relations and international management, program transmission documents, reports onaudience reaction to ABC programs and publicity on programs and activities. records subject to copyright including scripts and transcripts of programs (also subject to availability), recorded programs and other recordings. articles available for purchase including merchandise from ABC Shops and selected ABC program material.

During the last 12 months, the ABC has invested more than $68 million on digital production and transmission equipment and infrastructure for thecommencement of digital broadcasting in Australia. The ABC now has theinfrastructure in place to broadcast three digital channels and the capacityfor broadcasting SDTV, HDTV and to multichannel. During the year each state and territory was supplied with new digital television equipment and digital infrastructure conforming to the industrystandard Serial Digital Interface (SDI) specifications. The equipment iscommissioned and in operation in the Presentation and Master Control areasof the ABC throughout Australia. Digital camcorders (camera recorder) andtape machines for field acquisition of material for News and GeneralProgramming have been purchased and are in the process of beingcommissioned and put into operation in all States and Territories.Collaborative editing equipment, involving digital non-linear editing andcentral storage, has been installed for use by both News and GeneralProduction across Australia. Progress in the installation of new digital studios varies from Branch to Branch and is dependent on workpriorities and property redevelopment plans. Ordershave been placed for the construction of eight digitaltelevision Outside Broadcast vans with the first expectedto be delivered in the last quarter of 2001. The ABC has purchased initial High Definition Television (HDTV) camcorders, tape machines, monitors,vision mixers, waveform monitors and test signalgenerators. This equipment allows for evaluation andproduction of a test stream for on air transmission trialsto explore technical production issues with the newmedium. This equipment was the first 50Hz HDTVequipment to be delivered to a television facility inAustralia. The installation of Netia Digital Audio Workstations (DAWS), which commenced in 1999-2000, continued thisyear with 232 workstations deployed at twenty threeregional and four capital city sites. DAWS replace taperecorders and endless loop cartridge machines with PCbased workstations that allow the recording, editing,storage, broadcast and transfer of radio programmaterial. Digital on-air radio consoles have been installed in Sydney and Newcastle and a common approach is being developed for radio consoles for Canberra and Perth aspart of proposed property redevelopments and forplanned upgrades in Brisbane and regional stations. In 2000-2001 Radio studio equipment was upgraded in Bunbury, WesternAustralia in conjunction with local property work.

The ABC's BASYS news and current affairs production systems in Australia and London, one of the biggest networkedsystems in the world, have largely beenreplaced during 2000-01. The new system,Avstar, provides better integration for programproduction, is capable of utilising text, audio,graphics and vision, and is critical for theproduction of all News and Current Affairs forTelevision, Radio and Online. As part of the ABC-wide desktop upgrade, over 500 computers were upgraded toMicrosoft Office 2000. Following completion ofthis project, the installation of MicrosoftWindows 2000 has commenced. Detailedplanning and design for the messaginginfrastructure to replace the currentmainframe based All-In-One email system, introduced to the ABC in June1985, with Microsoft's Exchange 2000 has also begun. The ABC has continued to upgrade the graphics and data systems used for live sports and election coverage. Four sports computer systems were prepared and used for the successful coverage of the Hopman Cup by ABC TV. The live web-publishing prototypewas also successfully trialled during the Hopman Cup. This prototype providestimely updates of sports results to online website information. T&D staff are actively engaged in industry consultations with FACTS (Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations), ACA (AustralianCommunications Authority), ACIF (Australian Communications Industry Forum),AEEMA (Australian Electrical Equipment Manufacturers' Association) and WTF(Wireless Technology Forum). The ABC was represented at a number ofdomestic and international industry conferences with T&D staff presentingpapers dealing with technical and regulatory issues. Digital broadcastsThe ABC commenced digital television broadcasting on 1 January 2001 in the capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide on VHFChannel 12 (223-230MHz) in line with the Government implementationtimetable. The new broadcasts originated from temporary or \"standby\"transmitter facilities. The ABC's main digital television facilities commenced inthese cities in June 2001, while the standby facilities will continue to provideback up for the new services. The ABC will progressively roll-out transmission facilities throughout Australia with digital transmission across the country expected to becomplete by 2008. The ABC is working with the other networks to ensure thatAn ABC digital television presentation suite 110Technology and Distribution all broadcasters provide digital television to particular regions at about the same time. While the Australian Government has yet to pass legislation relating to the introduction of Digital Radio Broadcasting (DRB), the ABC joined withthree commercial radio operators in Sydney to form a consortium, known asDigital 2000, to trial digital radio broadcasts from Parramatta and NorthSydney using the European Eureka 147 system. The ABC commencedtransmission of the ABC Classic FM signal from Parramatta on 15 September1999 and followed a program of technical tests and evaluation on the digitaltransmissions. Technical trainingThe ABC delivered 127 technical training courses in the 2000-2001 financial year. These courses were conducted to introduce and familiarise ABCstaff in the use of digital television production and transmission equipment.With the introduction of Digital Audio workstations a further 54 courses weremanaged by the ABC familiarising both technical staff and users with thenew systems. A similar number of courses have been delivered to journalistsfor the introduction of Avstar. A number of training courses were alsoprovided for both the project management methodology adopted by the ABCfor technical projects and the pilot electronic records and documentmanagement systems. Taking care of ABC assetsThe ABC DigitalAsset Management (DAM) is about managing the Corporation's vast collection of audio, visual and textual material gatheredfor its radio, television and new media platforms. The ABC has beenexploring various DAM technology systems to make the process of collecting,storing and making available the content and its components (e.g. music,pictures, video), as seamless as possible. During the year the ABC exploredthe capabilities and maturity of DAM technology currently available and inthe coming year will focus on the detailed requirements for DAM in the ABC. An auction was held at Gore Hill in March 2001 to begin disposal of some 40 tonnes of equipmentreplaced as part of the digitisation and normalreplacement programs. Various ways of disposal havebeen explored to determine the best returns to theABC. Returns through auctions are small once costsare deducted, while sales to recyclers consistentlyreturn a small profit over the costs of disposal. Following the sale in June 2000 of the intellectual property in D-CART and D-Radio toHannetDigital, the Korean manufacturer has met allof its progress payments to the ABC. As part of the transition arrangements, HannetDigital took full responsibility for all formerABC customers in June 2001. 111Technology and Distribution Outcome 2 - Transmission ABC Service No. ABC Distribution NTL Transmission Total Network Transmitters Network* Network# Availability\u00a7 \"on air\" Target % Availability % ** (some service to audience) *ABC Distribution Network (including contracted service providers) :The ABC distribution network ensures that programs are delivered from the studio to local transmitters throughout Australia. The network includes outsourcedsatellite services and terrestrial broadcast lines. The distribution network has exceeded performance targets, with theexception of Local Radio. Local Radio is the only network dependent on non-redundant terrestrial broadcast lines andISDN services between regional studios and transmitter sites. Cost considerations prevent the ABC from introducingredundancy for these services. ABC distribution network targets are currently under negotiation. The estimated targetsused in this table are aggregated from a number of distribution contracts that are either in place or under negotiation. #NTL Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor) :The transmission network provided by NTL Australia has performed within expectations. The actual transmission figures for this year include some periods of reduced power andoff air resulting from major transmitter refurbishment works in each state capital, the introduction of digital TV and therollout of 69 new SBS services. This year a small number of under performing services have been identified and repairedor have major capital replacement works scheduled to restore the services to normal. The performance of these serviceshas lowered overall transmission network performance. In some cases these services have been under-performing for anumber of years and improved monitoring and reporting has finally identified these deficiencies. \u00a7Total Network Availability: Total network availability includes the direct impact of all planned outages, for the construction and repair of services. However, in the majority of cases, the works were undertaken with continuousoperation of services from standby or temporary plant and undertaken in a manner that minimised the audience impactof the works. \"On air\" availability supports this, showing where the audience continued to receive an on air service,when compared against the overall network targetsThe ABC, through its Distribution and Communications area, manages analog television and radio transmission service contracts in excess of $80million per annum with transmission service providers NTL Australia. During 2000-2001 work commenced with NTL Australia on improving reporting systems to collect accurate outage and performance figures tomeasure compliance with performance targets set in the TransmissionServices Agreement. Data on the level of outages experienced prior to the sale of the National Transmission Network is not available to the ABC. However, the ABC hasobtained from NTL Australia, data on the level of outages experienced by theABC's analog terrestrial transmission services for the year 2000-2001.Technology and Distribution delivered output 2.1 in the achievement of Outcome 2112Technology and Distribution Outcome 2 - Transmission Fault rectification For the period July 2000 - June 2001 the average time of restoration for a transmission or distribution network fault was: A Class transmitter (state capital services) 16 minutesB Class transmitter (major regional centres) 19 minutes Reception advice line The ABC works with the audience to ensure transmission defects are identified and repaired as soon as possible. In order to deliver this, aReception Advice Line has been established and handles telephone calls,emails and letters from the audience relating to the reception of all ABC TVand radio services. The advice line can be contacted on 1300 13 9994 (at localcall cost), by email: reception.advice@abc.net.au or the self help website:http://abc.net.au/reception/. This year, the unit has handled enquiries via telephone, email and letters as follows: Television service enquiries 16 320 Radio service enquiries 4 297Total enquiries resolved 20 617 Most enquiries to the Reception Advice Line are not due to transmission faults. About 60 per cent of reception problems are caused by electricalinterference or a deficiency in receiving equipment. Where the receptionissue cannot be solved by telephone, callers may be referred to a localtechnical source for further assistance. This year transmitters in the five major state capitals - Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney were refurbished. Periods of reduced powerand short transmission breaks were necessary to allow crews to work safelyon the transmitter towers. The ABC ensured that the impacts on audienceswere minimised and advised local viewers and listeners of disruptions toservice and planned duration. Maintaining the servicesThe Federal Government provides the ABC with fixed funding to enable it to broadly maintain the quality of reception of existing ABC broadcast servicesto the general public and also provides a special appropriation to enableminor extensions and service enhancements for the transmission of itsbroadcasting services within Australia. New services Ten of the 11 new radio and television analog services planned before the sale of the National Transmission Network (NTN) commenced broadcastingduring 2000-2001: ABC TV services Hopetoun, Victoria; Radio National inHopetoun, Victoria and, TV and Radio, in Weldborough, Tasmania. Planningdifficulties and bad weather have delayed the final ABC TV service in Lilydale,Tasmania.A special helicopter was used to install a new section to the ABC transmitter at GoreHill, to enable digital broadcasting 113Technology and Distribution Outcome 2 - Transmission Two new Local Radio satellite services commenced this year for Northern Queensland, rebroadcasting ABC Far North Local Radio from the ABC's Cairnsstudio; and Central Western Australia, rebroadcasting ABC Goldfields\u2014Esperance Local Radio from the ABC's Kalgoorlie studio. The satellite serviceshave provided more relevant local programming to audiences in severalsurrounding towns and via local transmitters. With the provision of additional funding from the Commonwealth Government the ABC launched a new subsidy scheme for communitieslocated in cyclone incident areas in Northern Australia during the year. Thescheme gives residents the opportunity to apply for funding to establish theirown rebroadcasting facility for ABC Local Radio. This will help to ensurecommunities have access to the latest local news and weather reports, whichare particularly important during the cyclone season. New services planned for the 2001-2002 year The ABC expects to be able to implement 20 minor extensions and enhancement projects for analog TV and radio services during 2000-2001.Any significant extension of ABC analog services would require further specificfunding to be made available from the Federal Government. Changes to existing services During the year there were a number of changes of frequency for ABC TV services. To minimise disruption the ABC participated in communityinformation campaigns with a tollfree telephone helpline, online information,household leaflet drops, announcements in local newspapers and on localABC Radio and Television. Publicity material was also sent to local MPs,councils, hospitals, educational establishments and television services. Changes to Radio Australia The Commonwealth Government, in August 2000, provided additional funds of up to $2.8m per year to obtain extended transmission hours forRadio Australia in the South East Asian region \u2014 in particular, an additionalfive hours a day program delivery and transmission to Central and WesternIndonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. The ABC has entered into contracts with three shortwave providers with transmitters in Darwin, Singapore, Taiwan and the Marianas to providetransmission facilities. The enhanced service reaches audiences in South-EastAsia and can be heard reliably in parts of the wider Asian region. Shortwavebroadcasts are delivered from several transmission sites, both off-shore andon-shore, to provide scheduling flexibility. The ABC had to change distribution of Radio Australia's services to South East Asia and the Pacific as a result of the Channel 7 decision to close itsAustralia Television service from 23 March 2001. The Radio Australia servicehad traditionally been carried through the same distribution system as theAustralia Television service. Contracts have since been signed with a satelliteservice provider to continue the service.

The Corporation has disclaimed liability and is actively defending these actions. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments which may be required in relation to these claims. The Corporation has provided guarantees and indemnity to the Reserve Bank of Australia for $1 950 711 (2000 $2 186 626) in support of 10 (2000 11) BankGuarantees required in the day to day operations of the Corporation. The above schedule should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.Schedule of Contingencies Schedule of ContingenciesABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:06 Page 10126The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\")and the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation, its controlled entities and the entities it controlled from time to time during the period, arestated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. These policies have been applied consistently by all entities in the economic entity. 1.1 Basis of AccountingThe financial statements are required by clause 1 (b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and are a general purpose financial report. They have been prepared in accordance with: Schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Financial Statements 2000-2001) Orders made by the Finance Minister for the preparation of Financial Statements in relation to financial years ending on or after 30 June 2001; Australian Accounting Standards and Accounting Interpretations issued by Australian Accounting Standards Boards; other authoritative pronouncements of the Boards; and Consensus Views of the Urgent Issues Group. The statements have been prepared having regard to: Statements of Accounting Concepts; and the Explanatory Notes to Schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Financial Statements 2000-2001) Orders issued by the Departmentof Finance and Administration; and Guidance Notes issued by that Department. The Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance and Financial Position have been prepared on an accrual basis and are in accordancewith historical cost convention, except for certain assets which, as noted, are atvaluation. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changingprices on the results or on the financial position. Assets and liabilities are recognised in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when and only when it is probable that futureeconomic benefits will flow and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. Assets and liabilities arising under agreements equallyproportionately unperformed are however not recognised unless required by anAccounting Standard. Liabilities and assets which are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments and the Schedule of Contingencies.for the year ended 30 June 2001Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements 1. Statement of Significant Accounting PoliciesABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:06 Page 11127Revenues and expenses are recognised in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance when and only when the flow or consumptionor loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.2 RoundingAmounts are rounded to the nearest $1,000 except in relation to : remuneration of directorsremuneration of officers (other than directors)remuneration of auditors trust funds 1.3 Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements are those of the economic entity, comprising the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, its controlled entities and the entities it controlled from time to time during the period. Controlled entities have annual reporting periods ending 31 December. Accounts of the controlled entities are prepared for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 for consolidation using accounting policies which are consistentwith those of the Corporation. Control exists where the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has the capacity to dominate the decision making in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so the controlled entity operates to achieve the objectives of theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation. The effects of all transactions and balances between the entities are eliminated in full. Details of controlled entities are contained in note 22. Financial statements of subsidiaries not considered to be a going concern have been prepared on a liquidation basis. No adjustments were necessary in relationto the recoverability and classification of the recorded assets of those subsidiaries. 1.4 TaxationThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation and its primary controlled entities are not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, whilst subject to income tax, have been inactive for the year ended 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001. The Corporation and controlled entities are subject to fringe benefits tax, payroll tax and goods and services tax. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont) 1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 121281.5 Foreign Currency Transactions Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. Exchange gains and losses and hedging costs arising on contracts entered into as hedges of specific revenue or expense transactions are deferred until the date of such transactions at which time they are included in the determination of suchrevenues or expenses. Open hedge contracts relating to all other revenue and expenditure transactions are converted at the applicable exchange rate at balance date with exchange gainsor losses being included in the Statement of Financial Performance. All foreign currency balances are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date, except for liabilities brought to accountat contract rates, which are subject to currency swap contracts for which anAustralian dollar currency repayment schedule has been adopted. Monetary assetsand liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporationin foreign currencies are translated into Australian currency at the applicableexchange rate at balance date. Non-monetary items of overseas branches aretranslated at exchange rates current at the transaction date. 1.6 DerivativesDerivative financial instruments are used by the Corporation to manage financial risks and are not entered into for trading purposes. The classes of derivative financial contracts used are interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying exposure. A. Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreementsInterest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are entered into for the purpose of managing the Corporation's interest rate position. Gains or losses oninterest rate swaps are included in the measurement of interest payments on the transactions to which they relate. Premiums or discounts are amortised throughthe Statement of Financial Performance each year over the life of the swap. B. Forward exchange contractsForward exchange contracts are used to hedge specific and regular occurring foreign exchange payments. Contracts are revalued at year end and the gain or lossis included in the Statement of Financial Performance. C. Foreign exchange options Foreign exchange options are used to hedge specific foreign currency payments. Premiums paid on foreign exchange options are amortised to theStatement of Financial Performance over the life of the contract.1.

Interest on theinstruments is recognised as an expense on an effective yield basis. Borrowingsare Commonwealth Government guaranteed. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except to the extent that they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised. Theamount capitalised in a reporting period does not exceed the costs incurred in that period. 1.8 Cash Cash includes notes and coins held, and any deposits held at call with a bank or financial institution. 1.9 ReceivablesReceivables are carried at nominal amounts due less provision for doubtful debts.The Corporation makes a specific provision for doubtful debts by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the probability ofrecovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. 1.10 Bills of Exchange and Promissory NotesPremiums or discounts are amortised through the Statement of Financial Performance each year from the date of purchase so that investments attain their redemption value by maturity date and income is recognised on an effective yield basis. Any profits or losses arising from the disposal prior to maturity are taken to the Statement of Financial Performance in the period in which they are realised. Theseassets are intended to be held to maturity and are carried at cost or cost adjustedfor discounts and premiums. 1.11 Trade CreditorsCreditors are recognised at their nominal amounts, being the amounts at which the liabilities will be settled. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that thegoods and services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Settlement is on normal commercial terms.1.12 Reporting by Outcomes and SegmentsA comparison of Budget and Actual figures by outcomes specified in the Appropriation Acts relevant to the Corporation is presented in note 23. Anyintra-government costs included in the figure \"net cost to Budget outcomes\" are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting tooperate predominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia.1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 141301.13 Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised upon the delivery of goods and services to customers. Interest revenue is recognised on a proportional basis taking into account the interest rates applicable to the financial assets. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Revenue from disposal of non-current assets is recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. External contributions earned in respect of the production of television programs are reflected in the Statement of Financial Performance once the program has been broadcast (refer note 1.19). Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for specific purpose where recognition of revenue will berecognised in accordance with the agreement. Recognition of appropriations from the government is discussed in note 1.22. Core operationsAll material revenue described in this note are revenues relating to the core oper- ating activities of the Corporation and controlled entities. Details of revenueamounts are given in notes 4 and 5. 1.14 Employee EntitlementsLeaveThe liability for employee entitlements includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave isnon-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees of theCorporation and the economic entity is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The liability for annual leave reflects the value of total annual leave entitlements of all employees at 30 June 2001 and is recognised at its nominal amount. The non-current portion of the liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at 30 June 2001. In determining the present value of the liability, attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflationhave been taken into account. On-costs relating to annual and long service leave have been included in the provision.1.

Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont) Separation and redundancies Provision is made for separation and redundancy payments in cases where positions have been formally identified as excess to requirements, the existence of an excess has been publicly communicated, and a reliable estimate of theamount payable can be determined. SuperannuationEmployees contribute to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. Employer contributions amounting to $28 080 557 (1999/2000: $27 380 292) for the Corporation and $31 595 741(1999/2000: $31 022 700) for the economic entity in relation to these schemes have been expensed in these financial statements. No liability is shown for superannuation in the Statement of Financial Position as the employer contributions fully extinguish the accruing liability which is assumedby the Commonwealth. Employer Superannuation Productivity Benefit contributions totalled $7 381 108 (1999/2000: $6 736 618) for the Corporation and $8 383 419 (1999/2000: $7 919 128) for the economic entity. 1.15 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrading or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. 1.16 Acquisition of AssetsAssets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilitiesundertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and revenues at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 1.17 Infrastructure, Plant and EquipmentAsset recognition thresholdPurchases of infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position, except for purchases costing less than $2000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition (other than where theyform part of a group of similar items which are significant in total). RevaluationsSchedule 1 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Financial Statements 2000-2001) Orders requires that land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment be revalued progressively in accordance with the \"deprival\" method of valuation in successive three-year cycles, so that no asset has a value greaterthan three years old.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 161321.17 Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment (continued) The requirements of Schedule 1 have been implemented as follows: Freehold land, buildings on freehold land and leasehold improvements are each revalued progressively on a geographical basis. The current cycles commenced in 2000-01 and each of these asset classes were independentlyrevalued during the 2000-01 financial year. All plant and equipment assets on hand at the commencement of the cycle, including information technology assets (not under operating leases) andfurniture and fittings were independently revalued during 2000-01 financial year. All libraries and archives were independently revalued during the 2000-01 financial year. Motor vehicles were revalued at directors' valuation in the 1999-00 financial year and are not due for revaluation until 2002-03. Assets in each class acquired after the commencement of a progressive revaluation cycle are not captured by the progressive revaluation then in progress. In accordance with the deprival methodology, land is measured at its current market buying price. Property other than land, plant and equipment is measuredat its depreciated replacement cost. Where assets are held which would notbe replaced or are surplus to requirements, measurement is at net realisablevalue. All valuations are independent or at directors' valuations. Recoverable Amount TestSchedule 1 requires the application of the recoverable amount test to the Corporation's non-current assets in accordance with AAS 10 Recoverable Amount of Non-Current Assets. The carrying amounts of these non-current assets have been reviewed to determine whether they are in excess of their recoverableamounts. In assessing recoverable amounts, the relevant cash flows, including the expected cash inflows from future appropriations by the Parliament, havebeen discounted to their present value. No write-down to recoverable amount has been made in 2000-01.Depreciation and amortisationDepreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives to the Corporation using,in all cases, the straight line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements areamortised on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of theimprovements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation/amortisation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each balance date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Residual values are re-estimated for a change in prices only when assets are revalued.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont) 1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 171331.17 Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment (continued) Depreciation and amortisation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2001 2000 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold land, buildings and improvements Lease term Lease term Plant and equipment 6 - 15 years 6 - 15 years As part of the revaluation of all plant and equipment, the useful lives of all assets were reassessed and in the majority of cases shortened, owing to the effectof technological change and the conversion from analogue to digital. This hasaccelerated the depreciation on many assets. The aggregate amount of depreciation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 6C. Asset Write-downA nation-wide stock count of all plant and equipment assets was completed during 2000-01 and a total write-down of $4.3 million received directors approval in May2001. Of this amount, $1.9 million was provided for in the 1999-2000 financialstatements and a further write-down of $2.4 million has been made in 2000-01 as disclosed in note 6D. 1.18 IntangiblesThe carrying amount of each non-current intangible asset is reviewed to determine whether it is in excess of the asset's recoverable amount. If an excessexists as at the reporting date, the asset is written down to its recoverableamount immediately. In assessing recoverable amounts, the relevant cash flows,including the expected cash inflows from future appropriations by the Parliament,have been discounted to their present value. No write-down to recoverable amount has been made in 2000-01.Intangible assets such as software, do not require independent valuation and can be recorded at either cost, or at fair value by way of directors' valuation. A directors' valuation of the Bananas in Pyjamas intellectual property rights has been done on a discounted cash flow basis during the 2000-01 financial year. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are: 2001 2000 Copyright 5 years 5 years Software 3 -5 years 3 - 5 years The aggregate amount of amortisation allocated for intangible assets during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 6C.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont) 1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 181341.19 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at cost, unless they are no longer required, in which case they are valued at net realisable value. Televisionprograms are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses. Fixed production overheads are expensed in the period in whichthey are incurred. The cost of television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs - 100% on first screening. Children's, Education and Movies - Straight line over the shorter of the license period or three years. All other programs not covered above - 90% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year. Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. Alternative Amortisation Schedule - Management may determine an alternative amortisation schedule for exceptional programs in any of the above categories for which the stated policy is considered inappropriate. Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. The costs of programs produced for news, current affairs and radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock onhand at any time being minimal. The provision for obsolete retail stock is based on stock on hand over twelve months old and which may require discounting or disposal. Items in engineeringand general stores which have not been issued for three years are provided for as obsolete. 1.20 Capital Usage ChargeA capital usage charge of 12% is imposed by the Commonwealth on the net assets of the Corporation. The charge is adjusted to take account of asset gifts and revaluation increments during the financial year. 1.21 LeasesA distinction is made between finance leases which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets and operating leases under which thelessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. The net present value of future net outlays in respect of surplus space under non-cancellable lease agreements is expensed in the period in which the space becomes surplus. Lease incentives taking the form of \"free\" leasehold improvements and rent holi- days are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating leasepayments between rental expense and reduction of the liability.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont) 1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont)ABC finances.qxd 22/11/2001 12:07 Page 191351.22 Appropriations From 1 July 1999, the Commonwealth Budget has been prepared under an accruals framework. Under this framework, Parliament appropriates monies to the Corporation as revenue appropriations, as loan appropriations and as equity injections. Revenue AppropriationsRevenues from government are revenues of the core operating activities of the Corporation. Appropriations for outputs are recognised as revenue to the extent they have been received into the Corporation's bank account or are entitled to bereceived by the Corporation at year end. Transactions by the Government as owner.Appropriations to the Corporation designated as \"capital equity injections\" are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that the appropriation has beenreceived into the Corporation's bank account or are entitled to be received bythe Corporation at year end. 1.23 GrantsThe corporation recognises grant liabilities as follows.Most grant agreements require the grantee to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. In these cases, liabilities are recognisedonly to the extent that the services required have been performed or the eligibility criteria have been satisfied by the grantee. (Where grants moneyare paid in advance of performance or eligibility, a prepayment is recognised). In cases where grant agreements are made without conditions to be monitored, liabilities are recognised on signing of the agreement. 1.24 Changes in Accounting PolicyChanges in accounting policy have been identified in this note under their appropriate headings. 1.25 Comparative FiguresWhere applicable, prior year comparative figures have been restated to reflect the current year's presentation in the financial statements. 1.26 Reclassification of Financial InformationSome line items and subtotals reported in the previous financial year have been reclassified and repositioned in the financial statements as a result of the firsttime application on 1 July 2000 of the revised standards AAS 1 Statement of Financial Performance, AAS 37 Financial Report Presentation and Disclosures and AAS 36 S t a t e m e n to fF i n a n c i a l P o s i t i o n . A revenue and an expense previously disclosed as abnormal have been reclassified and are shown as individually significant items in Note 2. These items are no longer identified separately on the face of the Statement ofFinancial Performance. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements (cont) 1.

Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the net fair values. Cash, receivables, payables and short term borrowings The carrying amount approximates the net fair value because of the short term maturity. InvestmentsThe carrying amount for non traded instruments has been assessed by the directors based on the underlying net assets, expected cash flows and any particular special circumstances of the investee as approximating net fair values. Long term borrowings The net fair values of long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Interest rate swaps and cross currency swap agreementsThe net fair values of unrecognised financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts the economic entity expects to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (netof transaction costs) or to replace the contracts at their current market rates as at thereporting date. This is based on independent market quotations and using standardvaluation techniques. Forward exchange contractsThe net fair values of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

Credit Risk Exposures Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform as contracted. Financial AssetsThe economic entity's maximum exposures to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net ofprovision for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in the Statement ofFinancial Position. Items not recognised in the Statement of Financial PositionThe credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The economicentity has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterpartyand, as a matter of policy, only transacts with financial institutions that have ahigh credit rating. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate derivativesis represented by the net fair value of the contracts, as disclosed. D. Hedging Instruments Specific Hedges The net unrecognised gain of $224 061 (2000 unrecognised loss $10 348) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases will be recognised atthe date of the underlying transactions. General HedgesAt balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy United States Dollars (USD), Great British Pounds (GBP) and the Euro (EUR).

Appendix 15ABC Advisory CouncilRecommendations,Responses andCommendations 3-4 August 2000 Meeting Recommendations andResponses Audience Research \u2014 Regional Areas Recommendation R1/2/00 \u2014 Director of Content Development Council notes the important research theABC has conducted. This includes forexample the survey of radio network'sperformance across five capital cities(Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth andAdelaide) for the period 27 December1999 to 11 March 2000. However, Councilbelieves there is a need for regularaudience research throughout Australia,including regional and remote Australiaand the ACT, and for the inclusion ofHobart in the city surveys. It also notesthat the Northern Territory has not hadany market research for several years. Response from Director of ContentDevelopment The ABC Research Department hasrecently become part of the new ContentDevelopment Division. The department'sstructure and all existing researchcontracts are under review. Wheredeemed necessary, appropriate changesand additions will be made. As part ofthis review, specific reference will bemade to the three recommendations ofCouncil. Current Affairs \u2014 Information Programs Recommendation R2/2/00 \u2014 Director of News and Current Affairs and Director ofRadio Council notes widespread concern aboutthe future of current affairs on ABCTelevision. It considers, particularly aftercommunity consultations in Alice Springs, that the ABC has a responsibility topresent discussions on current affairswhich place the news in context andassist viewers in their understanding ofcontemporary events, as ABC Radiocurrently does. It has comments on thefollowing programs: Lateline \u2014 it is regrettable that the original format of Lateline has been changed. In depth discussion is whatdistinguished the program from otherlate night news programs. Late Night Live \u2014 Council received representations in support of theretention of Late Night Live and its presenter. Council believes that Late Night Live makes an important contribution to Australia's intellectuallife. It does, however, consider that thereare occasions when personal politicalviews overwhelm the content. Council hopes that its views will be taken into account during this period ofrestructuring of news, current affairs andinformation programming. Response from Director of News and CurrentAffairs As noted, Lateline has undergone changes over the past six months,initially with the inclusion of a newselement, and recently towards morenews analysis. We have made it clearthat when the need arises, Lateline will be doing in-depth interviews as it has inthe past. However, the emphasis will beon topical news coverage and newsanalysis. The changes to Lateline aresupported by audience research whichshows increasing demand for lateevening TV news, as lifestyles change andmany people arrive home later. It is truethat the commercial networks also offernews at that time. However, theirproduct is largely a reworking of theearlier bulletins; Lateline is now offering substantially fresh material, especiallyfrom the ABC's extensive network ofoverseas correspondents. The 10.30pmtimeslot is well positioned for this. In anideal world, of course, we would preferto produce both styles of programming -news analysis and in-depth interviews -but budgetary and scheduling limitationsmean we must choose between the two.And that decision is guided largely bywhat viewers tell us they want at thathour. Response from Director of Radio Council's support for Late Night Live andits presenter is appreciated. Despiterecent media speculation, there are nopresent plans to make changes to LateNight Live. Program formats do howeverremain under the constant attention of television and radio management, as dothe levels of audience support, but thecurrent schedules remain in place. Anychanges to network schedules or programformats will only occur after the closestconsideration of all relevant factors. Extension of Services \u2014 News Radio and Triple J Recommendation R3/2/00 \u2014 Director ofRadio Council believes that all Australiansshould have the opportunity to accessNewsRadio and Triple J. Feedbackindicates that these services would beappreciated in rural areas. Response from Director of Radio The ABC would like nothing better thanto be able to provide all its services to allAustralians, regardless of where they live.However, it is it is important that Councilmembers are aware of the currentarrangements for transmission of ABCservices. Since 1 May 1999, the ABC has had responsibility for, and been in control of,its terrestrial analog television and radiotransmission services. Prior to that date,the National Transmission Agency inCanberra had responsibility for deliveringall ABC terrestrial broadcast servicesaround Australia. The Federal Government has provided the ABC with fixed funding which willenable us to broadly maintain thequality of reception of the existing ABCbroadcast services to the general public.The Federal Government has alsoprovided the ABC with a specialappropriation to enable minor extensionsand enhancements to our transmissionnetwork. However, requests forextensions and service enhancementshave now significantly exceeded ourability to meet them from the specificfunding currently available. In its triennium funding submission, the ABC sought extra funds from the FederalGovernment to further extend Triple Jand PNN retransmission facilities aroundAustralia. We were not successful inobtaining these funds. Programs for Young Audiences Recommendation R4/2/00 \u2014 Director of Content Development, Director of Radio,Director of Television and Director of Newsand Current Affairs Council has received positive feedbackfrom young people regarding televisionprograms such as The Full Kombi , Triple J Unearthed , and the Four Corners reports, Hitting Material and The Killer of Thurston High. However, we feel that becauseappendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 167168these programs timeslots don't usually contain issues of interest to youngpeople, many were unaware that theseshows would be of interest to them.Council recommends better targetedpromotion of these types of shows so thatyoung people do not miss them. Response from Director of Radio ABC Television broadcast a documentaryon the highly successful Triple JUnearthed project on 27 June. Thedocumentary was the subject ofextensive cross-promotion on Triple Jleading up to its screening. Thedocumentary was promoted daily, in atleast one key shift, in the month prior togoing to air and in the final week beforescreening promotions were broadcastduring each shift. The timing of thescreening coincided with promotions forTriple J's Unearthing of Sydney in July. Response from Director of Television ABC Television program marketing andpromotional strategies are currently beingassessed with the objective of bettertargeting various audience sections,including young audiences. Response from Director of News and CurrentAffairs Four Corners aims for a wide audience reach, but naturally welcomes youngerviewers as potential \"lifelong\" devotees.It draws an increasing volume of accessesto its lively post-program forums on theFour Corners website, reflecting a growing youth culture to engage directly with ABCprogram makers. This month Four Cornerslooked at public relations and theOlympics, digital television, and theservice industry workplace: all issueswith potential interest to youngerviewers. Within budget limitations, Newsand Current Affairs promotes its programsas widely as possible. We will investigatepossible expansion of youth publicitythrough ABC outlets such as Triple J. Response from Director of ContentDevelopment Council will be aware that a new YouthProgram Development Unit is beingestablished as part of the newly createdContent Development Division. TheExecutive Producer of Youth programmingwill be made aware of this promotionalissue and asked to take appropriate stepsto ensure adequate promotion of anynewly developed youth programming.This will be done in liaison withTelevision, Radio, New Media and Newsand Current Affairs.Something in the Air Recommendation R5/2/00 \u2014 Director of Television and Director of ContentDevelopment Council notes that Something in the Air isincreasing in popularity, but many youngpeople find it hard to relate to the'young' characters portrayed on theshow. Feedback from consultations inAlice Springs suggests support for anindigenous character. Council constantlyreceives requests for repeats ofHeartbreak High . Could this be considered for 6pm then youngaudiences may stay on for Something in the Air ? Response from Director of Television The Television Division is investigating ways of implementing therecommendation including broadcastingremaining episodes of Heartbreak High for which the ABC holds rights at 6.00pmfrom the start of series three ofSomething in the Air in January/February 2001. Response from Director of ContentDevelopment Director of Television is undertaking areview of the next series of Something in the Air , part of which is to increase the appeal of the program to a wideraudience. Insofar as qualitative researchmay be required to address this issue,the Research department will liaise withTelevision. Commendations Council recorded commendations for arange of television and radio programsincluding Message Stick, Axeman, Thomson of Arnhem Land, The Games,Stateline, Landline, Four Corners, SoundQuality and Behind the News . It commended Triple J for its commitmentto the Unearthed project, the work of theABC Equity and Diversity Manager and theCorporation's support for National ScienceWeek. 23-24 November 2000 Meeting Recommendations andResponses Special Events - Features Recommendation R1/3/00 - Director of Television Council has received positive feedbackabout initiatives such as showing themovie Gallipoli in conjunction with Remembrance Day and the documentaryThree Minutes to Glory in conjunction with the Paralympics. Council commendsthe showing of feature length films anddocumentaries to coincide with special events. Response from Director of Television The Television Division will continue tohighlight significant events withappropriate, key programming, includingfeature films and documentaries. News and Current Affairs Recommendation R2/3/00 - Director of News and Current Affairs Council notes the high qualitybroadcasting of news and current affairsaround Australia. Council supports andunderstands the importance of the ABCnot only being independent but alsobeing 'perceived' as independent. Response from Director of News and CurrentAffairs News and Current Affairs managementand staff are empowered by the ABCCharter and the ABC's Editorial Policies todeliver news bulletins and current affairsprograms that maintain the higheststandards and are noted for theiradherence to the principles of accuracy,impartiality and objectivity. AM and PM Recommendation R3/3/00 - Director of News and Current Affairs Council supports strongly the currentlength of these programs and recognisestheir role and importance in the lives ofthe majority of Australians. Response from Director of News and CurrentAffairs The current durations of AM and PM willbe maintained for the 2001 productionyear. SCOSE Reports Recommendation R4/3/00 - Director of News and Current Affairs, Director of Radioand Director of Television Council would like to see greaterattention by presenters being given tothe SCOSE report. Response from Director of News and CurrentAffairs News and Current Affairs presenters andon-air reporters all receive an electroniccopy of the monthly SCOSE reportdelivered via the Basys/Avstar systems.News and Current Affairs is responsiblefor managing SCOSE and ensuring thatthe Language Research Specialist suppliesdaily pronunciation word lists to all ABCon-air staff. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television has taken theopportunity of Council'sRecommendation to remind executiveproducers and promotions staff of theappendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 168169importance of ensuring that presenters and announcers are aware of SCOSEreports and are familiar with latestreports. Response from Director of Radio ABC Radio is well aware of the ABC'sresponsibility to maintain the higheststandards in pronunciation and usage ofwords and phrases and for Radiobroadcasters, in their use of language, toreflect the standards that ABC audiencesexpect of the national broadcaster. To ensure there is no lapse in these standards, or if in doubt about therecommended, or generally accepted,use of names, words and phrases, Radiobroadcasters have a range of referencesources readily available. These sourcesinclude the daily pronunciation guides,the Pronunciation Handbook, the SCOSEReport and the Language ResearchSpecialist. Radio \u2014 Rural Areas Recommendation R5/3/00 - Director of Radio Council notes the importance of access bypeople in rural and regional areas toradio programs in particular, as many ofthese areas do not have ready access tonewspapers or other forms ofinformation. Response from Director of Radio The ABC is extremely committed to ruraland regional broadcasting and welcomesCouncil's support in this area. With 48regional stations and an increasingemphasis on programming aboutregional Australia, we are conscious oftrying to increase our coverage of ruraland regional issues to both the regionaland city audience. Council may be interested to know that a new weekly regionally sourced televisionprogram, Radio Pictures is to commence in June, using radio broadcasters to tellthe stories about their local patch ontelevision. There is also a new rural radioprogram beginning on Radio National atEaster. This will be a daily program from11.00am to 12.00noon about regionalissues. At the end of February, Rural Radio is again providing extensive coverage of thenational ABARE Conference in Canberra.This year, as well as radio and audiostreaming of the conference online, Ruralis also experimenting with a unique formof video broadcasting online to provideadditional coverage for those people inregional Australia unable to attend theconference.Nurses Recommendation R6/3/00 - Director of Television Council recommends that in light of thesuccess and positive feedback aboutNurses the ABC could look at similar programs filmed along the same lines,which follow other occupations. Response from Director of Television The Television Division continues to seeksimilar program opportunities, given thestrong audience response to Nurses ; the impact of which extended beyond thealmost one million metropolitan and halfmillion regional viewers that watchedeach episode to include significantnumbers of online accesses and requeststo use tapes at nurses symposia. Currently in development is a follow-up series to Nurses , this time focussing on the teaching profession. Television hasalso scheduled the documentary series,The Academy , directed by Simon Target (Kings School , Flight For Life ), providing a behind the scenes look at Duntrooncadets. Series on 'Moral Dilemmas' Recommendation R7/3/00 - Director of Television and Director of Development Council recommends that ABC Televisionlook at presenting a series which dealswith 'moral dilemmas' in practical reallife situations covering ethical, social andcultural dilemmas facing people invarious areas, for example: the law,health, education, ageing. Council alsosuggests an online forum to follow suchprograms. Response from Director of Television The Television Division will discuss theproposal with the Development Divisionwith a view to developing appropriateprograms for production and broadcast.Television would also like to believe thatmany current programs, from factualthrough to drama, look at moraldilemmas. New programs indevelopment will also address thequestions of ethics and culturaldilemmas. Response from Director of Development The Development Division is currentlydeveloping programming proposals inthe areas of law, health, education andcontemporary life ('aging'). A number ofthese proposals could deal with 'moraldilemmas' and ethical, social andcultural dilemmas people face. TheDivision will take on board Council'ssuggestion during the development ofthese proposals.ABC Communication Recommendation R8/3/00 - Director of Television Council discussed the need for the ABC tobe a better communicator both internallyand externally. Reference was made toprograms such as Backchat and the former segment on NewsRadio whichinformed people about the ABC. Councilrecommends that the ABC explore thepossibility of segments explaining whatthe ABC does. This could also include asegment on audience feedback andinformation about what the ABC has tooffer, along the lines of that which wason NewsRadio. The segment could alsoinclude SCOSE issues and provide anexplanation of current ABC issues. Response from Director of Television The Division recognises the ongoingimportance of better internal andexternal communication. Theprogramming of Backchat -style programs has been considered on a number ofoccasions. Under discussion is thequestion of how best to achieve the mosteffective opportunity for communicatingprogram changes and/or responding toviewer's comments. The Division believes this is achieved through individual direct responses toviewer's comments and enquiries, withan average of between 300 and 400 suchemails and letters handled each week. Aswell, the advent of online chat roomsconnected to many programs is a morefocussed means of allowing audienceparticipation. In the meantime wecontinue to explore the return of aBackchat -style program. ABC Marketing Recommendation R9/3/00 - Manager TV Publicity Council recommends that ABC marketinglook at different ways to inform peopleabout ABC programs and services. Anexample could be to focus on littleknown ABC programs and audiences suchas teachers for Behind the News and the publicising of ABC call signs instead ofpromotions. Response from Manager TV Publicity This is being considered. A detailedresponse will be provided for theFebruary Council meeting. Paralympic Coverage Recommendation R10/3/00 - Director of Radio and Director of Television Council commends ABC Radio for itscoverage of the Paralympic Games andparticularly Karen Tighe for herperformance. However, the Council wasappendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 169170disappointed at the lack of television coverage particularly in light of the largeaudiences. Council recommends that theABC look at more flexible ways ofresponding to audiences. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television notes thecomments and advises that the divisionadopted a pro-active approach to theParalympics. Despite the existingcontractual arrangements, opportunitiesfor increased television coverage weresought throughout the Games,responding to official and unofficialrequests to increase the plannedcoverage. However, the ABC was dependent on the host broadcast consortium (contracted tothe Sydney Paralympic OrganisingCommittee) that supplied pictures to ABCTV and the rest of the world. There were18 Paralympic sports (compared to 27Olympic sports), of which only five(swimming, athletics, cycling, basketballand tennis finals only) had hostbroadcaster produced multi-cameracoverage. ABC Television broadcast 35 hours of the 2000 Paralympic Games including theopening and closing ceremonies,highlights including live crosses,basketball finals and other events. Thiswas the most extensive Australiantelevision coverage ever for theParalympics, since the ABC beganbroadcasts in 1988. Response from Director of Radio ABC Radio is justifiably proud of the teamof broadcasters, including Karen Tighe,journalists and technical staff whoprovided more than 40 hours of livecoverage of the Sydney 2000 ParalympicGames. This coverage included 20 hoursof commentary and reports duringGrandstand on both weekends of competition. Weekday programmingincluded two hours coverage everyevening. Five-minute updates were broadcast every half hour during each day ofcompetition. Coverage by 702 ABC Sydneyincluded the Opening and ClosingCeremonies, and the Parade ofChampions on 30 October. Council's commendation and recognition of the team's efforts and professionalismis very much appreciated. Triple J Local Presenters Recommendation R11/3/00 - Director of Radio Council recommends that Triple J have alocal presenter in each State for the 6-10pm timeslot. This would allow afocus on the State music and cultural scene and would incorporate localpresenters. This would also allow forgreater audience participation in quizzesetc. This recommendation will befollowed up in the report by Council'sYouth Subcommittee. Response from Director of Radio As Council's recommendation points outthis would facilitate a focus on theindividual State's music and culturalscene and this would obviously be abenefit of any such initiative. There arehowever, some difficulties that arisewhen considering such an initiative. Firstly is the audience itself. While some areas of the ABC, rightly or wrongly,attract criticism of being Sydney-centric,this is something that is rarely leveled atTriple J. Listener feedback indicates thatyoung audiences feel a sense ofconnectivity through Triple J, that is theydon't feel confined to thethinking/influences of their own area butrather can share a sense of togethernesswith their peers around the nation. Thisis particularly important for teens whomay feel a sense of emotional isolationwhich can be exacerbated by distance.Triple J lets them stay in touch with thefashions and cultural shifts in the big cityand the feelings of people their own agearound the country. Apart from this important programming consideration, there is the matter ofexpense. To hire a new presenter andproducer for the remaining capital citieswould conservatively cost $100 000 percity, or at least $500 000. For a networkfunded at $3.3m, this is a massive budgetpercentage for a program which alreadyhas strong audience appeal. Lastly, the matter of available resources in each of the capital cities must betaken into account. Not all cities havespare studios and production boothsvacant on a nightly basis and the costinvolved in building more is prohibitive. Triple J, through initiatives such as Unearthed , makes a strenuous effort to reflect the diversities of culture whichmake up our nation and to give itsyoung people a voice. Feedback tells usthey recognise and appreciate the regularelements of non-city programming, evenif it is not their region in particular beinghighlighted. Triple J management thanks Council for providing recommendations aimed atuncovering more effective ways of servingour audience.Commendations Council commended Behind the News and Chequerboard Revisited . It commended the Sunday eveningtelevision lineup for providingentertaining viewing, the dedication andcommitment of the ABC's overseascorrespondents, and welcomed theintroduction of the ABC's weekly staffbulletin abcXchange. 15 - 16 February 2001 Meeting Recommendations andResponses ABC Online Recommendation R1/1/01 - Director of New Media Services Council congratulates ABC Online forproviding quality broadcasting to boththe Australian a nd internationalcommunity. However, Council would liketo see the following improvements: a 24 hour updated News and Current Affairs service; an archival search facility for current news stories; and a search engine on the Message Stick page. Response from Director of New MediaServices ABC Online News has been a 24 hourservice more or less since its inception.On weekends there is a brief gap of 1-2hours between some incoming andoutgoing shifts. There have beendiscussions about pulling back from 24hour production because of resourcingissues. For obvious reasons, this is acomplex issue. In terms of the number of bulletins produced, it is more likely to be a case of10 per day with constant updatesthroughout the day. News Online post afew hundred story updates to thewebsite daily. There is already a news archival search facility offered on a large number of theOnline News pages, although itsperformance could be better. Theimprovement of the search facility forNews and the rest of ABC Online is a highpriority. There are plans over the nextcouple of months to implement a muchimproved search approach whichpromises to return much more usefulresults to queries.appendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 170171Drum Logo \u2014 Youth Logo Recommendation R2/1/01 \u2014 Director of Radio, Director of Television, Director ofDevelopment and Director of New MediaServices In regard to recent recommendationsfrom Council concerning a 'youth logo',Council recommends investigation of theuse of the Triple J Drum Logo as a 'youthlogo' across all ABC networks. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television thanks Councilfor its recommendation on the use of theTriple J drum logo. Television hasinvestigated the potential use of thedrum logo but for several reasons (seebelow) is unable to use it. Response from Director of Radio ABC Radio recognises the power of theTriple J Drum logo and the attendanthigh credibility it has with youthaudiences. This has been achievedthrough consistently associating the logowith a particular image and a particularform of programming. There is value in leveraging the Drum's high recognition for output of a similarimage and content, such as a website.However, there is danger in attemptingto associate it with initiatives that aredifferently positioned. For example,Television's Top of the Pops , despite its strengths, is clearly pitched at a moremainstream audience than the Triple Jaudience. Association of the Drum logowith Top of the Pops would confuse the identity of both entities and over time,would dilute the effectiveness of theDrum logo. Should Council be interested to discuss issues of branding and positioning, ABCRadio's Head of Promotion and Publicitywould be happy to talk with Council. Response from Director of New MediaServices The Television, Radio, New Media andDevelopment divisions of the ABC areworking on the development of a cross-media youth strategy which willencompass branding. All possibilities forusing existing brands will be consideredas part of this process. Howard Goodall's Big Bangs Recommendation R3/1/01 - Director of Enterprises Council recommends that ABC Enterprisesexplore the possibility of makingavailable the Big Bangs program on video. Response from Director of Enterprises The decision to release Howard Goodall's Big Bangs rests with Warner Vision,which holds the Australian distribution rights for this program. If Warner Visiondecides to release this program on video,then ABC Shops will stock it. Community Based Drama Recommendation R4/1/01 - Director of Television and Director of Development Council recommends that the ABCresearch the possibility of a communitybased drama to attract a family audienceacross all age groups, which wouldexplore medical and social issues acrossall families: for example, disability andindigenous issues. By way of background, the previous success of GPwas discussed and Council felt that the ABC could examineproducing a contemporary program alongsimilar lines exploring the health andsocial issues of today. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television noted Council'sinterest at its February meeting in acommunity-based drama programexploring health and social issues andhas discussed it with the Director ofDevelopment, who is currently giving theproposal consideration. Commendations Council commended a number of radioand television programs includingStateline andLandline, Australian Story, AMand PM, The Media Report, and the Centenary of Federation Concert . It commended the ABC's fortnightlynewsletter National Broadcaster and ABC Radio's commitment to the Heywire project. 28 - 29 May 2001 Meeting Comments andCommendations Younger Audiences \u2014 Director of Television and Director of RadioCouncil welcomes the changes to theearly evening timeslot with cartoon seriessuch as Angela Anaconda and Johnny Bravo , which appeal to a younger audience. Council sees the programmingin the 6.00pm timeslot as a step in theright direction but notes that there is noregular drama programming which wouldappeal to 10 to 16 year olds or earlyevening programs which provide asatisfactory alternative to a youngeraudience presently being diverted to quizprograms on commercial stations. Council commends the drama programs, Love is A Four Letter Word and Headstart and would like to see these programsbeing given a longer time to establishwith the targeted audience. Council hasconcerns whether the timeslots for these programs are appropriate for youngeraudiences. The work on cross-promotingthese programs on local radio isrecognised, however given the targetaudience Council suggests the crosspromotion of these television programsshould also be on Triple J. Studio 22 is another program which has good bands with appeal to a youngeraudience. Council would like to see thisprogram put to better use in a time-slotwhich would attract a younger audience.This program could also be crosspromoted on Triple J. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television has notedCouncil's recommendations andcomments regarding programming foryoung audiences, including the 6.00 pmtimeslot, regular drama programming for10 to 16 year olds, longer running seriesand the Australian drama programs Love Is a Four Letter Word and Headstart . In this regard it should be noted that, in addition to Love Is a Four Letter Word and Headstart ABC Television has co- produced and broadcast Eugenie Sandler PIand The Saddle Club this financial year. These latter programs are designed for a10-12 year old audience. In relation to comments regarding Love is A Four Letter Word , while we understand Council's concern about the program, ABCTelevision did not cancel the series.Twenty-six episodes were commissionedand produced. The decision not to makeanother series was not about its ratings. The program was always conceived, developed and produced as a self-contained dramatic narrative. It had anumber of storylines that span the seriesand reach natural conclusions in the finalepisode. This was always designed to bethe case. Unfortunately, it is not possibleto bring the creative team back togetherfor another series. However, the Divisionplans to have many of these people workon various projects in the future. The Television Division agrees that it would be a positive step to produceregular drama programming and longerseries of Australian drama programs notjust for youth audiences but for all agegroups. The opportunity for increasedlevels of Australian drama is limited byavailable projects in development and forproduction and available funding andresources to the Division. Within theseconstraints Television will continue towork with the Development Division todevelop and commission suitableprojects.appendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 171172Council's comments regarding the scheduling of Headstart and Studio 22 are noted. However, there are numerousconstraints on the Division in planningthe broadcast schedule that make itdifficult to place either of these programsin a more prime time slot. Response from Director of Radio ABC Radio has been working closely withthe ABC's Manager of Cross Promotions,in developing cross-promotion strategiesacross Radio networks and across theABC's diverse platforms. Cross-promotionis recognised as a valuable means ofinforming the audience of upcomingprograms and other services offered bythe ABC across all platforms. To this end,ABC Radio networks have allocated up to25% of all promotional airtime to otherABC platforms, including Enterprises. The ABC TV programs mentioned by the Council: Love Is A Four Letter Word , Headstart and Studio 22 , have all been promoted on Triple J. Cross promotion on Triple J for Love is a Four Letter Word commenced on 21 January 2001. Approximately 20 produced spots werebroadcast per week for the duration of theprogram (16 weeks). Triple J also promoted atour which saw artists who performed onLove is a Four Letter Word play two live gigs in Sydney on June 9 and 10. AHeadstart forum was conducted on the Triple J website on April 29 and thenetwork began verbal promotions offorthcoming episodes from 8 April 2001.Each weekend, eight verbal promotionswere scheduled. Verbal promotionconsisted of on-air presenters speakingabout Headstart from notes prepared by Triple J promotions staff. Studio 22 is promoted verbally by presenters. Live simulcasts of Studio 22 commenced (where appropriate) on 3May 2001 on Triple J. Triple J's websitemaintains links to the websites of allthree ABC TV programs. In addition TripleJ highlights Rage content and maintains permanent online links to relevant ABCprograms. Currently, the network islinking to Da Ali G Show . Science Programming Recommendation R2/2/01 \u2014 Director of Television Council is of the view that Quantum is missed. Aftershock has been disappointing and does not satisfy anaudience looking for a program whichcontains scientific discovery or scientificinformation. Council recommends thedevelopment of a program about recentscientific developments which showsscience for the layperson. Response from Director of Television The Director of Television notes theCouncil's views regarding Quantum and Aftershock and agrees that there is a need for a program that addressesscientific discovery and/or developments,including the presentation of informationin an understandable manner. With this in mind a new weekly science program, Catalyst , begins on 9 August 2001 at 8.30pm. This program willcelebrate and analyse science, bringingtogether a team of specialist sciencejournalists including astrophysicist DrGraham Phillips, palaeontologist Dr PaulWillis and veterinary scientist Dr JonicaNewby. The program will also featurespecial reports from Dr Norman Swan andRobin Williams and a weekly sciencenews roundup presented by Karina Kelly. In addition, beginning on 8 August 2001, ABC Television will present a weeklyhealth program as part of the Dimensions series. Health Dimensions will be broadcast at 6.30pm each Wednesdayevening. This program, featuring a teamof respected health professionals, willfocus on all areas of health andmedicine, from alternative treatments tocontemporary medical situations. Micallef Recommendation R10/2/01 - Director of Television Council would like to see the return ofMicallef . Response from Director of Television The Director of Television advises that the Division is currently in discussion withShaun Micallef regarding possible futureprojects. Email Services Recommendation R3/2/01 - Director of New Media Services Council commends the excellent serviceprovided by email lists from the websiteand recommends that this service beresourced so that it can be extended toas many areas as possible. Response from Director of New MediaServices While we are exploring the provision ofan email service, the resourcing of such aservice is an issue. Until we are able tooffer this service, extending it is not anoption. Availability of DVD Product Council raised the issue of the availabilityof DVD format product through ABCEnterprises.Response from Acting Director of Enterprises DVD is an expensive format to produceand the penetration of DVD players inAustralia, especially those accessed bychildren, is still quite small. This hasmeant that both globally and inAustralia, the release of children's DVD'sby the producers of those programs hasbeen slow and as such, he range of titlescurrently available to all Australianretailers including ABC Shops, is quitelimited. ABC Shops currently stock all relevant and available children's DVD titles in Australiaand as more titles are released the rangewill grow. As the take up of DVD playersincreases around the world and inAustralia, the simultaneous release onDVD and VHS cassette of both adult andchildren's programs will become morecommon and this will be reflected in therange of DVD product carried in ABCShops. Commendations Council recorded commendations for The Comfort Zone , Australians at War , the Deakin Lectures , Sound Quality and the Centenary of Federation Stories broadcast on ABC Radio. Appendix 16Independent ComplaintsReview Panel In 2000-01 the Independent ComplaintsReview Panel (ICRP) completed tworeviews: one commenced in the previousyear and the other commenced during1999-2000. The two reviews completedduring the year were requested by MrHisam Sidaoui and Mr Glyn May. Mr Hisam Sidaoui complained about a segment broadcast on the ABC Televisioncomedy program, BackBerner on 30 March 2000. The complaint concerned asegment dealing with Yusef Islam(formerly Cat Stevens) and a compact discwith fictitious song titles. Mr Sidaouiwrote to the ABC protesting stronglyabout the segment's offence to theIslamic community but was dissatisfiedwith the response. The then GeneralManager of Network Televisionapologised to Mr Sidaoui and the Islamiccommunity but did not accept that theABC's Code of Practice had beenbreached. Mr Sidaoui then referred hiscomplaint to the ICRP. The Panelreviewed the correspondence andbroadcast and found that the viewsexpressed in the segment reinforced byappendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 172173the imagery broadcast, the mannerism of the broadcaster and the tone of voice did'encourage denigration against thefollowers of Islam'. The Panel, havingdue regard to its terms of reference, didnot conclude that the segmentamounted to 'serious bias, lack ofbalance or unfair treatment' given thecontext of the programming philosophyofBackBerner . Mr Glyn May complained about a segment on Media Watch broadcast on ABC Television on 18 September 2000. Thesegment dealt with travel articles publishedin The Age , Sunday Tasmanian and the Adelaide Advertiser under the byline of Mr May. The program criticised Mr May'sconnection with companies praised withinthese articles. The ICRP found that Mr May'sconnections were well known to thenewspapers, that this should have beenmade clear when the articles werepublished, and that accordingly adisproportionate amount of blame hadbeen attributed to Mr May in the Media Watch segment. The Panel upheld Mr May's complaint on the grounds of unfairness.The ABC Managing Director, as Editor-in-Chief, apologised in writing to Mr May anddirected that an apology be made on ABCTelevision on 16 April following Littlemore , which then occupied the former 9.15pmMedia Watch timeslot.

The ABC Act guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation'sprogram services. The ABC holds its powerto make programming decisions onbehalf of the people of Australia. By lawand convention neither the Governmentnor Parliament seeks to intervene inthose decisions. 2 General Program Codes The guiding principle in the applicationof the following general program codes iscontext. What is unacceptable in onecontext may be appropriate andacceptable in another. However, the useof language and images for no otherpurpose but to offend is not acceptable. The code is not intended to ban certain types of language or images from bonafide dramatic or literary treatments, noris it intended to exclude such referencesfrom legitimate reportage, debate ordocumentaries. Where appropriate,audiences will be given advance noticeof the content of the program. 2.1 Violence . The presentation or portrayal of violence must be justifiable,or else the material should not bepresented. Particular attention should bepaid to the portrayal of violence againstwomen. In news and current affairs programs, violent events should never besensationalised or presented for theirown sake. In drama programs, the aim is not to see how much violence will be tolerated, buthow little is necessary to achieve honestends without undue dramaticcompromise. 2.2 Language . Variations of language favoured by different groups ofAustralians \u2014 young or old, welleducated or less educated, migrants,Indigenous and others \u2014 are equallyvalid and have their place in programs.On occasions, the language of one groupmay be distasteful to another. Use ofsuch language is permitted provided it isnot used gratuitously and provided the language can be justified in the contextof, for example, fiction, documentary,dramatisation, comedy and song lyrics. 2.3 Sex and Sexuality . Provided it is handled with integrity, any of thefollowing treatments of sex and sexualitymay be appropriate and necessary to aprogram: \u2014 it can be discussed and reported in the context of news, information ordocumentary programs; \u2014 it can be referred to in drama, comedy, lyrics or fictional programs;and \u2014 it can be depicted, implicitly or explicitly. 2.4 Discrimination . The presentation or portrayal of people in a way which islikely to encourage denigration of ordiscrimination against any person orsection of the community on account ofrace, ethnicity, nationality, sex, age,disability or illness, social or occupationalstatus, sexual preference or the holdingof any religious, cultural or political beliefwill be avoided. The requirement is notintended to prevent the broadcast ofmaterial which is factual, or theexpression of genuinely-held opinion ina news or current affairs program, or inthe legitimate context of a humorous,satirical or dramatic work. 2.5 Privacy . The rights of individuals to privacy should be respected in all ABCprograms. However, in order to provideinformation which relates to a person'sperformance of public duties or aboutother matters of public interest,intrusions upon privacy may, in somecircumstances, be justified. 3 Specific Program Codes 3.1 Children's Programs . While the real world should not be concealed fromchildren, special care will be taken toensure programs children are likely towatch unsupervised will not cause alarmor distress. 3.2 Religious Programs . Religious programs may cover Christianity, othertraditional religions and new religiousmovements, as well as analysis anddiscussion of religious issues from non-religious points of view. 3.3 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programs . Program makers and journalists should respect Aboriginal andTorres Strait Islander cultures. Particularcare should be exercised in traditionalmatters such as the naming or depictingof Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanderpeople after death.3.4 Portrayal of Women and Avoidance of Stereotypes . Programs will take care to acknowledge the full range of roles nowperformed by women. Irrelevantreferences to a woman's physicalcharacteristics, marital status ormaternity will be avoided. Programs should not promote or endorse inaccurate, demeaning or discriminatorystereotypes of women or men. In producing programs using experts, interviewees and other talent, programmakers will ensure that there areopportunities for both women and mento present viewpoints. 3.5 Closed Captioning for People who are Hearing Impaired or Deaf . Closed caption programs will be clearly markedwhen program information is provided tothe press or when captioned programsare promoted. Where possible, opencaptioned advice will be provided iftechnical problems prevent scheduledclosed captioning. Addresses to the nation and events of national significance will be transmittedwith closed captioning. The ABC willendeavour to increase the amount ofclosed-captioning programming, asresources permit. 4 News, Current Affairs and Information Programs 4.1 News, Current Affairs and Information Programs . In programs produced by ABC News and Current AffairsDepartments and information programs: (a) Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that the factualcontent of programs is accurate.Demonstrable errors will be correctedin a timely manner and in a formmost suited to the circumstances. (b) Editorial staff will not be obliged to disclose confidential sources whichthey are entitled to protect at alltimes. (c) Re-enactments of events will be clearly identified as such andpresented in a way which will notmislead audiences. (d) If reported at all, suicides will be reported in moderate terms and willusually avoid details of method. (e) Sensitivity will be exercised in broadcasting images of or interviewswith bereaved relatives and survivorsor witnesses of traumatic incidents. 4.2 News and Current Affairs Programs . Every reasonable effort must be made toensure that the content of programsappendices11oct.qxd 22/11/2001 11:13 Page 177178produced by ABC News and Current Affairs Departments is: (a) impartial: impartiality does not require editorial staff to beunquestioning; nor should all sidesof an issue be devoted the sameamount of time. (b) balanced: balance will be sought through the presentation, as far aspossible, of principal relevantviewpoints on matters ofimportance. The requirement maynot always be reached within asingle program or news bulletin, butwill be achieved within a reasonableperiod. 4.3 News Flashes . Care will be exercised in the selection of sounds and imagesand consideration given to the likelycomposition of the audience. 4.4 News Updates and News Promotions . News updates and news promotions will not appear duringobviously inappropriate programs,especially programs directed at youngchildren. Due to their repetitive nature,there will be very little violent materialincluded in them, and none at all in thelate afternoon and early evening. 5 Promotions for Programs Program promotions will be scheduled soas to be consistent with the nature ofsurrounding programs. 6 Warnings Where appropriate, the audience will begiven advance notice of programs orprogram segments which some viewersor listeners could find distressing ordisturbing. 7 Television Program Classifications This system of television program classification applies the Guidelines forthe Classification of Films and Videotapesissued by the Office of Film and LiteratureClassification. Programs having a particular class- ification under the Office of Film andLiterature Classification Guidelines maybe modified so that they are suitable forbroadcast or suitable for broadcast atparticular times. 7.1 Classification G - General (suitable for all ages) G programs, which include programsdesigned for pre-school and school agechildren: \u2014 are suitable for children to watch on their own;\u2014 may be shown at any time. PG \u2014 Parental Guidance (parental guidance recommended for personsunder 15 years) PG programs: \u2014 may contain adult themes and concepts which, when viewed bythose under 15 years, may requirethe guidance of an adult; \u2014 may be shown between 8.30am and 4.00pm on weekdays7.30pm and 6.00am on any day ofthe week. M \u2014 Mature Audience programs and MA \u2014 Mature Adult Audience programs \u2014 are programs which, because of the matter they contain or because ofthe way it is treated, arerecommended for viewing only bypersons aged 15 years or over. M programs may be shown between: noon and 3.00pm on weekdays that are school days8.30pm and 5.00am on any day of theweek. MA programs may be shown between: 9.30pm and 5.00am on any day of theweek. While most adult themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness andintensity of treatment will determinewhat can be accommodated in the Mand MA classifications \u2014 the less explicitor less intense material will be includedin the M classification and the moreexplicit or more intense material,especially violent material, will beincluded in the MA classification. X programs and unmodified R programs (not suitable for television) \u2014 contain material which cannot appropriately be classified as G, PG,M or MA because the material itselfor the way it is treated renders themunsuitable for television; \u2014 must not be shown at all.7.2 Implementation Guidelines . The time zones for each program classification areguides to the most likely placement ofprograms within that classification. Theyare not hard and fast rules and there willbe occasions on which programs orsegments of programs appear in othertime-slots, for example, a PG program orsegment of a program designed forteenage viewers could appear before7.30pm if that is the time most suitablefor the target audience, or a PG segmentin an arts program could appear during aweekend daytime program. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for aprogram classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues mayappear outside their normal classificationperiod provided that a clear indication ofthe nature and content of the program isgiven at its commencement. 7.3 Television Classification Symbols . The classification symbol of the PG, M or MAprogram (except news, current affairs,general information and sportingprograms) being shown will be displayedat the commencement of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA program (except news, current affairs,general information and sportingprograms) being promoted will bedisplayed during the promotion. 7.4 Consumer Advice . Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an Mor MA classification will be given prior tothe commencement of an M or MAprogram. 8 Complaints 8.1 This Code of Practice does not apply tocomplaints concerning programs whichare or become the subject of legalproceedings.
