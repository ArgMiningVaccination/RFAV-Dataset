Learn more about propane's environmental impact including its energy efficiency.", "sitename": "Amerigas", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Propane is Cleaner Propane has the lowest carbon content of any fossil fuel, so using propane minimizes carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to electricity, which is ultimately powered by coal or nuclear power, propane is a much cleaner energy source. Propane is Non-toxic Propane is not toxic or caustic, and it does not pollute the atmosphere, so it isn't an environmental or personal hazard if it's released. Plus, propane doesn't pool, so it won't build up in soil or water if leaks occur. [About Propane Safety learn more about propane safety](/about-propane/propane-safety) Propane heats up faster and packs more power, so you need less to get the job done. Propane appliances\u2014like water heaters, stovetops, and fireplaces\u2014heat up to 40% faster than their electric counterparts. Since it contains twice the energy, propane also burns hotter than natural gas, so you can use less to do the same amount of work. "}
