Comparability The activities, including study design, conduct of studies, and evaluation of data, that are designed to investigate whether the products are comparable. In addition to routine analyses performed during production and control of the active biological ingredient or final product, these evaluations typically include further characterization studies. In some cases, non -clinical or clinical data might contribute to the conclusion . Final Product A finished dosage form (e.g., tablet o r solution) that contains an Active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association within Active ingredients. It is also referred to as Finished Product or Drug Product in other documents. Manufacturer: means a person manufacturing a medicine (Final Product) or manufacturing of the active ingredients and includes a manufacturing plant . Specification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges or other criteria for the tests described. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by the regulatory authorities .

Module 3.2.R: R EGIONAL INFROMATION 3.2.R.1 Not applicable for biosimilar applications. 3.2.R.2. Parent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Manufacturer/DMF Holder with various sites a. If an identical route of synthesis, or manufacturing process of the Primary Production Lot (in case of Biological Medicines), including the purification step is used by each site of the same parent company or DMF Holder, a statement to this effect will suffice with regard to the route. b. In this case include valid CoAs from the active ingredient manufacturer or manufacturer of the primary production lot (in case of Biological Medicines) for two batches issued by each site. 3.2.R.4 Multiple active ingredient manufacturers If more than one manufacturer of the API is being applied for (irrespective of the apparent similarity of the routes utilized by the different manufacturers), or when different routes of synthesis are used in the manufacture of the active ingredient, the following should be submitted, in addition to Module 3.2.S for each active ingredient: 3.2.R.4.1 Comparability between the active biological ingredient batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing sites with respect to physico - chemical characterization, biological activity, and impurity profile. Occasionally, bridging non - clinical and/or clinical studies may be required when quality dat a are insufficient to establish comparability. The extent and nature of non -clinical and/or clinical studies should be determined on a case -by-case basis taking into consideration the quality comparability findings, the nature and level of the knowledge of the medicine, existing relevant non- clinical and clinical data, and aspects of medicine use. 3.2.R.4.2 Description of the batches and summary of in-process and batch release testing results as quantitative data, in a comparative tabular format, for at least three (3) consecutive batches manufactured at each of the proposed manufacturing sites. 3.2.R.4.3 Comparative results of at least 3 active biological ingredients batches manufactured at each of the proposed sites for key stability indicating parameters. The data should cover a minimum of 6 months testing unless otherwise justified 3.2.R.4.4 Certificates of analysis PREAMBLE: The granulation for Module 3.2.R. indicated in this guidance document is as per currently approved SAHPRA requirements for Module 3.2.R. Nonetheless, the Biosimilar analytical comparability studies should be included unde r section 3.2.R.8. N.B: For biosimilar applications, applicants should comply with the requirements stipulated in SAHPRA Biosimilar guideline. Page 10 of 11 SAHPGL -PEM -BIO-06_v3 General guidance document on quality, safety and efficacy requirements for Biological Medicines 1 September 2022 Provide certificates of analysis for each batch of the active ingredient reported in 3.2.R.4.2 3.2.R.5 Medical devices Valid ation / calibration / specifications of medical device(s) 3.2.R.6 Material of animal /Human origin All ingredients of animal origin (excluding products from porcine origin) should be BSE/TSE free. Include a declaration from FPP manufacturer that the mate rials used will always comply with BSE/TSE free requirements. 3.2.R.6 Material of animal /Human origin All ingredients of animal origin (excluding products from porcine origin) should be BSE/TSE free. Include a declaration from FPP manufacturer that the materials used will always comply with BSE/TSE free requirements. 3.2.R.7 Production documentation Copy of the batch manufacturing record including the ingredient (active ingredient and excipients) analytical reports, in process control tests reports, in termediate product test reports, reconciliation records and a certificate of analysis for the batch must be presented. Please note that if there is a major change in the production process that affects the quality evaluation of the product, e.g. changes to the process, in -process controls, or ingredients, updated production documents will be required by SAHPRA. For editorial or minor changes (Type 1A variations or administrative changes), annual notifications will suffice, and SAHPRA will not require submis sion of updated production documents. 3.2.R.7.1 Executed production documents The executed production documents should be provided for the batches used in the product development. Copies of executed manufacturing records should be in English, or translate d into English where relevant. 3.2.R.7.2 Blank /Master production documents Copies of the FPP master production documents must be provided for each manufacturing site and should ideally be provided for each proposed strength and commercial batch size. Mast er production documents from a pilot scale batch will be sufficient if the process has not yet been scaled up to production scale. Please note that the pilot batch size should correspond to at least 10% of the production scale batch. Where the EMA guidelin es permit bracketing for commercial batch sizes, master production documents for the smallest and largest batches as validated will be sufficient. The details in the master production documents should include, but not be limited to, the following: a) master formula; b) dispensing, processing and packaging sections with relevant material and operational details; c) relevant calculations (e.g. if the amount of active ingredient is adjusted based on the assay results or on the anhydrous basis); d) identification of all equipment by, at minimum, type and working capacity (including make, model and equipment number, where possible); Page 11 of 11 SAHPGL -PEM -BIO-06_v3 General guidance document on quality, safety and efficacy requirements for Biological Medicines 1 September 2022 e) process parameters f) list of in -process tests and specifications; g) sampling plan with regard to the: i. steps where sampling should be done ii. number of samples that should be tested iii. frequency of testing h) precautions necessary to ensure product quality (e.g. temperature and humidity control, maximum holding times); i) for sterile products, reference to SOPs in appropriate sections and a list of all relevant SOPs at the end of the document; j) theoretical and actual yield; k) compliance with the GMP requirements. If some of the required detail is contained in standard operating procedures (SOPs) and not in the master production document, the applicant s hould submit both the master production document and the relevant SOPs. 3.2.R.8 Other Placeholder section for documents that do not have a specified location in the CTD folder structure, but which the applicant deems necessary for evaluation of the dossier. This includes the biosimilarity analytical comparability studies. 8.
