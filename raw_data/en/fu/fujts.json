Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Richmond Agitation and 35 Sedation Scale (RASS) were used to evaluate pain and agitation. 36 The dosage and treatment period of sedative and analgesic drugs in the intervention 37 group were notably lower than the control group (p<0.05). Analgesia compliance time 38 in the intervention group was superior to control group (p<0.05). The shallow 39 sedation compliance rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than the 40 control group (p<0.01). There was significant difference in blood gas analysis before 41 and after treatment between the two groups (p<0.05). After 2 h of sedation and 42 analgesia, heart rate (HR) in the intervention group was lower than control group, but 43 respiratory rate (RR) was higher than the control group (p<0.05). 44 The traditional analgesia and sedation combined with intracutaneous pyonex reduced 45 the total amount and treatment period of sedative and analgesic drugs in critically ill 46 patients throughout the treatment process, while it also decreased the adverse 47 reactions such as blood pressure drops and respiratory depression. 48 Keywords: mechanical ventilation; analgesia and sedation; intracutaneous 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft51 Introduction 52 As a life support system, mechanical ventilation is widely used in critically ill patients 53 (Jordan et al., 2016). In order to alleviate the pain and anxiety and prevent 54 man-machine confrontation during mechanical ventilation, analgesia and sedation 55 procedures are very important (Singleton et al., 2015). At present, analgesia and 56 sedation are mainly induced by drugs (Cunningham and Vogel, 2019). However, 57 drug-induced analgesia and sedation may cause several complications, including 58 hypotension, respiratory insufficiency, and bradycardia (Chinese Society of Critical 59 Care Medicine, 2018). Therefore, a large number of studies have been carried out 60 worldwide to reduce drug doses and maintain a satisfactory level of analgesia and 61 sedation (Vincent et al., 2016; Ferguson et al., 2016; Nasr and DiNardo, 2016). 62 Traditional Chinese medicine mentions that intracutaneous pyonex maintains for a 63 long time in static status to attenuate pain, which shows that intracutaneous pyonex 64 has an effect on pain (Ying-ying et al., 2014). Fanti et al. have proved that the 65 combination of LI4, S36, SP6 and SP9 can reduce the demand for sedatives in 66 critically ill patients (Fanti, 2003). Leung et al. have established that the pain and 67 discomfort caused by barostat-induced rectal distension could be alleviated by 68 electro-acupuncture at P6, ST36, and LI4 (Leung, 2012). Zhu et al. have proposed 69 that the use of intracutaneous pyonex reduces the dose of analgesics and the 70 associated adverse events (Na et al., 2018). The indwelling intracutaneous pyonex is 71 remained in the skin for a certain period, so that the skin is stimulated by tender, 72 continuous and stable stimulation to accomplish the treatment (Na et al., 2018).Page 4 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft73 It has been reported that intracutaneous pyonex therapy has been used for analgesia 74 and sedation in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (Kotani et al., 2001; Ak\u00e7a 75 and Sessler, 2002; Meissner, 2009). The present randomized controlled study was 76 performed to evaluate the effect of intracutaneous pyonex on analgesia and sedation 77 in critically ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation. On the basis of 78 previous studies, this study further verified the advantages and safety of 79 intracutaneous pyonex in the short term.Page 5 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft81 Methods 82 Subjects 83 A total of 88 patients (66 males and 22 females) were admitted to the emergency 84 intensive care unit (EICU) of our hospital for mechanical ventilation aided by 85 analgesia and sedation between February 2018 and December 2019. They were 86 enrolled in this randomized controlled study. They were randomly divided into 87 control group and intervention group. 88 Inclusion Criteria: (1) the patients who admitted to ICU were over 18 years of age, 89 and whose estimated admission time was more than two days; (2) the patient who had 90 received mechanical ventilation during his/her admission to the ICU; (3) to ensure 91 stability in the patient's pain and agitation at baseline, there was no requirement of 92 sedation and analgesia before admission to the ICU. Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients 93 younger than 10 years old; (2) patients who use muscle relaxants during treatment; (3) 94 patients who are allergic to anesthetics or sedatives; (4) patients with severe brain 95 disease or nerve injury or other mental disorders; (5) patients with cerebral 96 insufficiency or shock; (6) patients who have recently participated in drug clinical 97 trials. 98 Signed informed consent was obtained from all subjects; the process of obtaining the 99 informed consent adhered to the GCP regulations. The present study was approved by 100 the Ethics committee of Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine 101 (2018NL-174-02). 102Page 6 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft104 Methods 105 (1) The Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Richmond Agitation and 106 Sedation Scale (RASS) were used to evaluate the levels of pain and agitation before 107 and after treatment in the two groups. The scoring criteria of COPT and RASS were 108 shown in Table 1 and Table 2. (2) Patients in control group received conventional 109 analgesia and sedation 111 intravenous dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 \u00b5g/kg/h (Chinese Society of Critical Care 112 Medicine, 2018). The dosage of dexmedetomidine was adjusted according to the 113 assessment of the depth of analgesia and sedation. In the intervention group, 114 conventional analgesic and sedative treatment in addition to acupoint stimulation of 115 zusanli (ST36), hegu (LI4), and neiguan (P6) were used for analgesic and sedative 116 treatment. In addition, acupoint positioning was performed according to the 'People's 117 Republic of China national standard GB/t13734-90 acupoint name and location' 118 (Figure (ST36), hegu (LI4), and neiguan (P6) were 119 pressed bilaterally with the thumb for 1 min at each acupoint. The pressure was 120 applied every 4 h and repeated every 2 to 3 days. 121 SEIRIN \u00ae brand press-pins manufactured by Japan's Qingling Co., Ltd were used in 122 the present study. Different models (0.2 mm \u00d71.2 mm to 0.2 mm\u00d71.8 mm) were 123 selected according to the body type of the patients. The needle was inserted slowly 124 and patiently using a press-stick. While embedding the needle, purulent infection of 125 the skin, purpura scar, local redness infection, blister and bleeding must be avoided. Page 7 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft126 In case such a situation arises, it must be promptly stopped, and symptomatic 127 treatment should be initiated. In addition to the intervention treatment, the use of 128 press-needle therapy must be prohibited during the treatment period. 129 Outcome Measures 130 (1) Biological indicators, including gender, age, height, body weight, and vital signs, 131 including temperature, resting heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), blood oxygen 132 saturation (SPO 2) and mean arterial pressure (MAP); (2) Curative effect: The dosage 133 and treatment period of sedative and analgesic drugs in the two groups; CPOT and 134 RASS scores before and after treatment in the two groups; Symptoms, vital signs, 135 blood gas analysis and the use of ventilator; (3) Secondary efficacy indicators: 136 endotracheal intubation time, ICU admission time, and the clinical outcome; (4) 137 Comprehensive efficacy: safety observation for any decrease in HR and blood 138 pressure, respiratory depression, delirium, vomiting and other adverse events during 139 mechanical ventilation in the two groups; (5) Test evaluation indicators: shedding and 140 elimination, compliance. From day 1 to day 7, observation was recorded every 6 h 141 (04:00-10:00-16:00-22:00) before and after pressing acupoints. 142 Statistical Analysis 143 SPSS26.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. General data are 144 compared with frequency number and percentage. In measurement data, normal 145 distribution is described by \u00b1 s, eccentric distribution data is described by median 146 (quartile spacing) [M (IOR)], descriptive statistical analysis by frequency number and 147 percentage, and 2 test for intergroup comparison count data. For measurement data, Page 8 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft148 independent, normal and variance data; Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon and test; 149 defined the 0.5h analgesia and sedative standard as the end event, analyzed different 150 treatment compliance rates by survival analysis and Log-Rank, and bilateral tests for 151 all statistical tests. P 0.05 is statistically significant for the differences. The chart 152 are made in Graphpad8.0.2.Page 9 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft154 Results 155 General clinical characteristics 156 The control group comprised 30 males and 14 females, with an average age of 75.95 157 \u00b114.32 years old, while 36 males and 8 females were in intervention group, with an 158 average age of 76.80 \u00b110.83 years old. There were no statistically significant 159 differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, severity of the disease, 160 body mass index (BMI), main diagnosis, basic disease and artificial airway 161 establishment (p>0.05) (Table 3). 162 The dosage and treatment period of sedative and analgesic drugs used in the two 163 groups 164 The dosage and treatment period of administration of Dexmedetomidine were both 165 significantly lower in intervention group than those in control group (p<0.05, p<0.01) 166 (Figure 2A ). However, there was no marked difference in term of the dosage of 167 administration of Propofol between the two groups, while the treatment period of 168 Propofol in intervention group was significantly shorter than control group (p<0.01) 169 (Figure 2B). Moreover, the dosage and treatment period of administration of 170 Remifentanil were both notably decreased in intervention group than those in control 171 group (p<0.05) (Figure 2C). 172 COPT and RASS scores before and after treatment in the two groupsThe 173 changes of analgesia rates and sedation rates after 30 min treatment in the two groups 174 were shown in Figure 3. As shown in Table 4, analgesia up to standard time in 175 intervention group was better than that in control group (p<0.05). However, no Page 10 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft176 statistically significant difference was found in other items between the two groups. 177 To ensure that the patient continued to stay in a state of shallow sedation, a sedation 178 score was performed every 2 h within 48 h, and each patient was evaluated for 24 179 times. A total of 2112 sedation evaluations were performed in the two groups, and the 180 shallow sedation compliance rate in intervention group was significantly higher than 181 that in control group(p<0.05) (Table 4). 182 Moreover, after evaluating by COPT score, the compliance rates after 20 min or 30 183 min treatment were both significantly higher than those in control group (p<0.05) 184 (Table 5) (Figure 3b). However, there was no significant difference in term of 185 compliance rates after 20 min or 30 min treatment between the two groups after 186 evaluating by RASSscore (p>0.05) (Table 5). 187 Basic vital signs and blood gas analysis in the two groups 188 Basic vital signs in the two groups were shown in Table 6. 1 h or 2 h after sedation 189 and analgesia, it was found that HRs in intervention group were significantly lower 190 than control group (p<0.05), and RR after 2 h treatment in intervention group was 191 higher than control group (p<0.05). Moreover, the values of MAP after treatment for 192 0.5 h were all markedly increased than those before treatment in the two groups 193 (p<0.05), while the values of HR and RR after treatment for 0.5 h were all notably 194 decreased than those before treatment in the two groups (p<0.05). However, there was 195 no significant difference in terms of SPO 2 between the two groups (p>0.05). 196 Moreover, the values of PaO 2 after treatment for 72 h were all markedly increased 197 than those before treatment in the two groups (p<0.05), while the values of PaCO 2 Page 11 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft198 and LAC after treatment for 72 h were all notably decreased than those before 199 treatment in the two groups (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in 200 terms of PaO 2, PaCO 2 and LAC between the two groups (p>0.05). Blood gas analysis 201 in the two groups were shown in Table 7. 202 Comprehensive efficacy and adverse reactions after treatment between the two 203 groups 204 The incidence of adverse reactions after treatment was shown in Table 8. The 205 incidences of hypotension and respiratory depression in intervention group were 206 lower than those in control group (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference in 207 terms of vomiting, delirium and bradycardia between the two groups (p>0.05). 208 Moreover, the intubation duration and length of ICU stay in intervention group were 209 shorter than those in control group (p=0.001), and the survival were also improved in 210 intervention group in comparison with control group (p<0.05) (Table 9).Page 12 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft212 Discussion 213 Analgesia and sedation performed in patients undergoing traditional mechanical 214 ventilation in ICU were commonly induced by drugs, including opioids, 215 benzodiazepines, propofol, and dexmedetomidine (Patel, 2012; Barr et al., 2013; 216 Chang, 2013). Although these are efficient drugs in clinical treatment, it is worth 217 noting that the contradiction between the \"advantages\" and \"disadvantages\" of 218 analgesia and sedation treatment in critically ill patients is increasingly prominent 219 (Baron et al., 2015). Recent studies have found that sedation and analgesia can change 220 the long-term prognosis in patients with chronic diseases by affecting the functions of 221 immune system, gastrointestinal system, neuromuscular system and other organs 222 (Luetz et al., 2012). The present study was performed based on the theoretical basis of 223 intracutaneous pyonex application at specific acupoints for analgesia, and we aimed to 224 explore the effect of intracutaneous pyonex on analgesia and sedation in patients 225 undergoing mechanical ventilation through a prospective clinical randomized 226 controlled trials. 227 In TCM, intracutaneous pyonex therapy has existed since ancient times (Li-juan et al., 228 2018). The intracutaneous pyonex therapy is also known as an intradermal needle 229 embedding therapy. The needles are fixed to the acupoint or a specific part beneath 230 the skin to give long-lasting and soft benign stimulation, and this thereby enhance the 231 analgesic effect. We selected zusanli (ST36), hegu (LI4), and neiguan (P6) for this 232 experiment. The three points are in synergistic compatibility with each other, and they Page 13 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft233 together have the effect on relieving menstruation and collaterals, and coordinating qi 234 and blood, thereby showing good analgesic and sedative effects. 235 According to the guideline recommendations (Chinese Society of Critical Care 236 Medicine, 2018), the Intensive Care Pain Observation Scale (CPOT) was used for 237 patients who could not express but exhibite physical motor function and observable 238 behavior, and Richmond agitation-sedation score (RASS) was performed for the 239 depth of sedation. At the same time, an individualized sedation plan was formulated 240 according to the organ function state of the patient, and a goal-guided sedation 241 strategy was implemented. For patients with relatively stable organ function or during 242 recovery period, a shallow sedation regime was followed. The goal of sedation was 243 RASS-2 to 1 point to shorten the mechanical ventilation time and hospital stay in 244 ICU. 245 The results of this study indicated that dexmedetomidine and remifentanil used in 246 patients who underwent conventional analgesia sedation plus intracutaneous pyonex 247 treatment showed a significant decrease in dosage and treatment time, which was 248 consistent with the results obtained from Ye Zhongliang (Zhong-liang, 2009). The 249 present study showed that the use of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil was 250 decreased by 23.5% and19.0%, respectively, and the treatment time was decreased by 251 25.9% and 32.2%, respectively. Analgesia up to standard time in intervention group 252 was better than control group, and the shallow sedation compliance rate in 253 intervention group was significantly higher than that in control group. Those results 254 are consistent with the results of Yu Huijie (Hui-jie et al., 2016). 2 h after sedation Page 14 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft255 and analgesia, it was found that the heart rate in intervention group was lower than 256 control group, and the respiratory rate was higher than control group. 257 Repeated measurement found that the heart rate in the two groups was different, and 258 that in intervention group was higher than control group over time. There was no 259 significant difference in blood gas analysis between the two groups before and after 260 treatment, and the difference between the two groups before and after treatment was 261 statistically significant. The incidence of hypotension and respiratory depression in 262 intervention group was reduced significantly, suggesting that intracutaneous pyonex 263 treatment showed better effect and application value in analgesia and sedation. The 264 intervention group was significantly better than the control group in terms of 265 intubation duration, average length of ICU stay, and prognosis. After more than 30 266 years of painstaking research, Han Jisheng proved that acupuncture did cause an 267 increase in the content of enkephalin, endorphin and dynorphin in the human body, 268 thereby playing an analgesic role (Ji-sheng, 2011). Considering that there are many 269 factors influencing patients to achieve mechanical ventilation, analgesia and sedation 270 are only considered from one aspect. 271 There are also some limitations in this study. First, the subjective nature of artificial 272 scoring may lead to overlap in the actual scoring process, leading in bias. Secondly, 273 the sample size is relatively small, and the data analysis may involve some bias. 274 Further increased sample size is needed to improve the credibility of the experimental 275 results. ICU patients have complicated conditions, many influencing factors, and our Page 15 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft276 intervention observation time is short, and the non-fixed diseases in our research 277 population, different diseases have a certain impact on the prognosis. 278 Conclusion 279 In conclusion, intracutaneous pyonex was added based on traditional analgesia and 280 sedation treatment regime, which reduced the total amount and days of analgesia and 281 sedation throughout the treatment process, while also reduced delirium as well as the 282 adverse reactions, such as decreased blood pressure and respiratory depression. The 283 advantages of traditional Chinese medicine were completely utilized to complement 284 and improve the current deficiencies in the modern ICU analgesia and sedation 285 treatment. Perhaps in the future, more traditional Chinese medicine can be used to 286 supplement and improve the deficiency of modern ICU analgesia and sedation 287 treatment. 288 289 List of abbreviations 290 emergency intensive care unit (EICU) 291 Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) 292 Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) 293 heart rate (HR) 294 respiratory rate (RR) 295 emergency intensive care unit (EICU) 296 mean arterial pressure (MAP) 297 standard deviation (SD)Page 16 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft298 body mass index (BMI)Page 17 of 31 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Canadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft300 References 301 Ak\u00e7a O, Sessler DI.
