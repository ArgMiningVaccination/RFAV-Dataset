Whether it be for back pain, neck pain, headaches, stress relief or other health concerns, Dr. Oskardmay may use essential oils to enhance treatment effect as well as to provide you, the patient with something you can potentially take with you for home use. Essential oils support both chiropractic and [acupuncture](https://acudocnc.com/acupuncture-chapel-hill-nc/) for many reasons and in a multitude of ways. Commonly used oils include lavender, rosemary, citrus, and eucalyptus, to name a few. Each oil has its unique therapeutic benefit. Lavender helps to still the mind by reducing the stress hormone cortisol; lavender can be applied during a massage or cupping massage on tight muscles of the neck and shoulders to hasten this effect before or after the chiropractic adjustment. From a Chinese Medicine perspective, lavender is a cooling essential oil useful for imbalance in fire, wood, or water elements. Fire: to calm emotional upset and promote blood circulation. Wood: to quell liver qi stagnation associated with headaches, aggression, and some forms of depression. Water: to reduce anxiety and fear. Useful in chiropractic massage, rosemary reduces stress and can affect healing in other ways. Rosemary is a warm essential oil which balances all but metal. It tonifies the heart to benefit blood circulation, support earth stomach and spleen digestive issues such as diarrhea, and help reduce with effects of stagnant wood on headaches and muscle spasms. Rosemary benefits the water channel's connection to the brain and can help to improve memory and concentration. Rosemary can be especially useful in application to the paraspinal muscles for this reason. Citrus oils such as lemon or lime are cleansing and refreshing to the skin, muscles, and senses. Tight, sore, achy muscles feel better as this oil massages into areas of tightness and fatigue. Application to the upper back and shoulders can help reduce the tight weakness that accompanies heavy computer use or other work activities. It is particularly helpful to minimize earth channel stagnation and dampness such as abdominal bloating and constipation. Eucalyptus is an essential oil used in the office, which mainly benefits the lungs and stomach with its warm spicy nature. Dr. Oskardmay may apply this oil during chiropractic massage or cupping to reduce lung congestion or resolve stomach pain. Eucalyptus in Epsom salts is a useful soaking agent to relax sore muscles and open the pores. These are just a few of the essential oils we use in the office; more are available.
