Identifying characteristics of parents who believe in a causal role of vac- cines for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their child may help targeting educational activities and improve adherence to the immunization schedule.Objectives: To compare caregivers of children with ASD who agree or disagree that vaccines play an eti- ological role in autism for 1) socio-demographics characteristics and 2) developmental and clinical pro- les of their children.Methods: Data from 16,525 participants with ASD under age 18 were obtained from SPARK, a national research cohort started in 2016. Caregivers completed questionnaires at registration that included ques- tions on beliefs about the etiologic role of childhood immunizations and other factors in ASD. Data were available about family socio-demographic characteristics, rst symptoms of autism, developmentalregression, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, seizures, and current levels of functioning. Results: Participants with ASD were 80.4% male with a mean age of 8.1 years (SD = 4.1). Overall, 16.5% of caregivers endorsed immunizations as perceived causes of autism. Compared to caregivers who dis-agreed with vaccines as a cause for ASD, those who believed in vaccine causation came disproportion- ately from ethnic minority, less educated, and less wealthy backgrounds. More often their children had experienced developmental regression involving language and other skills, were diagnosed earlier, hadlost skills during the second year of life, and had worse language, adaptive, and cognitive outcomes.Conclusion: One in six caregivers who participate in a national research cohort believe that child immu- nizations could be a cause of autism in their child. Parent social background (non-White, less educated) and child developmental features (regression in second year, poorer language skills, and worse adaptiveoutcomes) index caregivers who are more likely to harbor these beliefs and could benet from targeted educational activities. /C2112019 Elsevier Ltd.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis- order manifesting in the rst years of life with a combination of developmental impairments in communication and reciprocal social interactions and atypical patterns of play, behavior, and sen- sorimotor responses. Although improvements occur as a function of maturation and early behavioral interventions, ASD is a lifelong disorder with persisting long-term impairments in core-symptom domains of ASD, especially social functioning [26]. Current epi- demiological estimates for ASD in the US child population range between 1.7% [2]and 2.5% [24].In the late 1990s, claims that childhood vaccinations accounted for upward trends in autism prevalence were widely publicized despite weak, if any, supporting empirical evidence. One purported mechanism incriminated the measles component of the triple MMR vaccine, arguing that in children previously normally devel- oping, a regression and loss of skills occurred 5 to 6 days after vac- cination, leading to autism associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammatory pathology [45] The second one impli- cated the cumulative dose of thimerosal (ethylmercury) received through other childhood vaccines up to age 2 that was deemed to be too high and possibly exceeding safety thresholds. Numerous controlled observational studies (case-control and cohort studies) failed to show that exposure to MMR vaccination [40] or to thimerosal-containing vaccines in various doses raised the risk of autism [21], ndings that extended to their high-risk https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.026 0264-410X/ /C2112019 Elsevier Ltd.

Goin-Kochel and B. J. O'Roak, Beliefs in vaccine as causes of autism among SPARK cohort caregivers, Vacc ine, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.026siblings [22,48] . The convergence of negative studies across inves- tigators, study designs, samples and countries has been impressive and the absence of association between MMR and autism con- rmed in several meta-analyses [23,42] . Further claims were subsequently made that the risk could be conned to a small, vulnerable, subgroup that epidemiological studies would not be capable to detect. Limited evidence was brought forward to describe this group (dened by regression/loss of skills days following the MMR vaccine, association with gastro- intestinal symptoms, and demonstrated abnormal persistence of the measles virus in the gut and other biological specimens). A sys- tematic search for this hypothetical phenotype failed to validate its existence [10,15] . Regression/loss of skills in the developmental trajectory of autism had been described since the 1940s in up to 30% of children with ASD, and there is no evidence that this regres-sive phenotype has increased recently or in post-MMR years [10]. Comparative studies showed that children exposed to MMR were not more likely than unexposed children to experience regression, or a combination of regression and GI symptoms [10]. Moreover, studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells RNA and measles antibodies titers [6]and measles RNA in gut specimen [20] all failed to document the presumed persistence of the measles virus in biological compartments of children with autism exposed to MMR. Of note, the initial research was shown to be fraudulent and the original paper was retracted by the Lancet [13]. Despite the strong convergence of negative scientic ndings on this issue, fears that vaccines might cause ASD have persisted in the community of individuals with autism and their caregivers, as well as the lay public. In fact, misperception about an ASD- vaccine link has been proposed as a leading explanation behind increases in vaccine delays and refusals [30], the public-health consequences of which are evident in increased outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases [32]. These outbreaks and steadily declining immunization rates prompted the World Health Organi- zation to identify vaccine hesitancy as one of the 10 greatest threats to global health in 2019 [47], as well as the publication of The Salzburg Statement on Vaccine Acceptance [35], which appeals to social media, government, healthcare, education, and families to actively promote condence in vaccines. A public health focus is increasingly centered on parents who are vaccine hesitant (VHPs), which refers to a continuum of vaccine concerns that may include delaying/refusing one or more vaccines; however, VHPs are more amenable to vaccination compared to parents who refuse vaccines entirely. Prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy varies geographically, but in the general population, estimates range from 9 to 15% [18,31,19] . However, emerging evidence suggests that this rate is much higher among parents of children with ASD. Two recentstudies on vaccine hesitancy and beliefs about causes of autism/de- velopmental delays among parents of chi at approximately 28% of parents were vaccine hesitant [28,17] . Not surprisingly, the bulk of these parents endorsed vaccines as a cause for their children's ASD. Considering that (a) children later diagnosed with ASD are well- vaccinated for childhood vaccines recommended during the rst two years of life [15,48] and (b) the median age of ASD diagnosis in the U.S. is four years, it is possible that many of these families become vaccine hesitant and endorse vaccines as a cause for ASD only after receiving the autism diagnosis. Unfortunately, once these beliefs are founded, they can be difcult to change and easy to dis- seminate, and little is known about the content and format of vaccine-information delivery that resonates most with parents who have concerns about vaccine safety [29]. As part of the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the SPARK cohort was recently initiated nationwide to increase genetic discovery and research capacity in ASD (SPARK, 2018). Since April 2016, recruitment from academic sites and the publicat large has allowed for rapid accrual of a very large sample of indi- viduals with ASD of all ages and from all US regions. A majority of these individuals and their parents consented to provide saliva samples for genetic characterization ( https://www.sfari.org/re- source/spark/ ). Data were collected on family background, medical and social history, and specic autism symptom patterns. As part of these baseline data, caregivers were asked questions about their beliefs about causes of autism in their child. We dichotomized the group into those participants who either did or did not identify immunizations as a possible cause of autism. We compared the two groups of participants with respects to familial socio- demographics and index child developmental and clinical proles. Our objectives were to identify: (1) characteristics of caregivers and households associated with belief in immunizations as a potential cause of autism; and (2) features of developmental tra- jectories and clinical proles of children with ASD whose parents are most vulnerable to endorsing such beliefs. 1. Material and methods 1.1. SPARK cohort In April 2016, SPARK began nationwide recruitment with 21 clinical sites, stakeholder partner organizations, and a multi- pronged social media strategy. Any individual living in the US with a professional diagnosis of ASD (by provider or school), alongside their parents (or legal guardians) and an unaffected sibling, are eli- gible to participate in SPARK. SPARK collects phenotypic data and biospecimens remotely so that participants can complete the study protocol online at their convenience, usually from home. As part of participation in SPARK, individuals are also asked to complete a battery of online questionnaires ( https://www.sfari. org/resource/spark/ ). For children under age 18, all questionnaires are completed by parents/caregivers. Although phenotypic information and ASD diagnoses in SPARK are self- or parent-reported, past research on the rst web-based registry for ASD, the Interactive Autism Network [25], as well as recent analyses of the dependent adults SPARK participants [11] suggest that parent-reported diagnosis of ASD is valid. Participants consent to share their de-identied data and to be contacted about future ASD research studies for which they may be eligible. Partic- ipants can also consent to contribute a saliva sample for genetic analysis and have the option to receive individual genetic results related to ASD should a primary genetic cause of ASD be identied. Detailed aspects of genetic material collection, genomic analyses,and return of results to participants are described elsewhere [39,11,9] . In SPARK's rst 32 months of recruitment, through December 2018, SPARK enrolled 150,064 participants, including 59,218 individuals with ASD. 1.2. Data and instruments Online registration requires completing a basic set of registra- tion questions about each individual who enrolls, and a series of supplementary questionnaires. /C15Registration Questions The registration questions (hereafter referred to as 'Registration Questions') for individual participants with ASD cover: age at reg- istration, sex, ASD diagnosis, professional/s who made the ASD diagnosis, age at rst diagnosis, lifetime receipt of any services or therapies specically for ASD, presence of an individualized educa- tion program/plan (IEP), lifetime diagnosis of intellectual disability or cognitive impairment, and current everyday language level2 E. Fombonne et al. / Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx Please cite this article as: E. Fombonne, R. P. Goin-Kochel and B. J. O'Roak, Beliefs in vaccine as causes of autism among SPARK cohort caregivers, Vacc ine, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.026(coded on 4 levels: No words/does not speak ,Uses single words meaningfully (for example, to request) ,Combines 3 words together into short sentences ,Uses longer sentences of his/her own and is able to tell you something that happened ). From this, we generated a dichotomous variable for current language functioning with: 0 = Sentence speech, 1 = Minimally or non- verbal (3 other levels). /C15Medical questionnaire Respondents can endorse any of the 5 following medical domains questions for diagnoses made by a professional: Birth or pregnancy complications, Neurological conditions, Growth condi- tions (e.g., obesity, head size), Vision or Hearing conditions, and Birth defects. A positive answer for any domain leads to more detailed follow-up questions. From these, we selected the follow- ing variables for subsequent analyses. We constructed a variable Any birth defect that was scored 1 when any of the 25 birth defects was endorsed and 0 otherwise. The ve birth/pregnancy complica- tions were similarly summarized in a binary variable Any birth problem scored 1 (=Any complications) or 0 (=No complications). Sleep disorder and Seizure disorder or epilepsy were similarly coded 1 for Yes and 0 for No. For psychiatric disorders, we created summary binary variables for Any disruptive disorder ,Any emotional disorder , and Any psychiatric disorder . We also examined specic disorders for their particular relevance\u2014 ADHD because of its high prevalence and impact on management and caregivers [38], and Tics because of prior concerns about an increased risk of tics fol- lowing vaccine exposure [44,3] . ADHD and Tics were included in Any psychiatric disorder but not in Any disruptive disorder . Questions on psychiatric disorders apply retrospectively to the lifetime per- iod and no data were collected about date of onset, duration, or treatment. /C15Background history This questionnaire covered socio-demographic information about the parents (marital status, race/ethnicity, annual household income, education level, occupation/employment status) and cur- rent living arrangements. From the child's developmental history, the following variables were used: Motor delay (0 = No; 1 = Sat after 8 months or walked after 18 months), Delay in 1st words (0 = No; 1= >= 24 months), Delay in rst phrases (0 = No; 1= >=33 months), Age of parental recognition of 1st symptoms ,Type of parental concern ,Stopped progressing or ''plateaued \" (0 = No, 1 = yes), Stopped talking, lost language (0 = No, 1 = yes), Loss of other skills (0 = No, 1 = yes), Age at diagnosis ,Diagnosed with Asperger/ PDDNOS (0 = No, 1 = yes), Ever diagnosed with cognitive impair- ment/intellectual disability (0 = No, 1 = yes), and Presence of a sibling with ASD (0 = No; 1 = Yes). Cut points for delays in milestones were selected to be similar to those of the Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2014 Revised , a widely used caregiver interview for the diagnosis of aut- ism. In the current functioning questions, parents were asked to rate the level of functioning of their child as compared to same- age peers. Questions covered the level of support required, general understanding of concepts and problem-solving capacity, daily functioning, and current level of spoken language. For each domain, parents indicated if their child was functioning above or at age level, slightly below age, or signicantly below age. A com- posite variable was generated by calculating the Number of areas where the child was most behind his peers (signicantly below age or very substantial support required), with a range from 0 to 4. One nal question was about the caregiver's perceptions about the causes of ASD: ''What is your opinion as to what may have cau-sed X's ASD?\". Nine options were listed: Genetic causes, Other medical conditions, Environmental exposures, Problems during pregnancy, Drug or alcohol exposure in pregnancy, Birth ordelivery complication, Infection in infancy or early childhood, Immunizations, Don't know/Other. Parents could select as many responses as they liked. A positive response to the 'Immunizations' modality was used to stratify the sample into caregivers who endorsed immunizations (EI) or not (NEI) as a cause of ASD. /C15Other SPARK data Other questionnaire data used were: - The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a parent- report questionnaire that evaluates 3 major aspects of ASD: communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. The development of the SCQ was modeled after the Autism Diagnostic Interview to generate a brief, parent-completed, screening tool (Berument et al., 1999). The questionnaire exists in two forms: life- time and current. The ''lifetime\" version (used in this study) eval- uates the child's developmental history as well as current behaviors. It comprises 40 questions with ''yes\" or ''no\" responses. Each item is scored as 0 or 1, and the sum of 39 items yields a total SCQ score ranging from 0 to 39 (the rst item documents whether or not the child has phrase speech and is not scored). Total scores are prorated when there are 3 items or less missing; with 4 or more items missing, total score is set to missing. Cutoffs of 15 and 22 were initially proposed to select children likely to have a broader or narrower form of ASD, with a cut-off of 12 recommended in sub- sequent epidemiologic studies. -The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) is a caregiver completed rating scale that evaluates 43 restricted, repetitive, self-injurious behaviors rated on a zero (Behavior does not occur) to 3 (Behavior occurs and is a severe problem) scale as observed during the last month. An overall score is derived from the sum of items scores, and scale-specic scores can also be derived for six dimensions (Stereotyped behavior; Self-injurious behavior; Compulsive behavior; Ritualistic behavior; The RBS-R overall score was dichotomized by using the 75th (47) and 90th (65) centiles of the whole sample distribution. The SCQ and the RBS-R were examined both as continuous and categorical scores. 1.3. Sample selection Data for participants registered in the SPARK cohort were downloaded December 20, 2018, from the SFARI website ( https:// www.sfari.org ). There were an ASD diag- nosis, of whom 50,505 were under age 18 at registration. Of these, 18,480 had Background history data with the vaccine-belief ques-tion answered. We further excluded 1,955 subjects who were sib- lings or half-siblings of an already registered child in order to maintain independence of observations, leaving a sample of 16,525 participants under age 18 with available data. They were comparable to participants without Background history data for sex, age, cognitive and language levels, and history of ASD services. 1.4. Ethical approval All recruiting sites for SPARK delegated institutional oversight of the study to a central institutional review board (Western IRB). Only de-identied data were used in this study. 1.5. Statistical analyses Data were analyzed in SPSS v25 and conventional statistical tests for categorical (Fisher exact test; chi-square) and continuous variables (t-tests, Pearson or Spearman correlation coefcients)E.

O'Roak, Beliefs in vaccine as causes of autism among SPARK cohort caregivers, Vacc ine, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.026were used. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of binary dependent variables. In line with cur- rent recommendations [34,37] , we did not use Bonferroni's adjust- ment for multiple tests. Owing to the large sample size, a p-value of <=0.01 was retained throughout as a pre-set level of statistical signicance. 2. Results The SPARK-participant sample was 80.4% male (male:female ratio: 4.1), and the mean age was 8.1 years (SD = 4.1) at registra- tion. Overall, 2,730 caregivers (16.5%) endorsed immunizations as a possible cause of ASD in their child; this was the fourth most fre- quent potential etiology endorsed by respondents, preceded by genetic causes (N = 9,650, 58.4%), environmental exposures (N = 3,611; 21.9%) and birth or delivery complications (N = 2,796, 16.9%). 2.1. Attributions to immunizations versus other causes EI and NEI caregivers were compared with respect to other endorsed etiologic beliefs ( Table 1 ). Genetic causes were the most frequently endorsed etiology, with no difference between the EI and NEI groups in likelihood of endorsing that cause. For 6 of the remaining 7 potential causes, the EI group had signicantly higher levels of endorsement than the NEI group. When causes were added up, EI caregivers endorsed a higher number of causes than NEI caregivers (2.8 vs 1.3; p < 0.001). 2.2. Socio-demographic characteristics by caregiver-belief status Sociodemographic characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . Children did not differ by gender but were signicantly older in the EI group compared to the NEI group. There was a marked ten- dency for children from ethnic minority backgrounds (with the exception of Native Americans) to have parents belonging to the EI group. Compared to NEI caregivers, EI caregivers were signi- cantly less often married, had lower income, were less educated, less often employed, and more likely to be full-time caregivers for their child. Sibling recurrence of ASD had no impact on beliefs. 2.3. Developmental and clinical proles by caregiver belief status Children from NEI caregivers had slightly higher rates of birth problems; otherwise, the 2 groups were comparable for the inci- dence of birth defects, motor delay, and language delay when esti- mated by rst-word onset ( Table 3 ). However, phrase-speech delay was signicantly more frequent in the EI group. The EI caregivers also differed from their NEI counterparts in their reports of rstASD symptoms in their child. EI caregivers less often reported early (<12 months) or late (>36 months) recognition of rst symptoms but identied them more frequently during the second year of life. The type of rst ASD symptom recognized by parents signicantly differed across groups, with EI caregivers reporting a change or loss of skills three times more frequently than NEI parents. Irrespective of age at symptom identication, over half the EI caregivers reported a loss of language in their child and over two fths reported a loss of another skill, with both reports occurring about twice as frequently in the EI compared to the NEI group. Similarly, reports of plateauing in development was much more frequent in the EI than the NEI group. In addition, when language loss occurred, children from the EI group lost language skills at an ear- lier age than in the NEI group (21.0 vs 23.1 months; p < 0.001). When asked if speech ever came back to the level it was just beforethe loss, NEI caregivers had more frequent positive answers than EI caregivers (69.5% vs 59.7%; p < 0.001) and the reported duration of the loss (<1 year) was signicantly different across the two groups and shorter in the NEI group (NEI: 34.3%; EI: 18.8%; p < 0.001). A similar pattern was observed for loss of other skills (i.e., non- language skills), which occurred at a signicantly younger age in the EI group compared to the NEI group (27.5 vs 37.5 months; <0.001). The return to pre-loss skill level was endorsed by 51.1% of NEI and 44.0% of EI caregivers (p < 0.001) and a duration of loss < 1 year was reported by 29.4% of NEI and 16.4% of EI care- givers (p < 0.001). The mean age at diagnosis in this sample was 4.4 years (SD = 2.7; IQR: 2.5-5.5). The age at diagnosis was signicantly lower in the EI group than in the NEI group (3.7 vs 4.5 years; p < 0.001), with higher proportion of children diagnosed before age 3 and the opposite pattern after age 6 ( Table 3 ). Severity was more pronounced in children of the EI group, with a higher rate of lifetime diagnosis of intellectual disability, similarly indexed by less reliance on 'high-functioning' diagnostic categorization. With the exception of Tics, lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders was slightly higher among NEI compared to EI offspring. By contrast, other indicators of clinical severity were signicantly raised in the EI group, including sleep disorders, epilepsy, as well as minimally verbal status (currently, no sentence speech). Like- wise, when asked about the level of support currently required by their child, ndings were consistent across the 4 areas investi- gated, with EI children endorsing a higher number of areas with signicant needs than NEI children by a factor that ranged from 1.3 (Spoken language) to 1.6 (Support required) ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, levels of autistic symptomatology, whether measured by the general autism SCQ questionnaire or by the more symptom-domain specic RBS-R scale, showed consistently higher levels of symptoms in the EI compared to the NEI group. This wastrue when scores were examined both continuously or categori- cally ( Table 3 ). Table 1 Vaccines versus other etiologic beliefs.

O'Roak, Beliefs in vaccine as causes of autism among SPARK cohort caregivers, Vacc ine, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.026Thus, children from parents endorsing immunization as a potential cause of ASD had a developmental course marked on average by an 'onset' in the second year of life, a regressive pattern involving language and other skills, an earlier (<3) age at diagnosis, and greater clinical severity as shown by heightened developmen- tal language and cognitive impairments, as well as more pro- nounced decits in current level of functioning across key areas. Moreover, parents in the EI group more frequently tended to come from minority, less educated, and less wealthy backgrounds. The ndings on psychiatric disorders ran in the opposite direction; however, previous analyses [11] showed that psychiatric preva- lence is decreased among individuals with lower levels of languageand cognitive functioning, likely indicating under-detection among those who are more severely impaired. Because factors associated with vaccine-belief status were intercorrelated, we employed multiple logistic regression analyses to obtain a more parsimonious set of correlates of such beliefs. Using belief in immunization as a dependent variable, three a prioridened blocks of variables with a signicant (p < 0.01) association with belief status were entered as predictors as follows: (a) demo- graphic characteristics (child ethnicity, living arrangements, par- ent's marital status, annual household income, mother's education, and mother's occupation; see Table 2 variables); (b) developmental trajectory characteristics (sex, age, any birth prob- lems, cognitive impairment, motor delay, phrase-speech delay, age at rst ASD symptoms, type of parental concern, plateau, any regression [language or other skill], age at diagnosis, Asperger/ PDDNOS diagnosis; see Table 3 variables, Section Early Develop- ment); c) current behavioral/adaptive functioning (history of sei- zures, any lifetime psychiatric disorder, diagnosed sleepproblems, minimally verbal status, total SCQ score [continuous], and number areas required, spoken language] with signicantly section on Current behavioral/adaptive func- tioning). Gender was initially forced in the models because of itsTable 2 Sociodemographic characteristics, by belief status. Immunizations may have caused my child's ASD ...

In summary, of the 25 vari- ables tested as predictors in the 3 models, 11 no longer signi- cantly contributed to the model (- marital status, living arrangements, household income; - sex, cognitive impairment, motor delay, Asperger/PDDNOS diagnosis; - seizure history, any psychiatric disorder, RBS-R total score) and were not further con- sidered. The remaining 14 variables were entered into a stepwise logistic regression with forward selection procedure and ap = 0.01 for inclusion in the model. Results are shown in Table 4 . Three variables (total SCQ score, mother's occupation, and delay in phrase speech) were not retained in the nal model. The model t was good (Hosmer-Lemeshow v2= 3.7; df = 8; p = 0.89). The 11 predictors remaining in the model reflected the role of both socio- demographic (child's race, child age, maternal education), develop- mental (regression, plateau, age at diagnosis, age and type of symptom for parental recognition, birth problems), and current functioning (language decits, number of areas with signicant below age functioning) factors.

Discussion In this large community sample of caregivers of children with ASD under age 18, one in six participants believed immunizations could be a cause of ASD in their child; this was the fourth most fre- quently endorsed cause. Caregivers who endorsed vaccinations as a potential cause also more frequently endorsed other external, envi- ronmental causes and came from more adverse social back- grounds; their children had developmental trajectories characterized by skill loss in the second year of life and long- term, persisting impairments in language and overall functioning. In our sample, beliefs in vaccines as a cause for ASD was not associated with a lessened endorsement of genetic factors as cau- sal, as well; rather, it was paralleled with more frequent endorse- ment of multiple, additional, putative environmental causes. As the SPARK cohort relies on voluntary research participation in a cohort with strong underpinning of genetic research, our observed pro- portion of caregivers harboring vaccine beliefs is likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency among the population of care- givers of children with ASD. Data were not available on actual vac- cine uptake of the children concerned, thus caution is needed in extrapolating from parental beliefs to actual opting out of the vac- cination schedule. However, previous studies have shown that par- ents of children with ASD are more likely to be vaccine-hesitant [28,36] and parental beliefs in vaccine causation is associated with lower immunization rates of ASD children at later ages [4,48] and lower rates of immunizations in unaffected younger siblings com- pared to their peers [1,4,12,48] . Taken all together, the results of these studies strongly suggest that parental beliefs in vaccine cau- sation lead to delays or declines in vaccine uptake in both children with ASD and their unaffected siblings. Interestingly, the proportion of EI believers was higher in care- givers of older children. This might reflect a cohort effect in which parents of children born around 2000 may have been more affected by the vaccine controversy in general, or by earlier concerns arising from the use of thimerosal that have subsided following discontin- uation of the preservative in vaccine preparation since 2004. Alter- natively, it may reflect an age effect by which the persistence of substantial impairments at older ages may be associated with dif- ferent patterns of parental beliefs. The cross-sectional and retro- spective nature of the data did not permit further investigation of these competing hypotheses. The sociodemographic factors related to parental beliefs showed that parents from ethnic minority and less-educated back-grounds were more prone to endorse these beliefs, ndings that are consistent with previous results [4]. Already, ethnic minority and underserved social groups have well-established decreased access to diagnostic and early intervention services [2,7] . Our nd- ings show that they also are more vulnerable to embracing unpro- ven attributions that may, in turn, result in increased medical risk or morbidity associated with preventable infectious diseases. In multivariate analysis, both ethnicity and lower maternal education increased signicantly the odds of erroneous vaccine beliefs beyond the effect of individual clinical characteristics, suggesting that preemptive educational efforts should be specially targeted at caregivers with these social risk characteristics. Moreover, it is worth noting that minority groups have been specically targeted by anti-vaccine movements [46,8] , which makes preventative edu- cation within these subgroups even more necessary. Both early developmental and current clinical characteristics influenced the likelihood of vaccine beliefs. In the early develop- mental period, both the emergence of specic symptoms and theirtiming separately increased odds of belief in vaccine causation. A rst parental concern about a change or loss of abilities in the child and report of regression or loss of language/other skills were the two developmental features with the strongest association with vaccine causation beliefs. With respect to timing, parental recogni- tion of rst alarming symptoms during the second year of life and a diagnosis before age 3 were predictive of later antivaccine senti- ment. In addition, loss of skills occurred earlier in that group and lasted longer. Loss of skills occurs in 20-40% of children with ASD, usually during the second year of life, and is associated in sev- eral studies with more severe language, adaptive behavior and cog- nitive outcomes [10,14,27,33,43] . The origin of the regressive pattern is unknown but has been associated with increased fre- quency of de novo variants in genes encoding for post-synaptic density proteins [16] or in a few specic genes involved in chro- matin remodeling or synapse formation and adhesion [41]. Belief in a vaccine-based etiology was also associated with increased overall current severity of the child at SPARK registra- tion. In particular, risk was increased in parents of children with current language limitations, either being non-verbal or having single words or word combinations, as well as those functioning below chronological age in multiple areas. Interestingly, when past and current delays in milestones or functioning were adjusted for,autism symptomatology scores no longer contributed to the pre- diction of parental beliefs. Thus, it appears that severity as indexed by non specic delays in development, especially in language and communication, rather than autism specic symptoms is the most predictive characteristic. It is worth noting that the type, and more so the timing, of rst autism symptoms identied in our sample make the measles- mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization a more likely target for par- ental causal attribution, as MMR is usually given during ages 12- 18 months, a period that coincides with the emergence of parental concerns in a high proportion of families [5]. In an earlier study, when parents harboring anti-vaccine beliefs were asked to com- pare different vaccines, MMR came well ahead of other vaccines or vaccine combinations (49% vs <26%) as the culprit for ASD [4]. Taken together, our results suggest that preemptive educational activities should preferentially target families from ethnic minority and less educated backgrounds and whose children exhibit loss of skills in the second year of life. Professionals involved in multidis- ciplinary specialist teams who diagnose ASD may not always have enough time to educate parents about what ASD is notcaused by. Additionally, teams led by nonmedical professionals may feel less competent to talk through medical matters and may refer families to later discussions with their community providers, which may or may not occur. Because of the recent resurgence of measles out- breaks, it is important that professionals tackle this informationgap. There is a need to develop evidence-based tools for practition- ers and families to facilitate this process. 4. Limitations This cohort comprises participants who volunteered for research, with special emphasis on genetic research, and the repre- sentativeness of the SPARK cohort cannot be fully assessed. Data, including those on diagnosis, are reported by parents online and no independent validation is yet available. However, preliminary phenotypic [11] and genetic [9]data provide indirect evidence for diagnostic validity among affected SPARK participants. Data on early developmental trajectories of ASD was retrospectively col- lected. Beliefs in vaccine causation of ASD were investigated glob- ally and no analysis could be done for beliefs relating to specic childhood vaccines. We did not have vaccination records and could not test if parents who hold beliefs that vaccines can cause ASD8 E. Fombonne et al. / Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx Please cite this article as: E.
