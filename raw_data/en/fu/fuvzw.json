Photo: MLW4 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESSStudy Endpoints The subunit severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE) will be superior to that of a licensed live oral vaccine, ROTARIX\u00ae The TV P2 -VP8 vaccine will be safe and well- tolerated in healthy infants.Study hypotheses To assess the relative efficacy* in prevention of SRVGE of the TV P2- VP8 vaccine compared to ROTARIX. To evaluate the safety of the TV P2- VP8 vaccine in healthy infants compared with the safety of ROTARIX.Primary objectives Laboratory -confirmed cases of SRVGE (any strain). Serious adverse events (SAEs), including intussusception, through 28 days after the last dose of study vaccine. Adverse events >grade 2 through 28 days following the last dose of study vaccine.Primary endpoints *Primary analysis to be performed once 99 cases are identified with onset at least 2 weeks after receipt of third study vacc ination.5 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESSSecondary Objectives EfficacyTo assess the relative efficacy in prevention of SRVGE in the first two years of life, as well as in the first and second year of life, separately. To assess the relative efficacy in prevention of very SRVGE (VSRVGE). To assess the P-type specific relative efficacy in prevention of SRVGE and VSRVGE, for P[4], P[6] and P[8] strains. To assess the relative efficacy in prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) of any severity . To assess the relative efficacy in prevention of hospitalization due to RVGE of any severity. SafetyTo evaluate the tolerability (reactogenicity) of the TV P2-VP8 subunit vaccine (in the week following each vaccination) and compare with that of ROTARIX. To evaluate longer -term safety of the TV P2-VP8 vaccine in healthy infants and compare with that of ROTARIX. ImmunogenicityTo evaluate the immunogenicity of the TV P2-VP8. To assess lot-to-lot consistency of immune responses across three lots of TV P2-VP8 vaccine, based on a subset of participants receiving TV P2-VP8. To compare the impact of concomitant administration of TV P2 -VP8 on immune responses to other Universal Immunization Program vaccines to that of ROTARIX. To evaluate immune response to ROTARIX.6 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESSDouble -Dummy Study Design 7 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESSGroup Sequential Design with an Interim Analysis No-go criteria met Go criteria met8 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESSInterim safety results Interim analysis occurred in August 2022 following the accrual of a predefined number of endpoints.

Current status: All eligible participants have received ROTARIX. Participants have started exiting the study. Study team remains blinded. Final analysis will be performed in Q3 2023, with results expected in mid-2024.DSMB recommendation Stop progression of study to Stage 2Cross -over vaccination of all eligible participants with ROTARIXFollow up participants for 6 months and then close out10 CENTER FOR VACCINE INNOVATION & ACCESS Thank you!
