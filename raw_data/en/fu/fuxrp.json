We are continuously exposed to stressors, whether they're related to work, family, relationships, or our environment. A stressor triggers a release of hormones initiating a response from both mind and body to be on high alert. This is commonly called the flight or fight response. We all have different approaches to self-regulating this response, allowing us to relax back to our normal state. However, the inability to handle these stressors, leaving us on high alert, will negatively affect our physical and emotional health. Unresolved stress can alter the pathways that help our brain maintain normal function and balance. Unfortunately, many of us do not recognize stress as the culprit of our body, mood, and behavior. Anxiety or worry is a natural response experienced from childhood through adulthood. If you are finding yourself feeling anxious without reason or anxiety is affecting your quality of life, it can be a sign of anxiety disorder. Anxiety can be defined as a mental health disorder described by feelings of worry, anxiousness, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily tasks and participation in social interactions. An indication of anxiety may be experiencing increased stress that is out of proportion to the event's impact and difficulty setting aside the worry. Depression disorder is more than just feeling unhappy. When you have depression it is a persistent, intense feeling of sadness and loss of interest in experiencing enjoyment. Depression, like anxiety, affects all ages with an increased prevalence with age. Depression is approximately 50% more prevalent in women than men. Ten percent of the US population experiences depression severe enough to necessitate medical attention. Depression can lead to a range of different behavioral and physical symptoms.
