It can also be used to treat some types of advanced prostate cancer, although it is not approved by the FDA for this use. The information provided here focuses on the use of ketoconazole to treat prostate cancer. Ketoconazole can inhibit (slow down or block) the production of steroids in your body, including testosterone. The inhibition of the production of steroids can slow down and possibly stop the progression of prostate cancer. How to Take Ketoconazole Ketoconazole is a tablet that is taken orally (by mouth). The dose and number of times per day you take it depends on why you are taking this medication. Follow your provider's directions for taking this medication. You should avoid drinking alcohol and ingesting products made with alcohol (some mouthwashes, cough syrups, etc) while on this medication because it can increase the risk of liver damage. Some patients have reported having allergic reactions to this medication, ranging from mild side effects like itching, to very serious side effects including anaphylactic reaction. If you have shortness of breath, a hard time breathing, chest pain, rash, flushing or itching, tell your provider immediately or call 911. It is important to make sure you are taking the correct amount of medication every time. Before every dose, check that what you are taking matches what you have been prescribed. Ketoconazole can affect the levels of many medications in your blood, just as other medications can affect the level of ketoconazole. For example, ketoconazole can increase the plasma concentration of oral midazolam (Versed), triazolam (Halcion), and alprazolam (Xanax), which can increase the severity of lethargy commonly caused by these medications. Antacids and proton pump inhibitors can decrease the plasma concentration of ketoconazole. Tell your provider about all medications, both prescribed and over the counter, and any herbal or holistic supplements you are taking. If you have any questions regarding interactions, you can also ask your pharmacist. Storage and Handling Store your medication in the original, labeled container at room temperature and in a dry location (unless otherwise directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist).

Keep containers out of reach of children and pets. Where do I get this medication? Ketoconazole is available through mail order and retail pharmacies. Your oncology team will work with you to identify an in-network pharmacy for distribution of this medication. Insurance Information This medication may be covered under your prescription drug plan.
