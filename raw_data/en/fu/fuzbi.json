Try these little-known healing stones.", "sitename": "Healthline Media", "date": "2021-07-23", "cleaned_text": "These lesser-known crystals pack just as much power. Crystals have grown increasingly popular in recent years. Many people use them for everything from healing and protection to manifesting their desires. There are a few common crystals \u2014 like amethyst, quartz, jasper \u2014 you might expect to find on jewelry, on display, or in an energy worker's collection. But what about lesser-known gems? If you're ready to deepen your knowledge about the world of crystals or add a new stone to your collection, read on to learn what experts say about the more obscure stones in the crystal kingdom. First things first, why do people use crystals? Some people believe that crystals are powerful energy amplifiers. Formed over thousands of years, they're believed to harness energies that can aid with: - physical and emotional healing - protection against negative energy - attraction of love, success, abundance, and more While working with crystals is a popular practice, it's important to note that there's currently no scientific evidence to support its benefits. In fact, a [2009 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814126/) Still, many people swear by the benefits of crystals. There's certainly no harm in giving them a try as a complementary treatment. Crystal healer [Carol Boote](https://www.carolboote.co.uk/) says there are countless varieties of sacred stones many people aren't familiar with. \"Many 'new' stones are now available on the market and bring some unique healing properties,\" says Boote. \"Some of these are unique combinations of established crystals that would have previously been destroyed at the mining stage. These can have powerful healing properties.\" Any purported benefits of the following crystals are purely anecdotal and are not currently backed by scientific research. However, crystal use is an important part of many cultures and traditions. Many people around the world find the practice of wearing crystals and placing them in their surroundings to benefit their well-being. Chiastolite Appearance and properties Chiastolite is formed from aluminum nesosilicate mineral. It's a brown stone with a distinctive black cross that runs through it. Because of this, it is also known as Cross Stone. It's a favorite crystal of crystal healer [Jeannie Lymath](http://www.solecare.org/). According to Lymath, Indigenous Americans believe \"heavily in the protection aspects this mineral provides and often have it with them during rituals and ceremonies.\" However, Lymath isn't an Indigenous American herself. Chiastolite is also believed to help with blood conditions, circulation, stress, and more. Potential benefits This crystal may: - provide protection against negative energies - aid communication with the spiritual world - help support the immune system - help support hormone regulation - provide a calming effect - boost emotional strength - promote mental clarity - promote inner peace Lymath notes that chiastolite is strongly associated with the root chakra and can be of help when you're at a crossroads in life. [Chakras](/health/what-are-chakras) are thought to be energy centers in the body that affect your well-being. \"It helps cultivate positive energy, healing your aura,\" she says. Seraphinite Appearance and properties Seraphinite is deep green in color and has patterns of silver that reflect light. This crystal is said to be the stone of the Seraphim, often portrayed as the highest order of angels who attend the throne of God. It's an extremely rare gem variety of clinochlore, a magnesium iron aluminum silicate that's found only in the Lake Baikal region of Siberia.

It's found in various shades of blue, from transparent to slightly opaque. \"Tanzanite is relatively rare and costly, occurring in only one place in the world, the Merelani Hills in Tanzania, East Africa,\" says Lymath. Today it's often used in jewelry and is believed to improve psychic abilities and deepen spiritual practices like meditation. Potential benefits This crystal may: - support detoxification - boost vitality - relieve stress and nervous tension - inspire compassion and rebuild trust - promote deep meditative states Lymath says tanzanite is a stone of transmutation (transformation) that brings together all aspects of communication and psychic power. \"Tanzanite stimulates the throat, third eye, and crown chakras,\" she adds. \"This unites the higher mind with our intuition and aids communication. It allows you to more easily speak your truth.\" Blue Siberian quartz Appearance and properties Blue Siberian quartz is, as the name suggests, bright blue in color and is developed from cobalt. It's a laboratory-grown quartz made in Russia. Natural quartz is broken, regrown, and mixed with cobalt to form this stone. Proponents say wearing this stone can improve your inner vision and aid psychic abilities like telepathy and clairvoyance. Potential benefits This crystal may: - stimulate psychic vision and cosmic consciousness - support healing of throat and neck issues - promote peaceful feelings - increase intuition and positivity - promote clear communication \"People report feelings of deep peace when working with this stone,\" says Boote. \"It retains the properties of quartz and therefore can be 'programmed' and amplifies the healing properties of other crystals.\" Astrophyllite Appearance and properties This rare crystal is brown to golden-yellow in color and often has a pointy spear shape. It's formed from potassium, iron, titanium, manganese, sodium, and silicate minerals. It's also known as Star Leaf.

It's recommended to keep a piece in your workspace, as it helps with study and recall.\" Lepidocrocite Appearance and properties The raw form of lepidocrocite is a crusty opaque crystal with red flecks consisting of iron oxide hydroxide. It's believed to be closely linked to the heart chakra, though Boote believes it aligns with and stimulates all of the chakras. It's also said to bring you closer to divine energies and provide emotional healing. Potential benefits This crystal may: - support cellular regeneration - support liver function - support attention hyperactivity deficit disorder (ADHD), hyperactivity, and depression - support the functioning of the heart and lungs - support healing after abuse and trauma - deepen spiritual connection \"This stone recognizes your strengths and dissipates mental confusion and 'brain fog.' It teaches you to be kinder and less judgmental, and helps clear away the ego that prevents us from truly empowering others,\" Boote says. She also believes that it serves as a bridge between the physical and spiritual, replacing materialistic tendencies with unconditional love for yourself and the environment. When adding any crystal to your collection, it's important to ensure that it's ethically sourced. This will avoid fakes as well as counteract over-mining. Many crystals come from the earth and sometimes take thousands of years to form. This means they're a finite resource. If in doubt, ask the seller how the crystal is sourced and to provide a certificate of authenticity for very rare crystals. Many sellers are committed to sourcing their crystals sustainably and are happy to tell you how they do so. The best options for buying crystals - small independent shops where you can see, feel, and ask questions about the product - retailers who provide a certificate of authenticity for rare crystals - retailers who provide information on how their crystals are sourced, like [Mystic Wolf](https://www.themysticwolf.com/pages/our-crystals-sourcing) - retailers with realistic price points, since cheaper isn't always better There are hundreds \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 of new crystals to choose from when you're considering adding one to your collection, including many varieties you may not have heard of. Just like their better-known counterparts, these less common crystals are also believed to carry potent energies that may aid physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. Whichever crystals you choose to add to your collection, it's important you source them ethically. Remember that crystal healing isn't supported by scientific evidence, but it's generally considered a safe complementary practice to support your well-being.
