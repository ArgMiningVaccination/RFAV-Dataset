The three things that come most readily to mind are respect, knowledge, and safety. If you decide to learn the use of herbs for spiritual practices from people of different faiths, it is wise to proceed with reverence. In many cultures, spiritual practices with plants are a sacred component of religion. It is always good to proceed with care, to be cautious and circumspect when learning about new spiritual practices. Learn what the boundaries are that your teachers feel should be honored in order to respect their traditions, and then honor those wishes. Before you grow a plant, learn about what it needs to flourish so that you can provide well for it. Before you pick and use a wild plant, be absolutely certain of the identity of that plant and of what parts are safe to use. If you have any questions or concerns, trust your natural instincts for caution and consult an expert before going any further. This caution is, of course, most important for avoiding contact with, and ingestion of, toxic and poisonous plants. I have never studied mushrooms in depth, so I avoid them entirely. And even the improper use of the most innocuous-seeming plant can have consequences. One summer, when I was working as land manager for an Audubon Society, the black cherries bore an abundant crop. When the berries matured and ripened in the summer sun, they began to taste good and sweet. One day, I decided to make my lunch entirely of black cherries. That was the day I discovered wild black cherries (Prunus serotina), when eaten in quantity, have a powerful laxative effect. Where do you feel the closest to our green neighbors? The garden is my monastery; it is both my test and salvation. At times, after days of heavy rains, I return to the garden and mutter frustrations under my breath at the beds full of weeds. But then I start to pull the unwanted guests, watching the beds gradually return to their glorious state of clear soil and order. Pruning here, feeding the roots there, weeding everywhere_these are the acts of daily devotion that define who I am, and who I will become. In those rare moments when I lose my self in the process of caring for the garden, I feel closest to God. Herbs are one gateway to reaching for the Divine. What do you truly enjoy about using herbs in spiritual practices? I have always been drawn to experiencing things directly. Yes, it is possible to go out and purchase some incense and herbal candles, to buy an herbal wreath and ready-made holiday decorations, but it is far more satisfying to make your own herbal creations. The creative act itself is another level of spiritual connection with herbs, especially when you share the experience with friends and family members. These are the collective experiences through which we grow close to one another, and which are so often missing in our hectic daily lives. Research has shown clearly that families who share regular meals have lower rates of divorce, child abuse, juvenile delinquency and drug abuse_because these problems are all symptomatic of a lack of connection and support from both family and community. Preparing and using herbs for spiritual practices is one way to bring ourselves closer to those we love, and in so doing, we bring ourselves closer to God. I recently did some work in the Middle East during the holy days of Easter and Passover, and was fortunate to be able to visit with peoples of the Jewish and Islamic faiths, as well as staying with a family from among the Druze faithful. In a few short days I experienced how herbs are incorporated into these various religious feasts and events. The Druze, in particular, have a very strong rootedness to herbalism that is seamlessly woven into their faith through meals, healing, and daily practices. On one occasion, as we were touring the countryside, I pointed to a tree whose branches were pendulous with thousands of blossoms. _What is the name of that tree?_ I asked. In an instant, we swerved to the side of the road. My driver and host, Salman, jumped out of the car and enthusiastically motioned for me to follow. A minute later we were eating the pea-like flowers of the tree which offered a quick taste of sweetness from the nectar, followed by a sour flavor as the petals were eaten. It was obviously a point of great joy and pride for Salman to show me this tree, which he has known all of his life, and to then describe how to use the flowers. The experience taught me how one of the wonderful spiritual uses of herbs is that they can become a common point of sharing that brings together people of different faiths, cultures, and customs. Herbs are a shared point of reference that fosters human connection. - How can you use some of the ideas and activities in this book to enrich your own faith and your ongoing spiritual practices? - How can herbs and herbal practices be used to find common ground among peoples of different faiths? - A good meal feeds our bodies.
