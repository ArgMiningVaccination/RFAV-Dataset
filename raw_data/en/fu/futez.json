Are certain parts suitably assigned to be anointed? Should those who are deformed in the above parts be anointed thereon?", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-04-29", "cleaned_text": "Objection 1. It would seem that this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be conferred even on those who are in [good](../cathen/06636b.htm) health. For the healing of the [mind](../cathen/10321a.htm) is a more important effect of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) than the healing of the body, as stated above ( [Supplement:30:2](../summa/5030.htm#article2)). Now even those who are healthy in body need to be healed in mind. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be conferred on them also. Objection 2. Further, this is the sacrament of those who are departing this life, just as [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is the sacrament of those who are entering this life. Now [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is given to all who enter. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given to all who are departing. But sometimes those who are near departure are in [good](../cathen/06636b.htm) health, for instance those who are to be beheaded. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be conferred on them. On the contrary, It is written ( [James 5:14](../bible/jam005.htm#verse14)): \"Is any [man](../cathen/09580c.htm) sick among you,\" etc. Therefore none but the sick are competent to receive this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). I answer that, This sacrament is a [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) healing, as stated above ( [Supplement:30:2](../summa/5030.htm#article1>Supplement:30:1</a> and <a href=)), and is signified by way of a healing of the body. Hence this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should not be conferred on those who are not subjects for bodily healing, those namely, who are in [good](../cathen/06636b.htm) health. Reply to Objection 1. Although [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) health is the principal effect of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm), yet this same [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) healing needs to be signified by a healing of the body, although bodily health may not actually ensue. Consequently [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) health can be conferred by this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) on those alone who are competent to receive bodily healing, viz. the sick; even as he alone can receive [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) who is capable of a bodily washing, and not a child yet in its mother's womb. Reply to Objection 2. Even those who are entering into life cannot receive [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) unless they are capable of a bodily washing. And so those who are departing this life cannot receive this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm), unless they be subjects for a bodily healing. Objection 1. It would seem that this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given in any kind of sickness. For no kind of sickness is determined in the fifth chapter of James where this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is delivered to us. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given in all kinds of sickness. Objection 2. Further, the more excellent a remedy is, the more generally should it be available. Now this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is more excellent than bodily medicine. Since then bodily medicine is given to all manner of sick [persons](../cathen/11726a.htm), it seems that this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given in like manner to all. On the contrary, This sacrament is called by all [Extreme Unction](../cathen/05716a.htm). Now it is not every sickness that brings [man](../cathen/09580c.htm) to the extremity of his life, since some ailments prolong life, according to the [Philosopher](../cathen/01713a.htm) (De Long. et Brev. Vitae i). Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should not be given in every case of sickness. I answer that, This sacrament is the last remedy that the [Church](../cathen/03744a.htm) can give, since it is an immediate preparation for [glory](../cathen/06585a.htm). Therefore it ought to be given to those only, who are so sick as to be in a state of departure from this life, through their sickness being of such a [nature](../cathen/10715a.htm) as to [cause](../cathen/03459a.htm) death, the danger of which is to be feared. Reply to Objection 1. Any sickness can [cause](../cathen/03459a.htm) death, if it be aggravated. Hence if we consider the different kinds of disease, there is none in which this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) cannot be given; and for this reason the [apostle](../cathen/01626c.htm) does not determine any particular one. But if we consider the degree and the stage of the complaint, this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should not be given to every sick [person](../cathen/11726a.htm). Reply to Objection 2. The principal effect of bodily medicine is bodily health, which all sick people lack, whatever be the stage of their sickness. But the principal effect of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is that immunity from disorder which is needed by those who are taking their departure from this life and setting out for the life of [glory](../cathen/06585a.htm). Hence the comparison fails. Objection 1. It would seem that this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given to [madmen](../cathen/08041a.htm) and imbeciles. For these diseases are full of danger and [cause](../cathen/03459a.htm) death quickly. Now when there is danger it is the time to apply the remedy. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm), which was intended as a remedy to [human](../cathen/09580c.htm) weakness, should be given to such people. Objection 2. Further, [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is a greater sacrament than this. Now [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is conferred on mad people as stated above ( [III:68:12](../summa/4068.htm#article12)). Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) also should be given to them. On the contrary, This sacrament should be given to none but such as acknowledge it. Now this does not apply to [madmen](../cathen/08041a.htm) and imbeciles. Therefore it should not be given to them. I answer that, The devotion of the recipient, the personal [merit](../cathen/10202b.htm) of the minister, and the general [merits](../cathen/10202b.htm) of the whole [Church](../cathen/03744a.htm), are of great account towards the reception of the effect of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). This is evident from the fact that the form of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is pronounced by way of a [prayer](../cathen/12345b.htm). Hence it should not be given those who cannot acknowledge it, and especially to [madmen](../cathen/08041a.htm) and imbeciles, who might dishonor the sacrament by their offensive conduct, unless they have lucid intervals, when they would be capable of acknowledging the [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm), for then the sacrament should be given to children the same in that state. Reply to Objection 1. Although such people are sometimes in danger of death; yet the remedy cannot be applied to them, on account of their lack of devotion. Hence it should not be given to them. Reply to Objection 2. [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) does not require a movement of the [free-will](../cathen/06259a.htm), because it is given chiefly as a remedy for [original sin](../cathen/11312a.htm), which, in us, is not taken away by a movement of the [free-will](../cathen/06259a.htm). On the other hand this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) requires a movement of the [free-will](../cathen/06259a.htm); wherefore the comparison fails. Moreover [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is a [necessary](../cathen/10733a.htm) sacrament, while [Extreme Unction](../cathen/05716a.htm) is not. Objection 1. It would seem that this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) ought to be given to children. Because children suffer from the same ailments sometimes as adults. Now the same disease requires the same remedy. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given to children the same as to adults. Objection 2. Further, this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is given in order to remove the remnants of [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm), whether original or actual, as stated above ( [Supplement:30:1](../summa/5030.htm#article1)). Now the remnants of [original sin](../cathen/11312a.htm) are in children. Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should be given to them. On the contrary, This sacrament should be given to none but those to whom the form applies. But the form of this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) does not apply to children, since they have not [sinned](../cathen/14004b.htm) by sight and hearing; as expressed in the [form](../cathen/06137b.htm). Therefore this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) should not be given to them. I answer that, This sacrament, like the [Eucharist](../cathen/05572c.htm), requires actual devotion in the recipient. Therefore, just as the [Eucharist](../cathen/05572c.htm) ought not to be given to children, so neither ought this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) to be given to them. Reply to Objection 1. Children's infirmities are not [caused](../cathen/03459a.htm) by actual [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm), as in adults, and this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is given chiefly as a remedy for infirmities that result from [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm), being the remnants of [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm), as it were. Reply to Objection 2. This sacrament is not given as a remedy for the remnants of [original sin](../cathen/11312a.htm), except in so far as they gather strength, so to speak, from actual [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm). Hence from the very form it appears that it is given chiefly as a remedy for actual [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm), which are not in children. Objection 1. It would seem that the whole body should be anointed in this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). For, according to [Augustine](../cathen/02084a.htm) (De Trin. vi, 6), \"the whole [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm) is in every part of the body.\" Now this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) is given chiefly in order to heal the [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm). Therefore the whole body ought to be anointed. Objection 2. Further, the remedy should be applied to the part affected by the disease. But sometimes the disease is general, and affects the whole body, as a fever does. Therefore the whole body should be anointed. Objection 3. Further, in [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) the whole body is dipped under the water. Therefore in this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) the whole body should be anointed. On the contrary, stands the rite observed throughout the [Church](../cathen/03744a.htm), according to which in this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) the sick [man](../cathen/09580c.htm) is anointed, only in certain fixed parts of the body. I answer that, This sacrament is shown to us under the form of a healing. Now bodily healing has to be effected, by applying the remedy, not to the whole body, but to those parts where the root of the disease is seated. Consequently the sacramental unction also ought to be applied to those parts only in which the [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) sickness is rooted. Reply to Objection 1. Although the whole [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm) is, as to its [essence](../cathen/05543b.htm), in each part of the body, it is not as to its powers which are the roots of [sinful](../cathen/14004b.htm) acts. Hence certain fixed parts have to be anointed, those, namely, in which powers have their being. Reply to Objection 2. The remedy is not always applied to the part affected by the disease, but, with greater reason, to the part where the root of the disease is seated. Reply to Objection 3. [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is given under the form of washing: and a bodily washing cleanses only the part to which it is applied; for this reason [Baptism](../cathen/02258b.htm) is applied to the whole body. It is different with [Extreme Unction](../cathen/05716a.htm) for the reason given above. Objection 1. It would seem that these parts are unsuitably assigned, namely, that the eyes, nose, ears, lips, hands, and feet should be anointed. For a wise physician heals the disease in its root. Now \"from the heart come forth a man\" ( [Matthew 15:19-20](../bible/mat015.htm)). Therefore the breast ought to be anointed. Objection 2. Further, purity of mind is not less [necessary](../cathen/10733a.htm) to those who are departing this life than to those who are entering therein. Now those who are entering are anointed with chrism on the head by the [priest](../cathen/12406a.htm), to signify purity of mind. Therefore in this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) those who are departing should be anointed on the head. Objection 3. Further, the remedy should be applied where the disease is most virulent. Now [spiritual](../cathen/14220b.htm) sickness is most virulent in the loins in men, and in the navel in [women](../cathen/15687b.htm), according to [Job 40:11](../bible/job040.htm#verse11): \"His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly,\" as [Gregory](../cathen/06780a.htm) expounds the passage (Moral. xxxii, 11). Therefore these parts should be anointed. Objection 4. Further, [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm) are committed with other parts of the body, no less than with the feet. Therefore, as the feet are anointed, so ought other members of the body to be anointed. I answer that, The principles of [sinning](../cathen/14004b.htm) are the same in us as the principles of action, for a [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm) is an act. Now there are in us three principles of action; the first is the directing principle, namely, the cognitive power; the second is the commanding principle, namely, the [appetitive](../cathen/01656a.htm) power; the third is the executive principle, namely, the motive power. Now all our [knowledge](../cathen/08673a.htm) has its origin in the senses. And, since the remedy for [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm) should be applied where [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm) originates in us first, for that reason the places of the five senses are anointed. the eyes, to wit, on account of the sight, the ears on account of hearing, the nostrils on account of the smell, the mouth on account of the taste, the hands on account of the touch which is keenest in the finger tips, (in some places too the loins are anointed on account of the [appetite](../cathen/01656a.htm)), and the feet are anointed on account of the motive power of which they are the chief instrument. And since the cognitive power is the first principle of [human](../cathen/09580c.htm) activity, the anointing of the five senses is observed by all, as being [essential](../cathen/05543b.htm) to the [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). But some do not observe the other unctions\u2014some also anoint the feet but not the loins\u2014because the [appetitive](../cathen/01656a.htm) and motive powers are secondary principles. Reply to Objection 1. No thought arises in the heart without an act of the [imagination](../cathen/07672a.htm) which is a movement proceeding from sensation (De Anima ii). Hence the primary root of thought is not the heart, but the sensory organs, except in so far as the heart is a principle of the whole body, albeit a remote principle. Reply to Objection 2. Those who enter have to receive purity of the [mind](../cathen/10321a.htm), whereas those who are departing have to cleanse the [mind](../cathen/10321a.htm). Hence the latter need to be anointed in those parts in respect of which the [mind's](../cathen/10321a.htm) purity may be sullied. Reply to Objection 3. Some are wont to anoint the loins, because they are the chief seat of the [concupiscible](../cathen/04208a.htm) [appetite](../cathen/01656a.htm): however, as stated above, the [appetitive](../cathen/01656a.htm) power is not the primary root. Reply to Objection 4. The bodily organs which are the instruments of [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm), are the feet, hands, and tongue, all of which are anointed, and the organs of generation which it would be unbecoming to anoint, on account of their uncleanliness, and out of respect for the [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). Objection 1. It would seem that those who are deformed should not be anointed in those parts. For just as this [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm) demands a certain disposition on the part of the recipient, viz. that he should be sick, so it demands that he should be anointed in a certain part of the body. Now he that is not sick cannot be anointed. Therefore neither can he be anointed who lacks the part to be anointed. Objection 2. Further, a man born blind does not [sin](../cathen/14004b.htm) by his sight. Yet in the anointing of the eyes mention is made of [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm) by sight. Therefore this anointing ought not to be applied to one born blind, and in like manner as regards the other senses. On the contrary, Bodily deformity is not an impediment to any other sacrament. Therefore it should not be an impediment to this one. Now each of the anointings is [essential](../cathen/05543b.htm) to the [sacrament](../cathen/13295a.htm). Therefore all should be applied to those who are deformed. I answer that, Even those who are deformed should be anointed, and that as near as possible to the part which ought to have been anointed. For though they have not the members, nevertheless, they have, at least radically, the powers of the [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm), corresponding to those members, and they may commit inwardly the [sins](../cathen/14004b.htm) that pertain to those members, though they cannot outwardly. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
