Research on the immunogenicity of mRNA and its alteration through chemical modification seemed quite obscure until a globe engulfing virus triggered a pandemic that was dramatically quenched by vaccines made possible by that 'obscure' research. It may take a while for effective therapies to emerge from our research. But the possibility of our work making an impact is the driver that keeps us going. Engineering in a biological context\u2014whether it be a novel device for assisting the visually impaired, a 3D printed vascular system for tissue engineering; a new paradigm for design of asthma therapies\u2014 always has the potential of great impact. In this report, you will find a few stories of the research that we at Northeastern are doing now and get a glimpse of our hopes for its impact in the future. At Northeastern, students and faculty work together to combine classroom, research, and experiential learning in a vibrant bioengineering community that spans the entire University. With over 70 tenured/tenure-track and affiliated faculty, the Department of Bioengineering offers research that encompasses the entire breadth of biological and biomedical engineering. Our co-op program is working with companies across the sector to provide bioengineering students with cutting-edge opportunities within the Boston biotech industry and beyond. Career opportunities are rapidly expanding as the industry focuses on development of entirely new classes of products, instrumentation, and implants. The opportunities afforded our students through these placements are extraordinary. This Annual Report provides a glimpse into the many activities of our faculty and the energy and breadth of their research. When you see stories that intrigue, entice, or excite, I hope you will take the time to further explore the details through our website, publications, and activities.

Drugs intended to reach these structures often \"stick\" to whatever they reach first without penetrating deeper. Through Bajpayee's research, drugs could now be targeted to where they're needed based on the negative charge of these tissues. Positively charged biomaterials carrying the drug would be drawn directly into the cellular matrix of these structures, channeling the drug deep into the tissue to reach cells close to the bone. Ultimately, this method could vastly improve treatments for osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases.NSF CAREER Award for Drug Delivery BiomaterialsFaculty Honors and Awards selected highlightsPhoto by Ruby Wallau6 NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY BIOENGINEERING 2022 Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award University Distinguished Professor Eduardo Sontag, electrical and computer engineering, jointly appointed in bioengineering, received the 2022 Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award\u2014the highest recognition in control theory and engineering in the United States. He was honored \"for pioneering contributions to stability analysis and nonlinear control, and for advancing the control theoretic foundations of systems biology.\"$2.7M National Cancer Institute Award to Help Unlock the Mystery of How Cancer Spreads Professor Mark Niedre, bioengineering, and Associate Professor Chiara Bellini, bioengineering, received a $2.7 million grant, titled \"Continuous, Non-Invasive Optical Monitoring of Circulating Tumor Cell-Mediated Metastasis in Awake Mice,\" from the National Cancer Institute. The project will develop a wearable device to detect tumor cells that enter the bloodstream, and study why and how they dislodge, and how they behave in the bloodstream, as well as devise ways to prevent them from metastasizing. Since the key to treating cancer is early detection, the research could have life-saving implications. Collaborators include Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Dartmouth College, and the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada.Outstanding New Environmental Scientist (ONES) Award to Study Impact of Wildfire Smoke on Human Health Assistant Professor Jessica Oakes and Associate Professor Chiara Bellini, bioengineering, were awarded a $3.4 million National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Outstanding New Environmental Scientist (ONES) grant for \"Cardiopulmonary Risk Assessment from Smoke Exposure at the Wildland Urban Interface.\" Wildland fires in the U.S. now consume an average of 7.3 million acres each year, more than twice the average figure from the 1990s\u2014while the human populations in the paths of these fires keep growing. To date, studies on smoke inhalation from wildland fires have focused mainly on short-term effects. With the ONES Award, Oakes and Bellini will look deeper into the health risks associated with prolonged wildfire smoke inhalation, which damages the body when fine and ultra-fine particles penetrate the lungs and sometimes enter the circulatory system, threatening multiple organs. Worse, household materials ignited by these fires contribute a lethal inferno of airborne toxins. Looking at the cumulative effects of both types of exposure, the researchers will use complex computational modeling and conduct live experiments on mice using a smoke mixture that mirrors the composition of wildfire smoke in the forests and chaparral of California. In addition to burning trees and brush, the experiments will focus on two highly toxic household items: plastics and the polyurethane foam common in furniture and bedding. Based on their findings, Oakes and Bellini hope to make policy recommendations on such issues as evacuations and the types of materials that should be avoided in new construction in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)\u2014areas where human development mingles with wildland vegetation.Faculty Honors and Awards Photo by Adam Glanzman7 ANNUAL REPORT 2021-2022 $2M NASA Grant to Build Long Lasting Neurovascular Model Associate Professor Guohao Dai, bioengineering, and Associate Professor Abigail Koppes and Assistant Professor Ryan Koppes, both of chemical engineering, received a $2 million grant from NASA, titled \"Bioengineer Long-lasting 3D Neurovascular Microphysiological System to Model Chronic Inflammation- mediated Neurodegeneration.\" They are developing a long-lasting 3D neurovascular model, which would be valuable to evaluate the impact of chronic stressors on the brain, such as drugs, environmental toxins, bacterial/viral infection, inflammation in neurodegeneration, as well as microgravity and radiation in long- term space flight. Current organ/tissue on-a-chip models only last one month, which is inadequate to model chronic diseases.$7.5M DOD MURI Award to Advance Synthetic Biology University Distinguished Professor Eduardo Sontag, electrical and computer engineering, and bioengineering, and collaborators received a $7.5 million award for \"Rules of Composition in Synthetic Biology Across Scales of Complexity: Theory and Tools.\" The grant is funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) program. Collaborators include Massachusetts Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology. Synthetic biology aims to program biology for applications, such as biosensing, smart probiotics, and regenerative medicine. A major challenge to engineering synthetic biological circuits that behave as intended is the compositional context: Networks are not \"plug and play\" because behaviors of individual components change when other components are present. This forces a designer to re-optimize each component when other parts are added. The result is that circuits are designed in a monolithic fashion through brute-force parameter search\u2014a lengthy process that is neither scalable, nor generalizable, and often leads to poor outcomes. Overcoming these challenges requires a rigorous, modular, and systematic design framework that explicitly accounts for the context-dependence of biomolecular processes and undesired interactions, which one tends to neglect in the design phase. The goal of the new grant is to impact synthetic biology by changing the way one describes, characterizes, and designs genetic modules, through tools that will enable the systematic and scalable design of increasingly complex biomolecular decision-making systems. The core of the project will establish theoretical foundations and tools, grounded on the mathematics of dynamical systems, that will enable the compositional design of synthetic biology circuits while accounting for context. A control-theoretic framework will be developed for the composition of biomolecular processes to capture unintended connectivity due to the sharing of cellular resources in gene expression as well as a hierarchical design methodology. The theory will be validated through bacterial, mammalian, and cell-free testbeds to be developed by the experimentalists on the team.

It enables the creation of coherent training programs, forums for peer-to-peer learning and information transfer, and provides support for efforts to grow the faculty and student numbers in this field at U.S. universities. This project will continue building the network in the U.S., and one of the major goals continues to be fostering communication and cooperation across national boundaries.Faculty Honors and Awards NIH Grant to Identify Novel Markers of Senescence Cells Associate Professor and Allen Distinguished Investigator Nikolai Slavov, bioengineering, in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, was awarded a $588K NIH grant from the National Cancer Institute for \"Single-Cell Proteomic Identification of Novel Markers of Senescence.\" Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. Identification and characterization of senescent cells in human tissues will contribute to the understanding of human diseases. Mapping senescent cells at the three-dimensional level and single-cell resolution in human tissues is an important biomedical objective. Accurate mapping of senescent cells requires reliable markers to specifically identify senescent cells. The research will employ a novel single-cell proteomic technology to investigate the proteomes of senescent cells at the single-cell level, with the goal to reveal novel markers of senescence which can be used to identify and map senescent cells in human tissues.Pioneering Single Cell Proteomics Research Published in Top Journals Associate Professor and Allen Distinguished Investigator Nikolai Slavov, bioengineering, pioneered technologies, called Single Cell Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry, for quantifying thousands of proteins across many single cells. The technology offers a cheaper and faster technique that enables researchers to analyze a much larger number of single cells and gain much more accurate data. The new field was described in the November 2021 cover article of C&EN, titled \"Individual Cell's Proteins Vary. Single-Cell Proteomics Can Now Show How.\" As interest in single-cell proteomics grew fast, adoption was delayed by technical challenges in performing highly specialized analysis. The Slavov laboratory developed accessible methods that could be broadly adopted based on detailed protocols published by the group. A paper title, \"Multiplexed Single-Cell Proteomics Using SCoPE2\" was published in the October 29, 2021, issue of Nature Protocols. A paper titled \"Increasing the Throughput of Sensitive Proteomics by plexDIA\" was also published in the July 14, 2022 issue of Nature Biotechnology. Slavov founded and hosts an annual SCP Conference at Northeastern University, single-cell.net/proteomics/videos, which attracts attendees globally in academia and industry.

Her research focuses on vascular mechanics\u2014specifically, how chronic disease associated with e-cigarette \"vaping\" or cigarette smoking influences the structural integrity and functional health of large arteries. Recognizing her potential as a scientist, the National Science Foundation awarded Farra a prestigious Graduate Research Fellowship in 2019. During her doctoral studies, she worked on several projects and presented her work at numerous conferences in a wide range of topics, from tobacco research to magnetic resonance imaging, aerosol medicine, and biomechanics. Her efforts culminated in five first-author publications: three already published, one under review, and one currently in submission. As a result, she received the APSelect Award from the American Physiological Society for distinction in scholarship in the June 2021 issue of the American Journal of Physiology- Heart and Circulatory Physiology for the article \"Structural and Functional Remodeling of the Female Apoe/ Mouse Aorta Due to Chronic Cigarette Smoke Exposure.\" She was also selected as a finalist for the highly competitive student paper competition at the SB3C conference and received the 2022 College of Engineering Outstanding Graduate Student Award for her research contributions over the past five years. Farra was elected to the Bioengineering Graduate Student Council where she served for several years. She has also devoted considerable effort to improving science communication as a fellow of the College of Engineering Communications Lab for nearly three years. She coached peer-to-peer sessions to help students with scientific writing and organized training sessions on how best to present scientific content. Following graduation, Farra will be taking her passion for scientific research to her new role as a scientist at Senda Biosciences, a biotech startup in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She will work on the translational biology team to help bring life-changing treatments to patients by harnessing Senda's platform for fully programmable medicines. 12 NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY BIOENGINEERING Student Spotlights Experience-Powered Learning at Moderna All Northeastern students hope to land a co-op that lets them wrestle with real-world problems while exploring their own academic interests. For Ella Strzegowski, E'23, bioengineering, her six-month co-op at Moderna from July to December 2021 did just that. Strzegowski's task at Moderna was part of the company's quality control measures, which reduce production costs and are part of federal safety requirements. She used the chromatography technique to examine molecules in the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine solution. Chromatography is a method of separating molecules in a mixture, which in this case is the vaccine itself. As the pharmaceutical giant continues to scale up vaccine production, Strzegowski says the work of improving the vaccine solution is important because it ensures the vaccine remains safe, on top of reducing manufacturing costs. It was a fitting assignment because it aligned with Strzegowski's own sense of work she finds meaningful: that which focuses on helping as many people as possible, in the broadest possible way. In high school, Strzegowski developed a deep interest in biology. At Northeastern, the focus of her studies in bioengineering is on \"cells and tissue.\" While at Moderna, Strzegowski was part of a broader team focused on mRNA process development, specifically on improving the manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies in order to scale up production and distribution of the still- in-high-demand COVID-19 vaccine.mRNA vaccines use viral genetic material to teach the immune system to respond to threats, as opposed to adenovirus vaccines, like Johnson & Johnson's, which use a weakened version of an actual virus. But mRNA material is incredibly delicate, requiring storage at sub-zero temperatures to remain viable, which means widespread manufacturing and distribution is an ongoing challenge. Strzegowski says it was an exciting time to work for a company that's been so pivotal in combating the pandemic. \"New teams were being created and projects are getting shifted around constantly,\" she says. \"Even though it may be a little chaotic to experience that growth, to be a part of it was amazing. It was definitely a great workplace.\" Strzegowski says there was a vast division of labor across the company, with teams working on every conceivable problem across numerous biotech projects, spanning vaccines and other drug therapies, to novel cures for rare diseases. \"Some of the biggest issues with our mRNA process is the high cost to manufacture and time it takes to produce,\" Strzegowski says. \"By reducing the cost and decreasing time we would be able to produce a lot more mRNA and be able to supply it at lower costs, which is super important when supplying to low income countries, or developing personalized cancer vaccines which can [cost] upwards of tens of thousands [of dollars] per treatment.\" The work, she says, is not exclusive to the COVID-19 vaccine. New methods and strategies for streamlining and refining production can be applied to the development of other therapies.
