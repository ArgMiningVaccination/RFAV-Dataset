It therefore covers a very broad range, from self-help programmes to professional care and from the sensible and worthwhile to the ridiculous. While some scientific evidence exists for or against some CAM therapies, for most there are key questions that are yet to be answered through well-designed studies, including whether these therapies are safe, whether they work for the diseases or medical conditions for which they are used, and whether the explanations proponents offer for them are correct. Some CAM therapies are considered to be [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), based on [magical thinking](/wiki/Magical_thinking) rather than evidence. The list of therapies included under CAM changes gradually. If and when CAM therapies that are proven to be safe and effective become adopted into conventional health care, they gradually cease to be considered CAM, since adoption and acceptance often take time.
