I left my corporate job to look after her and we appointed a yoga teacher for her. I had a passion for fitness & I practiced yoga consistently since I was a teenager. My mom's yoga teacher would see me practice yoga daily. I was also preparing for IELTS as I was planning for my double master's degree in New Zealand. My mom's yoga teacher was impressed with my dedication & discipline towards my [yoga practice](https://www.myyogateacher.com/) and advised me to do a Teachers Training Course from The Yoga Institute. Initially, I did not consider it as an option. But, as I witnessed the change in my mother's health and how Yoga worked wonders for her, I began to rethink my decision. All her medication had been stopped and she was living a healthy life. That's where I decided to join the Level 1 programme at The Yoga Institute in the year 2017. There are so many people who are unaware of the miracles yoga can do and I want to let everyone know that miracles do happen. The union of body & breath along with the deep relaxation at the end of class began to teach me how to switch off my overactive mind & connect to my inner self. As I started practicing meditation, it brought me closer to my real nature & I began to enjoy the silence within. As my respect for the practice grew, I enrolled for the advanced Level 2 Teachers Training Programme and I dropped my plan to study in New Zealand. Over the last few years my relationship with yoga has grown in multi-dimensional directions. It has enhanced my mental, spiritual, physical & [emotional well-being](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/). The attitude of gratitude is the highest Yoga. Yoga has brought a sense of deep gratitude towards everything big and small. I now find myself on a journey where learning is bliss & I love enhancing people's life in a positive way. The path of yoga is not a destination, it's a journey & it's one that I'm blessed to be taking.
