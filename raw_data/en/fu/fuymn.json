That's because some immunizations are given in the hospital, while others happen in the very first postnatal visits. Here are a few things you need to know about infant vaccines before your baby's due date. Immunizations are safe for babies Despite the many [myths surrounding vaccines](//www.whattoexpect.com/childrens-health/vaccine-myths/), countless studies have shown that immunizations are very safe for babies. For one, the ingredients are safe. Excluding the flu vaccine, no routine infant vaccines contain mercury, called thimerosal, a type of preservative that is eliminated rapidly by the body. Scientists have studied thimerosal extensively, and it has never caused any issues because it is eliminated so quickly. Even though multi-dose vials of the [flu vaccine](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/influenza-vaccine-flu-shot/) typically contain a very small amount of thimerosal, parents can request a thimerosal-free flu shot for infants. What's more, serious [side effects from vaccines](//www.whattoexpect.com/child-vaccinations/treating-side-effects.aspx) are rare. It's important to remember that vaccines have never \u2014 repeat, never \u2014 been linked to autism. The lone study that connected the two was retracted by the journal that published it \u2014 and the doctor responsible had his medical license revoked after he admitted he fudged the report's data. Vaccination myths Infant immunizations are given in the first two months Your baby's [recommended vaccine schedule](//www.whattoexpect.com/child-vaccinations/what-shots-to-get.aspx) starts at birth, when your newborn receives a vaccination for [hepatitis B (HepB)](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/hepatitis-b-vaccine/). At baby's 2-month well visit, he'll receive number of other essential immunizations, including [RV](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/rotavirus-vaccine/) (rotavirus), [DTaP](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/dtap-vaccine/) (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also [whooping cough](//www.whattoexpect.com/childrens-health-and-safety/whooping-cough-babies/)), [Hib](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/hib-vaccine/) (haemophilus influenzae type b), [PCV](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/pneumococcal-conjugate-pcv-vaccine/) (pneumococcal) and [IPV](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/polio-vaccine/) (polio) vaccines. Recommended Reading Most of these have at least one follow-up shot or oral dose within the first two years; to keep track, you may want to keep a copy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) [baby and child vaccine schedule](//www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf) handy. [[1]](javascript:void(0)) Don't forget, some immunizations [you get during pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/your-health/advice-on-flu-shot-tdap-vaccine-during-pregnancy/) also help protect your baby before and after birth. Two \u2014 the flu shot, offered during flu season, and the Tdap vaccine, given between weeks 27 and 36 of pregnancy \u2014 are recommended for all expecting women. [[2]](javascript:void(0)) The flu vaccine helps prevent dangerous complications while you're pregnant, while Tdap protects your baby from whooping cough \u2014 which is highly contagious and potentially deadly \u2014 in the months before the vaccine series begins. Getting a [COVID-19 booster during pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/covid19-booster-shot-pregnancy) also helps protect your baby. Babies aren't stressed out by getting shots Though no parent likes to see a baby cry, remember that the very temporary pain your baby feels from a shot amounts to infinitesimally less suffering than he'd experience if he came down with a vaccine-preventable disease like whooping cough or the measles. Research has shown that holding your baby and talking or singing during shots helps distract him; breastfeeding just before or after can soothe him and sometimes even help relieve pain. If you're still concerned, talk to your doctor about giving your baby a sugar solution beforehand or numbing solution after, both of which can also help ease discomfort. There are risks to falling behind on the schedule The CDC's vaccine schedule is recommended for a reason: It works. For some shots, more than one dose is required to build up full immunity; for others, immunity wanes with time. Skipping or delaying shots puts your baby at risk of getting sick from the illnesses they protect against starting early in your child's life. So be sure to stick to the schedule and attend all of your baby's postnatal follow-up appointments. Vaccines are free for children Vaccines are hands-down the least expensive and most effective way to protect your baby's health now and in the future. If your baby doesn't have insurance, or your insurance somehow doesn't cover vaccinations, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides vaccines at no cost to eligible kids under the age of 19 at participating doctor's offices, clinics and health departments. [[3]](javascript:void(0)) Vaccines save lives Most importantly, vaccines save lives by protecting children from preventable diseases that are especially dangerous in the first few months and years of life. And it's important that [everyone opts in](//www.whattoexpect.com/child-vaccinations/herd-immunity.aspx). Staying on top of your child's vaccination schedule is more important than ever right now. Experts have seen a drop in routine (but critical) vaccinations since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have serious consequences. Once your baby arrives, always [keep his well visits on the calendar](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/well-baby-visits-guide/), and call the pediatrician right away if your baby misses one of his scheduled vaccines so you can make a plan to get caught up.
