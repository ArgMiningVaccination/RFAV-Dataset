[ The Hill: Voters Support Abortion Rights In All Five States With Ballot Measures ](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3726347-voters-support-abortion-rights-in-all-five-states-with-ballot-measures/) Voters in California, Vermont and Michigan on Tuesday approved ballot measures enshrining abortion rights into their state constitutions, while those in traditional red states Montana and Kentucky rejected measures that would have restricted access to reproductive care. The votes signal strength to effort to support abortion rights after the Supreme Court in June ruled to overturn the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to the procedure.

It would criminalize health care providers who do not make every effort to save the life of an infant \"born during an attempted abortion\" or after labor or C-section.

(11/9) [ South Dakota Votes To Expand Medicaid Cover ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/south-dakota-votes-to-expand-medicaid-cover/) Forbes says a \"wide margin\" of South Dakotans voted to approve a ballot measure to extend Medicaid cover to over 40,000 low-income adults. Vox notes that this is now the seventh time in a row nationwide in which voters have approved such a measure. [ Forbes: Medicaid Expansion Wins In Red State South Dakota ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2022/11/09/medicaid-expansion-wins-in-red-state-south-dakota/) Voters in Republican-leaning South Dakota Tuesday approved a ballot measure to extend Medicaid benefits to more than 40,000 low-income adults. The vote by a wide margin of South Dakotans to expand Medicaid health insurance for low-income Americans under the Affordable Care Act is a political blow to Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, who opposed the ballot initiative. It's also a setback for Republicans generally given their past unsuccessful efforts with Donald Trump to try to repeal the health law, also known as Obamacare. The Medicaid expansion measure known in South Dakota as \"Constitutional Amendment D\" had 56% support compared to 44% opposed with 90% of precincts reporting by early Wednesday morning, state election data showed.

Voters said \"yes,\" though, to Proposition 31, a measure that bans most flavored tobacco products in the most populous state. [ AP: Californians Reject Measure To Alter Dialysis Clinic Rules ](https://apnews.com/article/health-california-dialysis-government-and-politics-993c2cce89a68b07eca20f400f8f8812) For the third time in three straight elections, California voters rejected a ballot measure that would have mandated major changes to the operations of dialysis clinics that provide life-saving care to 80,000 people with kidney failure. Proposition 29 failed after nearly 70% of Californians voted \"no\" in returns late Tuesday. The measure would have required a doctor, nurse practitioner or physicians' assistant to be present during treatment at the state's 600 outpatient dialysis facilities. (Weber, 11/9) [ Los Angeles Times: California Votes No On Prop. 29 For Dialysis Clinics Changes ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-08/2022-california-election-prop-29-vote-dialysis-clinic-results) Proposition 29 would have required dialysis clinics to have a doctor, nurse practitioner or physician assistant present while patients are receiving care at any of the state's 600 dialysis centers. Clinics also would have been required to disclose if a physician had ownership interest in a facility and to report patient infection data.

The move makes California by far the largest state to ban such products, which are already illegal in a smattering of smaller states, including Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. (Florko, 11/9) [ Los Angeles Times: Flavored Tobacco Banned In California As Prop. 31 Passes ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-08/2022-california-election-prop-31-ban-flavored-tobacco-results) California voters on Tuesday passed a ballot measure to uphold a 2020 law that banned the sale of most flavored tobacco products, giving anti-tobacco advocates an expected victory in a multiyear fight against the industry to mitigate a youth vaping crisis.

Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, two leading Republicans who also won reelection and like Newsom may run for president. ... Speaking to supporters in Sacramento with his wife and four children by his side, Newsom again drew contrasts between himself and DeSantis and Abbot, saying he is \"resolved to do more to advance that cause of freedom.\" \"We have governors that won their reelections tonight in other states that are banning books, that are banning speech, that are banning abortion, and here we are in California moving in a completely different direction,\" Newsom said. \"That's a deep point of pride.\" (Beam, 11/9) [ Voters Have Their Say On Medical Debt, Pot, Mushrooms, Human Rights, More ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/voters-have-their-say-on-medical-debt-pot-mushrooms-human-rights-more/) In Arizona, voters overwhelmingly voted to decrease interest rates on medical debt. In Massachusetts, dental costs were front and center. In Pennsylvania, former heart surgeon and TV celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican, lost his bid for governor. [ Tucson.com: Arizona Prop 209 To Decrease Interest Rates On Medical Debt Likely To Pass ](https://tucson.com/news/election/arizona-prop-209-to-decrease-interest-rates-on-medical-debt-likely-to-pass/article_b06e03b4-5bc0-11ed-adf9-57126d9eb1a6.html) The ballot proposition to decrease interest rates on medical debt is leading with 75% voter approval as of Tuesday night, according to unofficial election results from the Arizona Secretary of State's office. If passed, Proposition 209 would reduce the maximum interest rates on medical debt from 10% to 3% annually. The measure would make certain assets exempt from debt collection, such as homes, household items, cars and bank accounts.

The Medical Loss Ratios for Dental Insurance Plans Initiative will soon force dental insurers to spend at least 83% of premiums on dental services, versus administrative or other overhead costs, or refund the excess to beneficiaries.

The ballot initiative would decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms for those 21 and older and create state-regulated \"healing centers\" where participants can experience the drug under the supervision of a licensed \"facilitator.\" The measure would establish a regulated system for using substances like psilocybin and psilocin, the hallucinogenic chemicals found in some mushrooms. It also would allow private personal use of the drugs.

The results mean that 21 states have now approved marijuana's recreational use. Arkansas and North Dakota voters rejected legalization proposals in Tuesday's elections. A similar initiative went before voters in South Dakota, but early Wednesday it was too early to call. (DeMillo, 11/9) On health care as a human right in Oregon \u2014 [ AP: Oregon Gun Control, Health Care Measures Too Early To Call ](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-health-oregon-gun-politics-government-and-b25a1e61055bec77898a5251c1187cc8) Oregon voters appeared closely divided late Tuesday on measures that would add permitting and training requirements for new gun buyers and amend the state's constitution to explicitly declare affordable health care a human right. With roughly 40% of the vote counted in the vote-by-mail state, the outcomes of both races were too early to call.

Talevski, the Supreme Court justices appeared reluctant to side with the defendants who argued that Medicaid recipients did not have the right to sue for benefits. The court ruling in favor would largely gut rights within safety net programs like Medicaid and CHIP. [ Axios: SCOTUS Seems Unlikely To Gut Suing Rights Of Medicaid Recipients ](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/09/scotus-seems-unlikely-to-gut-medicaid-recipient) Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared unsympathetic toward an effort to bar Medicaid beneficiaries from suing for benefits the safety net program promises.

Private plans also cap out-of-pocket expenses at $8,300 for 2023 coverage while traditional Medicare does not unless a person purchases supplemental coverage.
