Christian Science, or the Church of Christ, Scientist, is a sect of Christianity that believes in the full and healing power of the Christian God. Founded by a Boston woman named Mary Baker Eddy in the mid-1800s, Christian Scientists believe that prayer and faith in God is the key to healing illness and have limited contact with doctors. They do not use modern medicine but will sometimes get vaccinations or any sort of emergency treatment for serious injuries. However, in the case of illness, they will go to religious leaders for spiritual treatment. They are headquartered at the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was injured in 1866. She made a full recovery that she attributed to turning to God and the healing power of religion. As she preached the healing powers of God, she also became a religious leader and healer. She began to publish books on her philosophy of healing, most notably Science and Health with Key to Scriptures, and officially founded the Church of Christ, Scientist in 1879. She attempted to get her work published in magazines, but having little luck, went on to found many magazines of her own, most famously The Christian Science Monitor. Much like other Christian denominations, there is not always a one-to-one relationship with God. While Christian Scientists believe that everyone can access God from prayer and heal accordingly, there are members called Christian Science practitioners who act as a guide through the journey of prayer. They act almost as a combination of priest and doctor, as they offer spiritual guidance and practical assistance with prayer. Christian Science is less hierarchical than other Christian sects. Beyond Mary Baker Eddy's work as founder, there is no clergy. The services for members are led by readers rather than priests or pastors, and selections for readings are picked by those readers. Because things are more decentralized, Christian Scientists use reading rooms as places of worship. Set up like a bookstore, the reading rooms are spaces for independent prayer and learning. While for specific ailments people may use a practitioner, the religion is based on a personal connection to God, which is supported by the accessibility of reading rooms. While healing in bed, Mary Baker Eddy came to the conclusion that the physical world is an illusion and the spiritual world is the true world. Under this belief, illness or injury does not exist in the spiritual world and is therefore false. To truly heal, prayer and faith in the spiritual world are required, rather than the false medicine of the physical world. When she healed from her severe injuries, she attributed it to prayer, acceptance of God, and understanding of the material vs. physical worlds. Christian Science beliefs are built on the laws of God as Mary Baker Eddy interpreted them. To them, illness is a mental error rather than a health problem, and those mental errors can only be overcome by prayer and belief in the laws of God. Christian Scientists don't use traditional forms of medicine but do go to doctors for injuries and correctional practices, like dentists or optometrists. Christian Science differs from mainstream Christianity in a couple of key ways. Christianity features the belief in Heaven and Hell, where behaviors while on Earth, and acceptance of Jesus as the savior will determine where one goes when one dies. Heaven, as God's kingdom, is seen as just as real as life on Earth. Mary Baker Eddy, however, believed that our material world is false, and God's spiritual world is the only reality. Most sects of Christianity also rely on a hierarchy within the Church, but Christian Science flattens the hierarchy, allowing direct communion with God on an individual level. Christians, in general, are okay with modern medicine, some even seeing medical developments as actions of God. However, Christian Scientists do still celebrate traditional Christian holidays like Christmas. Through the Christian Scientist lens, however, Jesus' birth on Earth is the embodiment of God's healing power in the spiritual world. Christian Scientists reflect on the healing power demonstrated by God instead of focusing on material goods traditionally given at Christmas. The Christian Science Monitor began as one of Mary Baker Eddy's numerous publications and is based in Boston along with the headquarters of the church. It is not a religious newspaper despite being published and funded by the Church of Christ, Scientist. It does not espouse its beliefs, instead taking a centrist position on major world events. They were the first major newspaper to fully transition to an online news site, and it's won several Pulitzer Prizes for its reporting. The Christian Science Monitor describes itself as \"reflecting how founder Mary Baker Eddy described its object as 'to injure no man but to bless all mankind.'\" While they do not report based on Eddy's theological ideals, they hold the more secular ideals of Christian Science as a guiding tenet. Christian Science is a sect of Christianity also known as The Church of Christ, Scientist. The church was founded by Mary Baker Eddy in mid-1800s Boston when she was recovering from debilitating injuries. While studying theology during her bedrest, she began to believe in the full healing power of God, which she believed ultimately led to her recovery. She also came to the conclusion that the physical world is an illusion and the only reality is the truth of God or the spiritual world. As such, all illness experienced by the human body is not physical fact but moral failure. Christian Scientists are most famous for this belief, which leads them to choose prayer and spiritual healing over modern medicine. Christian Scientists do still see doctors for injuries or necessary modifications like eyeglasses but believe that faith in the spiritual world will heal the soul, and by extension, the body. The Church of Christ, Scientist, is seen as a fringe sect of Christianity, holding different values than the other, mainstream sects. There are differences in worship structures as well, as Christian Scientists do not have priests or traditional clergy hierarchies. There are practitioners who are more like spiritual healers who help guide worshipers through prayer. In lieu of confessions or other clerical interventions, Christian Scientists use reading rooms or quiet spaces for individuals to get in touch with God on an individual level. Their reliance on prayer and dismissal of the physical world makes them a more insular community. \"The Christian Science Monitor\", a secular newspaper funded by the church, is their most accessible output in part due to the lack of religious affiliation.

However, when other churches are formed in other areas, they follow a numerical naming system, starting with the First Church of Christ, Scientist, and continuing on with the second or third. First Church of Christs scientists are Christian Scientists. Christian Science is a sect of Christianity. While there are many differences, like the lack of clergy and hierarchy, Christian Science is still based upon the Christian Bible and God. Christian Scientists do not believe in medical treatment. They will get vaccines and other modern inventions, like eyeglasses, but turn to prayer and spiritual healing when illness arises. Christian Scientists celebrate Christmas with reflection instead of material goods. They see Christmas as the day that God sent down his healing power in the form of Jesus Christ and reflect on the spiritual world accordingly. Already a member?
