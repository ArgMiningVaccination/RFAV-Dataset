Introduction This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) describes testing inactivated rabies vaccines for relative potency (RP) . This method is in support of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) , section 113.209(b)(1) . The method uses immunized mice to measure protection following a challenge with challenge virus standard (CVS) . The RP is determined by comparing the Test Vaccine against a standardized reference vaccine . This SAM is based on the standard National Institutes of Health (NIH) test method as described in Laboratory Techniques in Rabies , fourth edition, edited by F. X. Meslin, M. M. Kaplan, and H. Koprowski, 1996, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland. 2.

Preparation for the Test 3.1 Personnel qualifications/training Personnel must have experience in laboratory dilution techniques, the handling and discarding of human pathogens, and the handling and inoculation of mice. 3.2 Preparation of CF -1 female test mice 3.2.1 Minimally, m ice are housed in a BL -2 animal room s. 3.2.2 On the day of first vaccination , mice are weighed in groups of 16 (VRRV, test vaccine) and 10 (back titration) and must weigh between 13 and 20 grams. 3.2.3 For each Test Vaccine, 5 groups of 16 mice are recommended . Mice are housed in cages labeled with the Test V accine identification and dilution. 3.2.4 For the VRRV, 4 or 5 groups of 16 mice are recommended . Mice are housed in cage s labeled with the VRRV and dilution. 3.2.5 For the CVS Back Titration, 4 groups of 10 mice are recommended . Mice are housed in cages labeled with the CVS Back Titration and dilution . These mice are reserved until the day of CVS challenge. 3.3 Preparation of reagents/control procedures 3.3.1 On the day of initia l vaccination, reconstitute the VRRV with sterile D I as described on the CVB Reagent Data Sheet. 1. Prepare test dilutions of the VRRV in NIH PBS as described on the CVB Reagent D ata Sheet. a. Maintain the VRRV dilution s on ice until mice are inoculated . The diluted VRRV is used within 3 h ours of preparation. b. Freeze the remaining reconstituted VRRV in the original container at -70\u00b0\u00b1 5\u00b0C for use in preparing t he second vaccination series . Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 308.06 Testing Protocol Page 6 of 12 Supplemental Assay Method for Potency Testing of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Mice Using the National Institutes of Health Test 2. Preparation of VRRV for the second vaccination (7 \u00b1 1 days post inoculation ) a. Rapidly thaw the frozen , reconstituted VRRV in a 36\u00b0\u00b1 2\u00b0C water bath or at room temperature . b. Prepare test dilutions of VRRV as described in the Reagent Data Sheet and once prepared , maintain the dilutions on ice until mice are inoculated. The diluted VRRV is used within 3 hours of preparation. 3.3.2 Preparation of the sample The initial dilution of a Test Vaccine is based on the dilution determined in 5 replicate NIH tests at the time of the initiation of the host animal efficacy trial. The starting dilution should optimally protect 85 -100% of vaccinates and this dilution shall be stated in Part V of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) approved Outline of Production . Starting with the initial dilution , prepare a set of five 5 -fold serial dilutions for each Test Vaccine . 3.3.3 Preparation of Working CVS on the day of challenge The stock CVS is a concentrated biological reagent that is diluted to a lower concentration for use. Stock reagents are used to save preparation time, conserve materials, reduce storage space, and improve the accuracy and stability. Working CVS is a dilution of the stock reagent prepared and administered to test mice by the intracranial (IC) route. 1. Rapidly thaw stock CVS in a 36\u00b0\u00b1 2\u00b0C water bath. 2. Prepare test dilutions of the stock CVS in CVS diluent as described on CVB R eagent Data Sheet. The working CVS will contain 12 50% lethal dose (LD 50)/0.03 mL. 3. The Working CVS is maintained on ice until inoculat ion into mice . The Working CVS is administered within 3 h ours of preparation. 4. Preparation of CVS Back Titration on the day of challenge a. Prepare three 10-fold serial dilutions from the working CVS . b. The CVS Back Titration is maintained on ice until mice are inoculated . The CVS Back Titration is administered within 3 h ours of prepa ration. Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 308.06 Testing Protocol Page 7 of 12 Supplemental Assay Method for Potency Testing of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Mice Using the National Institutes of Health Test 4. Performance of the Test 4.1 Fill a 1-3 mL syringe with a 23-26-gauge x \u00bd to 5/8-inch needle with diluted Test Vaccine or VRRV . 4.2 Beginning with the most dilute preparation, inoculate 0.5 m L of assigned vaccine dilution into each of 16 mice/dilution by the intraperitoneal (IP) route . Repeat for each dilution of a Test Vaccine and the VRRV using a new group of 16 mice caged according to dilution . (After all animals have been vaccinated, dispose of residual dilutions of the Test Vaccines and VRRV .) 4.3 At 7 \u00b1 1 days post inoculation , revaccinate animals as described above. 4.4 At 14 \u00b1 1 days post-vaccination , all vaccinated mice (vaccine and VRRV) are administered 0.03 m L of working CVS intracerebrally (IC) , using a 0.5 - 1.0-mL syringe with a 26 -28 gauge x 3/8 - \u00bd inch needle. The working dilution of CVS is inoculated through the frontal bone, midway between the right eye and the midline. (Optional: mice may be anesthetized using a rodent anesthesia machine containing isoflu rane and an induction chamber to scavenge residual anesthesia prior to challenge .) 4.5 The CVS Back Titration is administered IC to the remaining four groups of 10 back-titration mice using a new syringe and needle . Each of the four dilutions are administered to 10 mice per dilution ; beginning with the most dilute concentration of the CVS through the most concentrated dilution of the CVS . The same syringe and needle may be used if starting with the most dilute followed by successively more concentrated dilutions. The CVS Back Titratio n is not administered until all the vaccinated mice have been challenged. 4.6 Animal O bservations : 4.6.1 Animals are observed daily for 14 days post challenge . Deaths or animals humanely euthanized are recorded . 4.6.2 Mice dying prior to or on day 5 post-challenge are considered nonspecific deaths . Nonspecific deaths are not used in calculating the 50% effective dose (ED 50) of the Test Vaccine or VRRV. Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 308.06 Testing Protocol Page 8 of 12 Supplemental Assay Method for Potency Testing of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Mice Using the National Institutes of Health Test 4.6.3 The following five disease stages can be recognized in mice infected with rabies virus (Bruckner et al. 2003 ): Stage 1: Ruffled fur and hunched back indicate the first signs of clinical disease . These are general signs of illness in mice and can be observed for many other diseases . Therefore, these clinical signs in Stage 1 are not specific indicators for rabies, but do reflect that the animal is unwell and that its welfare is compromised. Stage 2: Slow or circular movements . During Stage 2, animals lose their alertness . They walk more slowly than usual ; and if observed carefully , show slow circling movements , mainly in one direction . These are the first clinical indicators of neurological disorder. Stage 3 : Shaky movements, trembling and convulsions . In Stage 3 the neurological signs become increasingly obvious, with trembling and shaky movement s and convulsions . By this time there is marked loss of body weight . This stage with severe and unequivocal clinical signs, clearly indicates rabies infection. Stage 4: Signs of paralysis . Lameness and paresis (partial paralysis) , usuall y of the hind legs, are clear indicators of progressive infection with rabies and is soon followed by complete paralysis . The animals become dehydrated. Stage 5 : Moribund animals . In Stage 5, a nimals become moribund . They can be seen to be prostrate and r ecumbent, and they obviously do not eat or drink; yet they may survive for 1 o r 2 more days. 4.6.4 Animals exhibiting Stage 3 or greater disease signs must be humanely euthanized . Deaths occurring 6 or more days post -challenge and euthanized animals are considered as deaths caused by the CVS challenge (9 CFR 117.4 and CVB Notice No. 12-12). Mice surviv ing the 14 -day post challenge observation period are euthanized at the conclusion of the test. 4.6.5 Similar definitions should be incorporated into non-codified potency and safety tests and efficacy study protocols. Proposed endpoints will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. 4.7 The ED 50 of each Test Vaccine , VRRV, and the LD 50 of the CVS are determined by the method of Spearman -K\u00e4rber as referenced in the fourth edition of the WHO, Laboratory Techniques in Rabies . Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 308.06 Testing Protocol Page 9 of 12 Supplemental Assay Method for Potency Testing of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Mice Using the National Institutes of Health Test 4.8 The relative potency (RP) of the Test Vaccine (TV) is determined by the formula: RP = reciprocal ED 50 of TV X dose of T V reciprocal ED 50 of VRRV dose of VRRV ED 50 of TV = 1:90 ED 50 of VRRV = 1:70 90/70 = 1.29 RP/m L 4.9 The RP value may be expressed in international units (IU) by multiplying the RP by the IU/ml of the VRRV . For a VRRV with a known value of 1.0 IU/m L, in the above example: 1.29 X 1.0 IU/m L = 1.29 IU/m L 5. Interpretation of the Test Results 5.1 For a valid test: 5.1.1 At least 70% of the mice receiving the most concentrated dilutions of VRRV and the Test Vaccine must survive (e.g. , 11 out of 16 mice). 5.1.2 At least 70% of the mice receiving the least concentrated dilution of VRRV and the Test Vaccine must die (e.g. , 11 out of 16 mice). 5.1.3 For a valid challenge , the CVS back titration must be 12 LD 50/0.03 mL . 5.1.4 If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST and may be retested without prejudice. 5.2 The minimum RP value for a satisfactory Test Vaccine is determined by the results of the host animal immunogenicity serial as required by the 9 CFR 113.209 and contained in an APHIS filed Outline of Production. If the validity requirements are met and the Test Vaccine meets or exceed s the minimum release RP value the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY . 5.3 If the Test Vaccine does not meet the minimum RP value contained in an APHIS filed Outline of Production, as determined from the initial NIH test, the Test Vaccine may be retested. If the Test Vaccine is retested, 2 independent NIH tests shall be conducted. A geomet ric mean RP of all 3 retests is used to evaluate the Test Vaccine. Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 308.06 Testing Protocol Page 10 of 12 Supplemental Assay Method for Potency Testing of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Mice Using the National Institutes of Health Test If the Test Vaccine is not retested by or if the geometric mean RP value of the initial test and retests is below the minimum release RP value, the Test Vaccine is UNSATISFACTORY . If the geometric mean RP value of the initial test and retests meets or exceeds the minimum release , the serial is SATISFACTORY . 6.
