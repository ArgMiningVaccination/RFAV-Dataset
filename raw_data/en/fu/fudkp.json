Many healthcare providers, students, patients and families have been inquiring about access to integrative medicine as a part of their healthcare services. To address this need, we held the first Integrative Medicine and Mental Health conference in 2016 at UCLA. The second conference in 2017 focused on the \"Healing Power of Breath in Clinical Practice and Mass Disasters,\" and featured Drs. Patricia Gerbarg and Richard Brown. We also participated in the training of 250 physicians located in Los Angeles County in different integrative medicine practices, such as deep breathing, acupressure, movement, art therapy and several other modalities. We have future plans to extend this to the wellness program for employees of the Los Angeles County Department of Health. Today, increasing numbers of aging baby boomers and seniors are seeking holistic and natural therapies for healing. There's a growing interest in refashioning the traditional concept of healing the body into healing the whole person, including mind, body, and spirit. The brain is an important target for healing, as evidenced from our recently published study showing the effectiveness of yoga compared with memory training in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. We also demonstrated that brief (15 minutes per day) yogic meditation n dementia caregivers can help reduce stress, improve mental health and cognition, and reverse inflammation and cellular aging related to chronic stress. I have been invited to present these results at the annual Mind & Life Institute at the residence of the HH Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India in October 2017. Integrative Medicine combines modern medical approaches to health with age-old therapies from around the world, such as acupuncture and naturopathic approaches; mind-body methods such as yoga, tai chi, meditation, biofeedback and relaxation therapies; and expressive art therapies. By using complementary practices, integrative medicine practitioners are better able to satisfy the increasing demand in a variety of healing techniques to relieve suffering, reduce stress, and maintain the well-being of patients and their families. Using these techniques also empowers those who seek to gain control over their lives and make their own conscious healthcare decisions. It's exciting to watch these changes in our current healthcare system unfold as patients and families choose to enhance their own healing through these powerful practices. My current projects on mind-body therapies include \"Tai chi for treatment of geriatric depression\" and \"Mindful-Calm meditation for fear-conditioning in undergraduate students.\" We are planning our 2018 Integrative Mental Health conference to focus on the \"Healing Power of Sound,\" which will include music therapy, sound-bath, chanting, dance, and music-based practices from around the world. I am certainly enjoying this journey, and am grateful for the support from the UCLA Longevity Center and the UCLA Department of Psychiatry. From the Director www.longevity.ucla.edu (310) 794-0676 2This spring, the UCLA Longevity Center and the Lifespan Learning Institute hosted more than 700 people on campus for a conference entitled, \"Mind, Consciousness, and the Cultivation of Well- Being: Transformation Through the Lifespan.\" Many of us who attended learned about some of the science-based strategies for reducing stress. The human brain has evolved to cope with stress. When a predator threatened our ancient ancestors, the ensuing acute stress elicited a fight-or-flight response, causing a spike of cortisol and other stress hormones to circulate throughout the body and the brain. The resulting increase in heart rate and mental acuity provided a survival advantage, and those ancient neural pathways are still programmed into our brains today. But those hardwired responses to acute stress are no longer necessary to survive on a daily basis. Today when we experience chronic elevations of stress hormones, it can actually damage brain cells, impair memory, worsen mood, and increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Acute stress also shifts brain activity from the frontal lobe (thinking brain) to the amygdala (emotional brain). This shift allows for quick responses to perceived threats and distracts us from any complex problem solving - a good reason why we shouldn't make important decisions while under acute stress. When research scientists inject cortisol into human volunteers, they observe temporary declines in learning and memory. Stress also increases our risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, which can lead to impaired memory from small strokes in the brain. Investigators at Rochester University recently reported on laboratory mice confined to small spaces for three weeks to create a temporarily stressful environment. They found that the stress altered brain anatomy in regions that control anxiety and depression. In particular, certain areas of the amygdala - the brain's emotional control center - shrank, while other areas lost branches to distant brain regions, thus weakening connections and the brain's ability to respond normally to stress. Chronic stress can lead to anxiety and depression, and when serious, these and other mental disorders require medical treatment. However, many everyday strategies can help us to cope better with our daily stress so we can live better longer. Here are a few to keep in mind: Laugh. Laughter offers both mental and physical benefits by lifting mood and allowing us to gain distance and perspective on our troubles. Laughter also offers such physical benefits as increased oxygen to the heart, lungs, and muscles; reduced pain; and the release of mood-elevating endorphins in the brain. It also boosts the immune system, improving our ability to fight infections and some serious illnesses. Meditate. The stress-busting and mood-enhancing benefits of different forms of meditation can protect the brain's hippocampal memory centers from shrinking and strengthen neural connections between different memory areas throughout the brain. Whether you concentrate on a single word or mantra, or focus your attention on your breathing or other sensations, spending just ten minutes each day will provide noticeable benefits. Try Tai Chi or Yoga. Research on yoga shows that it can relieve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. It can also boost brain health by lowering brain inflammation. Tai chi promotes relaxation and balance and has been shown to bolster immune function and improve energy levels, mood and symptoms of pain. Exercise. You don't have to become a professional athlete to improve your mental well-being - just 20 minutes of brisk walking each day can bring about significant stress-lowering benefits. Many people like to exercise with friends or get involved in competitive sports. The important thing is to find a convenient routine that works for you and that you enjoy so you keep it up for long-term health benefits. Sleep W ell. Picking a regular sleep time is important for setting your daily sleep rhythm and training your brain to know when it is time to sleep. Avoiding daytime naps and getting plenty of exercise during the day makes it easier to get to sleep and stay asleep throughout the night. Also, limiting evening liquids and caffeine will help you remain in bed through the night. Stay Positive. Optimists report lower stress levels as well as fewer physical and emotional difficulties compared with pessimists. People with a positive outlook also manage stress better and are less likely to get depressed. The brain's frontal and temporal lobes control many optimistic feelings, and MRI studies suggest that an optimistic person's brain wiring helps them cope well with adversity. DR. GARY SMALL Director, UCLA Longevity Center Jackie Martinez 3 (310) 794-0676 www.longevity.ucla.edu The Longevity Center welcomes Jackie Martinez to the team as the new Business Development Manager.

You can reach Jackie at 310-825-8761 or at jacquelinemartinez@mednet.ucla.edu. We are pleased to introduce a new staff member, Melissa Groller, to the UCLA Longevity Center. Melissa will be serving as the new program coordinator for the Senior Scholar's program. She has a background in higher education recruitment and previously served as a college admissions counselor and academic advisor at Palm Beach Atlantic University. Melissa brings three years of experience assisting students through the college enrollment process. She continues to serve her east coast alma mater as a part- time recruiter, representing the institution at various college fairs and community events in the Los Angeles area. She is passionate about sharing her joy for education, supporting students and providing academic tools. We look forward to working with Melissa and appreciate her enthusiasm for education. We believe Melissa's background and talents will help the Senior Scholars Program continue to grow. \"As I try to expand the Longevity Center's footprint, I am driven by care and compassion to provide community access to our memory programs with our Brain Trainer Certification Program. Our mission of living better longer is applicable on a global scale, and we aim to penetrate these domestic and international markets.\" \"I am thrilled to work with the Senior Scholars Program. It is a tremendous opportunity to assist our Scholars in this unique, life-enhancing program where they are able to expand their minds in an intergenerational setting.\"Spotlight on Melissa Groller www.longevity.ucla.edu (310) 794-0676 4T om was a 71 year-old man who had been diagnosed with lung cancer last year. He had surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy, which he found very draining. Fortunately, Tom was told that the cancer was in remission, and he was looking forward to getting on with his life and retirement. However, he noticed in the months after chemotherapy had ended that he wasn't feeling as \"sharp\" mentally and was having difficulty remembering things. Tom even started to worry that he was getting Alzheimer's disease. Developing cognitive problems after cancer and cancer treatment, as Tom did, is not uncommon - a recent survey reported that almost half of cancer survivors experienced some kind of cognitive change after treatment. Many people experience fatigue or feel less \"sharp\" during treatments, but sometimes these problems stick around in the months and years after treatment is over, and many are not aware that this could happen. For older adults like Tom, who may already be at greater risk for cognitive decline due to the effects of normal aging, medical conditions, and other risk factors, the possible cognitive effects of cancer treatments may be particularly worrisome. While research is still emerging on this important topic, it seems that some, but not all, older cancer survivors experience mild to moderate cognitive decline after treatment for cancer, and it's not entirely clear why some may be at greater risk than others. Some of the most common difficulties include memory problems, feeling \"slower\" mentally, having trouble coming up with the right word, remembering names, and maintaining focus or feeling \"scattered.\" These problems can be frightening, and it is important to know that if a cancer survivor does develop cognitive problems, it does not necessarily mean that the person is developing Alzheimer's disease or another type of neurodegenerative disease. If you are experiencing problems with your memory or other abilities after cancer treatment, the first step is to let your doctor know. Sometimes, it's just a matter of time and allowing yourself to recover from these treatments before the cognitive problems improve. We also know that there are issues that can be treated that may help improve cognition, such as sleep problems and depression or anxiety, and talking to your doctor about treating these issues can help. Your doctor may also recommend neuropsychological testing to get a clearer understanding of the nature and severity of any cognitive symptoms. Lifestyle choices may also be helpful in improving mild cognitive difficulties. These may include getting regular exercise and good nutrition, as well as simplifying or better organizing days and chores to avoid \"overload.\" Cognitive rehabilitation treatment, which teaches specific methods to compensate for memory and other cognitive difficiulties, also has been shown to benefit cancer survivors with these issues. Some of the information in this article was adapted from the Cognitive Rehabilitation Committee through the ACRM Cancer Rehabilitation Task Force publication, Cancer-Related Cognitive Changes, in press.Cognitive Decline after Cancer By Kathleen Van Dyk, Ph.D. Community Meeting 5 (310) 794-0676 www.longevity.ucla.eduDynia & Vicente Honrubia Interview Series: Interview conducted by Erin Der-McLeod & Michelle Moreno Written by Erin Der-McLeod Longevity Center Participant Spotlight: The Educated Pair - A Doctor and a Scholar In the early 1960s, a doctor from Spain and a graduate student of history from Puerto Rico met at the University of Chicago. Their life together has taken them from Chicago to New York, to Puerto Rico, to Spain, back to New York, to Tennessee, and finally Los Angeles. Throughout their journey, education has been a common thread. Dr. Vicente Honrubia grew up in Valencia, Spain. He studied medicine at a university in Valencia and at the University of Madrid. Dynia was born in Puerto Rico and spent part of her childhood in New York City. She attended college at the University of Puerto Rico. Bright scholars, they both received fellowships to study at the University of Chicago, where Vicente wanted to learn about the history of Spain because when he was growing up during the Franco dictatorship, information was censored. A mutual friend at the university introduced him to Dynia. Busy with her own graduate studies, Dynia recalls, \"I was really not interested in teaching anyone because I had my own things to do... I still haven't taught him about the history of Spain.\" Nevertheless, after their introduction Vicente reflects, \"thankfully, I met this lady, and was hooked.\" Life in Los Angeles The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1969, when Dr. Honrubia took a job at UCLA. As a leading otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist), he took care of patients, conducted research, and served as a faculty member at the medical school. He focused his career on research, and he received numerous grants from the National Institutes of Health. Among his many accomplishments, he served as the Director of the Victor Goodhill Ear Center at UCLA School of Medicine. He also co-wrote the seminal book, Clinical Neurophysiology of the Vestibular System, which is now in its 4 th Edition. Renowned for his work, there is a plaza named after him in the municipality of Yatova, Valencia, Spain, called Plaza Doctor Vicente Honrubia. While Vicente worked at UCLA, Dynia reared their two boys. Both sons followed in their father's footsteps and attended UCLA School of Medicine. When their sons were grown, Dynia decided to pursue a teaching credential at Cal State Los Angeles. During her first year, she taught high school Spanish, but she discovered her true passion was teaching kindergarten. She says she loved teaching the small children because of their enthusiasm for learning. www.longevity.ucla.edu (310) 794-0676 6Now, both in retirement, the Honrubias continue to seek new learning opportunities. With a weekly water aerobics class, balance class and tai chi in the park, the couple stay physically active. They often attend special lectures throughout the UCLA campus and are taking piano lessons. Dynia took classes as a child, noting \"I was better when I was seven.\" For Vicente, it is a new opportunity that allows him to fulfill a childhood desire to play an instrument. He recalls that as a child, he spent summers in his mother's hometown, where there was a band class for local children. Many of his friends were in the band, but because he did not live there year-round, the teacher would not let him join the music classes. As a result, he very much enjoys the piano lessons that he gets to take now. Continued Learning at the Longevity Center In addition to their fitness and piano classes, the Honrubias have participated in many of the programs that the Longevity Center offers. They were introduced to the Longevity Center by their doctor, who told them about Brain Boot Camp, the Center's three-hour session that provides an overview on how memory changes, strategies to improve everyday memory challenges, methods for remembering names and faces, and take-homes for continuing to reinforce memory strategies. After completing their Brain Boot Camp session and all the take-home exercises, they wanted to learn more. The Longevity Center's Dr. Karen Miller suggested that they attend Memory Care, an on-going weekly program that helps families with memory challenges. As a participant, Vicente enjoys the diversity of activities that occur and the social interaction with psychology graduate students who help lead the program. \"You have on one side the students who are learning to deal with patients...for patients, the therapy is fun because the students are genuinely interested in what you do,\" he said. He also notes that the on-going basis of the program is important. \"It's not the merit of one class. It's the sequence. The whole experience is what really counts.\" Dynia likes the group of people in the program, getting to meet with other families with similar challenges, and learning about the brain because it is a subject she did not know much about before. During one of their visits to the Longevity Center, Dynia also noticed a flyer for Senior Scholars, the Center's program for people fifty and over to audit undergraduate classes at UCLA. It was a happy coincidence because she had learned about the program a few years prior from a UCLA student. At the time, she was interested in the program, but she was still working. After she saw the flyer, she signed up for her first class, Language and Music. Over the past two years, she has taken several courses, many in the anthropology department. She says her favorite class was in social anthropology, Society and Culture. Taking classes in anthropology has allowed her to study a subject she had not studied previously. She also enjoys meeting the undergraduate students in her classes. \"It's fun. One kid told me last week that I was very cool,\" she reflected fondly. The Honrubias have traveled and lived in many places, but they say they feel fortunate to live near UCLA. The opportunity to come to campus for Longevity Center programs and other activities like fitness classes and special lectures, helps them maintain the active lifestyle they enjoy and contributes to their longevity. The Honrubias would like to thank Dr. Small, Dr. Miller, and the staff for making their path easier.7 (310) 794-0676 www.longevity.ucla.eduResearch Studies The UCLA Late-Life Mood, Stress and Wellness Program in the Geriatric Psychiatry Division is conducting a 6-month research study involving 12 weekly 60 minute session of either a health and education wellness class or a Tai Chi class.

Neuroscience research presentations showcased the efficacy of mind- body integrative techniques, and experts provided experiential immersions for the audience. Some of the important topics discussed included stress and depression; self-compassion and self-esteem; clinical applications of mindfulness; brain training; and how to make healthy choices. The Longevity Center would like to thank all of the outstanding presenters for making this educational event truly memorable. We would also like to extend our deepest gratitude to our partners at Lifespan Learning Institute - Marion Solomon, Matthew Solomon, Bonnie Goldstein, and Dr. Dan Siegel - for inviting us to collaborate with this esteemed group. 9 (310) 794-0676 www.longevity.ucla.edu Deepak Chopra Menas Kafatos Gary Small Jack Kornfield Daniel Siegel Judson Brewer Elissa Epel Shari Geller Bonnie Goldstein Amishi Jha Helen Lavretsky Kristin Neff Pat Ogden Shauna Shapiro Marion Solomon Rudolph Tanzi Elisha Goldstein Latest on Research Strenuous Exercise May Dampen Libido in Men Previous research has shown that women who exercise too much may experience hormone imbalances that can impair menstruation and sex drive. A new study indicates that too much exercise in men may affect their sex drive. Investigators at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill studied approximately 1,100 active adult men, and those who reported moderate or high sex drives also reported exercise routines that were moderate or light. The findings did not confirm whether exercise caused sex drive to diminish or whether low libido or low sexual activity lead to greater intensity of exercise. Depression is Leading Cause of Disability at Any Age Depression is a major public health challenge throughout the world. Women, young people and the elderly may be at particular risk. The World Health Organization recently reported that depression affects four percent of the population or an estimated 322 million people, which is close to a 20 percent rise compared to the numbers a decade ago. This increase may be due in part to our aging population. The apathy and low energy associated with depression accounts for more than $1 trillion in global economic losses due to sufferers' inability to work and cope with life. According to Dr. Dan Chisholm of WHO's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, \"Depression is the single largest contributor to years lived with disability. So it's the top cause of disability in the world today.\" Probiotics Benefit Alzheimer's Symptoms Probiotics are microorganisms or bacteria that are ingested to promote health. Yogurt, pickles, and many other popular foods have probiotic properties that promote digestion. Recent research has been exploring other potential benefits of probiotics. In February 2017, an article appeared in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience showing that Alzheimer's patients who consumed a probiotic milk for 12 weeks improved their cognitive abilities compared with a control group that consumed milk without probiotics. The group receiving the probiotic also had improved measures of inflammation and fat levels in the blood. These findings suggest that improvements in metabolic function from probiotics could influence memory abilities. Although only 52 patients completed the study, the results are promising and deserve further exploration. Obesity Linked to Stress Hormone New research suggests that lowering your stress may help you to lose weight. Scientists at the University College London reported on levels of stress and body weight in a sample of more than 2,500 research volunteers age 55 and older who were enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. They found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol were significantly associated with increased waist circumference and higher body mass index, a ratio of height to weight that indicates presence of obesity or overweight. The authors concluded that their results provide support the idea that chronic stress leads to a greater risk for obesity. Weekend Workouts Associated with Greater Life Expectancy Some of us are too busy during the week to get enough exercise so we focus our workouts on the weekend. A new study suggests that people who compress their exercise into regular but extensive weekend sessions enjoy the same longevity benefits as those who do briefer shorter workouts throughout their week. Scientists at Loughborough University in the UK and other collaborators reported on workout patterns of more than 60,000 middle-aged volunteers. Both those who exercised throughout the week and the weekend warriors enjoyed similar longevity advantages compared to volunteers who did not engage in the recommended level of exercise. www.longevity.ucla.edu (310) 794-0676 10Media Highlights 11 (310) 794-0676 www.longevity.ucla.eduThe Longevity Center would like to thank everyone who generously donated on behalf of Marcus Sitrin.
