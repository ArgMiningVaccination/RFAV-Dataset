He founded the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, where he won attention for studies that showed that small behavioral changes could influence eating patterns. He found that large plates lead people to eat more food because they make portions look smaller and that children eat more vegetables when they have colorful names like \"power peas.\" Dr. Wansink wrote best-selling books and published hundreds of studies. For over a year, he served in a top nutrition policy role at the Department of Agriculture under George W. Bush, where he helped shape the government's influential Dietary Guidelines.

But the reality is much more nuanced. Since its inception in 1990, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has revolutionised the way we think about the brain. In association with other techniques, it provides invaluable clues to understand brain disorders, like psychosis or dementia. At its heart, fMRI is a medical imaging technique that allows scientists to look at where oxygenated blood is being directed around the brain - if a brain area is being used for a particular task, it will need more oxygen. So by extension, fMRI allows us to look at how information is processed in the brain, and is one of the few techniques we have to look directly into a person's brain while they are thinking.

Big Pharma funded clinical trials frequently result in publication bias, buried results and misleading information. The pharmaceutical industry is the biggest funder of clinical trials in the U.S., but there is little financial incentive for Big Pharma to be honest about trial results. In the multi-billion dollar industry, companies face pressures from shareholders looking for returns on investments, competitors racing to be the first to develop new treatments, and astronomical costs for researching and developing products.

The results were \"plain as day\", recalls Motyl, a psychology PhD student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Data from a study of nearly 2,000 people seemed to show that political moderates saw shades of grey more accurately than did either left-wing or right-wing extremists. \"The hypothesis was sexy,\" he says, \"and the data provided clear support.\" The P value, a common index for the strength of evidence, was 0.01 \u2014 usually interpreted as 'very significant'. Publication in a high-impact journal seemed within Motyl's grasp. But then reality intervened. Sensitive to controversies over reproducibility, Motyl and his adviser, Brian Nosek, decided to replicate the study.

Experts say the case exposes deep flaws in the way science is done in a field, psychology, that has only recently earned a fragile respectability. The psychologist, Diederik Stapel, of Tilburg University, committed academic fraud in \"several dozen\" published papers, many accepted in respected journals and reported in the news media, according to a report released on Monday by the three Dutch institutions where he has worked: the University of Groningen, the University of Amsterdam, and Tilburg.

It all depends, one might argue, on where the scientific writing is found. Yet we have all read badly written published papers that are invariably less successful in communicating their ideas. Style is the art of clarity, concision and uniformity of presentation of word or idea, in written form or in picture. The aim of 'good' style is ease of interpretation\u2014to reduce to a minimum the mechanics of the transfer of ideas. As a service to the readers of Nature Immunology, the editors want to take this opportunity to discuss our stylistic requirements. This exercise will emphasize several examples of problems we often encounter in manuscripts that contribute to lack of precision and clarity. Some of these common problems are obvious; some are less so. All, however, cause papers to be less persuasive and impede successful communication of otherwise good data.

To protest aganst their university's acceptance of money from the tobacco industry, an MBA student refused to accept his \"student of the year\" award; Richard Smith, editor of the BMJ, resigned from his post as professor of medical journalism; a cancer research team decided to relocate; and a member of the European parliament relinquished her roles at the university.

The analysis, described on Monday in [PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1212247109), challenges previous findings that attributed most retractions to mistakes or inadvertent failures in equipment or supplies. 1.

[Commentary by the Nature Magazine](http://www.nature.com/news/misconduct-is-the-main-cause-of-life-sciences-retractions-1.11507) A senior cardiovascular disease and diabetes researcher at the University of Kentucky has been found guilty of falsifying data over the past 10 years. [A Decade of Misconduct](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33464/title/A-Decade-of-Misconduct/) By Dan Cossins | November 27, 2012 Federal investigators have censured a former University of Kentucky (UK) senior biomedical researcher for serial scientific misconduct over a 10-year period, including the falsification of data in grant applications, progress reports, and published papers. The US Office of Research Integrity (ORI) announced the findings last week (November 20) with a notice in the Federal Register. A joint investigation carried out over the course of 2 years by the ORI and the UK found that Eric Smart, who studied the molecular mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, had falsified or fabricated a total of 45 figures\u2014mostly images of Western blots, a technique used to identify proteins\u2014in seven grant applications, three progress reports, and 10 published papers, some of which were cited more than 100 times, according to Thomson Scientific's Web of Knowledge. The notice says that Smart also reported experimental data from knockout mice that did not exist.

The department's chairman said he could wait to be fired, resign voluntarily or accept a \"gracious exit strategy\" that would give him time to prepare a paper for publication, if he dropped his \"scientific misconduct issues\". When geneticist Aaron Taylor objected that the third option sounded like a \"plea bargain\" meant to discourage him from pressing his concerns about the lab's data, the chairman, Jeffrey Hardin disagreed. But Hardin also said: \"I think you'd have to decide which is more important to you.\" He later added: \"You have to decide whether you want to kind of engage in whistle-blowing.

Scientists, writers and journal editors gathered at Rockefeller University in New York last evening to discuss increases in retracted research over the past several years and how best to correct the research record. \"Image manipulation is not a new phenomenon, but it is an increasingly visible one,\" said Liz Williams, executive editor of the Journal of Cell Biology (JCB), a Rockefeller University Press journal that has led the way in ferreting out manipulated images before their publication. She was one of three panelists that I helped to bring together for the latest Science Online New York City (SONYC) event, hosted by nature.com and Rockefeller University.

In fact, it's not even clear how you'd do that study. \"Let's see, for a control group, we should have 100 people convince themselves they're flossing for a year, but not actually floss....oh, what else can we get funding for?\" [Read more ...](http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/a-retracted-periodontitis-heart-disease-paper-that-didnt-make-it-into-the-new-aha-review/) [Cracking Open the Scientific Process](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/science/open-science-challenges-journal-tradition-with-web-collaboration.html) An interesting article in The New York Times about new trends in the scientific community.
