The iCOMOS is organized by the College of Veterinary Medicine in partnership with other University of Minnesota colleges and centers as well as allied local, national and international agencies. It serves as a global One Health forum for: communicating the importance of science in solving pressing issues at the interface of animals, humans and the environment; facilitating increased international collaboration against emerging zoonotic pathogens, food- and water-borne diseases, and environmental health threats; and informing governmental policy development for managing complex needs in food safety/production, in environmental protection, and in animal and human health. In its second meeting, iCOMOS 2016 is focused on the balance between personalized/precision medicine and public health; the impacts of air quality on health; the multidimensional role of water in economic welfare and health of humans and animals; and the role of science in development of health policies at local and global levels. Workshops on Wednesday will help you engage in and develop an in-depth understanding of: the role of team science in physician-scientist training; One Health policy related to global food security; and the role of 'big data' in addressing animal, human and plant health. Also, experts will show how canines and humans can serve as mutually beneficial comparative models for better epilepsy treatments and cures. iCOMOS 2016 is packed with exciting, informative presentations, panel discussions, and workshops delivered by world-renowned bench, translational and applied scientists. As such, we hope you use this gathering to meet old and new colleagues to expand on existing networks and to build new partnerships. The deliberations of this meeting, attended by human health-care professionals, animal health-care veterinarians, public health specialists, economists and policy experts in health, environmental affairs, and economic development, and representing nearly 30 countries will be critically important in not only understanding the current status, but also in advancing the SCIENCE behind One Health, and finding viable and sustainable solutions to societal grand challenges throughout the world. Finally, the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are one of the most vibrant and multicultural urban settings in United States. You have extensive access to musical and theater events, spectator and participatory sports, and a cornucopia of food choices. It blends a rich and diverse scientific community with major industries ranging from high tech medical devices, information technology, and agricultural business to leisure and pleasure. We hope you will take advantage of the many opportunities to enjoy the cities, their surroundings, and all they have to offer.

The conference was focused around four topics, including the science of disease recognition at the human-animal-environment interface; evolving solutions to the changing infectious disease horizon; the grand challenges of food production; and the grand challenges of food safety. The Science behind One Health was further explored in heavily attended workshops on grantsmanship in a changing environment; the reality of One Health partnerships on the ground; a vision for safe food systems from local to global, and the question if it is possible to predict the next outbreak threat. iCOMOS 2014 provided an interdisciplinary forum for exchange of knowledge in basic and applied sciences and medicine that included Nobel Laureate Peter Agre, the leadership from NIH, NIFA, USDA, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations, as well as scientists, health professionals, key sponsors and policy experts from various national and international organizations. It was revealed that relevant case studies of monkeypox, influenza A, tuberculosis and HIV can be used to guide strategies for anticipating and responding to new disease threats such as Ebola, Chickungunya and influenza viruses, as well as improve programs to control existing zoonotic diseases, including tuberculosis. The wicked problem of safely feeding the world while preserving the environment and avoiding divisive issues such as antibiotic resistance in animals and humans was shown to benefit from cooperative scientific problem solving. Food poisoning outbreaks resulting from Salmonella growing in vegetables showed the need for knowledge of pathogen evolution and adaptation in developing appropriate countermeasures for prevention and policy development. Similarly, pesticide use for efficient crop production must take into consideration bee population declines that threaten availability of two-thirds of human foods that are dependent on pollination. Speakers weighed in on the objective merits of competing health priorities and identifying gaps in knowledge that threaten health security. Opportunities for major public policy implications were discussed and decided with an emphasis on an underlying platform of facts. There was general consensus that characterizing the health consequences of interactions among animals, humans and the environment in the face of climatic change, environmental disturbance, and expanding human populations is a critical global challenge in today's world. Meeting participants left the Twin Cities with a renewed appreciation for the commonalities in human and animal health, and the underlying principles shared by animals and humans. Importantly, the critical role of environment, shared by all species, means that health and development policies meant to achieve individual goals will have broad impacts, so multidisciplinary discussion and analysis is critical to maintaining health of humans, animals and the environment. It was concluded that solutions to global One Health challenges can best emerge through convergence of expert views at iCOMOS and related colloquia and the communication of these views to the society at large.

Individualized medicine 12 requires large investments and resource commitment to address individual needs. Public health, based on scientific knowledge of generalized health risks and rewards, requires investments and commitments to population and health impacts of local and global environments. Given a fixed set of resources, maximizing the potential of both is challenging at best. Here we highlight scientific complexities of individual and population health in animals and humans as impacted by environment. 8:30-9:00 Ethical and Legal Challenges of Translating Genomic Research into Public Health Benefit Susan Wolf, Professor, University of Minnesota 9:009:30 Ethics of Personalized Medicine versus Public Health Art Caplan, Professor, New York University 9:3010:00 The Science Behind Personalized Medicine: Mapping Complex Traits and Diseases Elaine Ostrander, Distinguished Investigator, National Institutes of Health 10:00-10:30 Networking Break 10:3011:00 Vaccines - Opportunities and Challenges in Meeting Global Expectations Mark Feinberg, President, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative 11:0011:30 President's Precision Medicine Initiative-Health and Human Services Overview Adam Berger, Senior Fellow, US Department of Health and Human Services 11:30noon Panel Discussion Noon1:00 p.m. Lunch Pinnacle Ballroom 1:004:00 Session I: Topic 2: Air Quality, Environmental Exposures and Health Meridian Ballroom 1:00-1:05 Session Chairs: Steve Hecht and Anne Joseph, University of Minnesota Session summary: The health of air-breathers is inextricably linked to the quality and composition of air. Human, animal, and plant health is therefore linked in the need to effectively manage air quality. To know what this means, it is essential to unravel the impact of human activities, animal metabolism, and plant biology on air quality, as well as the detrimental impact of specific air constituents on health. Here we will examine what air is in today's world, the science behind major air-related diseases and overall health, and the human and economic costs resulting from these diseases. 1:051:35 Air Pollution, Health and Policy C.

The problem facing policymakers is compounded by the fact that human, animal, and environmental health must be considered in making water policy but each are measured by different standards. Economic and social values vary across the globe and tend to compound rather than simplify issues at the local up to global levels. All of this means data to adequately inform policy is often hard to come by, and putting one use of water above and out of balance with all the other uses has already led to unintended and undesirable consequences. 8:10-8:40 Status and Challenges of Environment and Health in China Yinlong Jin, Professor, China Center for Disease Control 8:409:10 Environmental Pollution Impacts on Fish and Humans Levent Bat, Professor, Sinop University, Turkey 9:109:40 Pharmaceutical Waste in Water: Examples from Sweden of Trying to Reduce Emissions from Use and Manufacturing Marie-Louise Ovesj\u00f6, Senior Consultant, Stockholm County Council, Sweden 9:40-10:20 Networking Break 10:2010:50 Influence of a Natural Water Flow System in the Epidemiology of Anthrax at a Human-Wildlife-Livestock Interface: A Case of Queen Elizabeth National Park Margaret Driciru, Principal Warden/Wildlife Veterinarian Uganda Wildlife Authority, Uganda 14 10:5011:20 The Use of Climate Models in the Prediction of Vector Borne Diseases Andy Morse, Professor, University of Liverpool, England 11:2011:50 Water\u2014The Greatest Threat to Achieving Global Food and Nutrition Security Ajay Markanday, Director FAO Liaison Office, North America 11:50-12:00 Break and Lunch Set-up 12:001:30 p.m. Lunch and Featured Speaker Meridian Ballroom To the Ends of the Earth: Initiatives To Not Only Educate but Reshape How People and Communities Think About Water Ann Bancroft, Educator, Explorer and Team Leader, Bancroft Arnesen Explore 1:30-5:00 Session II: Topic 2: Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy Session Chairs: Ajay Markanday, Food and Agricultural Organization; Shaun Kennedy, Food Science Institute/University of Minnesota Session summary: Government regulation in the interest of health in the U.S. began around 1848 to ensure quality of imported drug products, with the role of animal health in protecting human health firmly established 1862 with the early Department of Agriculture. Publication of Silent Spring in 1962 dramatically raised awareness of the impact of environment on human and animal health. Today, industrial expansion in China and India, etc., reminds us of the interaction of environment and health. Health policies that establish national and international social priorities are often influenced more by near-term economics and public emotion than by science. Unfortunately, compartmentalized science often misses crucial interactions, and science often is not effectively introduced into the policy debate. To ensure that science serves its appropriate role in the development of enlightened public policies for sustaining human, animal, and environmental health, the science needs to be integrated and articulated so that it is impartial, useful, and accepted 1:35-2:05 Role of Science in Water Management Policy Development Deborah Swackhamer, Professor, University of Minnesota 2:052:35 Storytelling for Effective Science Communication and Policy Liz Neeley, Executive Director, The Story Collider 2:353:05 Animal Welfare: A Case Study in Translating Science into Policy David Fraser, Professor, University of British Columbia, Canada 3:05-3:30 Networking Break 3:304:00 Linking Science and Policy: The Foodborne Disease Consideration Jorgen Schlundt, Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 4:004:30 Minnesota Effect and Evidence-Based Policy in Global Health Juhwan Oh, Professor, Seoul National University, South Korea 4:30-5:00 The Successes and Challenges of Bringing Science to Global Food Safety Policy through CODEX Alimentarius 15 Samuel Godefroy, Professor, University Laval, Quebec, Canada; Senior Food Regulatory Advisor, United Nations Industrial Development Organization 5:00-5:10 Closing Remarks and Perspective for the Future Michael Murtaugh, Co-Chair, Organizing Committee, University of Minnesota 5:10-5:15 Conference Closing Trevor Ames, Dean, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota 16 Workshop One: Tomorrow's Health Science Workforce: Physician-Scientists and Team Science Coordinators: Clifford Steer, University of Minnesota and Hortencia Hornbeak, Peter Jackson, National Institutes of Health Overview: Gaps in our knowledge about complex biomedical and environmental problems limit our ability to develop durable solutions in the spirit of OMOS. Teams of experts who understand the OMOS vision are critical for developing these durable solutions. Physician Scientists trained in a broad, nonlinear, cross-disciplinary manner are, and will be, essential members of those teams.

While very successful, they do not always achieve their goal of aligning national policies. In order to better achieve the goals of these and other global efforts to protect health through policy, there is a need to translate across these scientific and social drivers so that there is greater transparency in the trade-offs that come with the various choices. This workshop will initiate a framework for comparing across risk management paradigms that are grounded in science but end in different outcomes, each of which has positives and negatives, with a focus on the impact on least developed countries.

Developing global food safety and animal health guidelines, standards and scientific guidance are challenging processes given the need for consensus, differing national perspectives, data availability, and the effort required. As a result, the primary risk assessments tend to be informed more by developed world data and studies and less by the developing world. In addition, they are more focused on the specific risk and not the totality of the impacts any recommendations may have beyond that risk. Through discussion, the challenges that FAO and CODEX face in applying \"One Medicine, One Science\" will be explored. Panelists: Marsha Echols, Howard University Samuel Godefroy, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Canada Markus Lipp, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Jorgen Schlundt, Nanyang University, Singapore Tongkorn Meeyam, Chiang Mai University, Thailand 10:1510:35 Break 10:3511:00 Animal Health and Global Standards Juan Lubroth, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations 11:0012:30 p.m. How do Differing Risk Management Paradigms Make it Difficult to Align Around \"One Medicine, One Science\" Across Countries? Opening comments: Ajay Markanday, Food and Agricultural Organization of the 19 Risk assessments focused on the specific risk within defined systems underpin global guidelines and standards. Application to national policies is in the context of other priorities and the uniqueness of the national food and agriculture systems. All new food and agriculture systems and technologies have some level of risk. Nations evaluate risks and effect policies based on their own paradigms, with genetically modified organisms, GMOs, being the highest profile example. This session will explore examples of the risk paradigm differences that drive national policy development.. 12:301:30 Lunch Presentation: The Challenges of Operating Globally Across Differing National Policies, an Industry Perspective Joe Scimeca, Cargill 1:302:30 Strategies for Bridging Across Risk Paradigm Differences Small group discussions Using either 12 examples from the prior session or others more familiar to the small group, explore strategies that could enhance understanding of how the differing risk paradigms impact policy positions and global guidelines/standards. 2:303:00 Reporting Back: Highlights from the Small Group Discussions 3:003:20 Break 3:204:20 Establishing Frameworks for One Medicine, One Science Policies Across Risk Management Paradigms Small Group Discussions Given that a common single global risk management paradigm that addresses all national food and agriculture systems, stages of development, and priorities is unlikely, a framework that compares across the most common paradigms and makes the trade-offs more transparent may be more realistic.

To help address this challenge, the USA enacted the Food Safety Modernization Act to maintain supplies of safe food products and improve health by reducing outbreaks of foodborne illness. While the development of food safety standards domestically and internationally at both pre- and post-harvest steps is anticipated to help reduce such outbreaks, the existence of multiple complex issues surrounding food production and distribution make future occurrences of such outbreaks unavoidable. Along with the need for creating and adopting food safety standards by public policy, so too exists the need for comprehensive standard approaches to discover root causes of health outcomes such as foodborne illness when outbreaks occur. Such approaches must consider the complex relationships that exist among environmental hazards that lead to contamination at all points along the food supply continuum. To address the need for a One Medicine/One Health approach to investigating the complex interactions among pathogens, sources and routes of contamination, farming practices, and the environment, a 'Web of Causation' was created. This conceptual model illustrates the multitude of complex pathways that lead not only to vulnerabilities in production of safe food, but also to an organized approach by which sources for environmental exposures can be identified and health outcomes such as outbreaks of foodborne illness can be prevented. Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 2 Relations between Chemical Exposure in the Home and Young Children's Adjustment Gustavo Carlo, Alexandra N. Davis, Zehra Gulseven, Luis Diego Conejo-Bolanos, Francisco Palermo, Jane McElroy, Chung-Ho Lin, and Susan C. Nagel, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO Children living in poverty are at-risk for deleterious outcomes resulting from environmental toxicants exposure (need cite). Children can be exposed to toxic substances from cosmetics and cleaning agents; home products, such as paints; pesticides, such as lawn sprays and insect repellant, and gas emissions from home appliances (Faustman et al., 2000). Because children may be unknowingly exposed to harmful substances via products that parents may perceive as safe and routine, it is important to examine how exposure may be linked to children's cognitive and mental health. We examined home toxicant exposure to preschooler's internalizing problems and self-regulation. Data collection is ongoing but participants include 40 parents of their children (M age = 49.3 months) enrolled in Head Start centers in Kansas City. Parents completed measures of their use of personal products (e.g., perfumes, lotions; alpha = .64), home products (paints, varnishes; alpha = .64), pesticides (alpha = .40), and gas emissions in the home (alpha = .64). Additionally, parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms (anxiety/depressive, alpha = .82) and effortful control (self-regulation, Eisenberg et al., 2011; alpha = .72). Preliminary correlation analyses demonstrated a significant negative link between personal care products and effortful control; positive links between both personal care and home products and internalizing problems. Pesticide use was negatively associated with internalizing problems (see Table 1). Multiple regression analyses controlling for possible confounds (e.g., quality of parent-child relationships) will be conducted once data collection is completed. Discussion will focus on toxicant exposure and young children's adjustment. 52 Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 3 Associations between Home Toxicant Exposure and Preschooler's Aggressive and Prosocial Behaviors Alexandra N. Davis, Gustavo Carlo, Zehra Gulseven, Luis Diego Conejo-Bolanos, Francisco Palermo, Jane McElroy, Chung-Ho Lin, and Susan C. Nagel University of Missouri, Columbia, MO Young children living in low-SES environments may be particularly prone to the detrimental effects of environmental toxicants (Bouchard et al., 2011). Chemicals from products routinely used in and around the home can contribute to children's health and social functioning (Faustman et al., 2000). Despite the extant research on toxicant exposure and children's social functioning, much of the existing focuses on negative outcomes (such as aggression) but not on prosocial outcomes. Prosocial behaviors are defined as actions that benefit others and have been linked to health and wellbeing (Carlo, 2014). We examine the relations between home chemical exposure and aggressive and prosocial behaviors in young children from low-SES environments. Data collection is ongoing but participants include 40 parents of their children (M age = 49.3 months) enrolled in Head Start centers in Kansas City. Parents completed measures of their use of personal products (e.g., perfumes, lotions; alpha = .64), home products (paints, varnishes; alpha = .64), pesticides (alpha = .40), and gas emissions in the home (alpha = .64). Parents reported on children's physical aggression (alpha = .84) and prosocial behaviors (alpha = .88). Preliminary correlation analyses demonstrated a significant negative link between personal care products and prosocial behaviors and a negative link between home products and aggressive behaviors (see Table 1). Once data collection is completed, multiple regression analyses will be conducted to control for confounds (e.g., quality of parent-child relationship). Discussion will focus on the association of home toxicant exposures to young children's social behavioral functioning. Table 1.

Goyal University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Global commercial animal feed manufacturing is the largest component of producing safe and abundant animal derived food products. Minimizing the risk of contaminants in animal feed is essential for supporting animal and human health. Animal feed is often manufactured in centralized mills for distribution to livestock farms, which may result in contaminated feed ingredients being fed to large numbers of animals. Understanding the mechanism for disease transmission from feed ingredients can help to better manage this risk. This study was designed to characterize the inactivation of three swine coronaviruses in several feed ingredients. Five gram samples of spray dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, or dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed into vials, spiked with 1mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV, and then stored at room temperature for up to 56 days. At various time intervals, virus was eluted in a buffer solution, centrifuged, and supernatants were used to determine virus concentrations. Virus inactivation kinetics was characterized by the Weibull model, which produced a delta value indicating the amount of time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. In general, the greatest delta value was observed in soybean meal (PEDV: 7.49\u00b14.62 days, PDCoV: 42.04\u00b114.00 25.60\u00b11.37 days, TGEV: 11.78\u00b116.77 days). Virus survival was generally lower in blood meal (PEDV: 2.84\u00b10.73 days, PDCoV: 1.23\u00b11.31 days, TGEV: 2.15\u00b10.96 days). These results indicate that virus survival may be higher in plant based feed ingredients. Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 5 Characterization and Modulation of Flavor in Extruded Corn Puffs Kenneth E Smith and Dr. Devin G Peterson University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA The development of flavor in extruded goods has been widely studied. However limited information is currently available regarding the difference in aroma generation or different bitter drivers between whole grain and refined flour. This work focuses on elucidating the key aroma and bitter differences between refined and whole grain corn flour through the utilization of GC-O guided and sensory driven bitter analysis. Initial analysis has shown that there are host of compounds that are responsible for the aroma differences between whole grain and refined grain extruded corn puffs. The different compounds include compounds from a host of reaction pathways including the maillard reaction and lipid oxidation. In addition to the aroma differences identified bitter compounds; cheanorpine and coumaryl-sperimidine have been identified as primary bitter drivers in extruded corn puffs. The final steps of the project aim to determine how the bitter compounds might be degraded using natural chemistry of the corn flour during simulated processing. Aroma will also be monitored to gain insight in to how simulated processing methods might impact the aroma. 54 Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 6 Nanoselenium Sponge Technology for Mercury Removal from Water Snober Ahmed, John Brockgreitens, and Abdennour Abbas Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering, College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota Twin Cities Mercury contamination of water is a global problem that causes a major threat to aquatic life but also to human health by entering the food chain. As much as 10 % of newborn in northern Minnesota have high blood level of mercury due to fish consumption by pregnant women. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the maximum acceptable levels of mercury in drinking water and fish are 2 \u00b5g/L and 1ppm respectively. EPA reports also showed that different types of seafood contain levels of mercury usually higher than or near to the maximum acceptable range. Numerous methods have been employed to remove mercury from water. These include, the use of chemicals to precipitate mercury, activated carbon, bioremediation using bacteria and thiol-based molecules. Despite these efforts, current technologies are still costly when used at a large scale, mercury capture is usually reversible, and there is still no available technology to remove accumulated mercury from large water bodies such as lakes. Using nanotechnology, we have developed a cost-effective nanoselenium sponge technology capable of removing > 99.95 % of mercury from water within a few minutes (US Patent Pending # 62/240,764 [Oct. 10th, 2015]). Unlike commercially available sorbents, the nanoselenium sponge permanently captures mercury to form non-toxic products, thus providing a more sustainable solution. In addition, the sponge exhibits strong antimicrobial properties, which prevents biofouling. Ongoing work is focused on improving the efficiency along with the environmental friendly disposal. Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 7 UltraSensitive Method of Detection for Mercury (II) Ions Snober Ahmed, John Brockgreitens, and Abdennour Abbas Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering, College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota Twin Cities Mercury is widely recognized as a major environmental pollutant, with broad impacts concerning environmental and human toxicity. Owing to these toxic physiological effects of mercury on human health, efforts are being made to detect mercury in environmental systems. The maximum limit set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Hg+2 in drinking water is 2 ppb (7.3 Pico molar, pM). In the study, hydroquinone mediated mercury-gold nanoparticles (Hg0-Au) amalgamation is used for the of Hg+2 ions. Hydroquinone in presence of Hg+2 ions gets oxidized benzoquinone and forms Hg0-Au amalgamation. The benzoquinone and Hg0-Au resulted in a colored product which was analyzed spectrophotometrically. The method gave detection of limit 0.1 ppb (0.36 pM). Thus the study provided a simple, easy and inexpensive method of detection for Hg+2 with ultra-low sensitivity. 55 Air Quality, Environmental Exposures, and Health - 8 Preliminary investigation into the presence of contaminants of emerging concern in aquatic subsistence species in northeastern Minnesota Tiffany M. Wolf1, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2Department of Biology and the Environment, of Chippewa, Grand Portage, MN, Agency, St. Paul, MN, USA; 4Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Environmental Review and Assessment, Seattle, WA, USA; 5Los Angeles County Department of Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA Tribal communities rely heavily on fish and other species in the Lake Superior watershed for subsistence; however, concerns for the impact of endocrine-active or toxic chemicals in the environment on the health of fish populations and humans that consume them raises questions about the safety and security of subsistence food. To address these concerns, the University of Minnesota is collaborating with the Grand Portage Band of Chippewa and other agencies to assess concentrations of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), such as pharmaceuticals, current-use pesticides, and organic wastewater contaminants, in the Lake Superior watershed. A recent pilot study was carried out to screen for over 100 CECs in water and fish tissue from four distinct locations on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation. These efforts resulted in the detection of five compounds in water (androstenedione, androsterone, cotinine, hydrocodone, and iopamidol, and triclocarbon), and DEET in both water and fish tissues. Although the effects of such CECs on animal and human health are generally unknown, these results provide the basis for future studies to explore the impacts of CECs on the safety and security of important subsistence species. This project supports the UMN Grand Challenge for food and water security and the 2015 Lake Superior Lakewide Action and Management Plan in the identification of emerging chemicals of concern. Animal Health and Disease - 9 Attitudes of pharmacy and nutrition students towards team-based care after first exposure to interprofessional education in Qatar Al Abdi, Tamara, et al. University of Qatar, Doha, Qatar Little is known regarding attitudes of healthcare professional students towards team-based care in the Middle East. As modernization of health systems is rapidly occurring across the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, it is important for students to engage in interprofessional education (IPE) activities. The objective of this study was to assess pre-clinical student's attitudes towards interprofessional healthcare teams after completion of their first IPE activity. A previously validated questionnaire was distributed to 25 pharmacy and 17 nutrition students at Qatar University after participation in an IPE event. Questions related to quality of team based care and physician centricity. Results showed high agreement regarding high quality care provided by teams yet students were unsure of the value of team-based care when considering required time for implementation. Results provide baseline data for future studies to assess student attitudes throughout the professional programs and give valuable insight for future IPE program design in the Middle East. 56 Animal Health and Disease - 10 Epidemiological Tools for Real-Time Management of Swine Disease Risk Andreia Arruda, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA The Swine Health Monitoring Project (SHMP) is a national initiative to monitor and control swine pathogens in sow herds across the United States. As of March 2016, approximately 40% of the U.S. sow population was enrolled in the SHMP, representing 26 production systems. The objective of this study was to develop analytical methods for near real-time prediction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) risk using SHMP data. Region-specific sow herd density maps and cumulative incidence risk maps were constructed (timeframe: July 2015 - February 2016). A total of six regions were defined, representing the southeastern US, Pennsylvania, the Oklahoma panhandle, southern Minnesota/Northern Iowa, southern Iowa/Illinois, and South Dakota/Nebraska. Swine farm density and risk maps were created using Gaussian kernel smoothing implemented in the package 'spatstat' in R v. 3.2.3. Within each region, PRRS cumulative incidence risk ranged from approximately 3 to 23%, with the highest incidence recorded in the Oklahoma panhandle, southern Minnesota/Northern Iowa, and southern Iowa/Illinois regions. Risk maps showed that the areas where cumulative incidence was the highest did not necessarily correspond to areas with the highest swine density. Future work in this project includes incorporation of additional epidemiological factors to inform predictions, such as movement and environmental data, to develop a platform for real-time risk management for PRRS and other diseases. This work will ultimately help to prevent and control PRRS spread in the United States. Animal Health and Disease - 11 Evaluation of a Brucellosis Vacciantion Campaign and Management Practices in Two Districts brucellosis is endemic. Vaccination of heifers with strain S19 is mandatory. SENASA entrusts the vaccination campaign execution to Local Sanitary Entities (LSEs). Purpose: to evaluate brucellosis management practices concerning and the vaccination campaign and vaccine coverage in two districts. Questionnaires were performed to 113 farmers, 11 veterinarians, 13 vaccinators and 2 people of the LSEs. To check the vaccine coverage, serum of 20 heifers vaccinated 30-50 days earlier from 21 of the 113 farms were randomly taken. The BPA verified the vaccine exposure. Farms with at least 19 BPA + heifers were considered \"corrected vaccinated\". Results: tried to diagnose reproductive disorders (Neospora caninum, the most common cause). Dairy farmers diagnosed more than beef ones. 42% purchased cattle, only 38% did so from free certified farms and 27% tested the purchased animals, although all veterinarians suggested it. In beef, more \"unacceptable\" answers were found. b) Vaccinators: 77% calibrated the syringe, 40% homogenized the vaccine and 75% injected it again if it dropped. c) Vaccine coverage: 83% of heifers was BPA+, significantly lower than the expected coverage of 100%. At all farms at least one heifer was BPA+, but only 52% can be considered \"corrected vaccinated\". Although well advised by veterinarians, farmers should improve some management practices. The vaccination campaign is globally well implemented but some aspects should be improved. The low coverage is not due to the quality of the vaccine but more related to the lack of goof vaccination practices. 57 Animal Health and Disease - 12 Cell Culture Adaptation of Parvoviral Starins Obtained From Cats Prabhakar1, and Jacob Thanislass2 Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Veterinary Education and Research, Puducherry, India Canine parvovirus (CPV) is the most important and significant disease causing contagiousvira enteritis in pups and adult dogs charaterized by enteritis, myocarditis and leucopenia. The feline parvovirus (FPV) is ancestor for the current CPV strains. The FPV infects cats, minks and raccoons, which is characterized by leucopenia,enteritis additionally CNS symptoms like seizures. Since the cats can be infected with both FPV and CPV variants the cats can act as a source for emergence of new mutants. And also the CPV variants from the cats are highly prone to mutations, suggesting that still the virus evolves. So the study was taken up to study about the rate of amino acid substitution by subjecting the virus under pressure by adapting in heterologous cell line. Two isolates obtained from cats CPV-2a and FPV were characterized by full length sequencing of the VP2 gene were selected. Each strain was passaged in both homologous (CRFK cell line-Feline origin) and heterologous (A-72 cell line-Canine origin). Each virus was passaged in both the cell line for fifteen times. At the end of the fiteen passage the virus was full length sequenced. The full length sequence of VP2 gene of the field and the passaged viruses was analyzed for amino acid substitution. The study reveals that the CPV variant isolated from the cat showed several numbers of amino acid substitution when passaged in heterologous cell line (A-72 canine origin) suggesting that the virus from cats were still evolving and act as a source of emergence of viral mutants. Animal Health and Disease - 13 Comparison between Real-Time Rt-Pcr and Virus Isolation for Testing Early Protection of O1 Manisa Vaccinated Cattle against Aires, Argentina Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a contagious viral disease and endemic in many parts of the world that demand a highly potent vaccine for emergency in the vaccine bank of the different region of the world. Therefore in the frame of a collaborative project between SENASA -National Service for Agrifood Health and Quality, Argentina and CSIRO-Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Australia. We analyze the protection at 4 and 7 days post vaccination with a high potency (>6pd50) O1 Manisa double oil emulsion vaccine when challenged with O/Southkorea/2010, comparing Real-Time RT-PCR and Virus Isolation. The comparison between Real-Time RT-PCR and virus isolation for testing early protection of O1 Manisa vaccinated cattle against heterologous challenge was also used as tool to analyze if vaccination prevent the carrier state in infected cattle or not. 58 Animal Health and Disease - 14 Transmission of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus in Vaccinated Cattle Sergio Duffy Institute of Pathobiology, National Institute of Agriculture, Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina Objective: to evaluate the effect of vaccination on transmission of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Non vaccinated calves without antibodies (Ab) against FMD were randomly assigned to the groups, A: Non vaccinated and challenged (n=10); B: vaccinated day(-7) and challenged (n=10); C: vaccinated day(-14) and challenged (n=10) and D: vaccinated day(-14) and not challenged (n=5). On day(0), five animals from the groups A, B and C were housed in separate rooms and inoculated via intranasal (10.000DI;virus A2001). After 24 hours, they were released again in contact with the other five of their group for 29 days. Commercial oil vaccine (A2001;A24;O1Campos;C3Indaial) was used. An animal was considered infected if there was either (CS) clinical signs or lesions compatible with FMD, viral isolation, detection of viral genome (RT-PCR) or Ab against non-structural proteins. Transmission was estimated using the R reproductive rate. Results: Group A, all cattle became infected, presenting CS and lesions. Groups B and C, animals intranasal challenged became infected but had not CS or lesions. In contrast, none of the calves challenged by contact became infected. Group D, the animals remained negative. In Group A, R=0 (CL95%: 0.67-), (P=0.08). For groups B and C, R =0 (CL95%: 0-2.18), (P=0.13). The estimates for groups B and C, R were significantly lower than for the group A (P=0.013). Conclusion: Under these conditions, vaccination conferred complete clinical protection and significantly reduced the transmission of the A2001 virus in cattle from 7 days post-vaccination on. FMD vaccination may help to improve food security and poverty alleviation. Animal Health and Disease - 15 Investigation of the Role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Equine Metabolic Syndrome Sian A. Durward-Akhurst, Nichol Schulz, Elaine M. Norton, Raymond J. Geor, James R. Mickelson, Molly E. McCue. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is a clustering of abnormalities including insulin dysregulation, dyslipdemia and adiposity analogous to human metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our lab demonstrated EMS phenotypic variability is explained by individual (51-77%) and environmental (23-49%) factors. Despite up to 49% of variability being related to environment; only 4-18% is explained by diet, exercise and season, suggesting that other environmental factors play a role. Recently, associations between Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) and MetS have been identified. Preliminary data demonstrated that horses housed <30 miles of EDC disposal sites had higher post sugar challenge insulin concentrations (OST-insulin) (p=0.00005), suggesting EDC exposure may be an EMS risk factor. A genome-wide association and sequence analysis identified four synonymous and three non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the transactivation domain (TAD) of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is responsible for downstream metabolic effects of EDCs. The objective of this study was to determine if plasma EDC concentration and variants within the AHR are associated with metabolic measures of EMS. Plasma EDC concentrations were measured using the CALUX-DR bioassay in 158 Morgans and 137 Welsh Ponies from 32 farms. Mean EDC concentration was 0.23 TEQ/ml. Plasma toxin concentration was not associated with EMS measures except plasma triglyceride concentrations (p=0.040). A single SNP was associated with fasting insulin concentrations (p=0.008). A second SNP was associated with OST-insulin (p=0.0002), OST-glucose (p=0.0003). A SNP haplotype spanning the TAD was associated with plasma leptin concentrations (p=0.041). The results suggest that AHR variants and EDCs may play roles in EMS. Animal Health and Disease - 16 Pcv2 Neutralizing Antibody Levels in Colostrum from Farms With High or Low Levels of Viremia CMT Dvorak1, BJ Payne2, JL Seate2 and MP Murtaugh1 59 1Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA Porcine circovirus 2 is the disease (PCVAD). Vaccination against PCV2 at or around weaning effectively controls disease in finishers. Nearly all pigs in the US are vaccinated and develop PCV2-specific antibodies, but virus is not eliminated. Neutralizing antibody titers may be a more effective indicator of controlled infection than PCV2-specific antibody. Four sow herds were evaluated on vertical transmission of PCV2, sow PCV2 ELISA and colostrum PCV2 NA to gain information on antibody control of infection. Significant differences in PCV2 PCR were observed between Farms A&B and Farms C&D. No significant differences were observed analyzing antibodies from sows using a PCV2 ELISA. A broad range of 50% neutralizing antibody titers, from 1:159 to 1:1x106 was observed and a significant difference in average neutralizing antibody titers was shown between Farms A&B and Farms C&D. Sow ELISA results do not indicate differences in sow herd stability. However, in this study, NA titers differed significantly between stable (A&B) and unstable farms (C&D); higher NA titers observed in farms with no to low virus levels compared to farms with high levels of vertical transmission. This suggests that sows on farms with higher vertical transmission may develop less protective NA and may be more susceptible to disease due to amounts of replicating virus present. Likely, protective colostrum antibodies need to be produced and passed to piglets in order to protect against disease. Animal Health and Disease - 17 Potential Distribution of the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (Vhsv) in the Great Lakes Region LE G Kurath2, J Escobar-Dodero3, ME. Craft1, NBD Phelps1 1Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2U.S. Geological Survey, Western Fisheries Research Center, Seattle, WA USA. 3Universidad Andres Bello, Facultad de Ecolog\u00eda y Recursos Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb is responsible for large fish mortality in the Great Lakes of North America. Anticipating the areas of potential VHSV occurrence is key to designing epidemiological surveillance and disease prevention strategies to mitigate the impacts of VHSV in the Great Lakes basin. We explored the environmental features that could shape the spatial distribution of VHSV, based on remote sensing and climate data via ecological niche modeling. Environmental variables included temperature measured during the day and night, precipitation, vegetation, bathymetry, solar radiation, and topographic wetness. VHSV occurrences were obtained from available reports of virus confirmation in laboratory facilities. We fit a Maxent model using VHSV-IVb reports and environmental variables under different parameterizations to identify the best model to generate continuous and binary maps of potential VHSV occurrence based on environmental suitability. VHSV reports were generated from passive and active surveillance, thus, occurrences were abundant in shorelines. We, however, were able to capture the environmental signature of VHSV based on the environmental variables employed in our model, allowing us to identify patterns of VHSV occurrence. Our findings suggest that VHSV is not at an ecological equilibrium and more areas could be affected, including areas not in close geographic proximity to past VHSV reports. 60 Animal Health and Disease - 18 Tuberculosis in Calves Associated with Colostrum Management CJ Garro1, Aires, Argentina Bovine tuberculosis (BT) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). Information about risk associated with the pooling of colostrum is scarce in dairy herds of Argentina. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of BT in calves that were fed with pool of colostrum (PC). A longitudinal study was conducted in endemic BT dairy herd. PC comprised colostrum collected by farm personnel within 12 h post-calving from cows or heifers and frozen at -20 \u00b0 C. All animals received colostrum during the first 12 h of life and then they were fed with milk replaced. The exposed group (n = 354) received PC with teat-bottle (between 2 and 4 liters). The unexposed group (n = 154) received fresh colostrum from the dam. All calves were subjected to the tuberculin skin test ( 10 week-old). The relative risk (RR) and population attributable proportion was calculated. The incidence of BT in calves exposed was 19.3% and in unexposed calves was 9.8%. Calves receiving PC had almost doubled risk of BT (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1 - 3.3; p = 0.0087). Population attributable proportion indicates that 40% of the total incidence of BT in calves would be reduced by avoiding the PC. We conclude that exposure to PC is a potent risk factor associated with BT in calves. The implementation of technologies such as pasteurization of colostrum would be an important factor to consider in order to advance in the control and eradication of BT in dairy herds. Animal Health and Disease - 19 Tuberculosis in Calves and Cats in a Dairy Herd CJ Garro1, F Gonz\u00e1lez2, M Argentina Bovine tuberculosis (BT) is an infectious disease endemic in Argentina, caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). Domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are also susceptible to infection by M. bovis. However, there is little local information about BT in cats of rural areas. The aim of this study was to confirm the M. bovis infection in calf and cats that cohabiting in an endemic BT dairy herd. Calves prevalence was 22% (12/55). One calf positive to tuberculin skin test were necropsy at 90 days-old. A colony of cats, consisting of 30 individuals, cohabiting in the area of artificial rearing of calves. Eight cats was necropsy. Samples for bacteriology and histopathology were collected in the calf and cats. Spoligotyping technique was used for identify M. bovis and spoligotypes. The calf showed typical lesions of BT in thorax (lung, lymph node mediastinal and tracheobronchial). Histopathology detected granulomatous foci coinciding with macroscopic lesions sites. Two cats showed typical lesions of BT in lung and in one of them, the histopathology showed granulomatous foci and acid-fast bacilli. M. bovis was detected in lesions of the cats and two calf, with the same spoligotypes in both species. In dairy herds endemic for BT, cats that cohabiting with calves may be infected by M. bovis. A unique spoligotypes of M. bovis can affect calves and cats. These findings alert about the role of cats in the epidemiology of BT in dairy herds, and their potential zoonotic risk. 61 Animal Health and Disease - 20 Characteristics, Evolution, and Development of Livestock Traceability System in Uruguay AD Gil1, C Picasso2 Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay, 2University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Ministry of Livestock Agriculture and Fisheries, Montevideo, Uruguay A traceability system is critical to animal health and food-safety control and surveillance programs. Uruguay has a strong livestock-based economy, and animal traceability systems aimed to it development and enrichment. Currently, Uruguay has a complete cattle individual traceability system that allows to identify the origin of individual meat-cuts. The goal of this work is to describe the evolution and characteristics of the Uruguayan traceability system since started. Since 1912, the government authorities required farm-level registration, and identification of livestock with iron brand and ear notches. Whit the beginning of foot-and-mouth (FMD) control program, in the sixties, the understanding of the importance of traceability for disease control was critical. Therefore, in 1974, the national agency to control livestock population and identification (DICOSE) was created to register and recorded all livestock stakeholders (farmers, brokers, auction markets, slaughterhouses, etc.), including farm demography, and movements. DICOSE database was initially in paper-forms and later with an electronic system. After the latest FMD outbreak in 2001, the government authorities implemented jointly to group traceability, an individual system for cattle. In 2004, a pilot project was placed, and two-years later became compulsory to identify all cattle with electronic ear-tags. Since 2011, complete Uruguayan cattle population has an individual identification, and requires an electronic authorization to move cattle. At the level of slaughterhouses, animal identification is maintained until the individual beef-cut, giving the possibility to link them with the origin farm. Nowadays, the traceability system in Uruguay is essential to implement animal health programs in the country. Animal Health and Disease - 21 Cytopathological and Cytokine Expression Studies Associated with Mycobacterial Infections in NK Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana The present study included 32 cases of bovine lymphadenopathies. Out of these, on necropsy one case of tuberculosis and two cases of Johne's disease were diagnosed. In tuberculosis cases, cytology revealed numerous acid fast bacilli in bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes and lungs. Histopathological examination showed multifocal caseocalcifying granulomas in lymph nodes, lung, spleen and liver. Mycobacterium bovis was confirmed by using M. bovis, CFP-10 PCR showed amplication of mycobacterium in lymph nodes and lungs and TB was further confirmed by TaqMan Real-Time PCR. 100% homology with Human Cytokine expression studies showed significant increase in INF-. Johne's disease was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conventional PCR also showed amplication of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) in intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes. MAP was further confirmed by using TaqMan Real-Time PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of our isolate with JD isolates of Mathura, India. Cytokine expression studies showed upregulation of Th1 and Th2 immune response. The study concluded that immunohistochemistry, molecular techniques, gene sequencing and cytokine expression studies were important in diagnosis of mycobacterial infection associated with bovine lymphadenopathies. 62 Animal Health and Disease - 22 Johne's Disease Distribution in Minnesota Dairy Cattle K Kanankege1, J Alvarez1, SJ Scott1, B Dokkebakken2, AM Perez1, 1Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA. 2Minnesota Dairy Herd Improvement Association, Buffalo, MN, USA Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for Johne's disease (JD), causes a chronic debilitating enteritis in cattle, resulting in far-reaching economic losses. Approximately 60% of the dairy herds in the Midwestern U.S. has JD, with an estimated cost of infection of 200-250 USD per infected cow. Minnesota is 6th in milk cow numbers in the U.S. and thus JD has a major impact on its dairy industry. Control of JD in the U.S. is not legislated, and therefore limited epidemiological information is available. Here, we used data collected in 2015 from a voluntary JD-testing (milk ELISA) program, in herds enrolled in the Minnesota Dairy Herd Improvement Association (MNDHIA) to i) evaluate the usefulness of this dataset to determine the JD status at herd and county levels; and ii) characterize disease distribution in the state. Values at the herd level were adjusted to account for the uncertainties associated with limited sampling in the herd and limited test accuracy. Up to 607 herds were tested at least once for JD during the study period (approximately, 37% and 13% of all MNDHIA and Minnesota dairy herds, respectively), with >50% of them having at least one positive test. Spatial distribution of tested herds demonstrated a good coverage in areas with high density of dairy farms, though confidence in test results was heterogeneously distributed. This information will help to define regionally distributed risk factors, inform the dairy industry regarding the potential risk based management and contribute to mitigate the impact of JD in Minnesota. Animal Health and Disease - 23 A Case Control Study to Reveal Risk Factors Associated with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreaks in Korea 2014-2015 W Kim1, S Cho1, O-K Moon2, SH Bae3, 1College of Veterinary Medicine and Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea 2 Animal& plant Quarantine agency, Republic of Korea 3 Dept. of Geography Education, Kangwon National University Republic of Korea From January 2014 to June 2015, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N8 outbreaks was occurred on poultry farms in Korea. To evaluate risk factors for infection with HPAI in poultry farms, we conducted a retrospective matched case-control study. Thirteen farms were selected as case group from poultry farm where HPAI H5N8 had been confirmed with a positive real time PCR test from infected poultry samples within January-July 2014. Forty farms were designated as control group matched on farm location and species. Veterinarians interviewed the farmers regarding the environmental characteristics, possibility of contacts with wild animals, and their knowledge of HPAI and biosecurity. Univariable logistic regression was used to assess possible risk factors related with HPAI infection of farms. Four variables were identified as risk factors for the HPAI infection on the poultry farms by Univariable CI: 9.52-405.62, P-value<0.001). We believe that strict biosecurity on farm is critical to prevent HPAI infections in Korea. These data may give insight into the epidemiology of HPAI risk factors. 63 Animal Health and Disease - 24 The Impact of Farm Structure and Biosecurity on Foot-And-Mouth Disease in Swine A Kinsley1, K Vanderwaal1, Ga Galith2, M Craft1, A Perez1 1university of Minnesota, St. Paul, Mn, Usa 2university of Minnesota Rochester, Rochester, Mn, Usa Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral pathogen capable of causing outbreaks with severe animal welfare and economic consequences. In this study, a stochastic transmission model was formulated and parameterize to describe intra-herd transmission of FMD virus, and to assess the impact of farm structure and biosecurity on disease dynamics. We considered direct and indirect transmission on a farrow to finish, farrow to wean, wean to finish, and finishing operations. Results were compared to those obtained in a model simulation that assumes random mixing of animals, to assess the impact that farm structure may have on the likelihood of FMD spread within a farm. Key model parameters including latent period, subclinical period, incubation period and were estimated from published data and expert opinion. The results of this study will be used to guide biosecurity practices and to inform between-herd FMD models. Ultimately, results will help to inform decisions intended to improve preparedness for hypothetical FMD epidemics in the U.S. Water at the Interface of Health, Economics and Environment - 25 After the Flood: Water Quality and Health Considerations of Post-Flood Conditions in Kasese, Uganda Ac Kinsley1, K Pelican1, D Travis1, L Mugisha1,3 1Ecosystem Health Division, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2College of Veterinary Medicine, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda 3Conservation and Ecosystem Health Alliance (Ceha), Kampala, Uganda The declining access to clean drinking water has become a global concern in the face of an ever-expanding human population, increasing agricultural activities, and the major fluctuations that climate change has on the hydrological cycle. Sub-Saharan African countries, like Uganda, are particularly vulnerable to the transmission of water-borne diseases due to limited water, sanitation and public health infrastructure. Heavy rains occurring in Kasese district, Uganda in May 2013, resulted in the overflow of the Nyamwamba, Mobuku and other rivers in the region leading to the death of 8 individuals and the displacement of thousands. After the floodwaters receded, a public health team comprised of public health residents, veterinarians and microbiologists was sent to Kasese district to conduct post-flood water quality sampling of natural waterways and wells. In addition to water quality indicators such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and redox, sites were also tested for E. coli, Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae and heavy metals. Seventy percent of the sites sampled tested positive for E. Coli. In contrast, only 3% of the sites tested positive for Salmonella and none tested positive for Vibrio choleara. Lead, copper, cobalt, zinc and nickel were also identified in samples throughout the study. The locations of positive samples were used to characterize the vulnerability of the infrastructure to future flood events. The results of this study will be useful in infrastructure development and planning. 64 Animal Health and Disease - 26 Detection of Novel Pathogens in Baitfish SK Mor, NBD Phelps University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA The baitfish industry is a multi-million dollar business in Minnesota and moves hundreds of millions of fish from one location to another each year with very little oversight. This risk of inadvertent disease transfer is a serious concern for managers. To establish baselines, thirty golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) were collected with a dipnet from 56 baitshops in Minnesota from May - October 2014 (n=25) and December 2014 - February 2015 (n=31). All collected fish were delivered live same-day to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Upon arrival, fish were euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 and necropsy performed. The entire viscera of 30 fish were pooled in groups of five, resulting in six pooled samples per location. Diagnostic assays were performed to characterize parasites, bacteria, and viruses. A variety of parasites were identified, including Ovipleistophora ovariae, not previously known to be in Minnesota. More than 62 bacteria species were identified, some of significant concern. Cell culture did not yield many positive results, however molecular assays for specific viruses and next generation sequencing (non-specific virus identification) resulted in the identification of seven viruses. Most of the viruses have never been described/reported and are the focus of ongoing research efforts to better understand the disease causing potential and management recommendations. Animal Health and Disease - 27 Molecular Detection of Pathogens Associated with Honey Bee Colony Collapse in Minnesota SK MOR, AG Armien, SM Goyal University of Minnesota, ST. Paul, MN, USA Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are critical pollinators of important agricultural crops. Thus, they are very important in U.S. agriculture producing roughly a quarter of the food consumed by Americans with a value of over $17 billion per year. In recent years, high honey bee mortality has been reported from all over the world, which has raised the concern of beekeepers, growers, scientists, and government officials. The disease hit 42.1% of managed honeybee colonies from April 2014 through April 2015 in the USA. To determine the cause of such a high mortality in Minnesota honey bees, we collected samples from different counties in Minnesota from colonies which had high bee mortality. A total of 22 samples collected in spring and winter of 2014-2015 were tested. Swab samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Nucleic acids were extracted from 10% clear supernatants of homogenized bee samples for molecular detection of viruses (RNA and DNA viruses) and parasites. Black Queen Cell Virus (16/22, 72.7%) and Sacbrood Virus (16/22, 72.7%) were the most common RNA viruses detected. In addition, Deformed Wing Virus, Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, Lake Sinai virus, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus, Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus and Tobacco Ringspot Virus were also found. Nosema ceranae, a microsporidian parasite, was also detected in combination with different viruses. This study showed a high prevalence of various pathogens in Minnesota honey bees. This information should help in the design of various preventive and control measures. 65 Animal Health and Disease - 28 Exploring the Health Benefits and Economic Opportunities of the Bioactive Compounds Isolated from Eastern Redcedar Agroforestry and Department of Forestry, School of Natural Resources University of Missouri, MO, USA 2Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, MO, USA Emergence of bacterial pathogens that are multiply antibiotic resistant is a growing public health problem worldwide. These microbes limit treatment options in both human and veterinary medicine, increase morbidity and mortality, and escalate patient hospitalization times and costs. In order to overcome this problem, new chemotherapeutic approaches are needed. Our lab recently had isolated an antimicrobial diterpenoid from Eastern Redcedar (ER, Juniperus virginiana) named A. Our studies showed that it exhibits strong antimicrobial activity against many Gram positive bacteria pathogens, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. To further investigate the actual mode of action of diterpenoid, two diterpenoid resistant S. aureus strains were created by ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis followed by diterpenoid A selection. A bioinformatics analysis on genomic sequences of the mutant strains and the parent strain was performed using BWA alignment and SAMtools following by snpEff to determine the SNPs candidate for diterpenoid A-resistance. In addition, a cost-effective and environmentally friendly bioprocessing procedure was developed to extract the bioactive compounds. The immediate and potential commercial applications were also identified. The findings of this project not only contribute to identifying a unique antimicrobial mode of actions, but also have potential to create a new industry for state of Missouri, where ERs are abundant. Animal Health and Disease - 29 The Results of a Preliminary Investigation on Small Ruminant Brucellosis and Tuberculosis and Caprine Arthritis-Encephalitis in El Salvador KL de Cardona, A de Gracia OIRSA Representation in Panama, Panama This paper reports a first-time study performed in El Salvador on the presence or absence of antibodies to three important animal diseases in small ruminants. The work was conducted in the west and central departments of the country, selecting 42 and 43 cantons with an existing sheep and goat population, respectively. Serum samples were collected from 396 sheep and 335 goats and tested for seropositivity to Brucella (B.) spp. The specimens from goats were also tested for antibodies to caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) virus. Four (1%) sheep and none of the goats were seropositive by Rose Bengal test. All animals were negative by indirect ELISA (iELISA) for B. abortus. All animals were negative by iELISA for CAE. 383 sheep and 330 goats underwent the single intradermal cervical tuberculin (SICT) test for tuberculosis. 70 (18%) sheep and 43 (13%) goats reacted to the SICT test. Those reactors were subjected to the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test and one (0.3%) goat was deemed to be a positive reactor. No mycobacteria were diagnosed in concluding analyses and further studies are considered necessary to determine the prevalence of the investigated diseases. Additionally it is recommended that small ruminants should be included in the national eradication program on bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis to prevent potential reservoirs. 66 Animal Health and Disease - 30 Exosomes Can Transfer Viral Components between Cells N Luong University of Minnesota, MN, USA Exosomes have recently emerged as a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. These membrane-bound nanovesicles (30-100 nm) are released from various cell types and can be taken up by other cells thus mediating intercellular communication. Exosomes can contain a wide variety of materials (miRNA, mRNA, proteins) specific to the cells from which they were released. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a picornavirus that has a single positive strand RNA genome. TMEV infection of susceptible mice leads to the persistent infection of microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). The persistent infection contributes to the development of a chronic progressive demyelinating disease associated with an inflammatory immune response in CNS, similar to multiple sclerosis in humans. Microglia are resident macrophage type cells of the CNS. TMEV infection of microglia activates an innate immune response with expression of type I interferons (IFNa and IFNb). Recently, we have determined that TMEV- infected microglia secrete exosomes. Our current study shows that exosomes secreted from TMEV-infected microglia contain viral RNA and proteins that could be transferred to bystander uninfected CNS cells, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. The viral RNA from the exosomes was replicated in the recipient cells. Furthermore, the viral RNA from the exosomes activated an innate immune response by the bystander cells leading to expression of IFNa and IFNb. These results show a mechanism in which exosomes can transfer viral components to uninfected cells leading to transfer of viral RNA and activation of the innate immune response. Animal Health and Disease - 31 Migratory Hmultidrug Resistant Extended-Spectrum -lactamases Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Pakistan with Potential Transboundary Spread M Mohsin Institute of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan Objectives: We focused on the occurrence and molecular characterization of extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), with focus on CTX-M type, from wild migratory avian hosts across wetland habitats in Pakistan. Methods: A total of 150 migratory birds faecal swabs from four wetland habitats in Pakistan were screened for ESBL producing K. pneumoniae, carbapenem resistance, ESBL encoding genes, CTX-M genotype, and genetic diversity. Results: A total of 13 (8.6%) ESBL producing K. pneumoniae were recovered. Molecular detection of ESBL genes showed 9 harboured blaCTX-M gene and 7 contained blaTEM. Co-existence of the blaCTX-M and blaTEM was detected in 3 isolates. None of the isolates was positive for blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCMY genes. Of the 9 blaCTX-M positive isolates, 88.8%) belonged to CTX-M-1 group and 1 (11.2%) CTX-M-9. DNA sequencing confirmed blaCTX-M-15 as the single dominant ESBL genotype. None of the isolates showed positive genotype i.e blaKPC, blaNDM-1, 9 (69.2%) isolates were multidrug resistant. BOX PCR fingerprints revealed 4 major clones; of which clone A was the most widespread. Conclusions: This study is the first to report the wildlife contamination of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae in Pakistan. Dissemination of clinical relevant blaCTX-M-15 genotype in wild migratory birds is worrisome indicating the extent of environmental contamination of antimicrobial resistance with potential zoonotic risks. 67 Animal Health and Disease - 32 Improving the Detection of H9N2 Viruses by use of DNA Aptamers I Hmila1 Mysz2 1Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia 2Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University Of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) poses an enormous threat to both animal and human health and safety. As highlighted by the rapid spread of HPAI in the Midwest during 2014-2015, effective therapeutics and highly sensitive diagnostic tools are necessary to prevent this disease from causing huge economic losses. Current diagnostic methods are culture-based, relying on enrichment and antibodies for detection of virus. These methods are time consuming and often unreliable, making these approaches less than ideal for outbreak investigations and disease monitoring. To overcome these limitations, we are designing DNA aptamers as highly sensitive diagnostic tools. DNA aptamers are small, single stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can bind with high affinity to antigens and are exceedingly more stable under field conditions than antibodies. In our lab, we identified five potential DNA aptamers against the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of an H9N2 influenza strain using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). These five aptamers were further characterized for binding affinity (Kd) and specificity using a dot blot technique. The ability of these aptamers to bind live virus and prevent viral entry into target cells will be assessed using a hemagglutination inhibition assay with H9N2 virus and Turkey red blood cells. If the selected aptamers are able to bind H9N2 virus with high affinity and block entry into host cells, we hypothesize that these aptamers could be used for rapid detection of and potential antiviral therapy against H9N2 viruses. Animal Health and Disease - 33 Risk Mapping of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) using Swine Movement Network Analysis and Environmental Factors Including Land Use Patterns in Nepal S Nepal Massey University, New Zealand and Kathmandu, Nepal Japanese Encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis, cycles between birds, pigs and people and can cause irreversible neurological damage in humans. High mortality and disability rate in infected individuals due to JE has posed a serious threat particularly to children in Nepal. In Nepal, JE has been recorded since 1978 A.D., but limited studies have been done for predicting the risk of its spread and outbreaks based on the putative risk factors including swine movement and environmental factors. Also, information on network of pig movement from JE endemic to JE free areas in Nepal and the biosecurity status of pig farming have not been adequately assessed for spread of JE and other infectious diseases here. In this study we have collected information on biosecurity status of pig farms and pig movement networks. Risk mapping of JE will be done using this information of pig movement network analysis from JE endemic to free areas. Retrospective data on environmental factors including land usage pattern will also be evaluated for the same cause. The holding and network level parameters of pig movement generated will be used for simulation modelling of JE virus infection. Furthermore, the risk maps representing the hot spots for human JE cases will be generated using historical data of JE cases in humans. The result from the study will be further used to assess the cost effectiveness of different control options for JE in Nepal and will be employed for designing the appropriate control policy for JE in Nepal. 68 Animal Health and Disease - 34 Improved Serodiagnosis of Porcine and Caprine Brucellosis, Using a Glyco-Engineered Antigen Maria Nicola anicola@senasa.gob.ar Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis and still a major public health problem in endemic areas of the world. There are different serological diagnostic test with different performance and ability to differentiate negative and infected animals. We evaluated the use of antigen previously characterized and validated for diagnosis in humans (infected with B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis) and cattle, for improved serodiagnosis of porcine and caprine brucellosis. An indirect immunoassay based on the detection of anti O-polysaccharide IgG antibodies was developed coupling OAg-AcrA to ELISA plates (Glyco-iELISA), wich comprises the O-polysaccharide of the LPS of Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 (identical to B. abortus O-polysaccharide) covalently linked to the carrier protein AcrA, derived from Campylobacter jejuni. This antigen can be produced in uniform batches without the risk of exposure and culture Brucella spp. To validate the assays, more than 560 porcine and 440 caprine serum samples obtained from uninfected and infected (with B. suis biovar 1 and 2 and B. melitensis biovar 1) animals were analyzed and, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Based on this analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the test was 0.9999 (95% CI, 0.9997-1.000) and the optimum cutoff value was 0.56 for swine samples and, was 0.9977 (95% CI, 0.9952-1.000) and the cut off value 0.24 for caprine. The results indicate that glyco-iElisa can clearly discriminate individual positive animals from negative, resulting in a diagnostic test sensitivity of 100% for swine and goats and specificity of 99.7% and 97.03% respectively. Animal Health and Disease - 35 Synergistic Effect of Antibiotics and Some Chemical Agents on Biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolated from Bovine Mastitis K Patel and S Maherchandani Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India In the present work 18 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and seven isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from various clinical cases of bovine mastitis were studied for their biofilm producing ability and genes responsible for its formation. These isolates were also investigated for their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), minimum biofilm inhibitory (MBEC) with Gentamicin, Ampicillin and Polymixin-B alone and in combination with 2-acetyl salicylic acid (SA). The phenotypic characterization of biofilm producing strains of S. aureus by Microtitre plate assay and slime production assay on Congo red agar (CRA) revealed that all the isolates had the capability to produce biofilms. For P. aeruginosa its pellicle forming capabilities were also studied. All the P. aeruginosa isolates were biofilm producers. PCR amplification of genes responsible for biofilm production revealed that icaA gene was present in 61.11% and icaD was present in all the isolates of S. aureus. All the isolates of P. aeruginosa, were positive for algD. MIC values correlated well with the ABST and SA had a significant effect in combination with antibiotics in lowering the doses required to either inhibit or kill the organisms both in planktonic form and in biofilms. The efficacy of SA in combination was more effective against the S. aureus biofilms as compared to that with P. aeruginosa biofilms. But, out of the three combinations studied, the combination of SA with gentamicin proved to be better as compared to other two combinations. 69 Animal Health and Disease - 36 Epidemiological Investigation of Bovine Tuberculosis Outbreaks in Uruguay (2011-2013) C 1Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota 2Animal Health Bureau, Ministry of Livestock Agriculture and Fisheries, Montevideo, Uruguay 3Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by infection with the Mycobacterium bovis. BTB prevalence in Uruguay has been traditionally low (<11 outbreaks-year) as a consequence of a national control program. However, between 2011 and 2013 annual incidence increased up to 15, 26 and 16 infected herds each year, raising concerns from livestock stakeholders and the government. The goal of this study was to assess the spatial dynamics of BTB in Uruguay from 2011-2013, and the association between BTB and potential demographic and movement risk factors at the herd level using data provided by the Uruguayan Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Clustering of incident outbreaks was assessed using the Cuzick-Edwards' test and the Bernoulli model of the spatial scan statistic, and a conditional multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess risk factors associated with BTB in a subset of dairy Uruguayan farms. Significant (P=0.05) global clustering was detected in 2012, while high-risk local clusters were detected in southwestern (2011, 2012, 2013), northwestern (2012), and southeastern (2012) Uruguay. Increased risk of BTB in different regions of Uruguay suggests a potential role of animal movements in disease dissemination. Larger herds, higher number of animals purchased, and steers entering the farm were associated with increased odds of breaking with BTB. These results will contribute to enhance the effectiveness of BTB control programs in Uruguay. Animal Health and Disease - 37 Establishment and Characterization of a Porcine Lymphoma Cell Line MC Rahe, AJ Borgerding, B Wiseman, L Cenatti, D Martin, and MP Murtaugh Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA The lack of well characterized, established domestic porcine cell lines hinders advancement of porcine cellular immunology understanding in disease resistance and anti-viral immunity. Numerous cases of multicentric lymphoma were diagnosed in pigs at the time of slaughter. Affected organs were harvested and submitted for single cell isolation and analysis. Culture of disaggregated single cell suspensions in RPMI 1640 with weekly passage resulted in clusters of dividing cells in about 2% of attempted isolations. In one pig, cells grew in approximately 50% of wells. Cell lines were established by limiting dilution repeated 3 times from splenic and subiliac lymph node lymphomas. Initial flow cytometry analysis a population of CD3+, CD79a+, CD21+, CD4-, and CD8- cells which have grown and been maintained in culture for more than 7 months and more than 10 subcultures. To further characterize the nature of this paradoxical homogenous population of CD3+ and CD79a+ cells, transcriptome analysis was carried out and identified lymphoma cells which displayed a B cell phenotype with no CD3 gene expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis is ongoing. This new porcine lymphoma cell line will be a valuable resource for more in-depth cellular investigations into the porcine immune system, as well as providing a potential tool for the growth of lymphotropic viruses of pigs and humans. 70 Animal Health and Disease - 38 Stray Dog Attack on a Horse and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy IG Sancak, E Akpinar and AA Sancak Department of Clinics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ankara University, Diskapi, Ankara, Turkey Free roaming stray dogs can cause numerous common problems around the world. These dogs are independent of human control and live apart from people. These dogs occasionally might be aggressive and may bite walkers or other animals. In this case a16 year old female pony badly attacked and bitten while it was in its pasture by a group of stray dogs in the Central Anatolian province of Ankara. The horse was immediately brought to the clinics of Faculty of veterinary Medicine, Ankara University with external bleeding due to dog bites. The bite wounds were excessive and deeply penetrated the gluteal and perianal area in both hind limbs. A part of the tail was ruptured and some of it was lost. Following a conventional wound management technique; negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was used. It is a vacuum dressing to promote healing in wounds and has extensively been used in human patients and recently in veterinary practice. NPWT dressing was placed on the wound and the vacuum was set at -125mm Hg for 24 hours to drain the wound cavity. Granulation of tissue began to form 3 to 4 days after the beginning of treatment and NPWT was concluded in a month without further drainage or dressing requirements. In conclusion stray dogs and abandoning of a dog by an owner is a great concern to many people in Turkey and this problem should be addressed. However NPWT is a useful form of wound therapy particularly, with excessive tissue loss in horses. Animal Health and Disease - 39 The Role of Fur in Iron Regulation during Mycobacterium Avium Subsp. Paratuberculosis Infection - Johne's Disease FM Shoyama and S Sreevatsan Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Johne's disease (JD), or paratuberculosis, is must better understand the metabolic and virulence determinants of MAP. A fastidious bacterium, MAP requires siderophore supplementation for optimal growth in vitro. Our group identified an in vivo upregulated ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-like element on the MAP-specific phage-like region as a likely candidate (MAP3773c), and we sought to define if MAP3773c is involved in iron homeostasis. In silico analysis identified 23 pathways directly regulated by MAP3773c, including those critical for metabolism and virulence. Furthermore, multiple sequence alignments of well-studied Fur proteins (E.coli and S. typhimurium) and MAP3773c showed 41% overall amino acid similarity with a nearly identical \"Fur box\" binding site. Based on sequence similarity and conserved \"Fur\" domains, we conclude MAP3773c acts as a ferric uptake regulator (Fur-like protein). A transposon mutant of the gene (3776c) upstream of MAP3773c in MAP K-10 demonstrated concomitant knockdown of Fur transcription. We characterized the MAP3773c knockdown phenotype and a MAP3773c complementation strain was shown to restore Fur function. Cell invasion studies using a bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T) provided invasion efficiency and survival data for each MAP strain (Wild-type, mutant and complement). Data showed a positive correlation between intact Fur (wild-type and complement) and cell invasion. Cloning and expression of MAP3773c was generated for protein-DNA studies through EMSA and ChIP-seq assays. These results support Fur playing a role the virulence of MAP 71 Animal Health and Disease - 40 Potency of Cpg Odn as Molecular Adjuvant in Stimulating Immune Response Against Recombinant Virus Like Particle (Vlp) of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Serotype 'O' M Terhuja and P Saravanan Division of Veterinary Virology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Hebbal campus, Bangalore, India Immuno stimulating molecules like CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG ODN) are being used in improving the potency and efficacy of vaccine. CpG ODNs boost the immune response elicited by vaccines by improving protein immunogenicity, inducing both humoral and cellular responses and increase magnitude of vaccine induced responses. In this study, CpG were tested in virus like particle (VLP) of foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccine formulations obtained from baculovirus expression with mutated 3C in tandem with O-P1-2A in guinea pigs. The animals were bled on 0,14,28,44 and 56 days post vaccination and systemic immune response was analyzed for IgG, IgG1, IgG2, serum neutralization test and lymphocyte proliferation assay. The protection level achieved upon foot pad challenge with 1000 GPID50 virulent type 'O' FMDV for VLP+CPG was comparable with the conventional group suggesting the induction of protective cell mediated than wholly antibody mediated. This could be used for improving the potency and efficacy of VLP vaccines in control of FMD in endemic counties as well as in FMD free countries in the event of disease outbreak. Animal Health and Disease - 41 Airborne Transport of Infectious H5n2 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus during the 2015 Spring Outbreaks in the Midwestern U.S. M Torremorell, C Alonso, PC Raynor and PR Davies Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University Of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Since first detected in December 2014, the cases of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus resulted in the most severe foreign animal disease outbreak in United States causing devastating losses to the poultry industry. Due to the rapid spread of cases, we investigated the plausibility of airborne transmission of the virus in farms acutely infected during the spring of 2015 in the U.S. Midwest area. Air samples were collected inside and outside of infected turkey and layer facilities at distances up to 1000 m. Samples were tested to assess HPAI concentration (RNA copies/m3 of air), virus viability and virus distribution by particle size. HPAI RNA was detected inside and up to 1000 m from infected facilities. HPAI was isolated from air samples collected inside, immediately outside and up to 70 m from infected facilities, and in airborne particles larger than 2.1 \u00b5m. Direct exposure of surfaces to exhausted aerosols proved to be a significant source of environmental contamination. These findings demonstrate HPAI aerosolization from infected flocks, and that both the transport of infectious airborne particles and the deposition of particles on surfaces around infected premises, represent a potential risk for the spread of HPAI. 72 Animal Health and Disease - 42 Big Data in Animal Disease Surveillance and Control K Vanderwaal, J Alvarez and A Perez Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University Of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA The goal of the STEMMA program is to develop and implement near-real time systems for the prevention and mitigation of animal diseases. Researchers in our program work to achieve this goal through a combination of research to generate new to theoretical and applied knowledge, outreach to transfer such knowledge to decision-makers working in the public and private spheres, and education. Specifically, we leverage data that is already routinely collected by industry and other key stakeholders involved in One Medicine to understand and predict spatiotemporal drivers of infectious diseases in animals. Here, we highlight several examples of our work as it relates to the prevention of infectious diseases in animals, including research, IT development, and outreach to industry partners. Big Data - 43 A Novel Approach for Anayzing Networks as Potential Pathways for Disease Transmission K Vanderwaal1, Enns2, C Picasso1, C Packer1 and ME Craft1 1Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University Of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2Division of Health Policy & Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Networks are frequently utilized to incorporate heterogeneity in who-contacts-whom in mathematical models of pathogen spread and are increasingly used to quantify large-scale connectivity patterns of populations at regional and national scales. However, we currently lack tools to evaluate whether potential pathways of transmission are adequately represented by an observed contact network. Here, we describe a novel permutation-based approach, the network k-test, to determine if the pattern of cases within the observed contact network are likely to have resulted from transmission processes in the network, indicating that the network represents potential transmission pathways between nodes. We compare the power of this approach to other commonly used analytical methods using simulated data of pathogen spread. We test the robustness of this technique across common sampling constraints, including undetected cases, unobserved individuals, and missing interaction data. We also demonstrate the application of this technique in two case studies of livestock and wildlife networks. We show that the power of the k-test to correctly identify the epidemiologic relevance of contact networks is substantially greater than other methods, even when 50% of contact or case data are missing. We further demonstrate that the impact of missing data on network analysis depends on the structure of the network and the type of missing data. 73 Animal Health and Disease - 44 Whole Transcriptome Analysis of Young and Aged Host Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (Pams) Infected by PRRSV X Wang and MP Murtaugh Department of Veterinary Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Different outcomes occur when pigs are infected with Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV); adult pigs often show a non-significant to mild syndrome while young pigs (including neonates, sucking and nursery pigs) suffer much more serious respiratory disease, secondary infections, and significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), an early and key target of PRRSV intrusion, are likely to contribute to this age-dependent infection outcome. In vitro experiments have shown that PRRSV grows better in PAMs from young pigs. Previous research demonstrated no differences in PAM expression of CD163 and CD169, surface proteins that are implicated in PRRSV cell entry between different aged pigs. Therefore, this age-dependent resistance ability towards PRRSV infection could be an intrinsic characteristic of PAMs. The general presence of cellular restriction factors that suppress replication and growth of various viruses led us to propose the age-dependent expression of anti-viral restriction factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that age-dependent presence of intrinsic cellular factors mediating restriction or permissiveness that are responsible for this resistance difference against PRRSV infection. We have examined PAMs from young and adult pigs for susceptibility to PRRSV infection in vitro, and RNA-seq on high-throughput sequencing has been done for the whole transcriptome analysis in order to identify differences in age-dependent restriction factors that are expressed constitutively or are induced following viral infection. This project is expected to provide novel insights towards determining molecular mechanisms of PRRSV resistance. Animal Health and Disease - 45 A Transfer Entropy Model for the Inference of Influenza Information Networks Yang Liu1, Maria Sundaram2, Matteo Convertino1,2,3 1School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA; 3Institute for Engineering in Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Variations in seasonal influenza epidemic initiation, timing, and magnitude yield highly variable illness data that can help researchers to understand the spatial spread of influenza. Historically, these data have been examined for characterizing local contagious diffusion. Long-distance connections of cases - for instance in the form of autocorrelation - have not been fully explored using these data. For the United States, predictable spatial patterns will contribute to more accurate predictive models for ascertaining when influenza infection will occur and to understand long distance connections. This has huge public health implications as well as theoretical and technological relevance. In order to evaluate the interdependence of cases we propose the use of a transfer entropy model (TE) that measures the amount of information transfer from one variable to the other; yet, in this context the number of cases ''transferred'' from one region to another. Data are taken from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that provides influenza information from 1997 to 2014 at the scale of Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions via the FluView online data portal. TE is a non-parametric and non-linear model that offers an alternative measure of effective connectivity based on information theory, more powerful than Granger causality or assumption-based dynamic causal models. More precisely, TE is quantifying causal networks between time series where node/variable distance, node connectivity, and link weights are related to variable undirected statistical closeness, dependence, and directional entropy reduction. Furthermore, transfer entropy is an asymmetric measure that conveys directional information. Considering TE on CDC data it results that Northeast and Northwest US are the most influential nodes in the network. Conversely, Midwest and Southwest regions are strongly affected 74 by other regions. There are long-distance connections between Northeast and Midwest, and between Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions. These connections are also verified by the Spearman correlation coefficient between influenza season onset timing and distance. Some pairs regions that are very far from each other (~1500-3000km) still show significant correlation with each other (r=0.45-0.65) that emphasizes the importance to assess effective connections rather than geographical connections. In a simple beta regression model, long-distance connections show statistical significance (p<0.05). The results allow us to conclude that long-distance effects are relevant in the dispersion of influenza cases and to infer locally generated cases. Thus, future development of influenza predictive tools should take both local generation/diffusion and long-distance dispersal into consideration. The TE model can be useful in analyzing any other complex disease where interactions among sub-systems/regions are expected to be non-linear and where minimal a priori knowledge is available. Yet, TE can be used successfully as a reverse engineering metric to infer causal networks from population patterns. In this way, the inferred information networks can inform about the relative importance of transmission networks. Animal Health and Disease - 46 An Information Theoretical Global Epidemic Prediction Model Yang Liu, Matteo Convertino School of Public Health, Institute on Environment, Institute for Engineering in Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Dengue fever is a multi-serotype mosquito-borne disease that is steadily increasing in incidence worldwide and sharing animal vectors with other rapidly spreading viruses like Zika virs. Strong ties between environmental factors - temperature and humidity, predominantly - and vector dynamics have been consistently reported. However, also in relation to the uncertainty in the life cycle of the primary vector, translating the environment-vector dependencies into predictive models is challenging because of the wide range of time lags in these dependencies. The better understanding of the epidemiology of Dengue and the improvement of predictive models has huge public health implications; yet, computational models are improved for this purpose. In an Epidemic Prediction Initiative context, a new computational method is proposed as a new approach for constructing Stochastic Generalized Linear Models (SGLM) with multiple diversely lagged input factors based on the aim to improve prediction accuracy. The two sites considered as case study are San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. The sites were chosen specifically for their ecosystem diversity that is potentially linked to a different Dengue dynamics. Public health data were provided by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and environmental data are from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The proposed computational method uses mutual information (MI) to evaluate the dependencies between predictive and outcome variables at different time lags. The window with the highest MI in the time series of each predictive variable is selected as the input of a negative binomial SGLM that predicts the weekly incidence of DF. Predictions were generated every four weeks. More precisely, total cases, outbreak timing and magnitude are the variables used to design the most accurate predictive model. The mean absolute error and a logarithmic scoring rule were used as accuracy tests. Global Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis (GSUA) is applied to attribute the variability of the output to each predictive factor and their interactions. The selected models are tested on four years of data that were excluded from the model calibration phase. Environmental factors that have shown the highest mutual information are temperature and humidity for San Juan and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for Iquitos. These results reflect the micro/meso ecosystem dependence on Dengue fever incidence. For instance, temperature and humidity are more important in urban settings like in San Juan; NDVI is more important in rural settings like in 75 Iquitos, Peru. For both study sites, annual and inter-annual trends and autoregressive components are the most influential independent variables. This epidemiological information has higher lag for San Juan than Iquitos considering the quicker response of the latter to ecohydrological fluctuations. Independently of the geographical area, in endemic periods most of independent variables present the same importance in terms of prediction accuracy, while during epidemic peaks one variables dominates over all others. Overall, for both sites the proposed model performs significantly better than a baseline model built as a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The accuracy in predictions shown by the proposed SGLM is significantly improved by applying mutual information as a metric to design the predictive model. MI allows one to construct a varied lag factor model that can both investigate the universal epidemiology of a disease and make useful and site-dependent fine-resolution predictions. Yet, the mutual information based SGLM is proposed as a powerful. Epidemic prediction model not just for Dengue fever but also for any other environmental dependent infectious diseases. Balancing Personalized Medicine and Public Health in a Changing Environment - 47 Sero-Epidemiology and Molecular Characterization of Hepatitis E Virus Infection in Swine and Human Risk Population in \u00b0School of Public Health and Zoonoses, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) has 2 discrete epidemiological patterns: (1) water borne epidemics in developing countries, caused by HEV genotype 1 and (2) sporadic zoonotic outbreaks in developed countries caused by genotype 4. The present study was designed to investigate seroprevalence, molecular detection and characterization of HEV by using nested RT-PCR in swine and human occupational risk population in Punjab, North India. The occupational risk group was comprised of swine farmers (organized - formulated feed feeders and unorganized - swill feeders), abattoir workers, sewage workers and veterinary students. During the study period, around 300 swine blood and fecal samples and 360 human blood and fecal samples were collected from occupational risk and healthy control low risk population. The overall seroprevalence of swine HEV was 65.00% with significantly higher seropositivity in growing pigs (2-8 months of age) and swill fed pigs. The prevalence of HEV in swine fecal samples by nRT-PCR was detected as 8.75%. In human risk population, significantly higher (60.48%) anti-HEV IgG sero-positivity was observed as compared to control population (10.71%). Human HEV by nRT-PCR was detected as 1.11% in the occupational risk population. In conclusion, strong evidence of association was observed between human anti- HEV IgG seropositivity and certain occupational risk groups (p <0.0001), indicating that HEV infection is an important occupational hazard in unorganized swine farmers, slaughter house workers and sewage workers. Molecular characterization revealed the circulation of G IV and G I genotypes among swine and human population, respectively in Punjab, India. 76 Balancing Personalized Medicine and Public Health in a Changing Environment - 48 Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever 2Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Dkap, Ankara, Turkey. First case of CCHF in Turkey was seen in Tokat, a province of the northeast region in 2002. Then cases increased through Kelkit Valley in the Black Sea region in Turkey. There are twenty CCHF endemic provinces defined as incidence of CCHF is higher than the mean incidence of Turkey. National CCHF Advisory Board established in 2003 and develops annual strategies for CCHF control program in Turkey. Those strategies include increasing awareness of the public on personal preventive/protective measures and increasing knowledge of health staff, surveillance of tick migration, monitoring and treatment of patients, strengthening laboratory infrastructure, and health facilities. Public training activities are held by medical staff not limited to the endemic areas as well as across the country. Guidance of 'The approach to a patient with tick bite' and 'CCHF case Management' were prepared and distributed by Ministry of Health to all health facilities. Prepared documentations were consisting of printed materials, documentary and short animation videos with subtitles as well the availability of these materials uploaded online. Moreover, specific referral centers and PCR laboratories were designated for critically ill patients with possible CCHF. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock is responsible for control of tick on livestock not limited to endemic area of CCHF but also across the country. For this purpose, Flumethrin is being used for 2.000.000 animals per year. In summary, Turkey as a country gained very significant experience with the CCHF control program, which needs multidisciplinary approach and collaboration to be effectively carried out. During the CCHF control program, Turkey improved the quality of health services and activities. Most important outcome during this program is that we realized to have people more alert on main message of prevention needs different materials. Balancing Personalized Medicine and Public Health in a Changing Environment - 49 Gastro-Intestinal Parasites in Mountain Gorillas (Gorilla Beringei Beringei) of Rwanda Volcanoes National Park: Impact on Public Health Richard Gashururu, Alice Gloria Umurerwa, Mike Tukei; University of Rwanda, Nyagatare, Rwanda The study was carried out in the Volcanoes National Park of Rwanda, which is home to mountain gorillas, between March and June 2015. The study aimed at assessing the prevalence of the GIT parasites affecting the gorillas and identifying those of which that can be of public health importance. Twenty four faecal samples were randomly collected from two gorilla families at different intervals. The faecal samples were examined for parasites using flotation and sedimentation methods. Of the twenty four fecal samples examined, the study revealed 5 nematodes, 1 cestode and 4 protozoa. There was no significant difference in the prevalence between the two families. Some of the parasites could not be identified. E. hystolytica and Giardia are of zoonotic nature and could therefore be shared with humans. Most of the nematode types found are also found in humans, it is possible that these parasites were from daily human-gorilla interactions by zoonotic, reservoir or paratenic ways. However, there is a need to make the systematic coproculture to definitely identify some parasites and determine the transmission mode in order to confirm whether or not these are multi-host pathogens that can be shared. 77 Balancing Personalized Medicine and Public Health in a Changing Environment - 50 Anti-Toxoplasma Antibodies Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors Among HIV Patients Attending Treatment and Counseling Package at Agaro Town Health Center in a major public health concern mainly among immunocompromised individuals and the objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of toxoplasmosis among HIV patients in Agaro Town Health Center of Jimma zone. Methods: It was a cross sectional study based in public health center and convenient sampling was used to collect blood samples from 135 patients attending anti-retroviral therapy from February to March 2015. Serum samples were tested for anti-T.gondii antibody by using latex agglutination test. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic and risk factors associated with toxoplasmosis. Results: 87.36). In analysis significant association was observed between anti T.gondii seropositivity raw meat showed high rate of seropostivity and thus, it is highly advisable to introduce routine anti-T. gondii antibodies serological screening test prior to ART commencement. Balancing Personalized Medicine and Public Health in a Changing Environment - 51 One Health Approaches in the Antibiotics Resistance of Escherichia Coli Isolates from Cattle, Pig and Chicken in Korea Seungwon Shin and Han Sang Yoo Department of Infectious Diseases, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea Antimicrobial drugs have contributed to the overcoming of illness and death caused by bacterial infections in animals and humans. However the excessive use of antimicrobials resulted in emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Especially Escherichia coli have been considered as the significant reservoir of antimicrobial resistance transferring resistance determinants in one health aspect. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli isolated from food producing animals and the transferability of their resistance determinants. Total 586 E. coli isolates collected from cattle, pig and chicken were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Of the bacterium, MIC value of ampicillin and tetracycline resistant isolates were determined using cephalosporin and tetracycline. The presence and transferability of antimicrobial resistance determinants were assay, respectively. The PCR-based plasmid replicon typing was also conducted. All isolates showed resistance to one or more antimicrobials, with half isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance. Ampicillin-resistant isolates harbored TEM-1 gene and transferred that mostly by IncFIB. The tetracycline resistance gene, tet(A) and tet(B), were frequently detected in tetracycline-resistant isolates. MIC test revealed that isolates carrying tet(B) had higher MIC than isolates carrying tet(A). Conjugation assays showed that isolates could transfer a tetracycline resistance gene via the IncFIB. Conclusively, the high prevalence of ampicillin and tetracycline-resistant E. coli from food-producing animals is due to the transferability of resistance genes between E. coli populations which have survived selective pressure caused by the use of antimicrobial agents. This study suggests that E. coli with transferable antimicrobial resistant gene(s) should be considered as an important reservoir in one health aspect. 78 Big Data - 52 One Medicine in Action: Use of Data Gathered from the Raptor Center for Syndromic Surveillance of Zoonotic Diseases Ponder2, Andres Perez3 1Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2The Raptor Center, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 3College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Many wildlife species are reservoirs of important emerging zoonotic pathogens (EZP). For timely detection and prevention of the spread of these agents, there is a continual call from human and animal health organizations to enhance wildlife disease surveillance. Wildlife rehabilitation centers across the United States routinely gather health-related data from diverse wildlife species. Their potential to signal the occurrence of EZP and improve the efficiency of traditional surveillance remains largely unexplored. We assessed the utility of such data from raptors admitted to The Raptor Center (TRC) between 1990 and 2014 for syndromic surveillance, using West Nile Virus (WNV) as a proof of concept. As raptor species are susceptible to WNV, we hypothesized that monitoring the frequency of raptors admitted to TRC with specific syndromes could indicate WNV circulation in this region. Using grouped time-series structures and classical time-series models, we studied the variability of raptor admissions according to the avian group, species and clinical signs grouped by body systems. We uncovered underlying frequencies and trends for the main groups and identified syndromes that increased in periods with high incidence of WNV. Despite the lack of specificity, the influence of other non-controlled factors and the difficulty in retracing data, monitoring data from wildlife rehabilitation centers may help to target populations at high-risk and disease trends. Digital medical records with standardized data sets and terminology would help advance syndromic surveillance in wildlife. Ultimately, this information could contribute to the early detection of zoonotic diseases and help prevent the spread into human populations. Big Data - 53 Spatio-Temporal Trends of Q Fever Cases in Minnesota (1997-2014) Julio Alvarez University of Minnesota, St. Paul MN USA Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a widely distributed yet neglected zoonotic disease for which domestic ruminants are considered the main reservoir. Although present in most of the world, and leading to 1-6 cases every year in Minnesota, there are still many gaps on our knowledge of its epidemiology and the main causes leading to infection. Here we show how Q fever surveillance data used in combination with information routinely collected by different agencies (animal and human population counts) can be used to characterize patterns of occurrence of cases and detect variables potentially associated with increased incidence. Thirty-eight Q fever cases were reported between 1997 and 2014 in Minnesota, with annual case counts ranging between 1-3 and 1-6 prior and after 2006, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of areas in the south of the state at significantly higher risk of Q fever for certain time periods throughout the study period. These results were in agreement with the standardized incidence ratios, which suggested an increased risk in counties in the south. Poisson spatial Bayesian regression models suggested that inclusion of information on presence of small ruminants at the county level helped to explain the expected number of cases, thus pointing at a possible association with the outcome. This example demonstrates how already available information can be combined with health data to characterize disease occurrence. 79 Comparative Medicine - 54 Ctl-Based Vaccine-Induced Protection with Induction of High Follicular to of Virus-Specific Cd8 T Cells Hadia M. Abdelaal University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA There is an urgent need to develop an effective HIV vaccine. We previously showed that during chronic HIV-1 and SIV infections, HIV and SIV replication is concentrated within B cell follicles, whereas HIV and SIV-specific CTL are largely excluded from these sites suggesting that the inability of HIV and SIV-specific CTL to fully suppress virus replication may be due to their deficiency in B-cell follicles. We hypothesize that a successful HIV vaccine will either prevent the seeding of B cell follicles or induce high levels of virus-specific CTL in B cell follicles. Here we investigated whether protection associated with three CTL inducing SIV vaccines was associated with levels of SIV-specific CTL in follicular (F) and extrafollicular (EF) compartments in lymph nodes of vaccinated animals after challenge with pathogenic SIV relative to a cohort of non-vaccinated chronically infected animals using in situ tetramer staining with MHC tetramers combined with immunohistochemistry. We found lower levels of tetramer+ cells in F compared to EF areas of unvaccinated animals (P<0.0001), but not in vaccinated animals (P=0.41). Although, similar levels of tetramer+ cells were detected in F areas between vaccinated and unvaccinated animals (P=0.9), the vaccinated animals had significantly higher F: EF ratios of tetramer+ cells (P=0.04). Also, there was a significant inverse correlation between F: EF ratio of tetramer+ cells and plasma VL in vaccinated (P=0.016) but not in unvaccinated animals (P=0.85). These results support developing CTL-based HIV vaccines that augment relative levels of virus-specific CTL within B-cell follicles. Comparative Medicine - in Hemangiosarcomas and Angiosarcomas Derek Korpela Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA Tumor cells often hijack metabolic pathways to gain a survival advantage. Recent studies suggest canine hemangiosarcomas and human angiosarcomas signal through -adrenergic receptors (-ARs) to acquire a metabolically plastic phenotype, which may promote tumorigenesis. Inhibition of these pathways by -AR antagonists likely reprograms cellular metabolism, reducing cell viability. Specifically, -AR antagonists may modify fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and fatty acid transport by reducing the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). -AR expression by hemangiosarcoma and angiosarcoma cell lines was assessed by immunoblotting, and the effects of -AR specific antagonism on cell viability were ascertained. Changes in UCP-1 expression after treatment with the -AR antagonist propranolol were assessed, and the changes correlated to alterations in mitochondrial uncoupling with TMRE assay. Our results show that -ARs are expressed in hemangiosarcoma and angiosarcoma cell lines and beta blockade decreases tumor cell viability. Inhibition of AR signaling also reduces UCP-1 expression in a concentration dependent manner, partially restoring mitochondrial coupling. Furthermore, beta blockade reduces the expression of transcription factors involved in fatty acid transport. Our data suggest that -AR signaling regulates several lipid metabolic pathways in hemangiosarcomas and angiosarcomas, and inhibition may result in an Achilles heel for tumor cells. Future studies will establish the receptor(s) needed for metabolic plasticity, and identify key metabolic pathways regulated by -ARs necessary for progression. 80 Comparative Medicine - 56 Biochemical Constituents and Steroid Hormones Concentration in Different Stage Follicular 2National Dairy Research Institute, Haryana, India The oocyte quality is mainly focussed on the various physiological constituents in follicular fluid (FF). These constituents appear to be a key nutrients controlling ovarian activity in animals.Therefore, a study was conducted in cross-bred (CB) Malabari breed of Southern India to study the changes in biochemical constituents of follicular fluid during different stages of follicle development. For this purpose, 120 ovaries were collected from adult CB Malabari goats immediately after slaughter from a local slaughter house. After classifying the follicles based on size i.e. small (1-3 mm) and large (>3 mm), the fluid was aspirated and centrifuged. The supernatant fluid was separated and stored at -40C for further analysis. The follicular fluid was analyzed to estimate the concentration of various biochemical constituents including total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) and steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone) using commercial kits. The results showed that the concentrations of glucose was significantly higher (p<0.05) in small follicles. However, the level of HDL was significantly higher (p<0.05) in large follicles. Also, the level of oestrogen was significantly higher (p<0.05) in large follicles. However, follicular fluid protein, albumin, globulin, triglycerides, cholesterol and progesterone did not differ between the small and large follicle. The results of the present study suggest that the biochemical constituents in the antral follicular fluid vary with the follicular size in Malabari goat. These data can contribute to understand the FF metabolite concentrations which could be helpful for in vitro culture of follicles and oocytes in goats. Comparative Medicine - 57 Microglial Immune Response to Low Concentrations of Silver Nanoparticles: A Novel in Vitro Model of Brain Health Angelo Yuan, Ce Yuan, Cayla M. Duffy, Shihab Ahmed, Jacob Swanson, William Northrop, Vijayakumar Mavanji, Tiffany R. Beckman, Joshua P. Nixon, Tammy A. Butterick. University of Minnesota, St. Paul The brain is the central regulator for integration and control of response to environmental cues. Worldwide increases in the use and production of nanoparticles have raised concerns regarding the potential neurological impact and downstream effects on brain health. Recent studies show that nanoparticle (NP) components of air pollution from combustion engine exhaust can directly and adversely affect brain health, such as neuroinflammation. Metal NPs contained within the particulate matter of engine exhaust can trigger neuroinflammation, a deleterious immune response in brain tissue. Epidemiological data and animal studies suggest that air pollution affects brain regions controlling central energy balance may contribute to the propensity for obesity. To test this association, we developed a novel in vitro biological sensor model of low-dose NP exposure using microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. Here we demonstrate that low concentrations of 20 nanometers (nm) silver-NP (AgNP) promote low-grade microglial metabolic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (tumor necrosis (interleukin-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase). We also demonstrated increased production of reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) p65 activation in microglia with AgNP stimulation. Finally, we show that microglial secretions following low-dose AgNP significantly reduced cell survival of hypothalamic neurons in vitro. To our knowledge, this data shows for the first time the activation of NF-B in microglia exposed to low dose of AgNP and similar immune response as others have shown for high dose of AgNP. 81 Ethics and Economics of Individual versus Population Health- 58 Current Practice and Associated Ethical Issues of Radiation Protection among Referring Clinicians Practicing in Bharatpur, Forestry University, Chitwan, Nepal A cross-sectional study was carried out during July- August, 2015 among 60 referring clinicians from 3 randomly selected hospitals of Bharatpur sub-metropolitan city, Nepal to assess their current knowledge and practice on radiation protection. The respondents were not the radiation professionals but did refer for the radiation as part of their work. The result of this study showed that the level of knowledge among referring clinicians was only 52.08% while their current practice was 60.55%.The practice was found to better than knowledge which was due to habituation in once acquired practical skills and lack of regular update on knowledge. There was no significant difference (p> 0.05) in the level of knowledge of clinicians of the three hospitals. But significant difference (p< 0.05) occurred in the practice of clinicians among hospitals because one of the hospitals was a cancer hospital which uses radio diagnostic modalities and radiation therapies regularly in bulk for cancer diagnosis and treatment. The findings showed that 33.3% (n=20) respondents referred cases for radiological investigation just to satisfy patients while 15% (n=9) for ionizing radiation during pregnancy. It seems extremely necessary for clinicians to decide for appropriate radio diagnostic modality based on need rather than patient's desire. Therefore, there is a need of soundness in knowledge in relevant aspects of radio diagnosis and radio safety among the referring clinicians to prevent the patients from unnecessary risks and hazards of radiation and equally the cost of the expensive procedures. Food Safety and Security - 59 Heavy Metal Levels in the Mediterranean Mussel Mytilus Galloprovincialis from the Turkish Black Sea Coast as Biomonitor and Potential Risk of Human Health Elif Arici1, Levent Bat1 1Sinop University, Fisheries Faculty, Department Turkey The concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Hg in the soft parts of Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from the Turkish Black Sea coast have been measured by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometer) for monitoring metal pollution in 2013. Statistically significant differences in the concentrations of all metals investigated were observed among four sampling stations namely Igneada, Sinop, Samsun and Trabzon in order to evaluate health risk for mussel consumers, using mussels as biomonitors. The results were compared with the guidelines set down by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), the Turkish Food Codex and Commission Regulation (EC) for the safe consumption limits of Molluscs and the other studies. The concentrations (\u00b5g metal g-1 wet wt.) of metals ranged from for Cd and <0,05 for Hg. In Sinop, essential element Fe, Zn and Mn are present at the lowest concentrations reaching 55 \u00b5g metal g-1 wet wt. Sinop is the smallest city and pollutants load more less than other cities. On the basis of metal levels, Samsun shows the higher concentrations of metals with the exception of Mn that is maximum in neada. According to permissible limits, results in all studied stations show that there is no health risk for mussel consumers in the coastal areas of the Black Sea. 82 Food Safety and Security - 60 Single Steps on Selection of Dna-Aptamers for Detection of Norovirus Capsid Protein Vp1 Olga Saiapina, Sreevatsan, Abdennour Abbas Of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN USA The epidemic non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans caused by the noroviruses in the United States alone, are estimated to result in 21 million illnesses each year and contribute to some 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Commonly used methods for the norovirus detection, such as RT-qPCR and EIAs, are not selective enough when both fast and accurate detection is required (e.g., on-line and on-site analysis). This research was aimed to develop short-time and reliable approach for selection of the DNA-sequences capable of the specific and tight binding to the target molecule, norovirus VP1 protein. The appropriate search was carried out by the consequent application of the step gradient salt elution assay, dot blotting and cloning of the selected candidates for their further sequencing. Initially, the immobilized target molecules were incubated with the randomized oligonucleotide library, and eluted with the gradient concentrations of NaCl. The DNA sequences bound to VP1, eluted with the 1.4 M and 1.5 M solutions of NaCl were then amplified and selectivity was demonstrated in a dot blot assay. Sequences eluted from the dot blot membranes were amplified and successfully cloned and sequenced. Selected oligonucleotides will be assessed for avidity and specificity using a novel direct detection system for field applications. Food Safety and Security - 61 Validation of In-House Developed Test Kit for Detecting Antimicrobial Residues in Meat R Warin, R Boripun, M Intanon, W Chaisowwong Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chollapratan road, Mae Hia, Muang, Chiang Mai, Thailand The objective of this study aims to validate test kit for antimicrobial residues in honey that produced by Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University (CMU test) using microbial inhibition assay. In order to apply in meat products, Limits of Detection (LOD) of Tetracycline and Penicillin G were determined. The result showed that the LOD of Tetracycline and Penicillin G were 400 and 5 \u00b5g/kg respectively. Antimicrobial residues in 150 meat samples sold in fresh markets were detected by using CMU test. The positive result was 6.7 % in 150 meat samples mostly found in chicken. Moreover, we used the result from CMU Test to compare with the result of Premi\u00ae Test and CM Test for measure of agreement using Cohen's kappa coefficient. The result from CMU test was not in accordance with the result of Premi\u00ae Test however, it was highly accordance with CMU Test. Therefore, CMU Test can be possibly developed as screening test for detect antimicrobial residues in meat products. 83 Food Safety and Security - 62 Instantaneous Microbial Screening: Detecting Pathogens in Less Than 30 Min K Xu, J Brockreitens, A Fang, A Abbas Kaufert Lab, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA A rapid and cost-effective microbial detection technology capable of providing reliable results in less than 2 hours is in persistent today in food industry, food safety agencies and diagnostic laboratories. The 2-hour time frame is highly critical as food producers seek to control the quality and safety of their products on-site before shipment. Once the product is released, any undetected contamination or spoilage would lead to significant cost due to recalls, food waste, food poisoning or negative impact on the product perception and consumer trust. Although many commercially available technologies are labeled for \"rapid microbial detection\", they always require 12-48 hours enrichment before detection. We have developed instantaneous microbial screening assays that is capable of identifying the microbial content of food samples (bacteria, fungi, viruses) in less than 30 min without using antibodies, enzymes or equipment using bionanotechnology. The technology is based on specific microbial coating with gold nanoparticles, named \"plasmonic cell nanocoating\" (US Patent Pending # 62/287,894 (Jan. 27th, 2016), where gold nanoparticles are used to target specific surface phylogenetic markers at the surface of the microorganisms and induce a visible colorimetric change in the sample solution. The same technology was successfully applied to lateral flow assays using a newly developed hand-held device to separate and concentrate the sample and allow a detection limit lower than 100 cfu/mL (US Patent Pending # 62/287,892 (Jan. 27th, 2016). We hope that this technology will provide an effective tool for rapid decision making to reduce food spoilage and food poisoning. Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 63 Building Antimicrobial Resistance (Amr) Capacity in Cariforum Countries R Ahern1, A Hoet2 1Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, San Jose, Vazquez de Coronado, San Isidro, Costa Rica; 2Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA Based on a specific need identified by the Region, a project entitled \"Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in Agriculture\" was developed in collaboration with the Ohio State University (OSU), College of Veterinary Medicine. Twenty-seven professionals were trained from the fifteen CARIFORUM Countries on Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Agriculture during June and December, 2015. This training was specially designed and customized for official veterinarians, diagnosticians, epidemiologists and other public health professionals from different countries in the Caribbean. The main objectives of the program were to provide foundational and applied knowledge on the use of antibiotics and related antimicrobial agents in different animal production systems and to understand the emergence and epidemiology of AMR in agriculture. The impact of AMR on the health of humans, animals and the environment, as well as on international trade and commerce was emphasized. In addition, course participants were trained in the establishment or enhancement of surveillance and monitoring systems for AMR in zoonotic and foodborne pathogens. One outcome of the in-person training was the development of a multi-country pilot project as the first step to contribute in the establishment of a Regional Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance system for the Caribbean. The overall purpose of these pilots is to establish an AMR baseline, while expanding the laboratory capacity and expertise in the respective countries. The pilot project is expected to start in June, 2016. 84 Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 64 Epidemiology, Impact, Prevention and Control of Nipah Encephalitis in Bangladesh: A Systematic Review of One Health Issue M Asaduzzaman1, S Mahmood2 1International Centre for diarrheal disease research, Dhaka, Bangladesh 2Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR), Dhaka, Bangladesh Introduction: Nipah virus poses an eminent threat in Bangladesh & the region as it encounters almost yearly outbreak since 2001. The objective of this review is to summarize the epidemiology &control of Nipah encephalitis. Method: We searched three different databases- Pubmed, Web of Science & Google Scholar using different appropriate search terms mixing the Boolean operators that yielded 144, 113 &1530 articles respectively. We screened the titles first for relevance & later abstracts. 47 articles met our criteria &were finally reviewed. A literature matrix was formed in Excel for compilation & analysis. Results: Unlike Malaysian outbreak, person to person transmission occurred in Bangladesh leaving humans most vulnerable. Infections were reported in domesticated pigs, dogs & cats in South Asia. Serological study in Bangladesh showed 6.5%, 4.3% &44.2% seroprevalence in cattle, goat & pig respectively. Pteropus bat plays a key role in Nipah transmission. Risk factors include drinking raw date palm sap contaminated with bat urine or faeces, eating half-eaten bat saliva laden fruit & close contact or involvement in burial of cases. It mostly occurred during winter (date palm sap harvesting season). Nipah occurred within the \"Nipah belt\" & had a high case fatality (> 70%). Avoiding raw date palm sap & drinking sap from trees protected with bamboo skirt remain the principle preventive measures along with strict infection control in hospitals to prevent secondary cases. Conclusion: Extensive knowledge of this emerging zoonosis is the key for prevention. Multisectoral intervention through One Health approach can prevent this deadly disease. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 65 Cost of Illness in Diarrheal Diseases among Under Five Children: A Gender Biased Attitude of Parents in Bangladesh M Asaduzzaman A Akter International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh Background: Diarrhea is a common cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in Bangladesh. The purpose of the study is to identify the gender discrepancy made by the parents for the cost of illness in diarrheal diseases among under five children. Methods: The parents or the guardians of 30 male children and 30 female children were interviewed at homes who were treated for diarrhea in a diarrheal treatment center in Dhaka city. The interview was done within 15 days of discharge to avoid the recall bias. The total and average out of pocket payment were calculated. Result: Results show that parents spend more for male children during diarrheal disease treatment. The average out of pocket payment for male child was 624.57 Bangladeshi taka (BDT) or 7.97 USD which was 515.87 BDT (6.58 USD) for female child for each episode of diarrheal disease. The average out of pocket payment for under five children was 570.22 BDT (7.27 USD) Conclusion: Further study is required to ascertain in detail why parents are spending more for male children during diarrheal disease treatment. The health policy of the country should consider this gender issue regarding the prevention and control measures of any disease of importance. Besides, to reduce the cost of diarrheal disease, different types of vaccine like Rotavirus vaccine, Cholera vaccine would be the suitable options. 85 Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 66 Climate and Health: Observations and Modeling the Impact of Climate Parameters on Seasonal Malaria Outbreaks in Senegal I Diouf Laboratoire de Physique de l'Atmosphere et de l'Oc, Dakar, Senegal An extensive literature survey shown that climate has an important impact on malaria, a vector-borne disease which is a public health problem, particularly in the Sub-Saharan Africa. This study has an important component of simulations of malaria parameters using the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM). Malaria model outputs are compared with observed malaria cases recorded by the National Malaria Control Program in Senegal. The different reanalysis datasets used to 20th century reanalysis, NCEP reanalysis, ERA40, and ERA Interim. The simulated malaria parameters are EIR (Entomological Inoculation Rates), HBR (Human Biting Rate), and Nm (Number of adult mosquitoes). It is found that in Senegal, high malaria transmission season takes place from September to November with a peak in October corresponding to two months after the peak of rainfall in August. Also, the spatial distribution of malaria has been characterized. Observed malaria data and simulated malaria outputs are consistent. Furthermore, we investigate climate change impacts on malaria for two RCP scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from the baseline period (1971-2000) to the near future (2020s) and in the medium future (2050s) to the long-term (2100s). The Coupled malaria model to GCMs shown malaria increasing from the north to the southern part of Senegal. The epidemic belt is generally pushed too far in the south and very low incidence for the northern part of Senegal is consistently simulated. These findings taking account climate conditions could be useful for climate services, end-users, researchers and decision makers in malaria prevention in Senegal. Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 67 Improving Consumer Acceptance of Sugar-Free Jam through Flavoromics GA Dubrow, DG Peterson University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Fruit spreads are a broadly consumed category of foods, with over one billion dollars in annual sales within the United States. However, due to the high sugar content of traditional jams, diabetic consumers and consumers following calorie-restricted diets are unable to consume these products within the constraints of their diets. Although sugar-free and low-sugar spreads offer an alternative to traditional spreads for consumers, current products are plagued by flavor defects not present in traditional spreads. These flavor defects lead to low consumer acceptance of sugar-free spreads, making it more likely that consumers may choose to consume traditional products in spite of dietary restrictions. In order to improve consumer acceptance of sugar-free spreads, a fusion of food sensory science and metabolomics, termed Flavoromics, has been used to understand chemical differences between traditional and sugar-free products which may contribute to these flavor defects. Compounds significantly different between product types can be isolated, recombined with jams, and analyzed using consumer sensory panels to determine if they have a causal relationship with acceptance. Using these techniques, compounds which modulate perceived acidity and contribute to a sense of \"full\" flavor in fruit jams have been discovered. Further work is ongoing. 86 Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 68 Challenges and Opportunities for the Small-Scale Pork Production in Southeast Asia T Meeyam, D Pichpol; Veterinary Public Health Centre for Asia Pacific (VPHCAP), Excellent Center of Veterinary Public Health, Chiang Mai University, Mae-Hia, Muang, Chiang Mai, Thailand Pork production has been rapidly growing and considered as a major meat consumption in many countries in Southeast Asia. The pork processing requires standardization which is currently in a transition state in some countries. The objective of this study is to identify the challenges and opportunities for small-scale pork processing plants in Thailand, Vietnam and Philippines. Knowledge, attitude and perception were identified among stakeholders. Semi- structure in depth interview, focus group discussion and checklists were applied to the stakeholders based on each context. The results of this study indicated the differences and some similarities of processing lines, stakeholders, challenges and opportunities in each countries. Knowledge and attitude of hygiene operation during the process have been identified as an important factor and mostly influences by the workers. Similar to this, the operating cost and enforcement of regulations are the most challenging factor for development of standardization. The demand and perception of consumers plays an important role, and could be the opportunity for improvement of the pork production chain. Team Science - 69 Building Capacity on Veterinary Service for Asia through Education, Research and Service T Meeyam; Veterinary Public Health Centre for Asia Pacific (VPHCAP), Excellent Center of Veterinary Public Health, Chiang Mai University, Mae-Hia, Muang, Chiang Mai, Thailand The Veterinary Public Health Centre for Asia Pacific (VPHCAP) is a knowledge and collaborative regional centre in capacity building for veterinary service particularly in Southeast Asia and South Asia. With 12 years of experiences, the ultimate goal of the center is to provide academic information and technical know-how to support public health veterinarians in the region for safe trading and public health wellbeing. VPHCAP offers the International Master of Veterinary Public Health Program (MVPH) which has been developed to strengthen capacity of veterinary service in the region and to produce graduates from Asia countries to have all-round competency in Veterinary Public Health. MVPH also creates network in region level to control, prevent and resolve diseases caused by epidemic diseases, zoonoses and food hygiene, with an emphasis on quality control and safety of food of animal-origin from farms to consumers including environmental hygiene. The MVPH curriculum encourages the student-centered atmosphere and concentrates on universal knowledge to resolve the problems in their own countries and region. Recently, there are 71 graduates in MVPH alumni network, from 6 batches and from 15 countries in Asia Pacific including Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Sri Lanka, China, Bhutan, Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh. The MVPH Alumni Network is created to maintain connections between their intuitions in order to reinforce international academic, research and collaboration for transferring knowledge, experiences, problems and taking appropriate action on food safety and zoonoses in the Asia Pacific region. 87 Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 70 One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit: A University-Government Partnership to Inform Policy and Strengthen Cross-Sectoral Coordination for Infectious Disease Threats K Pelican, T Dutcher, H Kassenborg, O Prasarnphanich, A Hunt, J Bender, L Valeri, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Coordination and collaboration across human, animal, and environmental health sectors are essential to address infectious disease threats like Avian Influenza or Ebola. While progress is being made, many evaluation and assessment efforts focus on individual sectors. Additional tools are needed that strengthen cross-sectoral response systems and policy infrastructure. The One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit (OH-SMART), jointly developed by the University of Minnesota and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is a step-wise, structured approach by which a network of agencies visualize and review their processes for interdisciplinary coordination of complex issues at the human-animal-environmental interface. OH-SMART has been used in the US to train state and federal agency personnel from over 35 states. Trainees have then gone on to use the tool to improve infectious disease response including developing a plan for outbreaks at petting zoos and strengthening state response for Ebola. The tool has also been used to strengthen cross-sectoral response to zoonotic diseases including leptospirosis, anthrax, rabies and avian influenza in 6 provinces and 2 districts in Indonesia. Most recently, it was used to facilitate an After Action Review of the cross-sectoral Avian Influenza response in Minnesota, where participants identified best practices and prioritized future actions to strengthen the system of prevention, early detection, and rapid cross-sectoral response. Minnesota Agencies are currently using the results to revise State Emergency Response Plans. Future implementation includes expansion of the work to the Lower Mekong region of Southeast Asia as well as further expansion of its use in Indonesia. Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 71 The DriBank\u00ae Container: an Effective Room-Temperature Solution TR Sadler; DriBank Labs, Minneapolis, MN, USA Laboratory specimen maintenance typically requires processes such as cold-chain storage or chemical preservation, which consequently have significant direct and indirect associated costs. An alternative room-temperature solution not requiring powered equipment, toxic chemicals, or coatings was developed. Several independent organizations have evaluated its effectiveness in preserving key bio-macromolecules such as RNA, subsequently stabilizing them for storage at room temperature for months. Here, we present data on preservation of bio-macromolecules from a variety of specimens at room temperature using the DriBank\u00ae container. Evaluators compared preserving, storing, and/or shipping their specimens with the DriBank\u00ae container at ambient conditions with traditional practices. Bio-macromolecules included DNA extracted from whole organisms (acheta), RNA aliquots from MCF7 cultured cell extracts, and viral antigens from blood sera (primate and porcine). Specimen samples were preserved with the DriBank\u00ae, stored at room temperature from weeks to months, and analyzed at different time points. Analyses were conducted in replicate using established methodologies such as Arrayed Immuno-Multiplexing, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and electrophoresis. Sample integrity was maintained with no detectable/significant differences from controls. RNA aliquots shipped or stored at ambient conditions as well as viral antigens from blood sera were equivalent to their frozen counterparts. Similar results were observed with DNA extracts; more than 50% of DNA fragment 5kb were preserved. We deduce from independent evaluations that the DriBank\u00ae container is an effective solution for preserving, storing, and/or shipping a variety of lab specimens at ambient temperature, potentially creating significant cost reductions, and improving workflow efficiency. 88 Role of Science in Formulation of Local and Global Health Policy - 72 Comparative Genomics of Archived Pyrazinamide Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex Isolates From Uganda S Wanzala1, J Nakavuma2, J Bender1, D Travis1, P Kia2, S Ogwang3, S 1College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, USA; 2College of Veterinary Medicine, Makerere University, Uganda; 3Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) Mengo, Uganda Bovine tuberculosis is a 'neglected zoonosis' yet its contribution to the proportion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infections in humans is not fully known. In a developing country like Uganda, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTC) testing is routinely carried out with the use of glycerol as a carbon source for the organism but this inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium bovis, if present in a sample. Samples routinely collected for tuberculosis (TB) testing are usually sputum yet M. bovis is generally isolated from extra-pulmonary sites like lymph nodes. We undertook a retrospective study on archived MTC isolates in a large reference laboratory in Uganda to determine the proportion of M. bovis isolates. We found 1.5 % of the pyrazinamide resistant samples to be M. bovis; this was low but expected since over 80% of the samples were from sputum and were cultured using glycerol as a carbon source. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis helped us determine the extent of diversity and relatedness of our isolates to other MTCs. We also defined a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) set that can be used to differentiate the MTC group of organisms. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 73 Reproductive Behaviors of Stray Dogs in Flocks and Behavioral Changes Observed after Castration: with Emphasized Public Health E Ak\u00e7ay, AB Arkun Department of Animal Reproduction and AI, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ankarara, Ankara, Turkey. The study is focused on the possible changes observed in the reproductive behavioral patterns of stray dogs following the castration procedure and to see if this changes effect social behavioral patterns of dogs towards people in intercommunal places adoptively. Three seperate dog packs in three seperate zones were included in the study. The study consisted a total of 23 dogs of which 12 were female and 11 were male. The sniffing, approching, licking, barking, courting, mounting, biting, aggression, sign marking behaviors of dogs, their interest towards people and other animals are observed for 12 weeks pre-castration and 16 weeks post-castration. The observation reports were evaluated weekly and frequency of specific behaviours were noted. During the 16 weeks following the castration, a decrease in frequency of sniffing, approaching, licking, barking, courting, leaping and marking behaviors was observed in most of the dogs. Biting and aggressive behavior of dogs did not present significant changes. However the dogs showed an increased \"positive interest\" towards environmental factors and people, a decrease was not observed in aggressive behaviour in dogs which were aggressive before castration. As a result, a decrease in reproductive behaviours and an increase interest towards people and other environmental factors were observed in castrated stray dogs in packs during the 16 weeks following the operation. 89 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 74 Applications of Bayesian Phylodynamic Methods in Disease Pandemics: Evolutionary History of Foot and Mouth Disease Serotype O Vp1 Gene in the Middle East and Northern Africa MA Alkhamis1, B Moore2 1Department of Veterinary population medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA 2Evolution and ecology, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) remains one of the most contagious diseases of domestic livestock worldwide and causes severe economic losses within affected countries. Presently, FMDV maintains an endemic state in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA), with frequent outbreaks across the region. In this study, we performed analyses of publicly available sequence data of the FMDV serotype O (FMDV-O) VP1 gene segment using different coalescent phylodynamic models within a Bayesian statistical framework to infer the evolutionary and geographic history of this virus within and among the MENA region from 1969 to 2014. Our results indicate that the FMDV-O experienced a substantially elevated evolutionary rate associated with the introduction of the Pan-Asia strain into the MENA region in 1990. Regional-level analyses indicate that the FMDV-O entered the MENA from Eastern Asia; where this is the most significant geographic route of viral migration into the MENA region. However, country-level analyses indicate that Turkey is the point of entry of the FMDV-O into the MENA; where significant dispersal routes of the virus were inferred between Turkey and three different MENA countries. Finally, our analyses indicate that cattle are the most probable host associated with the transmission and maintenance of the virus in the MENA; while sheep, goats and pigs had insignificant role in between species transmission. We demonstrate the ability of phylodynamic models to inform the molecular surveillance and control of the FMDV-O virus in high-risk regions, and guide preparedness in neighboring FMDV-free countries or regions. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 75 Research Quality Assurance: A Strategy for Improving Research Reproducibility R Davies; Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Scientific research is the fundamental process used to inform public policy and establish the economics of health. This process is reliable if research data are accurate and reproducible. Quality Assurance is defined as a system for ensuring a desired level of quality in the development, production, or delivery of products and services (Dictonary.com). The products of scientific research are data and inference, and data reproducibility is the critical measure of whether a desired level of quality has been reached. While quality systems are employed to support data quality in many scientific environments, they are rare in basic research settings. This leaves scientists without the training and infrastructure needed to achieve research accountability and facilitate research reproducibility. This gap is especially unfortunate as public skepticism of scientific discovery is increasing in light of demonstrated inability to replicate results, growing numbers of publication retractions, inadequate peer review, and the increasing reports of error and misconduct events. The University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine has initiated pilot programs to integrate recommended 'Good Research Practices, GRP' into collegiate research environments by providing research QA training and support. Examples of GRP include the use of standard operating procedures spanning the breadth of research activities, the management of equipment, reagents, and supplies, good documentation procedures, and the management of research data. In this poster, models for GRP integration at the individual, program and consortium level will be described and freely available training resources will be identified. 90 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 76 Modeling the Transboundary Risk of Feed Ingredients Contaminated with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Scott Dee1, Casey Neill1, State University, Manhattan, KS, USA; 4University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA This study describes a model developed to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated swine feed ingredients and the effect of two mitigation strategies during a simulated transport event from China to the US. Ingredients imported to the USA from China, including organic & conventional soybeans and meal, lysine hydrochloride, D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D & E, choline, carriers (rice hulls, corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline, were inoculated with PEDV. Control ingredients, and treatments (ingredients plus a liquid antimicrobial (SalCURB, Kemin Industries (LA) or a 2% custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA)) were tested. The model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013. To mimic conditions on land and sea, historical temperature and percent relative humidity (% RH) data were programmed into an environmental chamber which stored all containers. Across control (non-treated) ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional), Vitamin D, lysine hydrochloride and choline chloride. In contrast, viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA. These results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients using a model simulating shipment from China to the US. This is proof of concept suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients could serve as transboundary risk factors for PEDV, along with the identification of effective mitigation options. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 77 The Western Food Environment; Why Nutrition Policy Is Not Working Mallory Franklin, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Since 1980, the U.S. government has published The Dietary Guidelines for Americans every five years. This set of recommendations is generated by a council of experts and researchers in the field of nutrition. Nutrition advice from these professionals has not change much over the past thirty-five years. Every dietary guideline recommends you eat a large variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and recommends you avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar. With such basic and consistent guidelines, it is still very difficult for Americans to obtain a healthy diet. One aspect of our food environment that does not get much attention is how our society gets information about nutrition. Most of the nutrition information the public is exposed to does not come from dietary guidelines that are carefully based in current nutrition discoveries from experts in the field. Rather, society gets information from media and food industry advertisements that often exploit the findings of a single study for their own benefit. This causes a perception that nutrition is rapidly changing and contradicting itself, leaving the public confused, frustrated, and uncertain about what constitutes a healthy diet. Therefore, our food environment cultivates a sense of mistrust around nutrition, rendering basic dietary guidelines less effective. Nutrition research is being misrepresented for media propaganda and food industry profit that is undermining our nutrition policy efforts to help Americans eat a nutritious diet. 91 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 78 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health in South Asia Using a One Health Framework Focussed on Priority Endemic Zoonotic Diseases Neumann EJ, Jolly PD, McKenzie JS, Dorjee S, and Morris RS; Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand Zoonotic diseases are a threat to people's livelihoods in the developing world. Improving the capacity of governments to respond to these threats require the combined efforts of experts in animal, human, and wildlife diseases. Massey University is implementing a three-year program in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal using a One Health approach for design and economic evaluation of disease control policies for endemic zoonotic diseases. The program combines formal training in epidemiology and economics with practical application of the acquired skills. In each country, six medical doctors and veterinarians from the human, animal, and wildlife health sectors participate full-time in a fellowship that includes Master's level training in One Health epidemiology and biosecurity. Systematic assessments of existing data are completed for four zoonotic diseases in each country, followed by field studies designed to provide missing information about each disease. Novel software that integrates epidemiological and economic analyses allows for structured policy evaluation and identification of appropriate One Health control strategies. The formal training component of the fellowship is 80% complete and field studies are currently underway. This fellowship integrates capacity building and collaboration at both individual and government institution levels. Working across animal, public health, and wildlife sectors, both within and between countries, national policy recommendations for each selected disease based on evidence that is supported by systematic epidemiological and economic analysis of real data from each country will be developed; policy recommendations will be created in consultation with the government institutions responsible for zoonotic disease control in each country. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 79 Assessment of Zoonotic Disease Surveillance Alternatives to Optimize Effectiveness and Cost by Simulating Disease Simultaneously in Wildlife, Livestock, and Humans Neumann EJa, Wang Sb, Morris RSc, Cannon RMd, dConsultant, Warrnambool, Australia Emergent zoonotic diseases can create social and economic disruptions in affected countries. Timely detection is critical in minimizing these disruptions and objective approaches are needed for predicting the effectiveness of surveillance strategies. A spatially-explicit, spatiotemporal model was developed using Interspread Plus software, to simulate spread of a hypothesized zoonotic disease 'Austeria' amongst feral pigs, domestic pigs, and humans in Australia. Eight surveillance strategies were designed, each focusing on different strata of affected pig or human populations. Variants of each strategy were implemented at high, medium, and low levels of intensity and sensitivity (8*3*3 = 72 sub-strategies). The effectiveness of each sub-strategy was measured by (i) days until outbreak detection, (ii) proportion of outbreaks detected, and (iii) number of farms infected. The most efficient approach (RB2) involved risk-based sampling of commercial pig farms in regions having substantial overlap of commercial and feral pigs and the least efficient approach (FPB) involved collection of blood samples from harvested feral pigs. Strategy RB2 implemented with high intensity and sensitivity detected the outbreak after 108 days, detected 93% of simulated outbreaks, and resulted in 23 farms becoming infected. The FPB strategy implemented with low intensity and sensitivity detected the outbreak after 281 days, detected 3% of outbreaks, and resulted in 2,515 farms becoming infected. Choosing the 'best' combination of surveillance sub-strategies can be economically optimized using additional software (OptiSurv). Simulation of disease spread simultaneously among and between wild and domestic animals, and people was conducted enabling analysis of surveillance strategies involving humans, animals, or both. 92 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 80 What if You Have One Science? Or Even One Policy? AZIZ ARDA SANCAK, HASAN ALBASAN, EBUBEKR CEYLAN; ANKARA UNIVERSITY, ANKARA, TURKEY We all agreed on the challenge of extending our productive lives and focused on wellness, mobility, and cognition in maintaining a high quality of life for as long as possible. The One Health concept recognizes that the health of humans is connected to the health of animals and the environment. Likewise, \"one health one medicine\" shows the world how to work together. This synergism only can be achieved by accelerating science for one health and one medicine. This idea brought about the second idea of \"one health one science\". Besides the potential outcomes can only be possible by established regional and global policies, particularly the political and the ethical and social decisions we make, to protect environment, food chain that are global effects to human health. Therefore, at last this idea birthed the idea of \"One Policy\" (speak one voice which equates to one policy). We all expect when the policies are properly, and especially globally implemented it will help protect and save our lives in the present and the future, consequently \"Better policies for better lives\". However there is a close relation between policies and trade. Nevertheless, there are always concerns; who will be making full use of the advantages of global trade? Because trade policies are inherently unequal and developing countries seldom experience rise in wellbeing but increasing unemployment, poverty, and income inequality. In conclusion \"Public health, animal health and security sector must speak with one voice on the need to strengthen health systems.\" However, climbing the stairs from \"one health, one medicine\" to \"one medicine one science\" and eventually \"one science, one policy\" opens an issue with the argument that we need fundamental change in how we think about the future and how long that future might last 'this proves to be very, very complex!' Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 81 Risks versus Benefits of Controlling Vector-Borne Diseases Using Insecticides: a Case Example in South Africa L A Thompson1, Y Ikenaka1, Y B Yohannes1, J J van Vuren2, V Wepener3, N J Smit3, W Vlok4, S M M Nakayama1, Mizukawa1 and M Ishizuka1 1Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan; of South Africa; 4BioAssets Consultants, Sterpark, Polokwane, South Africa Insecticides are a highly effective method of controlling diseases spread by insect vectors, with benefits including low cost and ease of use. To control malaria, WHO recommends using both insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). DDT was used extensively in agriculture during the 1940s/1950s before adverse effects in wildlife prompted a ban in many countries. This insecticide is persistent in the environment, bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in the food chain, and health risks are reported in both animals and people. However, due to its efficacy, use of this pesticide for vector control is still permitted by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Meat samples and eggs were collected from free-ranging chickens in an area of the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, where DDT is used regularly in an IRS program. Although concentrations of DDT and its metabolites were below published acceptable daily intake levels, calculation of carcinogenic hazard ratios showed a potential increased risk to human health through consumption of these chicken products. Where do we go from here? The first step uses science to assess effectiveness of disease control, but we also need to monitor contaminants in the environment and study at grass roots to understand how these interact with people and animals. Can we store and use chemicals more safely? Can we lower their risk? With that knowledge, we can weigh up risks versus benefits, and make informed decisions about improved, safer control methods for vector-borne diseases such as malaria. 93 Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 82 Rural Design as a Link between Science and Society Dewey Thorbeck, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Gaps in our knowledge about complex biomedical and environmental problems limit our ability to develop durable solutions in the spirit of One Medicine One Health.... Compartmentalized science often misses crucial interactions and science often is not effectively involved into public policy debate.... If science is crucial to create public policies for sustaining human, animal, and environmental health the science needs to be integrated and articulated so that it is impartial, useful and accepted. (iCOMOS 2016) Evidence-based rural design is a problem-solving process that can improve the linkage between science and society. It is a process that recognizes that human and natural systems are inextricably coupled in continuous cycles of mutual influence and response. It is a methodology for holistically crossing borders and connecting issues to nurture new design thinking and collaborative problem solving to create a better and prosperous future for humans, animals, and environments - locally and globally. Rural design can be instrumental in seeking ways that teams of scientists (agricultural, medical, and social) can better bring scientific evidence to a societal problem and in turn raise new issues that science needs to resolve. It is a process to nurture collaboration and cooperation among rural communities to shape the landscape to provide and integrated system of humans, animals, and environments that meets the needs of people in the present without compromising for the future. This poster session will outline the design methodology to illustrate how rural design can better link science with society while integrating human, animal, and environmental wellness. Science Informing Public Policy and Economics of Health - 83 Medical Waste Pollution from Sinop Sarikum Beach of the Black Sea, Turkey Ayah Vine, Levent Bat, Sinop University, Sinop, Turkey Sarikum Lagoon which is one of the significant wetlands of the Black Sea has been announced as Nature Reserved Area in 1987. Lagoon and its surroundings is a tourism route for local tourists. However, Lagoon beach is exposed to a significant accumulation of solid waste both with sea currents and the influence of the prevailing winds due to its geographical location. This study is a part of the project named \u00abStatus of Sinop Sarkum Lagoon Marine Litter under the Scope of Marine Strategy Framework Directive: A Case Study\u00bb and numbered which it is financially supported by T\u00dcBTAK. In this context encountered medical waste results is shared during the beach litter survey. Sampling stations were selected from 4 sections of the beach's different location for four seasons. Within each sampling area, all debris items were collected, categorized and the possible usage (medical, sanitary, etc.) were recorded. The results indicated that the medical waste proportion to the entire litter item is 2-4% and most of them were composed of syringes and needles, injection containers and serum containers. Also medicine bottles, insulin shots and inhaler drugs were found considerably. In the possible usage category, medical waste were occurred only a small proportion but its possible danger is unignorably. It reduces tourism, recreation and revenue for sea-side cities and causes injuries. Moreover, some medical waste in the sea may be contaminated with pathogens, toxins etc. Moreover they are passed along food chains in the sea and can effect on sea life and human health. 94 Team Science - 84 Supranational Organizations of Veterinary Education in South America Daniel Picasso2, Republica; 2University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota and Ministry of Livestock Agriculture and Fisheries, Montevideo, Uruguay In the last century, the South American (SA) countries created, increased, and consolidated their Veterinary Schools. Transnational veterinary organizations raised in the last 25 years with the aim of enhance, enrich and complement each country research and educational capacities, addressing the region as a whole. Here, we will present current veterinary education organizations existing in the SA region. SAPUVETNET is a Veterinary Public Health Network of universities including fifteen countries aiming to improve veterinary education using updated teaching methods (on-line repository, field practices, integrated learning). Association of Montevideo Group Universities (AUGM), integrates public, autonomous, and self-governing universities of southern SA since 1991. Its committee, with an interdisciplinary approach, addresses animal heath strategic areas for sharing and exchange human and training resources. Since 1992, the Federation of Pan-American Veterinary Schools (FPFECV) is working to promote cooperation developing regional CVs, professional certifications, and school accreditations. Veterinary School Association was created in 1993 by the MERCOSUR countries. Currently, it has members from public and private universities, which discuss veterinary education structure, namely competences, programs' homologation, and international veterinary-accreditation. CEBASEV (Buenos Aires Center for Veterinary Services training and education) is a non-university education center created by Argentinian organizations. It serves as OIE reference center for Official Veterinary Services capacity building in the region, since 2006. In our opinion, there is overlapping of objectives and activities of these organizations, so we need to focus on integrate their efforts, to a more efficient achievement of goals. Team Science - 85 The Path towards an International One Health Workforce John Deen, Katey Pelican; University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA Outbreaks of novel diseases such as Ebola in West Africa can be described in similar manners to an agent host interaction. Though we focus a great deal on the characteristics of the agent in creating such a devastating disease, the focus on the host response has, in some ways, had less publicity. Yet, it is the ability of a country to prevent, detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases that better determines the outcome. It has been difficult for the general public to understand that though an agent such as Ebola can occur in the United States, the likelihood of an outbreak is much lower due to the indigenous capacity of its workforce and support of institutional structures. USAID's One Health Workforce Project focuses on creating adequate one health workforce is to support countries in developing that \"immunity\" to novel agents. Capacities need to involve and integrate a broad range of competencies that cannot be concentrated in any one profession or governmental agency. Thus the focus of this project is not only on personnel and their skills but their ability to work together as a team. 95 Team Science - 86 Paradigms and Pitfalls within Team Science: Case Studies on How to Fund and Evaluate Transdisciplinary Action Research Bruno Sobral, Claire Tucker; Colorado State University, Ft. Collins, CO, USA In its inaugural year, the One Health Institute at Colorado State University provided grant funding to seven projects, with the goal to make innovation in health real and sustainable though the institutionalization of community-engaged transdisciplinary action research. These projects represent interests of all eight colleges at CSU, and teams are required to use systems thinking approaches to promote intersections and interfaces across disciplines. Research teams are formed with individuals from diverse backgrounds, representing CSU faculty, government agencies, non-profits, and community members. Topics range from anti-microbial resistance to food systems to the reintroduction of bison onto the Colorado plains, and funding allotments range from $15,000-$100,000. The One Health Institute is currently conducting an extensive portfolio review to determine how these teams are faring, both within the context of their original grant and beyond, as they seek to secure further funding. This poster will present the seven projects as case-based examples of how team science functions on a day-to-day basis. We will share our metrics for success, and highlight key moments of pivot and problem. The geographic, organizational, and analytic scope of each project will be emphasized, and compared to the initial financial investment. With the data and insight generated from this portfolio review, the One Health Institute will provide invaluable information on best practices within team science, as well as how to set reasonable expectations for \"Return on Investment\" for transdisciplinary action research. Water at the Interface of Health, Economics and Environment - 87 Dual Detection of Nitrate and Mercury in Water using Disposable Electrochemical Nanosensors Minh-Phuong N. Bui, John Brockgreitens, Snober Ahmed and Abdennour Abbas; University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA It is extensively recognized that heavy metals are the cause of many disorders in plants, animals, and humans as these metals bio-accumulate in food chains and threaten human and ecological health. Mercury is considered one of the most hazardous heavy metal pollutants because of its toxicity and the mobility of its species throughout different environmental systems. Nitrate contamination also continues to be a problem for the world given the increased use of nitrate fertilizers in agricultural fields. Here, we present a disposable, cost effective electrochemical paper-based nanosensor for the detection of both nitrate and mercury ions in lake water and contaminated agricultural runoff. Disposable carbon paper electrodes were functionalized with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs served as a catalyst for the reduction of nitrate ions using differential pulse voltammetry techniques. The AuNPs also served as nucleation sites for mercury ions. The SeNPs served to reinforce this mercury ion nucleation due to the high binding affinity of selenium to mercury. Differential pulse stripping voltammetry techniques were used to further enhance mercury ion accumulation on the modified electrode. The fabricated electrode was characterized by SEM, EDS and electrochemistry techniques. The obtained results show that the PEG-SH/SeNPs/AuNPs modified carbon paper electrode has a dual functionality in that it can detect both nitrate and mercury ions without any interference with a limit of detection of 8.6 \u00b5M and 1.0 ppb, respectively. The modified electrode was used to measure nitrate and mercury in lake water around Minnesota area.
