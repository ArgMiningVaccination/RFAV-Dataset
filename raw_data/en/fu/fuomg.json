Novavax Vaccine Available to those age 12 and older who have not received any other COVID-19 vaccine. Bivalent Booster Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, bivalent booster is authorized for use in people ages 6 months and older. It is administered at least 2 months after either completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine or receipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, bivalent is authorized for use as a single booster dose in individuals 6 months of age and older. It is administered at least 2 months after completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine or receipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. First and Second Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is available to individuals age 6 months and older. Mix-and-Match Booster Guidance: The dosage for the 6 months to 4 years age group is one-tenth of the adult dose. The dosage for the 5 to 11 age group is one-third of the adult dose. The dosage for 12 to 18 age group is the same as the adult dosage. A second vaccine dose should be administered 21 days later for those ages 5 to 18. They will be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of vaccine. For people 6 months through 4 years, the bivalent vaccine is recommended for the 3rd dose in the primary series at least 8 weeks later. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is available to individuals age 6 months to 5 years and those age 18 and older. A second vaccine dose should be administered 28 days later. The Novavax vaccine is available to individuals age 12 and older. Novavax is protein-based, which is a traditional type of vaccine that has been widely used for decades. It is a different type of vaccine than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, which use mRNA technology. It is available to those who have not received a previous COVID-19 vaccine. A second dose should be administered three to eight weeks later. Individuals who are eligible for a booster dose may select which vaccine they receive. The eligible populations and dosing intervals for the heterologous (\"mix and match\") booster dose are the same as those authorized for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination. The booster dose (0.25mL) of the Moderna vaccine should be used whenever it is given as a booster. A different vaccine may not be used as part of the primary series. Verification of Eligibility: To expedite the registration process, individuals are asked to bring their COVID-19 vaccination card showing their first two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.
