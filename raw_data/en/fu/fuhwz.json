[Research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b02023) indicates that a lot of toxins actually enter humans through breathing in household dust. So for example, toxic PFAS from the stain-resistant treatment on your [couch](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-sofa-couch/) slowly work their way off of the sofa and onto your floors and other surfaces, where they stick to the dust. As that dust gets agitated and released into the air, you breathe it in\u2014along with the PFAS. The same could be said for things like formaldehyde, phthalates, flame retardants, and other toxins that end up in our homes. This is one of the reasons why regularly wet dusting your home and just generally keeping it clean is a relatively easy way to decrease your toxin exposure. But... a lot of household cleaning products contain problematic ingredients, too! So in this article, we're going to talk about some of the most common toxic ingredients to watch out for in all-purpose cleaners and then give you our favorite brands for non-toxic cleaning products that you can feel safe using.

Almost all traditional cleaning products contain \"Fragrance\" as one of their ingredients. The fact is that this isn't actually one ingredient; there are actually almost 4,000 different chemicals that can legally be included in a product under that \"fragrance\" umbrella! Some of those ingredients are completely safe, while others are classified as carcinogens, allergens, VOCs, and endocrine disruptors (including things like phthalates and parabens). The problem is that because of the lack of transparency that this loophole allows, it's basically impossible for consumers to know the truth about what's in their products. So when you're shopping for a non-toxic option for your all-purpose cleaner, look for a brand that is either fragrance-free or clearly lists its fragrance ingredients on the label. Of course, some conscious companies use essential oils as a way to provide a nice, clean scent in a safer and more natural way. If you want to take a deeper dive into this issue, [you can do that here](https://www.thefiltery.com/synthetic-fragrance-hidden-toxic-chemicals/). SLS/SLES Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are commonly used in soaps and cleaning products. They are used as surfactants, which create lather and help to help pull oil away from the surface you're trying to clean. The primary concern with SLS is that it can cause skin irritation. SLES is a less harsh option that tends to be more gentle on the skin... However, it's an ethoxylated ingredient, which can potentially be contaminated with a couple of carcinogenic ingredients due to the manufacturing process. (Ethoxylated ingredients are practically impossible to completely avoid, but it's something that may be worth trying to minimize when you can.) But there's really no reason to use either of these ingredients since there are safer alternatives available that work just as well. Triclosan Triclosan is actually a pesticide that used to be used in a lot of \"anti-bacterial\" products. It's a very problematic ingredient, linked to all kinds of [long-term health concerns](https://www.madesafe.org/triclosan/) like breast cancer and hormone disruption. Although it's still worth being aware of triclosan and keeping your eye out for it, the good news here is that it's actually been pulled out of almost all cleaning products (even more 'conventional' ones) in recent years. Quats This is another pesticide commonly used in traditional cleaning products, especially those that are labeled as \"anti-bacterial\" or \"anti-microbial.\" This is another group of chemicals that is [linked to](https://www.womensvoices.org/cleaning-with-pesticides-quit-the-quats/) skin and lung irritation as well as endocrine disruption (which can lead to infertility, birth defects, and more). These ingredients often have \"-onium chloride\" somewhere in the name. For example, the active ingredient in [Clorox's Bleach-Free Disinfecting Crisp Lemon All Purpose Cleaner ](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Clorox-Disinfecting-Crisp-Lemon-Bleach-Free-All-Purpose-Cleaner-32-fl-oz/304859896)is Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride. It's also worth noting that the instructions for this product say that \"All surfaces that come in contact with food must be rinsed with potable water,\" indicating that it's not really safe to use around your kitchen... (But also, who actually rinses surfaces after using an all-purpose cleaner on them in real life??) Synthetic Preservatives Ingredients like methylisothiazolinone and benziosothiazolinone are commonly found in cleaning products and soaps. These ingredients even sneak into some of the products that are marketed as \"green.\" However, these ingredients are irritants and have been known to cause things like rashes and/or exacerbate conditions like eczema. Not only that, but these ingredients are also [endocrine disrupters](https://endocrinedisruption.org/interactive-tools/tedx-list-of-potential-endocrine-disruptors/search-the-tedx-list#sname=methylisothiazolinone&searchfor=any&sortby=chemname&action=search&searchcats=all&sortby=chemname). What About Sustainability? Of course, environmental safety and human health go hand-in-hand. In addition to non-toxic ingredients, you may also want to consider the environmental impact of your cleaning products. Some other things you may want to look for are: - How low-waste is the cleaner (do they offer a plastic-free or refillable option)? - Is the formulation biodegradable? - Does the solution use plant-derived ingredients that are free from petroleum derivatives and sourced in a sustainable way? - Is the cleaner vegan and/or cruelty-free? The all-purpose cleaners listed below have many of these eco-friendly characteristics. Are you Cleaning, Disinfecting, or Both? It's worth noting here that cleaning and disinfecting/sanitizing are not always the same thing. Here is the difference according to the CDC: - Cleaning consists of the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. - Disinfecting consists of using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. In other words, you can clean a surface by wiping away all of the dirt and grease without actually killing the germs, bacteria, and viruses that exist on that surface. OR you can disinfect a surface simply by spraying it with a chemical (whether or not you actually wipe away the dirt and grime). Of course, many cleaning products are meant to do both. Obviously, there are going to be situations where disinfecting and sanitizing surfaces is the necessary or desired outcome (especially in the age of the pandemic, as we all know). However, some research indicates that [over-using disinfectants](https://www.womensvoices.org/2020/03/30/safer-disinfecting-at-home-in-the-times-of-coronavirus/) may contribute to antibiotic resistance, superbugs, and an overall decrease in immune function over time. Some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2082058/) also indicates that using anti-bacterial products isn't actually more effective in preventing disease when compared to \"normal\" cleaning products. There isn't necessarily a \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer when it comes to choosing between disinfectants or standard cleaning products (we use both at our house!), but it's simply something to be mindful of as you choose your products and clean your home. If and when you do use disinfectants, we recommend skipping the triclosan, quats, and other harsh chemicals and instead choose safer alternatives like hypochlorous acid (which is what [Force of Nature](https://www.thefiltery.com/force-of-nature-cleaner-review/) uses), alcohol, citric acid, or hydrogen peroxide.

[9 Elements](https://rstyle.me/+Iedy_f8EdmaPCf4YJ10e_w) (Best In-Store, Available at Target) Price: All-Purpose Spray Certifications: EPA Safer Choice Subscription? Not available I'm generally pretty skeptical about the \"natural\" and \"non-toxic\" brands that are available in stores (see below for more on that!), but the new(er) brand called 9 Elements, which is available at Target, is actually a pretty good option! It's got only 9 ingredients (hence the name). It does contain \"fragrance,\" but if you dig further into the [ingredient label](https://smartlabel.pg.com/00037000951018.html), you'll see that it actually only consists of lemon peel oil and limonene, which are commonly used in natural cleaning products (though they can be irritating for some!). So if you're at the store and trying to choose the best option, I recommend going with 9 Elements. In addition to their multi-purpose cleaning spray, they also carry laundry detergent and dish soap.

How Do You Make Non-Toxic All-Purpose Cleaner? (2 Easy DIY Recipes) If you're the type of person who'd rather make their own non-toxic cleaning products, here are a few super-easy recipes you can use to make your own natural cleaning products: Using Soap: - 2 cups of water (you can use tap, or distilled/filtered is even better) - 4 teaspoons castile soap (such as [Dr. Bronner's](https://thrivemarket.com/p/dr-bronners-liquid-castile-soap-organic-peppermint)) - 30-35 drops of the essential oil of your choice (ones with citric acid, such as lemon or grapefruit, tend to be better at cutting through grease as well as sanitizing) Using Vinegar: - 3 cups water - 1/2 cup white vinegar - 10-20 drops of the essential oil of your choice (It should be noted, however, that vinegar can damage certain surfaces, like natural stone, tile, and wood\u2014so be careful!) Tips for Using: - Use a glass bottle if you can - Store in a cool, dark place (some essential oils can oxidize if left in the sunlight) - Shake before each use A Closer Look At Other Popular \"Non-Toxic\" Cleaning Brands You may notice that there are a few other \"natural\" and \"non-toxic\" cleaners that aren't on this list... Brands like Method, Mrs. Meyers, and Seventh Generation have become almost as mainstream as the more 'conventional' brands like Windex and Clorox in recent years. The main problem with these brands is that some of their products are in fact non-toxic or even \"pretty good,\" while other products are just as bad as their conventional counterparts! This is problematic because it requires consumers to know a lot about hard-to-pronounce ingredients and do a bunch of research on each individual product before buying it... Most of us don't have time for that! In general, we'd say that these brands are better than most of the conventional brands... But they're definitely not the best. Let's take a look at some of the specific brands... Is Method Non-Toxic? Almost all of Method's products (the worst ones as well as the \"less bad\" ones) contain questionable things like several different ethoxylated ingredients, mystery fragrances, methylisothiazolinone (a known skin irritant and endocrine disrupter), and other random things like methylbenxyl acetate, which is a suspected hormone disruptor. Also, Method makes it relatively difficult to find their ingredients at all, which we don't like because we believe in full ingredient transparency. Consumers shouldn't have to dig and dig to find out what's in the products they're buying! Mrs. Meyer's Non-Toxic? Mrs. Meyer's products have a lot of the same problems that Method's do (although, they're generally a little bit better and they do prioritize transparency more than Method does). The main problems with Mrs. Meyer's ingredients are mystery fragrances, methylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone (known irritants), and a lot of ethoxylated ingredients. However, Mrs. Meyer's does at least indicate that their fragrances are made without phthalates or parabens. What About Seventh Generation? Seventh Generation is very similar to Method and Mrs. Meyer's. Some of their products are better than others, but a lot of them contain toxic methylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone. Their Free & Clear cleaners are free from mystery fragrances, so that's something. But again, we still don't really recommend this brand on the whole...
