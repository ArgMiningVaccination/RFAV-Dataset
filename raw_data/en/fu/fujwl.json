Let us learn from the past to create better choices for the future.'' -R\u00f3is\u00edn- - Ayurvedic wisdom, Nidra, Ecstatic Dance, Ayurvedic Cooking, Nature Connection- Here at True Nature Balance we offer a variety of remedies to enhance the human experience. These tools are an invaluable gift to the body and its nervous system. Using the ancient tools and techniques passed down for generations we have the potential to discover our inner radiance - our Bliss - our Balance. The Ayurvedic medical system recognizes we are more than the physical body, in its description it recognizes health as the health of body mind senses and soul. Ayurveda is inclusive for all human beings, no matter what size, shape, race, beliefs, religion, gender or age. On embarking on an Ayurvedic journey one has the potential to re-discover their unique energetic blueprint, their 'True Nature' in Sanskrit knows as 'Prakriti'. Prakriti is formed at conception and will never change. There may be times when we move away from our True Nature/Prakriti as a result of modern lifestyle routines and modernized 'nutrition'. This is one of the many reasons why we experience poor health, niggling pains, menstrual disorders and full blown dis-ease. Practical application of Ayurvedic wisdom can aid the body to recover and rejuvenate while it also encourages prevention of dis-ease from forming. Unleash your inner strength and radiance. Rediscover your lust for life. Come back to Balance; come back to your True Nature. Rejuvenate with True Nature Balance Your Gateway to Health Through the simple and practical applications of Ayurvedic wisdom and Hatha Yoga practices we aid the body to return to its natural rhythm - homeostasis. First we begin by treating the physical body through breath, movement, rest and food. The physical body is an intelligent vehicle and once given the support it needs, it will repair and regulate in its own unique time and way.
