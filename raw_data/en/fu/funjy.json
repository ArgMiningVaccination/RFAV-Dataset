E-waste and Children's health Electroni c waste (e- waste) is defined as discarded electrical and electronic equipment and components. This has become a rapidly increasing global problem [1, 2] . Informal and uncontrolled e-waste recycling processes include acid dissolution, incineration, pyrolysis and gasification, which all result in a large release of heavy metals and organic pollutants int o the local environment. With approximately 70% of e- waste import every year, China appears to be the largest e- waste dumping site in the world [3]. Although the Chinese government has implemented policies to control overseas e -waste importation, chemicals in the environment continue to exist due to their long half- lives and persistent accumulation. Children are most susceptible to threats posed by e- waste exposure. It is believed that unique routes of exposure, including breastfeeding and placental exposures, frequent hand- to-mouth behavior in early years, and immature physical development of children are likely to put them at high risk for being affected by toxicants [2, 4]. Epidemiological investigations have reported that exposure to hazardous substances in e- waste areas poses serious health risks to children, including altered thyroid function, aberrant cellular expression and function, abnormal temperament and behavior, and decreased lung function [2, 5]. As one of the largest e -waste destinations and recycling areas worldwide, Guiyu, nestled in the main manufacturing zone of southeast China, has a 30- year history of unregulated e -waste disposal [3, 6] . High levels of h eavy metals are found in the air, soil, water, sediment and plants in Guiyu, as compa red with non- polluted areas [7, 8]. Similarly, our previous studies reported high levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, manganese in the blood of Guiyu children [9 -11]. Many adverse health problems, including cardiovascular problems, endothelial inflammation, increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and asthma, aberrant synthesis of hemoglobin and erythrocyte complement receptor 1, and restricted physical growth and development, were reported to be related to high concentrations o f heavy metals in this area [9 -14]. Furthermore, alterations of the immune system in children from e -waste areas were also previously reported : It has been shown that elevated exposure to heavy metals is associated with increased memory T cell populations, lower NK cell percentage, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL- 1, and decreased titer of antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella [15-17]. 12General Introduction 2. Heavy metals Heavy m etals are generally defined as metallic elements that possess a high specific density above 5 g/cm3 with an atomic weight more than 40.04 [18]. They can enter the human body via various routes, such as food intake, water drinking, air inhalation and skin absorption following inadvertent occupational and environmental exposure [19, 20] . Some of these metals, such as zinc, selenium, manganese, cobalt, iron, and copper, are essential trace elements and beneficial for various physiological and biochemical progress in the living organisms when in adequate amounts, however, excessive supplementation of such metals may become noxious to cellular and tissue functions [19]. Other metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, are deleterious to biological organisms even in minor quantit ies and are therefore classified as non -essential metals [19, 20]. Those non- essential metals are not easily metabolized by the body and their constant accumulation may cause acute or chronic toxicities on the hematopoietic, renal, reproductive, immune and central nervous system [20, 21] . Lead occurs in different forms, s uch as metallic lead, lead salts, and tetraethyl lead and organic lead, and has been found in industrial processes, food and smoking, household dust, drinking water and domestic sources [20, 22] . It has no recognized biological function in the body. Once lead enters the bloodstream, more than 95% binds to hemoglobin and is distribute d within different organs and tissues of the body. Lead has an approximately 30-day half-life and is excreted mainly in the urine [20, 23]. Cadmium is found in the environment i n many forms, including cadmium acetate, cadmium sulfate, cadmium chloride, cadmium oxide and cadmium carbonate [24] . Cadmium is frequently used in batteries, fertilizers, coatings, pigments and alloys [24, 25] . It will remain inside the body permanently d ue to its strong accumulation competence and long half-life of about 10 to 30 years [26]. Mercury is a transition element and is found in different forms: metallic elements existing as a liquid at room temperature, inorganic salts that exist as ions (Hg+ or Hg2+) binding to chloride, sulfur or oxygen to form mercuric salts, and organic compounds including phenylmercury, dimethylmercury and methylmercury, with each having its own unique toxicity and bioavailability [20, 27, 28]. Among these forms, methylmercury is found in a larg e proportion in the environment and is formed as a result of the methylation of Hg+ or Hg2+ by the activities of microorganisms present in soil and water [20, 29]. The half- life of mercury in the human body is around 70 days, after which 90% is excreted [24, 30] . Arsenic is in an inorg anic form including the trivalent arsenite and the pentavalent and organic species, such monome thylarsonic acid, dimethylarsonic acid, and trimethylarsine oxide [19]. A ll over the world, about 100 million people get exposed to arsenic due to contaminated food and drinking water by arsenical pesticides, natural mineral deposits or inappropriate disposal of arsenical chemicals [31]. Heavy metals exert their toxicities by interactions with cellular constituents. In biological systems, heavy metals are transported and compartmentalized into cells and tissues and bind to cellular organelles and componen ts including cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane endoplasmic reticulum membrane and ear membrane via ionic or coordinating bonds [25, 32]. Moreover, some non- essential heavy metals are capable of replacing essential elements in t he body due to the same oxidation state or similar chemical structure. For example, lead and cadmium can substitute calcium, zinc, iron and magnesium to ultimately disrupt the cell metabolism [21, 33, 34]. In addition, heavy metals are responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as superoxide anion (O 2-), hydroxyl radical (HO- ), nitric oxide (NO.), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and dinitrogen trioxide (N 2O3). These ROS and RNS are known to induce oxidative stress and contribute to metals associated inflammation, apoptosis and tissue injury in the liver, kidneys, brain or immune organs [32, 35]. 3. Overview of the immune system The immune system is an intricate network of o rgans, cells and molecules that specializes in maintaining the body's homeostasis and responding to environmental exposures [36, 37] . In vertebrates, the immune system has been conceptually divided into two subsystems: the innate and adaptive immune systems, which are commonly distinguished on the basis of their levels of specificity and immunologic memory [38, 39]. The innate immune system is semi -specific and has the capacity to make a rapid and stereotyped response to offending agents or immunogens, while the adaptive or acquired immune system is thought of as being very specific to a particular antigen and capable of providing long- lasting immunity [39]. In a cooperative way, they effectively form a n integrated defense mechanism to provide the host with resistance to antigens and other harmful foreign intruders. 14General Introduction The innate immune system is the f irst line of defense against a wide range of unwanted invade rs [40]. T he constituents of the innate immune system can be categorized into external physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucosal membranes, cellular components such natural killer (NK) cells , molecular components such as germ -line-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), cytokines, lysozyme, antimicrobial peptides, [39, 41] . Monocytes are indispen sable innate cells with the potential to differentiate into tissue macrophages and dendritic cells , which can produce a series of cytokines to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses [42]. T hese cells recognize pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on pathogen's surface or damage- associated molecules patterns (DAMPs) derived from damaged cells via complementary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) , such as toll- like receptors to PAMPs or DAMPs , TLRs signal facilitate s interactions with downstream signalling molecules and result in the activation of cytoplasmic transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF - B) or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF -3), subsequently initiating transcription of pro - inflammatory cytokines [44]. Unlike the innate defense, the adaptive immune system recognizes non- self molecules with specificity for particular antigens, and can also induce a long- term memory. The specificity of adaptive immunity relies on unique antigen receptors on the surfaces of either T or B cells, such as T-cell receptors (TCRs) and immunoglobulins [43, 45]. Both B and T cells are lymphocytes that originate from common lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. However, they are responsible for different immune responses based on cell engagement and antibody production. B cells contribute to the humoral response of the adaptive immune system, whereas T cel ls govern cell- mediated immune responses [39] . Upon encountering invaded antigens, T and B cells are brought into the play, in which they proliferate largely to maximize the fighting capacity and differentiate into several specialized subsets to further facilitate their responsiveness to antigens [43] . When B cells are stimulated by antigens, they can transform into either effector B cells (antibody -producing plasma cells) that have the ability to produce high- affinity immunoglobulins to eliminate the triggering antigens or into memory B cells that closely resemble the o riginal B cells and respond quickly to a second invasion by the same antigens [39, 45]. T cells develop in the thymus, where they differentiate into discrete subtypes, 1 15Chapter 1 including helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells [43, 45] . Helper T cel ls have CD4 markers on their surface and can develop into effector T cells, such as Th1 and Th2 cells, which secrete different cytokines for different kinds of immune responses. Cytotoxic T cells express CD8 and have the capacity to directly kill virus -infected cells and tumor cells [46] . Inflammation is an essential immune response that eliminate s injury- inducing agents, clear s out necrotic cells and tissue damage from the original insult, and initiate s repair processes and restore s the physiological function of the tissue or organ affected [47, 48]. This process inevitably requires the participation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems . For example, large numbers of neutrophils are the first to reach the site of injury or infection within a short time. After infla mmation begins, monocytes in the bloodstream migrate to the site and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, both of which are capable of phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine releasing. Lymphocytes occur somewhat later during the inflammatory process and work in conjunction with antigen presenting cells (APCs) to process antigens, thereby coordinating a suitable inflammatory response [49, 50]. In addition, overexpression of inflammatory mediators, such as pro- inflammatory cytokine IL -1, IL -6, IL- 8 and TNF- , have been implicated as regulators of cellular proliferation and host inflammatory events [5 1]. 4. Toxicity of heavy metals on the immune system The toxicity of heavy metals on immune homeostasis ha s been increasingly recognized [52, 53] . Heavy metals are known to either stimulate or suppress the immune response, altering the number and function of innate immune cells as well as B, T lymphocytes and immunological memory cells of the body at different stages [5 4, 55] . Regarding the effects of heavy metals on the immune system, studies were identified with conflicting results due to the dose, route of exposure, and chemical species, as w ell as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals [19, 55]. 4.1 Heavy metals and innate immune cells With regard to neutrophils, researchers observed short- term exposure to low dose mercuric may inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of human neutrophils in vitro, whereas impaired neutrophil 16General Introduction chemotaxis and enhanced generation of ROS were found in mercury-exposed workers [56, 57] . Also, NK cells NK cells exposed to methylmercury showed an inhibition of the tumoricidal activity of NK cells in blood and spleen of mice and rats [58, 59] . The functions of neutrophils, such as cell movement, the generation of ROS and the killing of Candida albicans in workers occupationally exposed to lead were observed to be depressed [60, 61]. Cadmium exposure has been reported to be associated with the increase in neutrophil counts in occ upationally exposed workers [62, 63]. Macrophages displayed an impairment of phagocytic and migratory activity due to increased ROS production by cells exposed to methylmercury [64, 65] . Inhibitory effects of lead exposure on phagocytosis and migratory responsiveness of macrophages have also been reported [60, 66, 67]. Arsenic- exposed human blood monocytes were found to undergo marked apoptosis due to inhibition NF-B-related survival pathways; further, differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages was inhibited but LPS- induced macrophage TNF- and IL -8 mRNA and secretion w ere enhanced due to arsenic stimulation [68, 69]. 4.2 Heavy metals and lymphocytes The toxicity of heavy metals on B and T lymphocytes has been well recognized. Epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure to heavy metals may alter the numbers of lymphocytes and immunoglobulin levels [70-74]. Cadmium can suppress antigen -specific T cell responses and can induce abnormalities in antibody -production [75-77]. Cadmium has also been reported to be an effective apoptosis inducer in B cells [77] . Lead may promote the proliferation of B cells, enhance major histocompatibility complex activity and antibody production [ 78, 79]. It has also been suggested that lead is able to favor the activation and development of Th2 cells but suppres ses the proliferation and responses of Th1 cells in vitro , since in animal studies, it has been shown that lead inhibits IFN - production of Th1 cells and enhances the production of IL-4 by Th2 cells [78, 80]. Exposure to mercuric chloride and methylmercury has been reported to inhibit the function and development of lymphoc ytes in animals and humans, including proliferation, expression of cell surface markers and cytokines [81, 82]. It also has been well documented that inorganic mercury may induce autoimmunity by inducing excessive activation of B cells and Th cells, with manifestations like elevations in immunoglobulin (IgG1 and IgE) and specific antibodies and formation of renal IgG deposits [82-84]. Studies in Hg -induced autoimmunity mouse models revealed a reduction 1 17Chapter 1 of CD8+ T cells and the resistance of T cells to apoptosis after mercury treatment [ 85-87]. It has be en demonstrated that mercury not only disturbs B- cell receptor (BC R) signalling cascade pathways but also depresses its downstream activated extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways in B- cell lymphoma cell line [88, 89]. 4.3 Heavy metals and inflammation A growing body of evidence has shown the contribution of heavy metals to inflammation. Epidemiological data suggest that exposure to arsenic may exacerbate the severity of inflammatory reactions based on elevated IL -6, IL -10 and TNF- levels [54]. As evidenced by occupational studies, plasma levels of TNF and IL -10 were found higher in lead-exposed workers relative to those of non-exposed control subjects [90] . A positive association between lead exposure and the numbers of circulating neutrophils was observed in occupationally- exposed workers, particularly in those who smoked [67]. Cadmium exposure was demonstrated to cause pulmonary inflammation , which is ch aracterized by the elevation in macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in both blood and lung tissue of mice and rats [91, 92] . Exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes to mercury and cadmium showed increased pro -inflammatory IL -1 and TNF levels but decreased anti- inflammatory IL -10 and IL- 1 receptor antagonist production [93] . In addition, the production of TNF- , IL -6, IL-12 by macrophages exposed to lead and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found augmented, while production of anti- inflammatory IL -10 was decreased [94, 95]. Studies carried out in isolated human neutrophils, murine macrophages, macrophage cell lines and animal models of experimental pulmonary inflammation have demonstrated that c admium possesses pro- oxidative, pro- inflammatory activities , which was characterized by increases in the production of ROS, inducible NO synthase, and TNF- , IL -6 and IL-8 [96-98]. 5. Molecular Mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity Each heavy metal has its unique physicochemical characteristics that relate to its spe cific toxic actions. Although many mechanistic aspects involved in heavy metal-induced immunotoxicity have been proposed, the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. Possible mechanisms ( Figure 1 ) regarding heavy metal toxicity include oxid ative damage, 18General Introduction mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular signalling modification, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of DNA re pair and DNA b inding activity of transcription factors [19, 69, 99]. 5.1 Heavy metals enter cells via ionic mechanism Some he avy metals are able to substi tute bivalent cations such as calcium, zinc, magnesium and iron i n cells [22, 25] . For example, lead and cadmium mimic calcium and zinc at their specific sit es and bind to calmodulin, protein kinase C, and synaptic proteins [60]. C adm ium can replace zinc present in metallothionein, thereby inhibiting its ability to scavenge fr ee radicals [25]. Although heavy metals have the capacity to replace or mimic essential metals in the early transport and metabolism, they are incapable of mediating subsequent vital cellular functions, ulti mately disrupting various biological processes, such as intra and intercellular signalling , cell adhesion, protein folding and maturation, ionic transportation and apoptosis [22, 25]. In addition, heavy metals impair Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of their entry route into mam malian cells by voltage -dependent and receptor- operated calcium channels [60]. As a second messenger, Ca2+ concentrations contribute to intracellular signalling by protein phosphorylation, that disrupting Ca2+ homeostasis may have large cellular effects. Lead and cadmium were reported to interrupt intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis generating an uncontrolled release of Ca2+ Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent channels [101]. The divalent cations of lead, cadmium and mercury have an extremely high affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which impair Ca2+ translocases present in cellular membranes, resulting in uncontrolled rises in a murine macrophage cell line was found to be altered by cadmium exposure, which promotes phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK, modulating mitochondrial activity and cell apoptosis [102]. 5.2 Heavy metals interact with TLRs Recognition of microbial pathogens relies on PRRs. As the first identified PRRs, the essential role of TLRs in the innate immune response against microbial pathogens, as well as in the subsequent activation of immune responses, is widely accepted [103]. With a different location to either the cell surface or to endosomal vesicles, TLRs recognize diverse DAMPs generated by the host itself, and PAMPs from bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [104-106]. Upon 1 19Chapter 1 PAMPs and DAM Ps recognition, TLRs interact with TIR domain -containing adaptor proteins s uch as MyD88 and TRIF, which drive the activation of downstream NF- B, interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and MAPK, leading to inflammatory cytokine release and cell apopt osis [104, 107]. Various studies have indicated that heavy metals may bind to TLR s affecting their function. Evidence suggests that TLR4 is a target of lead [ 108]. Mercury elicited NF -B activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine binding and signalling [109] . Ionized gold is able to mimic viral dsRNA in triggering TLR3 in keratinocytes . C obalt, nickel and zinc ions are involved in TLR4 signalling, contributing to the release of the pro- inflammatory mediators NO, IL -6 and I L-8 [110- 114]. Due to its ligating capacity with two histidine residues of the TLR4 molecule, the nickel ion can activate human TLR4 to promote the inflammatory response through NF- B-, p38- and IRF3-dependent signal pathways [115] . An i n vivo study revealed that zinc supplement ation is beneficial to protect intestinal tissue from i nflammation via inhibiting the TLR4 - MyD88 signalling pathways [116]. Unfortunately, systematic studies showing which TLRs are activated or inhibited by heavy metals have not been performed yet. 5.3 Oxidati ve damage an d mitochondri al dysfunction Heavy metals are able to dysregulate the catalytic activity of the defense enzymes involved in oxidative stress because of their high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in the active sites [20]. I n vivo s t udies demonstrated that exposure to lead, mercury and arsenic suppress activities of delta -a minolevulini c acid synthas e (-ALAS), 117, 118] These enzymes ar e responsible fo r protecting intracellular components against ROS and RNS, which induce oxidative stress and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis by eliminating them and maintaining the balance of their generation [20, 119]. O n the o ther ha nd, lead, cadmium, mercur y and ar senic are also known to increase oxidative stress by inducing the generation of ROS and RNS in the mitochondria [20, 25]. Heavy metals have the capacity to induce lipid peroxidation, a process of oxidative degradation of lip ids, causing membrane structure damage , for instance in mitochondria [20, 117, 120] . Existing evidence has shown that lead, mercury and arsenic interrupt mitochondrial function 20General Introduction by inducing mitochon drial membrane damage, interfer ing with calcium ion (Ca2+)-dependent reactions, and inhibit ing the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the phosphorylation of mitochondrial enzymes [20, 121-123]. Figure 1. Possible mechanism of heavy metal -induced immunotoxicity. Ionic characteristics of heavy metals allow them to enter cells through voltage -dependent and receptor -operated ion channels. In the cell they can replace or mimic essential metals in transport and metabolism process . Some heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As), are known to bind to proteins largely due to their affinity for sulfhydryl groups in th e active sites. They also induce oxidative damage a nd mitochondrial dysfunction by facilitating ROS and RNS generation and suppressing antioxidant activity. In addition, the TLR signalling pathway is also a potential mechanism that can explain heavy metal- mediated aberrant immune and inflammatory response. Created with BioRender.com . 1 21Chapter 1 Aim and outline of this thesis The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate immune alteration s in preschool children in the e- waste area Guiyu, who suffer from heavy metal exposure . Moreover, we aim to explore the potential effects and mechanism s of heavy metals on monocytes and lymphocytes in vitro. We focus on the heavy metals lead , cadmium, mercury and arsenic as they are closely associated with e- waste as components of electrical and electronic equipment and largely generated during the dismantling process. Thus, they have been the most studied and essential concern on environmental issues and human health. T his thesis con tains two parts : Part 1 focuses on reporting the alterations in immune cells among children exposed to heavy metals in Guiyu, while Part 2 comprises two in vitro studies on the effects and mechanisms of the heavy metals lead and cadmium on monocytes and lymphocytes. The immune system of children is not completely matured and particularly sensitive to environmental toxicants. In Part 1 , we investigated the immune function of preschool children from Guiyu (an e-waste recycling area which has been introduced above) and Haojiang (the reference area). Haojiang is about 31.6 km to the east of Guiyu, without e-waste pollution. The two regions both belong to Shantou, Guangdong province, and ha ve simila r characteristics in latitude, demography, life -styles, eating habit s, traffic conditions, cultural background and socioeconomic status. We evaluated the exposure of children to heavy metals, especially lead and cadmium . This part starts with Chapter 2, which gives insight into the number and percentage of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils in preschool children from an e- waste recycling area, as well as the association between alterations in these cells and h eavy metal lead and cadmium. In Chapter 3, lead exposure and its adverse effects on the percentage and development of NK lymphocytes were assessed in preschool children from this e-waste area. In Chapter 4, alterations in apoptosis and development of B lym phocytes were investigated in children from this area ; in addition, caspase -9 activation and NF- B trans cription factor c -rel and p65 were explored in order to link heavy metal exposure to B cell apoptosis. In Chapter 5, immune cells (monocytes, neutrophil s and IL-10, IL-13) were analyzed to explore the states of immune regulation and inflammatory activation in children exposed to lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic. 22General Introduction In Part 2, in vitro stud i es were conducted. In Chapter 6, we systematically studied TLR activation and inhibition by lead and cadmium using TLR reported cell lines and measured the downstream effects on NF-B and p38 MAPK pathway s and cell apoptosis, activation and inflammatory cytokine production in a monocytic cell line ( MonoM ac 6 cells) . In Chapter 7, mitochondrial function and NF- B activation in a human T cell line (Jurkat cells) exposed to lead and cadmium w ere explored. In Chapter 8 , the findings in this thesis are summarily discussed, and a perspective of future research into heavy metal -induced immunotoxicity is proposed. 1 23Chapter 1 REFERENCES [1] Huo, X., et al. , Elevated blood lead levels of children in Guiyu, an electronic waste recycling town in China.

We evaluated the association between Pb/ Cd exposures and innate immune cells in children from an electronic waste (e- waste) recycling area. A total of 294 preschool children were recruited, including 153 children from Guiyu (e - waste exposed group), and 141 from Haojiang (reference group). Pb and Cd levels in peripheral blood were measured by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer, NK cell percentages were detected by a flow cytomet er, and other innate immune cells including monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils were immediately measured by an automated hematology analyzer. Results showed children in Guiyu had s ignificantly higher Pb and Cd levels than in the reference group. Absolute counts of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, as well as percentages of eosinophils and neutrophils , were significantly higher in the Guiyu group. In contrast, NK cel l percentages were significantly lower in Guiyu group. Pb elicited a significant escalation in counts of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, as well as percentages of monocytes, but a decline in percentages of neutrophils in different quintiles with resp ect to the first quintile of Pb concentrations. Cd induced a significant increase in counts and percentages of neutrophils in the highest quintile compared with the first quintile of Cd concentrations. We concluded that alteration s in the number and percen tage of innate immune cells are linked to higher levels of Pb and Cd, which indicates that Pb and Cd exposures might affect the innate and adaptive immune response in Guiyu children. 30Alteration of the Number and Percentage of Innate Immune Cells 1. Intr o duction Informal and uncontrolled e lectronic waste (e- waste ) recycling often results in human exposure to harmful chemical contaminants [1]. Guiyu, a typical e- waste destination and recycling area in southern China, with nearly a 30-year history of unregulated e-w aste disposal, has reported massive amounts of environmental toxicants, including heavy metals and organic pollutants, in environmental and human samples [2-7]. Our previous studies show ed that higher Pb and Cd levels are present in the placenta, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and urine in the Guiyu populations [8-11]. Heavy metal s Pb and Cd are widespread environmental contaminants, which cause extensive concern for their adverse effects on health [12, 13]. Pb is toxic to the central nervous, hema topoietic, renal, and immune system s [14-16] . Previous studies found that Pb exposure affects the humoral and innate immune responses, lymphocyte function and cytokine production [17, 18]. Cd is a [19-21]. Cd exposure has also been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer [22, 23]. In recent years, Pb and Cd immunotoxicity on humoral and cell- mediated immunity ha s been well documented, as mentioned above, but few reports have characterized their impact on innate immunity. Innate immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, natural killer (NK) cells and NKT cells, provide the first line of defense against pathogens and viral infections through recognition of pathogen- associated molecular patterns, via a limited number of germline -encoded pattern recognition receptors, and secretion of a series of cytokines and chemokines to eliminate pathogens and facilitate the adaptive response [24-26]. A handful of studies demonstrate d that Pb exposure decreases host resistance to pathogens and viral infections [27] . Cd exposure suppresse s specific immune responses neutrophil activity and macrophage phagocytosis [28, 29] . With regard to the mechanisms of Pb and Cd toxic ity on innate immunity, current evidence suggests that Pb and Cd interact with DNA repair mechanisms, generate reactive oxygen species and induce apoptosis, as well as alter cytokine secretion [27, 30, 31] . The immune system of preschool child ren is in the process of maturing , making it particularly sensitive to environmental toxicants [2, 32-34]. To date, there have been no studies reporting 2 31Chapter 2 the a lteratio n of the innate immune homeostasis affected by heavy metal exposure in Guiyu children. This study aimed to determine the blood Pb and Cd levels in children who reside in Guiyu area , and evaluate their toxic effects on innate immune cells, in order to get a deeper understanding of Pb and Cd immunotoxicity on susceptible populations, thereby making an early assessmen t of the risk for disease s. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study population A total of 294 preschool children, 3 to 7 years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (n = 153) and Haojiang (n = 141) in December, 2011. We selected Haojiang as the reference group, which has similarities with Guiyu in population, cultural background and socioeconomic status, but lacks electronic waste pollution. Questionnaires, including general characteristics of both parents and children, child behavior habits, diet and health physiological parameters, dwelling environments, parent education and jobs, were delivered to the participants and their parents who gave written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. 2.2. Sample collection Whole blood samples were obtained from volunteers, collected in Pb- free tubes by trained nurses, and transported to the laboratory. Blood sample tubes containing EDTA w ere used for blood routine examination and heavy metal measurement. 2.3. Blood cell examination Blood count s were immediately measured by an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XT- 1800i, Japan) in a hospital not far from the laboratory. NK cells (CD3-CD56+CD16+) were detected by labeled antibodies: MultiTEST CD45/CD3/CD56/CD16 (BD Bioscience, America), and da ta by an Aria II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, America) and analyzed with DVIA software (version 6.1, BD Bioscience). 2.4. Pb and Cd measurement Blood Pb and Cd levels were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotomet er (Jena Zeenit 650, Germany), using detection methods according to our 32Alteration of the Number and Percentage of Innate Immune Cells previ ous ly described publication [35]. For Pb determination, t he main parameters were: a wavelength of 283.3 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of 0.8 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 \u00b0C, ashing at atomization at 1500 \u00b0C. The 0.5% nitric acid solution was used as blank , and the l imit of detection (LOD) of this method was 0.51 g/L (0.051 g/dL). The accuracy of the method was controlled by recoveries between 95% and 107% from the spiked blood samples. For Cd determination , the main parameters were : a wavelength of 228.8 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of 1.2 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 at 300 atomization at 1300 \u00b0C. The 2.0 % nitric acid solution was used as blank , and the l imit of detection (LOD) of this method was 0.05 g/L. The accuracy of the detection method was controlled by recoveries between 100% and 103% from the spiked blood samples. Repeated analyses of standard solutions confirmed the method's precision. 2.5. Statistical analysis Summary statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software. M ean \u00b1 SD were used to depict blood Pb and Cd concentrations, absolute counts and percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils and NK cells. Chi-square and independent- sample t -tests were used to detect differences between the exposed and reference groups for categorical variables and continuous variables, respectively. We adopted a univariate linear regression analysis to analyze the impact of possible relevant facto rs on Pb and Cd exposure. Separate regression models were used to estimate the association between innate immune cell levels and Pb and Cd exposure, with each exposure categorized by quintiles. All linear models for group differences, in the changes of Pb and Cd concentrations and several innate immune cell levels, controlled for potential confounding variables, such as child gender, age and body mass index (BMI). A p < 0.05 in a two- tailed test was determined to be statistically significant. 3.Results 3.1. Characteristics of the study population Descriptive statistics for the sample characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The mean child age in the exposed group was 5.1 years , higher than the 4.4 years in the reference group ( p < 0.01). I n addition, the mean child body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in the exposed group than that in the reference group ( 14.73 kg/m2 versus 16.06 kg/m2, p < 0.01). No 2 33Chapter 2 signific a nt differences between two groups were found for gender. D ifferences between the two groups for categorical variables, such as the duration of the child outdoor play, habit of biting pencils and erasers, consumption of dairy and bean products, chi ld e-waste contact, frequency of colds, the duration of residence of both child and parents in the local area, the distance of residence from the road, e- waste contamination within 50 meters of the residence, and using the residence as an e -waste recycling workplace, were all significant differen t (all p < 0.05). 3.2. Candidate factors associated with Pb and Cd levels Pb and Cd both showed higher mean concentrations in the exposed group (10.34 \u00b1 4.75 g/dL and 2.39 \u00b1 1.16 g/L, the refer ence group (8.30 \u00b1 3.01 g/dL and 1.79 \u00b1 0.45 g/L, respectively) (Figure 1 ). A subsequent univariate linear regression model was used to determine the relationship between possible factors and two heavy metal exposures ( Table 2). We took into account the child's age, BMI and gender as potential covariates in the change of Pb and Cd concentrations. Therefore, these variables were being controlled. We found child blood Pb levels were positively associated with the residence duration of child in the local are a (unadjusted = 0.845, 95% CI: 0.076, 1.615), the residence duration of father local area (unadjusted = 1.087, 95% CI: 0.383, 1.791), the residence duration of mother local area (unadjusted = 1.070, 95% CI: 0.544, 1.595), the residence as an workplace (unadjusted = 1.346, 95% CI: 0.332, 2.361), and the = 2.636, 95% CI: 1.492, 3.780). However, in the adjusted linear regression model, child blood Pb levels had no correlation w ith the residence duration of child in the local area ( adjusted = 0.622, 95% CI: - 0.160, 1.404). In addition, some factors negatively correlated with Pb levels, such as dairy product consumption frequency ( adjusted = -0.621, 95% CI: -1.201, - 0.041) and distance of ( adjusted = -0.521, 95% CI: -0.942, -0.100). In terms of factors associated with blood Cd levels, we found positive correlations between blood Cd levels and certain variables, such as using the residence as an e- waste recycling workplace ( adjusted = 0.248, 95% CI: 0.023, 0.474), and the residence duration of child in the local area ( adjusted = 0.183, 95% CI: 0.016, 0.350) and the residence duration of mother in the local area ( adjusted = 0.136, 95% CI: 0.019, 0.253).

Distribution of innate immune c ells A general description of several innate immune cell levels is presented in Figure 2 (A - I). Monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils and NK cells were estimated in our study, and expressed as a percentage and absolute value. There were higher mean absolute values of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils in the exposed group (0.61\u00d7109/L, 0.29\u00d7109/L, 4.24\u00d7109/L and 0.05\u00d7109/L, respectively) compared with the (0.51\u00d7109/L, 0.19\u00d7109/L, 3.30\u00d7109/L and 0.04\u00d7109/L, respectively). Furthermore , there were higher eosinophil and neutrophil percentages in white blood cells and lower NK cell percentages among lymphocytes in the exposed group (3.26%, 47.50% and 14.87%, respectively) than those in the reference group (2.57%, 42.67% and 18.01%, respectively).

Associations between the distribution of innate immune cells and heavy metal exposure To estimate associations between distribution o f different innate immune cells and exposures, we categorized Pb and Cd exposures into quintiles for statistical analysis, and adjusted separate regression models by the child' s age ( Table 3). For blood Pb, the 5.10, 7.11, 8.65, 10.54 and 15.50 were both on average higher in the third quintile of Pb concentration, and eosinophil counts ( CI: 0.004, 0.152) in fourth quintile compared with those in the lowest quintile (all p < 0.05). For percentages of monocyt es, results showed increments in all quintiles (second of the Number and Percentage of Innate Immune Cells that ne utrophil percentages were on average lower in Pb concentrations in the second quintile compared with the lowest counts nor percentages of eosinophils, basophils and NK cells had significant associations with Pb exposure. For blood Cd, the lowest (0.47-1.45 g/L), g/L) had an Cd of 1.25, 1.56, 1.87, 2.36 and 3.51 g/L, respectively. Concerning the relationship between innate immune cells and Cd exposure, we only found neutrophil counts ( increased in association with the highest versus the lowest quintile of Cd levels (p < 0.05). 4.Discussion 4.1. H igher blood Pb and Cd concentrations in Guiyu children are associated with the candidate factors Primitive and unregulated e -waste recycling and disposal s, such as open incineration and acidic leaching, lead to the emission of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, and the accumulation o f heavy metals in the dust, soil, water, vegetables and paddy rice [2, 36, 37]. Our results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that elevated Pb and Cd concentrations in Guiyu children are mainly due to the severe pollution of the local environment, as well as the child 's habits, diets , contaminant exposure sources and duration of exposure [8, 9, 38, 39] . Among candidate factors investigated, such as the child 's contact with e -waste, parents ' dwelling time in the local area and using the residen ce as an e -waste recycling workplace contribute to the elevated Pb and Cd levels in children. Our previous investigation confirmed that nearly 60 -80% of families in Guiyu are engaged in e-waste recycling operations, and most of the recycling workplaces are often residences. These family -run e- waste dismantling activities increase the risk of exposure of children to Pb. I ndeed, studies show ed that the Pb concentration in the dust, collected from the workshops, is hundreds of times higher than indoor dust in other areas [8, 38, 40] . We also observed that Pb levels are positively associated with the residence duration of father in the local area , which suggest s that fathers with a high risk of Pb exposure can expose children when in close contact. Another possi bility is that, because 2 39Chapter 2 n 5.10 \u00b1 1.05 Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference 1.25 \u00b1 0.16 Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference 1.45-1.69 59 and 95% CIs from linear regression models for innate immune cell levels (109/L, %) in children by quintiles of blood Pb ( g/dL) and Cd ( g/L) concentrations. Model was adjusted by age. Values of * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. 40Alteration of the Number and Percentage of Innate Immune Cells smoking o r passive smoking is a source of non-occupational Pb exposure for humans [41- 43] and most fathers smoke, smoking could lead to passive smoking by children. Unfortunately, we did not take into account parental smoking as a candidate factor in the study. However, our previous studies have reported that parental smoking may promote an increase in child bl ood Pb and Cd levels [8] . We found factors that can hinder the accumulation of Pb levels, such as the intake of dairy products, which may be protective factors for Pb levels. Other dietary factors, such as bean products and supplements of calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin C, also can be a part of nutritional intervention to reduce Pb absorption [8] ; however, we are very confused we do not draw such a conclusion. In terms of Cd exposure, our results show that outdoor play time negatively correlates with blood Cd levels for children, which is oppos ite to the early findings [3, 8] . We speculate that indoor exposure to heavy metals may be more serious than outdoor pollution in Guiyu because of the greater density of heavy metal accumulation in dust particles [44, 45]. 4.2. A ssociat ion between Pb and Cd exposures and innate immune cells in children We also found blood Pb and Cd levels are associated with the altered distribution of innate immune cells in children. Prior studies conducted on immunotoxic ity of heavy metals on human leukocytes in vitro suggest that Pb and Cd exposures can interfere with the viability and function of lymphocytes and monocytes [46- 48]. Our results show that m onocyte percentages positively correlate with Pb levels, which contrasts with a prior study of Pb exposure in male mice [49] . Pb and C d promote inflammation as a consequence of ROS production, cell damage and apoptosis, and l ead to increases in e ndogenous waste requiring elimination by monocytes and neutrophils [50-52] . Therefore, it is understandable that Pb exposure might induce increased levels of monocytes. Strangely , the quintile with blood Pb levels from 6.31 g/dL to 7.69 g/dL exhibited a decrease of neutrophil percentages , in contrast to that in the group with Pb levels lower than 6.31 g/dL. Di Lorenzo et al. have reported t he mean absolute neutrophil count is significantly higher in Pb-exposed workers (geometric mean Pb levels: 20.5 g/dL) with respect to a control group (geometric mean: 3.5 g/dL ) [53]. The different exposure pathways, duration and levels may be reason s for different results . We also observed an upward trend of eosinophil and basophile counts resulting from P b exposure ( = 0.078 and = 0.013, respectively) (p < 0.05). Few prior2 41Chapter 2 studies a m ong highly exposed populations have noted positive as well as negative correlations between Pb and eosinophils. In addition to different study populations , the variation in results may also be due to the analyses of divergent adjustment on covariates [54-56]. Our analyses indicate Cd exposure in the highe st quintile (2.59-7.90 g/L) will increase the percentage of neutrophils with respect to the first quint ile (0.47-1.45 g/L), which is s imilar to a study in rats by Mladenovi and colleagues [57]. However, another research in workers has suggested that individuals with blood Cd levels higher than 1.2 g/L exhibits a decrease in neutrophil percentages with re spect to individuals with Cd levels lower than 1.1 g/L, which is inconsistent with our finding [58]. One possible reason for the difference in finding s is that our subjects, preschool children, had higher blood Cd level s and lived in the typical e- waste dismantling area. As m entioned above, Cd may elevate monocyte and neutrophil levels via ROS generation, inducing cell apoptosis and i ncreasing endogenous substances . Thus, it is plausible that higher Cd exposure can show a positive association with neutrophil counts and percentage s ( = 0.665 and = 3.919, respectively ). From our results, we found decreased percentages of NK cells in Guiyu children. NK cells play critical roles in innate and adaptive immune responses, including cytokine secretion, contact- dependent cell- cell signal ling and direct killing of other immune cells, and are involved in combating tumors, viral infections, parasites and bacteria [59-62] . Therefore, l ower percentages of NK cells might impair innate immune response, as well as an adaptive immune response in Guiyu children. U nfortunately , we cannot conclude t he effects of Pb and Cd on NK cell s, which is similar to previous ly reported population studies [63, 64]. However, Sata et al. found a negative correlation between CD16+ NK cells and blood Pb in Pb-exposed workers [65]. Studies in vitro also have shown that Pb and Cd can inhibit NK cell number and activity [66, 67]. 4.3. L imitations This study is the first investigation to explore the toxic effect of heavy metals on the innate immune system of preschool children in the e -waste dismantling area, Guiyu. However, there are several limitations of our study. First, we did not analyze some parameters like oxidative stress or innate immunity cytokines to sufficiently conclude that the immunotoxicity of Pb and Cd on innate immune cells. Second, we cannot eliminate the s ynergistic or antagonistic impact 42Alteration of the Number and Percentage of Innate Immune Cells of othe r environmental pollutants, such as mercury, arsenic, PCB, PBDE and B PA, which are widely spread in Guiyu [68-71] and c an affect the innate immune response [72, 73] . It will be of importance to consider these interactions in our further research . Third, children in the reference group unexpectedly had a mean blood Pb level of 8.30 g/dL, which exceeds the maximum safe level ( < = 5 \u00b5g/dL) established by the U.S. CDC [74]. Thus we analyzed the association between Pb and innate immune cells by quintiles of Pb concentrations i n order to understand the effects of different exposure levels. Other information is required in our questionnaire, such as the child passive smoking and dietary sources , which can e nhance the risk of exposure to Pb and Cd [38, 41-43]. 5. Conclusions Alteration of the numbers and percentages of several innate immune cells is linked to higher levels of Pb and Cd, indicating that Pb and Cd exposures might affect the innate immune response, as well as the adaptive immune response in Guiyu children.

To monitor the internal Pb level and evaluate its effect on natural killer (NK) cells and cytokine/chemokine concentrations, we recruited 285 preschool children from Guiyu, one of the largest electronic waste (e -waste) destinations and recycling areas in the world, and known to have high concentrations of Pb in the air, soil, water, sediment and plants. A total of 126 preschool children were selected from Haojiang as a reference group. Results showed that children in Guiyu, the exposed area, had higher blood Pb levels and lower percentages of NK cells than children from the reference area. A significantly negative association was found between the percentage of NK cells and increasing Pb levels. Moreover, children in Guiyu area had higher platelet counts and IL-1 concentrations, and lower levels of IL-2, IL-27, MIP-1 and MIP-1 were observed in the exposed children. These changes might not be conducive to the development and differentiation of NK cells. Taken together, the elevated Pb level result s in the lower percentages of NK cells, but also alter s the levels of platelets, IL -1 and IL -27, which might be unconducive to the activity and function of NK cells. 48Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells 1. Introduction Electr onic waste (e- waste) has been regarded as leading source of environmental contamination and human health problems, which arouses wide concern in recent years [1, 2] . Our previous studies showed that a large amount of environmental toxicants , including heavy metals and organic pollutants , were found in Guiyu, a typical e-waste site in southern China with nearly a 30-year history of unregulated e- waste disposal [3, 4]. Lead (Pb), as one of the conventiona l environmental chemicals, has been constantly discovered in the air, soil, water, sediment and plants in Guiyu, and its level is usually much higher than other non- polluted areas [5 -7]. Besides, high blood Pb levels were observed among local preschool children in our cross- sectional studies [8, 9] . In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that Pb can stir up developmental toxic outcomes, such as low cognitive competence, poor memory and study, reduced birth weight [10-12] . Children are particularly vulnerable to this xenobiotic and are prone to have a long- term accumulation, resulting in many potential health risks [13-15]. Pb is known to produce neurotoxicity and dysfunction of the hematopoietic system [16] . It has also been proved to exert immunotoxicity to immune homeostasis in humans, increasing opportunities to suffer from infections or diseases [17- 20]. A prior study conducted for in vitro immunotoxic effects of heavy metals on human blood shows that Pb and other metal co- exposures can interrupt the viability and immune competence of human peripheral lymphocytes and mononuclear cells [21]. Natural killer (NK) cells, as a unique subset of lymphocytes, can spontaneously lyse certain virus- infected cells and tumor cells without the requirement for prior sensitization, which plays a key role in innate immunity and exhibits immunoregulatory functions in adaptive immune responses [22] . Pb exposure has been verified as a signicant contributor to the NK cell cytotoxicity. This is especially true for high doses of acute and chronic Pb exposure to rat spleen cells in vitro that NK cell cytolytic activity is largely suppressed, which may to some extent explain the tumor -promoting effect of this chemical through compromising immunosurveillance [23, 24]. There are some population- based studies revealing that environmental pollutants have an impact on children's immune system development, following decreases in the numbers of NK cells and NK cell receptor expressions, and increases of other inflammatory mediators [25, 26] . However, data are scarcely available focusing on epidemiological investigations of Pb exposure effect on NK cell cytotoxicity, 3 49Chapter 3 especially for those susceptible populations. Thus, efforts are needed to find out the chemical - specific eff ects on abnormal immunoregulatory responses during which perturbations in quantity and function of NK cells may be changed. In addition to the likely imbalance of lymphocytes including NK cells induced by Pb exposure, current studies have identified that certain critical immune molecules like cytokines are tig htly are important s ignals for regulating NK cell development, survival and functioning actions [32-35] , as well as promoting NK cell cytotoxicity and/or production of IFN- [36-38] . Several experimental reports have indicated that increased interleukin levels incl uding IL -1, IL-6, IL- 8 and TNF- are associat ed with varying doses of Pb exposure, causing neurodevelopmental impairments, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis [39 -42]. Howe ver, an inverse result is found that secretions of IFN - and IL-4 ar e significantly de creased after the guinea pigs are exposed to Pb inhaling, resulting in asthma-like changes [34, 43] . Taken collectively, the existed observations highlight the pivotal roles of cytokines in mediat ing inflammation or anti- inflamm atory immunoregulation induc ed by Pb exposure. To date, human health risk assessment, of particular in children, performed to link exposur e to trace levels of environmental chemicals with probable abnormal immune regulation and status is unproven and remains a matter of speculation, even though some evidence has been gained by rodent experiments. Our previous study showed a decreased immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine with chronic Pb exposure in the e-wast e polluted area of Guiyu [44]. In this respect, we consider the immune components o r immunoregulatory chain of local children are partly injured. Again combined with the current context of Pb-induced NK ce ll cytotoxicity, we hypothesize that Pb might affect the development and activity of NK cells by inducing changes in the l evels of accessory cells and cytokines/chemokines involved in NK cell survival and function. This study aims to determine child blood Pb level and evaluate its effect on NK cells and cytokine/chemokine concentrations, to offer a deeper understanding of the cellular an d molecular networks of cytokine -cytokine re ceptor interactions by activating the anti- tumor potential of NK cells. 50Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Stud y population A total of 411 preschool children with a 3- to 7-years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (n=285) and Haojiang (n=126) in December, 2014. Haojiang was selected as the reference area because of its similarities to Guiyu in population, cultural background and socioeconomic status, and lacks electronic waste pollution. All participants were given the written informed consent prior to enrollment. A questionnaire was delivered to the participants, including both parents ' and children 's general characteristics, dwelling environments, parent education and jobs, child behavior habits, diet and health physiological parameters. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. 2.2. Sample collection Peripheral blood samples were obtained from volunteers and collected in Pb -free tubes by trained nurses. The blood sample tube containing EDTA, as an anticoagulant, was used for routine blood examination and Pb testing. The other tube of blood was anticoagulant- free and was c entrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 855 g; serum supernatant was stored at 70\u00b0C until assay for cytokines and chemokines. 2.3. Determination of blood Pb For Pb detection, 100 L whole blood and 900 L of 0.5% nitric acid (analytical reagent) were combined, followed by vortexing, and subsequent digestion for 10 min at room temperature. The blood Pb level was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Jena Zeenit 650, Germany), using detection methods according to our previous publication [10]. 2.4. Flow cytometry analysis To determine the CD3-CD56bright CD16low/- and CD3-CD56dimCD16+ phenotype of NK cells, 100 L whole blood was added to a tube with 2 mL wash buffer, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 500 g. The s upernatant was decanted and cells were rewashed . After washing, cells were resuspended in 100 L wash buffer by gentle vortexing. The appropriate volume of the following monoclonal antibodies was 3 51Chapter 3 gently vortexed, after adding all antibodies, and incubated for 15 minutes in the dark at room temper ature, then 2 mL of 1\u00d7 FACS lysing solution (BD Bioscience, USA) was added, and the cell suspension was vortexed gently and incubated for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was removed. Cells were washed twice as above, followed by thorough resuspension in 200 L wash buffer. Cells were analyzed by FACS using an Aria I flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). Data w ere analyzed with FlowJo and D I VA software (v ersion 6.1, 2.5. Cytokine and chemokine assays Cytokines chemokines detected with the use a ProcartaPlex Human Cytokine & Chemokine Panel the serum samp les and analysis was based on the manufacturer's instructions. Data acquisition was performed using a Luminex 200 analyzer (Luminex, USA). 2.6. Statistical analysis All stat istical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. The comparison between two groups was made by an independent- sample t test, Mann -Whitney U test and chi -square test. Median or mean \u00b1 SD were used to depict blood Pb levels, percentages of NK cell subsets, cell counts and cytokine/chemokine concentrations. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to examine relationships between blood Pb levels, the number of blood cells, and cytokine and chemokine concentrations. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the relevant factors contributing to Pb exposure, and association of blood Pb levels with percentage of N K cell subsets. A p < 0.05 in a two- tailed test was considered as statistically significant. 52Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells 3. Results 3.1. Charac teristics of the study population A total of 411 children were enrolled in the study (Table 1 ), the mean age of children in the exposed group (n = 285) was 4.5 \u00b1 0.9 years, and 4.3 \u00b1 1.0 years in the reference group (n = 126) ( p < 0.01). Gender, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) of children did not show significant differences (all p > 0.05) between the exposed and reference group. The mean blood Pb level in the exposed group was higher than that in the reference group (6.00 \u00b1 2.75 \u00b5g/dL vs. 3.92 \u00b1 1.96 \u00b5g/dL) ( p < 0.01). More than 57% of children from exposed group exceeded the limit value of Pb level (>5 \u00b5g/dL) according to the U.S. CDC [45]. Besides, significant differences between two groups were found for smoking by a family member, housing ventilation, us ing the residence as a workplace, distance of residence from the road, mother's work associated with e- waste, and e -waste conta mination within 50 meters from residence (p < 0.01). 3.2. Blood Pb levels and related factors Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate whether specific factors were related to blood Pb levels ( Table 2 ). We found ventilation of housing, using the residence as a workplace, distance of residence from the road, mother's work associated with e- waste and e - waste contamination within 50 meters away from the residence were all positively associated with blood Pb levels ( = 0.142, = 0.143, = 0.115, = 0.126 and = 0.147, respectively), among which e- waste contamination within 50 meters away from living house predominated, contributing more to the elevated Pb levels in children. 3 53Chapter 3 Table 1.

Percentage of NK cell subsets in peripheral blood We used a gating strategy to investigate different NK cell subsets in child peripheral blood via CD3 populations with the exception of CD3+ cells. Further, the identified subsets were analyzed based on CD16 and CD56 expression ( Table 3 ). Differentiated human peripheral blood NK cells were characterized by surface expression of CD56, with approximately 2 - 10% of these NK cells designated as CD56bright, and more than 90% of cells classified as CD56dim. The CD56dim cells expressing CD16 were responsible for the cytotoxic effect. Results showed that the percentage of CD3-CD56+ NK ce lls in the CD3 population was significantly lower in the exposed group (mean 8.51%) compared with that in the reference group (mean 11.69%) ( p < 0.01). The percentages of CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- and CD3-CD56dimCD16+ subpopulations in CD3-CD56+ NK cells were both lower in the exposed group (mean 3.64% and 84.10%, respectively) than in the reference group (mean 4.62% and 87.21%, respectively) (both p < 0.05).

The association between blood Pb levels and NK cells The relati onship between blood Pb levels and NK cells were shown in Table 4 . We found that the percentages of CD3-CD56+ and CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- NK cells were both negatively correlated with blood Pb levels (R s = -0.199, p = 0.031 and R s = -0.229, p = 0.013, respectively). Univariate linear regression analysis between blood Pb levels and NK cells further showed that increased Pb levels mainly affe cted the CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- NK cells, which led to a decline in the percentage and differentiation of these subgroups (B = -0.182, 95% CI: -0.357, - 0.007, p 5 ).

Determinations in indices of blood cells and cytokines/chemokines In order to understand the NK cell microenvironment conditions that were associated with the proliferation and activation of NK cells, we measured blood corpuscles and cytokines/chemokines in child peripheral blood. Blood cells including lymphocytes, plate lets, erythrocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were analyzed. We found that lymphocytes were 10.6% in the Guiyu group (median 3.71\u00d7109/L), lower than that in the reference group (median 56Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells 4.15\u00d7109/L) ( p < 0.01). In contrast , platelets were 10.5% in the Guiyu group (median 315.00\u00d7109/L), higher than that in the reference group (median 285.00\u00d7109/L) (p < 0.01). In addition, erythrocyte and monocyte counts were both lower in the exposed group (median 4.78\u00d71012/L and 0.50\u00d7109/L, respectively) compared with the reference group (median 4.73\u00d71012/L and 0.51\u00d7109/L, respectively), while there was no significance for the number of neutrophils (median 3.81\u00d7109/L vs. 3.85\u00d7109/L) between tw o groups ( p > 0.05) ( this study ( Figure 2 ). We found that IL -2, IL-27, MIP-1 and MIP-1 concentrations were significantly lower in the exposed group (median 7.97 pg/mL, 50.40 pg/mL, 9.17 pg/mL and 758.06 106.28 pg/mL, 10.16 pg/mL and 791.44 pg/mL, respectively) (all p < 0.05). IL-1 concentration was increased in the exposed group (median 0.81pg/mL) compared with that in the reference group (median 0.80 pg/mL) ( p < 0.05). IL-12 secretions were not detectable (data not shown) . The concentrations of IL-15, IL-18, IL- 21, IFN- , TNF -, IL-6 and IL- 7 did not show statistically significant differences between two groups.

The association between Pb exposure and blood cells, cytokine/chemokine concentratio ns The blood cells, cytokines and chemokines were assessed to link with Pb levels. We found that platelet, neutrophil and monocyte counts correlated with blood P b levels (R s = 0.112, R s = 0.139 and R s = 0.120, respectively; all p < 0.05). In terms of cytokines, serum IL-1 and IL- 6 concentrations were positively associated with blood Pb levels (R s = 0.162 and R s = 0.222, respectively; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). By contrast, IL- 27 concentrations were negatively associated with blood Pb levels (R s = -0.306, p < 0.01) ( Table 6 ). Table 6. Spearman correlations between blood Pb level and immune parameters. Blood Pb level Rs of p < 0.05 wer e considered statistically significant. 4. Discussion In this study, we explored the changes of NK cells and NK cell activation- associated cytokines and chemokines, and estimated the associations of these level changes with Pb exposure in preschool children from Guiyu, a typical e- waste site. Our results show that children in Guiyu still suffer a high Pb level compared to the reference population [6, 8, 10-12, 15] . We analyzed 58Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells certain factors including ventilation of housing, us ing the resi dence as a workplace, distance of residence from the road, mother's work associated with e -waste and e -waste contamination within 50 meters away from residence, were all positively associated with blood Pb levels, suggesting that Pb accumulation from the mainly preliminary e -waste polluting sources continues affecting local people, particularly for children. In the present data, percentages of NK cell subsets encompassing CD3-CD56+, CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- and CD3-CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in the periphera l blood of Guiyu children are reduced compared with the reference area. CD3-CD56+ and CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- NK cells both exhibit a negatively significant correlation with blood Pb levels. These observations indicate that decreased percentages of NK cells to some extent may be related to elevated blood Pb levels. Heavy metal Pb exposure can partly interrupt child immune state and development through alterations of different NK cell subsets. A former cross -sectional study conducted by Stata et al. demonstr ated that there is a negatively significant correlation between the amount changes of NK cells and blood Pb levels in Pb -exposed workers [23, 46] . Their results showed that the number and percentage of CD16+ NK cells in the high -Pb group are significantly lower than those in the control and in the low- Pb group, which is consistent with our finding for children in the e- waste site. The difference is that they f ound a negative correlation between the number of CD16+ NK cell subpopulations and Pb exposure, ins tead of CD3-CD56brightCD16low/- NK cells in our results. From the internal fate of Pb exposure in children, approximately 73% of Pb eventually accumulates in bone [47] . Although NK cells are derived from bone marrow cells, previous results in vitro showed that Pb exposure reduces somatic growth, longitudinal bone growth, and bone strength during the pubertal period [48]. The status of skeletal growth and development will affect bone marrow cell survival and differentiation. In addition, one of the most impo rtant trace elements, zinc, influences the proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ progenitors and plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of NK cells [49, 50]. Pb, as an antagonist that competes with zinc at zinc binding sites, can inhibit the biological function of zinc [51, 52] . From this point of view, it can be explained that Pb may be unconducive to the development and proliferation of NK cells. Certainly, NK cells may also be influenced by multiple factors, such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, red blood cells and several cytokines, all of which can alter the number and function of NK cells [30, 53]. We determined blood cell quantities and cytokine c oncentrati ons 3 59Chapter 3 to explore the possible factors related to the change in percentage of NK cells. In this study, we found lower lymphocyte quantities in children from Guiyu. As a kind of lymphocytes, CD3- CD56dimCD16+ is the most abundant subpopulation of NK cells in human peripheral blood. Unexpectedly, we did not find any reduction of lymphocyte counts associated with elevated Pb levels. Another blood cell type, platelets, may attenuate cytokine secretion and immunosuppressive responses of Th cells, and enhance Tc cell proli feration and cytotoxicity, as well as impeding the anti -tumor activity of NK cells [54]. Our results show that increased platelet counts are associated with elevated Pb levels, affecting NK c ell activity. Neutrophils are potent inflammatory effector cells e ssential to host defense, but they may also result in tissue damage [55]. Our findings show that children living in Guiyu have a higher percentage of neutrophils, and exhibit a negative correlation between the percentage of neutrophils and CD3- CD56dimCD16+ NK cells (data not shown). It has shown that even low exposure to Pb can cause an increase in the number of neutrophils in Pb -exposed workers[56] . T hus, our finding of the increased percentage of neutrophils may indicate a higher risk of inflammation in Gu iyu children . Thor\u00e9n et al. provided evidence t hat NK cells may have the ability to induce neutrophil apoptosis via NKp46- and Fas-dependent mechanisms [57]. Interestingly, we f ound monocyte numbers are negatively correlated with blood Pb levels, but there is no significant differenc e between the exposed group and the reference gr oup. Possible reason could be that the effects of Pb on monocytes are too low to be detected by our methods, or the effects of Pb on monocytes are neutralized by other factors. Research on the ant i-tumor effect and cytotoxicity of NK cells has been a hot topic in recent decades. The killing activity of NK cells is associated with the levels of cytokines and chemokines, the numbers of activated NK cells in the body, and the expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells [37, 38] . NK cells express a variety of cytokine and chemokine receptors. C ytokines and chemokines can regulate the development and function of NK cells, and promote NK cell -mediated anti -tumor immune response [58]. In our study, we found that IL-1 concentrations are higher in exposed group ( p < 0.05). This is similar to Li et al. who found that high expression of IL-1 and T NF- were associated with maternal Pb exposure in mouse pups. IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness and carcinogenesis, and et al. reported IL -1 can confer myeloid -derived suppressor cells with enhanced capacity to inhibit NK cell activity [39, 59] . Meanwhile, we 60Elevated Lead Levels and Adverse Effects on Natural Killer Cells also found that levels of IL -2, IL-2 7, MIP-1 and MIP-1 are lower in the exposed group. CD56bright NK cells can constitutively express the high -affinity heterotrimeric IL -2 receptor (IL - 2R) and expand in vitro and in vivo in response to IL -2 [25] . This suggests that IL- 2 levels are related to the development and proliferation of CD56bright NK cells. As a member of the IL - 12 family of cytokines, IL-27 induces the production of IFN- by human NK c ells and increases cytotoxicity in mouse NK cells. It also potentiates antibody -dependent 60]. involved in the recruitment of NK cells to various tissues and sites of chronic inflammation, and may facilitate or potentiate NK cell cytotoxic activity [58, 61] . In addition, correlation analysis shows that the concentrations of IL-1 and IL-27 are both related to blood Pb levels (R s = 0.162 and R s = -0.306, respectively) . An explanation could be that Pb induced excessive ROS, thus stimulating MPAKs and NF -B signalling pathways to alter cytokine production, which has been demonstrated by Liu and Cabral et al. [62, 63] . Taken collectively, Pb may affect the expressions of IL-1 and IL-27, which are not conducive to the number and function of NK cells ( Figure 3 ). There are still some limitations in this study. Firstly, Guiyu children are exposed to multiple contaminants, including other heavy metals and organic pollutants, but we only investigate the effect of Pb on NK cells because of the insufficient blood samples. However, Pb is the most widespread environmental contaminant and hinders immune response, lymphocyte function and cytokine production reported in extensive research [46, 64, 65]. Secondly, there exist minor differences between the two groups and weak correlations between Pb and relevant immune parameters. Taking into account the duration and levels of exposure, the influence of Pb on these immune parameters may be more notable in the future. Finally, we did not directly measure the number of NK cell populations in peripheral blood. To better interpret the effects of Pb on the activity and function of NK cells, we need to detect more direct indicators, such as NK cell numbers, receptor expressions and NK cell -secreted granulysin/perforin. In addition, the toxicological effects of multiple contaminants on NK cells should be noticed in our further investigation. 3 61Chapter 3 Figure 3. Main effects of Pb exposure on immune parameters in this study. Black arrows: higher levels in Guiyu children; Green arrows: lower levels in Guiyu children; Red the positive correlations between Pb and parameters; Blue arrows: the negative correlations between Pb and parameters. 5. Conclusions To summarize, we demonstrate higher blood Pb levels and lower percentages of NK cells in Guiyu children. Our findings suggest that the elevated Pb levels result in the lower percentages of NK cells, but also alter the levels of platelets, IL-1 and IL-27, which might be unconducive to the activity and function of NK cells. More indicators related to the activity and function of NK cells should be measured to elucidate Pb toxicological effect in the future studi es.

Faas, Xijin Xu Chapter 4 ABSTRACT Dysre gul ated apoptosis can disturb the survival and function of B cells, affecting the humoral immune response. However, the effects of exposure to heavy metal on B cell apoptosis in humans are not fully investigated. This study explored whether lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) exposure are associated with B cell apoptosis in preschool children. A total of 147 preschool children, 3 - 7 years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (an electronic waste recycling area) and a reference group. Individual blood Pb and Cd le vels were measured by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Proportions of cells in apoptosis and caspase- 9 activation of CD19+ B cells were assessed by a flow cytometer. The detection of NF -B transcription factor c-Rel and p65 mRNA level in CD19+ B cells was performed by real -time polymerase chain reaction (RT -qPCR). Plasma cytokines (IL -4, IFN- and IL-6) involved in B cell development were tested by a Luminex 200 analyzer. Guiyu children had increased blood Pb and Cd levels but lower apoptosis in CD19+ B cells. The levels of caspase- 9 activation and IL- 4 were decreased, while c-Rel mRNA level and IFN -/IL-4 ratio w ere elevated in Guiyu group compared with the reference group. Notably, we present novel findings on the inverse association betw een heavy metal exposure and B cell apoptosis in children . Decreased caspase - 9 activation and raised c- Rel mRNA level link Pb and Cd exposure to inhibited B cell apoptosis. Aberrant IL -4 production and Th1 bias may suggest a disturbance in the development and functioning of B cells. 68Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s 1. Intro d uction Environmental contamination by heavy metal lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) resulted from uncontrolled electronic waste (e -waste) recycling activities have aroused increasing attention in recent years [1, 2]. Concentrations of Pb and Cd were found to be considerably greater in the surrounding air, dust, soils, sediments, and plants of the e- waste recycling areas than in other regions [2-4]. Our prior studies reported elevated Pb and Cd levels among pregnant women and preschool children of Guiyu, a typical e- waste area with nearly a 30 -year history of unregulated e-waste disposal in southern China [5 -7]. Evidence of the association of exposure to Pb and Cd with human health was established. Epidemiological studies have shown that Pb and Cd toxicities are associated with numerous adverse outcomes of humans, such as cancers, neurological disorders, hypertension, cognitive impairments, immunodeficiency and specific organ dysfunctions [8- 10]. Mechanism research indicates that Pb and Cd are able to induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, subsequently promoting the process of carcinogenesis or apoptosis [11 -13]. B cells, also known as B lymphocytes, originate from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow throughout life and act as the effector of humoral immunity providing defense against pathogens [14]. Apart from contributing to the immune system by producing antigen- specific antibodies, B cells also function in the processes of antigen presentation, cytokine generation, lymphoid orga nogenesis, and T cell differentiation [15]. It has been acknowledged that the development and maturation of B cells are dependent upon the participation of multiple cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)- 4, IL -6, and interferon (IFN)- [16, 17]. During this process of maturation, apoptosis plays an essential role in the development of B cells, which contributes to check their affinity for self- antigens to delete those B cells expressing potentially self - reactive BCRs or failing any maturation steps [18, 19]. Investigations regarding the immunotoxicity of Pb and Cd on B cell s have been established. For instance, in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that Pb may promote the activation and proliferation of B cells, and increase the major histocompatibility comple x activity and antibody production [20, 21]. In contrast to Pb, in vitro exposure to Cd reduces the activity and percentage of B cells from humans and mice [22, 23]. However, the effects of Pb and Cd exposure on B cells are not fully elucidated in population studies. Our previous study reporting 4 69Chapter 4 decreased vaccine an tibody titers (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, polio, measles) in children exposed to Pb, Cd and other heavy metals and metalloids [24], indicates that the antibody- producing capacity of B cells (plasma cells) may have been affected by heavy metal exposure. This study aimed to evaluate the survival and development of B cells in preschool children following Pb and Cd exposure, and explore the potential role of in tracellular activated caspase- 9, nuclear factor- B (NF -B) transcription factors (c- Rel and p65) and cytokines (IL-4, IFN- and IL-6) in B cell apoptosis induced by Pb and Cd. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study participants A total of 147 preschool children, 3 - 7 years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (23\u00b0327N, 116\u00b0342E, the e -waste exposed group, n = 80) and Haojiang (23\u00b017N, 116\u00b043E, the reference group, n = 67) between December 2013 and January 2014. Guiyu is located in southeast China and is a typical e- waste destination with a more than 30 -year e -waste recycling history [25]. Haojiang, around 31.6 km away from Guiyu, has a similar latitude, number of inhabitants, socioeconomic status and cultural background to Guiyu but without any e- waste dispo sal actions. Questionnaires were delivered to all parents or guardians of participants and their written informed consent was received before the enrollment. A baseline survey of the standardized questionnaire and physiological health parameters was carried out by trained workers, which include general information on demographics, child's age, gender, body mass index (BMI), outdoor time, frequency of washing hands before meals, milk consumption frequency, calcium/iron/zinc supplementation frequency, parents ' education level, family member daily cigarette consumption, monthly household income, distance of the road from the residence. Participants enrolled were healthy children without having family medical history, or chronic diseases such as asthma, or acute cough or cold recently. The study protocol was approved and identified by the institutional review boards of the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. 70Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s 2.2. Measur e ment of blood Pb and Cd exposure Peripheral venous blood samples from participants were collected in vacuum tubes with EDTA anticoagulant by trained nurses from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Blood samples were immediately transferred to the lab withi n 2 hours after acquisition. The measurement of blood Pb and Cd levels w ere performed by using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFASS, Jena Zeenit 650, Germany) and has been described in our previous reports [7, 25]. Briefly, for blood Pb detection, the GFASS were set at the condition of a wavelength of 283.3 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of 0.8 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 \u00b0C, ashing at 950 \u00b0C, and atomization at 1500 \u00b0C. The accuracy of the method was controlled by recoveries between 92.5% and 104.6% from the spiked blood samples. For Cd, the similar procedure was followed with a wavelength of 228.8 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of 1.2 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 at 300 \u00b0C, and atomization at 1300 \u00b0C. The accuracy of the detection method was controlled by recoveries between 91.7% and 106.3% from the spiked samples. A relative standard deviation (RSD%) before each run w as acquired less than 15% as a warranty for the instrumental ac curacy, and the linearity of a five -point calibration curve for Pb and Cd ( r2 > 0.99) indicated the GFASS running under good performance. 2.3. Isolation and detachment of CD19+ B lymphocytes B cells in the peripheral blood of healthy participants were positively selected by using a Dynabeads CD19 Pan B kit (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions or as previously described [26]. Briefly, each fresh blood sample was mixed with Ca2+ and Mg2+ free PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 2 mM EDTA (Isolation Buffer) at a ratio of 1:2. After centrifugation at 600 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, Dynabeads were added and incubated with blood cells by a ratio of 1:40 for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, then rosetted cells were captured using a magnet (Thermofis her Scientific, USA) and washed 4 times with Isolation Buffer. Obtained cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% release B cells from Dynabeads, DETACHaBEAD CD19 (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) was added to the cell suspension at a ratio of 1:10. After incubation for 45 min at room temperature with gentle mixing, detached cells were thoroughly washed by resuspending the cells in a total volume of 4 71Chapter 4 10 mL RPMI 1640 me di um with 1% FCS and centrifuged for 6 min at 400 \u00d7 g to remove beads. The isolated CD19+ cells will be applied in the downstream flow cytometry for the tests of CD19+ B cell apoptosis and caspase -9 activation proportion. 2.4. Apoptosis and caspase-9 activation in CD19+ B cells Cell apoptosis measured by using an FITC-conj ugated Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit (BioVison, USA). In brief, after spinning at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min, cell pellet in each tube was resuspended in 500 L 1\u00d7 Annexin V binding buffer (BioVison, USA) with 5 \u00b5l V and 5 \u00b5l propidium iodide (PI) S taining Solution. Cell suspension was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. A total of 10,000 events was quantified to score each run. Flow cytometry data were plotted by flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6, biosciences, USA) CellQuest Software (BD biosciences, USA). Apoptosis is known to be executed by a series of sequentially activated caspases, in which caspase -9 is a key initiator in the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway that responds to harmful cellular stimuli [27, 28]. The CaspGLOW Fluorescein Active Caspase-9 Staining Kit (BioVision, was used to assess the activation of caspase -9 according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD19+ B cells in 300 L culture medium were incubated with 1 L cell membrane - permeable fluorogenic caspase -9 specific substrate (FIT C-LEHD -FMK, BioVision, USA), while negative control was treated with the caspase inhibitor Z -VA D -fmk (BioVision, USA). Afterward, cells were incubated with the fluorogenic substrates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C incubator with 5 % CO 2, then centrifuged at 855 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. Obtained cell pellet was resuspended in 500 L washing buffer (BioVision, USA). A total of 10,000 events were collected for each sample. Data were acquired by flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6, BD biosciences, USA) and analyzed by CellQuest Software (BD biosciences, USA). 2.5. Detection of NF- B transcription factors c-Rel and p65 mRNA level NF-B transcription factors were first identified as a regulator of B light chain expression in mature B and plasma cells by Sen and Baltimore [29]. It consists of a family of transcription factors RelA/p65, c -Rel, RelB, p50 and p52 that play critical roles in regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and development (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh 2009). To evaluate whether NF -B transcription factors were altered in CD19+ B cells of children following Pb 72Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s and Cd expo s ure, c- Rel and p65 transcriptional levels were measured by real -time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in this study. Total RNA was isolated from obtained CD19+ B cells using a Dynabeads O ligo(dT) 25 kit (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and previous literature [30, 31]. In brief, cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in a Lysis/Binding Buffer containing 100 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% LiDS, 5 mM dithiothreitol USA). A 10 L prewashed Dynabeads Oligo (dT)25 was added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with continuous shaking. Afterward, the mixture was placed on a magnet to collect beads, washed twice with 10 mM Tris -HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% LiDS, and twice with a similar washing buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA 10 mM Tris- HCl (pH 7.5) (both from Thermofisher Scientific). The capture d mRNA mixture was eluted from the beads in a 10 L of 10 mM Tris -HCl in 2 min at 75 \u00b0C, then was placed on the magnet and the supernatant containing the mRNA was quickly transferred to a new RNase- free tube. The one- step real -time PCR was conducted u sing a Quant One Step qRT- PCR Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, each 10 ng mRNA sample was used to perform a PCR reaction in a final volume of 20 L containing buffer 10 L of 2 \u00d7 Quant One- Step SYBR qRT -PCR Ma ster Mix (probe), 1 L of 2.5 U/\u00b5L HotMaster Taq Polymerase, 0.16 L Quant RTase (for one-step), each ddH 2O. The qRT- PCR reaction was undertaken by an Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 real- time thermal cycler (Thermofisher Scientific, USA). The cycling procedure involved reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, 58 \u00b0C for 20 s and 68 \u00b0C for 30 s. Relative transcript levels of c-Rel and p65 were normalized to the endogenous reference -Actin . The primers used in this study presented Cytokines, such as IL- 4, IFN- and IL-6, play a vital role in the proce ss of B cell development, survival and immunoglobulin isotype switching [16, 17]. In this study, we measured plasma levels of these cytokines to determine whether there exists a relationship between B cell apoptosis and cytokine production. Beads coated with anti-human IL-4, IL-6 and IFN- were incubated with the plasma samples according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The assay was carried out by a ProcartaPlex Th1/Th2 Cytokine Panel (11 plex) (Thermofisher Scientific, Luminex 200 multipl ex immunoassay instrument (Luminex, USA). 2.7. Statistic analysis All statistical analyses were performed by using R v3.6.3, SPSS 25.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Before data analysis, the one- sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify the specific distribution of data. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using the chi-square test and t- test, respectively. Normal distributions were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), and data between the two groups were compared using the independent- sample t-test. Abnormal distributions were presented as the median, and comparisons between two groups were made by the Mann-Whitney U test. For hypothesis testing, a p < 0.05 in a two- tailed test was considered statistically significant. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed to explore the simultaneous relationships between variables, including child gender, BMI and age group, heavy metal Pb and Cd, percentages of apoptosis and caspase- 9 activation, and relative mRNA levels of c- Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells, cytokine IL -4, IL- 6 and IFN- as well as the IFN -/IL-4 ratio from participants. Except for child age group, data of variables were processed into binary variables according to their medians. Based on the points located approximately in the same direction of the origin and the same quadrant of space by variables, MCA analysis can interpret the simultaneous relationships between them [32]. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of Pb and Cd exposure with B cell apoptosis. For this analysis, data of CD19+ B cell apoptosis percentage were ln - transformed to normalize the distribution, blood Pb and Cd levels were split into binary variables by their medians, and potential confounders were adjusted in 3 different models. The 74Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s model 1 r epresents a crude model without any adjustment; the model 2 was adjusted for child age, gender, head circumference, chest circumference and BMI; the model 3 was adjusted for child age, head circumference, chest circumference, gender, BMI, outdoor time, frequency of washing hands before meals, milk consumption frequency, calcium/iron/zinc supplementation frequency, parents' education level, family member daily cigarette consumption, monthly household income, distance of the road from the residence. 3.

No differences in child age, gender, body mass index (BMI), outdoor time, frequency of calcium/ iron/zinc supplementation, and monthly household income were found in the reference and exposed group. Children from the exposed group were more likely to have a lower frequency of hand-washing before meals, and milk consumption compared with children in the reference group. Moreover, the exposed group had significantly higher family member daily cigarette consumption and distance between residence and road, but significantly lower parents' educational level than those in the reference group ( p < 0.05). 3.2. Blood Pb and Cd levels in children Pb and Cd levels in child peripheral blood were examined. As shown in Figure 1 , the median [interquartile range (IQR)] blood Pb and Cd values in the exposed group was 5.40 (3.81 - 6.97) g/dL and 0.54 (0.36 - 0.66) g/dL greater than those in the reference group 4.10 - 5.26) g/dL and 0.43 respectively (both p < 0.05).4 75Chapter 4 Table 1.

Alterations of apoptosis and caspase-9 activation i n CD19+ B cells Proportions of CD19+ B cell apoptosis and caspase- 9 activated cells were determined as shown in the density plot ( Figure 2 ). According to our observation, the exposed group had a lower median apoptosis rate compared with the reference group (3.6% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.030). Caspase- 9 is the intrinsic initiator that induces apoptosis by harmful cellular stimuli; therefore, its activation probably indicates intrinsic apoptosis happens [27, 28]. We found the median caspase -9 activated level is significantly decreased in the exposed group (5.8%) compared with that in the reference group (9.0%) (p = 0.011). 3.4. Relative mRNA levels of c- Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells The subunits c- Rel and p65 are two essential transcription factors of NF -B, which was reported to play critical roles in regulating cell apoptosis and development [33]. In the present study, the relative mRNA levels of c- Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells were quantified compared to -actin mRNA level and results are shown in Figure 3 . We found that the exposed group had an elevated median c- Rel mRNA level compared with the reference group (fold-change: 2.30 vs. 1.01, p = 0.001). No significant difference was found in p65 mRNA level between the two groups (median fold-change: exposed group 0.55 vs. reference group 0.47, p = 0.572). 4 77Chapter 4 Figure 2.

Alterations in B cell development- related cytokines We further determined the production of several cytokines involved in B cell proliferation, survival and immunoglobulin isotype switching, such as IL- 4, IL -6 and IFN- [17]. Details are provided in Figure 4 . Lower median IL- 4 level was found in the exposed group (2.49 pg/mL) compared with the reference group (3.16 pg/ mL) (p < 0.05). The individual IFN- /IL-4 ratio was calculated to estimate the balance of T helper 1/T helper 2 (Th1/Th2) -type of responses [34]. According to our results, the median IFN- /IL-4 ratio in the exposed group (0.41) is 78Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s significantly greater than in the reference group (0.32) ( p = 0.037). No signific ant differences in IFN - and IL-6 were observed within two groups. Figure 3. Relative mRNA levels of NF -B transcription factor c-Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells.

Relationships between heavy metal, apoptosis, caspase-9 activation, NF- B transcription factors and cytokines To explore the complex interrelationships between heavy metal exposure and alterations in apoptosis, caspase- 9 activation, NF- B transcription factor c- Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells, and 4 79Chapter 4 cytokine IL- 4, IL - 6 and IFN- as well as the IFN -/IL-4 ratio from participants, a multiple correspondence analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 5 , the MCA map shows that dimension 1 and dimension 2 explain 52.1% and 33.2% of data variability, respectively. Points located in the same quadrant reflect the close correlation between these variables. For example, low BMI (12.6 - 15.4 kg/m2), high Pb level (4.8 - 16.3 g/dL), high Cd level (0.49 - 1.77 g/dL), low apoptosis proportion (0.8 - 4.4%,), low caspase-9 activation (1.1 - 7.9%), high c- Rel mRNA level (1.46 - 9.43 fold-change), low p65 mRNA level (0.21 - 0.49 fold-change), and low IFN- concentration (0.2 - 1.1 pg/mL) were scattered in the upper left quadrant. It prompts that high blood Pb and Cd levels are prone to be found in children with low BMI values, while low levels seem to exist in children with high BMI correspond ently (in the lower right quadrant). Pb and Cd exposure is negatively correlated with CD19+ B cell apoptosis as well as caspase- 9 activation according to the results in the upper left and lower right quadrants. Moreover, the MCA figure manifests high caspase -9 activation is related to high apoptosis of B cells, which also has a close relationship with low levels of c- Rel transcription and IFN - (in the upper left quadrant). It's worth noting that child age and gender might not disturb or be implicated in these interrelationships. Furthermore, to evaluate the association between heavy metal exposure and B cell apoptosis, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis. Data of blood Pb and Cd levels were split into binary variables as abovementioned. Based on our results ( Table 2 ), all 3 models show a descent for CD19+ B cell apoptosis percentage in high Pb group (4.8 - 16.3 g/dL) as compared with low Pb group (1.5 - 4.8 g/dL) when stratifying by median [ (95% confidence intervals or CIs in model 1, 2 and 3 are -0.376 ( - respectively, all p < 0.05]. In model 1, CD19+ cell apoptosis had a decrease [ (95% CI): - 0.272 ( -0.597, -0.053), p < 0.05] Cd group (0.49 - 1.77 g/dL) in compa rison with that in low Cd group (0.18 - 0.49 g/dL). Nevertheless, after adjustment, the decreased trends remained but no statistical significance in the model 2 and 3 for the association between Cd and cell apoptosis. 80Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s 4 81 Figure 5.

Value of *p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 4. Discussion Thi s study was carried out focusing on the spot of Pb and Cd exposure and humoral immunity in children. Children from the e -waste recycling area had higher exposure to heavy metal Pb and Cd, with a lower proportion of apoptosis and caspase- 9 activation but up- regulated c- Rel mRNA level in CD19+ B cells compared with the reference area. Using an MCA analysis, the complex interrelationships between relevant parameters, such as child gender, BMI and age group, Pb and Cd exposure, alterations in apoptosis, caspase-9 activation, and NF- B transcription factor c- Rel and p65 in CD19+ B cells, plasma cytokine IL -4, IL -6 and IFN- as well as the IFN -/IL-4 ratio, were revealed. We also discovered inverse associations of blood Pb and Cd level with CD19+ B cell apoptosis, which suggests that exposure to Pb and Cd might be detrimental to B cell survival and development. Our prior work has consistently shown elevated blood Pb and Cd levels in children from the e- waste recycling area [5, 35, 36]. E- waste recycling activities, such as incineration and acidic 82Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s leach ing, are a major source of the emission of Pb and Cd exposure for vulnerable populations, especially children and pregnant women [5, 36]. Based on MCA analysis, we observed an inverse association between BMI values and blood Pb and Cd levels in children in our study. Earlier literature has previously reported similar findings [37, 38], which suggests Pb and Cd exposure may limit or delay child growth and development. Although many other heavy metals and organic pollutants resulting from e -waste recycling activities have been previously reported [24, 39] , blood samples were not available for assessing multiple pollutants simultaneously due to the large measurement of markers in the aspect of B cells in the present study. Because of their high degree of toxicity and since they are ranked among the priority metals with a public health concern [40, 41], Pb and Cd could be a kind of representative pollutant to study environmental pollution and human health risk assessment. B cells are at the center of the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system [14]. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to observe a decreased apoptosis in CD19+ B cells of Guiyu children. B cell functioning is dependent on its appropriate development and proliferation, in which apoptosis is a counterbalance to cell proliferation and is a crucial process to select cell populations undergoing functional demise and to eliminate cells that are no longer required or potentially autoreactive [18, 42]. It has been demonstrated that decreased apoptosis in B cells may induce the disruption of immune homeostasis, promoting the incidence of autoimmunity or lymphoma [18]. Even though we hardly drew a conclusion on what adverse health consequences will emerge in the future, the fact of aberrant B cell apoptosis in Guiyu children should be cause for concern. The decreased caspase- 9 activation in CD19+ B cells found in this study suggests that the caspase -9 activity of B cells in Guiyu children might be suppress ed. Evidence from genetic knockout studies showed that abnormal suppression of caspase- 9 activity is not only associated with developmental aberrance and proliferative diseases but also considered as a tumor escape mechanism of apoptosis [27, 43, 44]. As a key initiator, caspase- 9 is required for intrinsic apoptosis to obliterate irreparable cells and maintain cell homeostasis [27, 28]. Our finding shows an association between the proportion of apoptotic CD19+ B cells and caspase- 9 activation, which provide s a piece of evidence to support the mechanism of apoptosis attributed to caspase- 9 activation. Besides the intrinsic pathway, apoptosis is also known to be initiated by an extrinsic pathway mediated by the death receptors, including Fas receptors, tumor 4 83Chapter 4 necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, and TNF -related apoptosis- inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors [45]. It is a limitation of this study that the evidence in terms of extrinsic apoptosis remains unexplained since the insufficient blood amounts of participants we obtained have fallen short of the assessment of experiments. Further studies are warranted to explain the alterations in the aspects of extrinsic apoptosis. The results of the present study also suggest the potential role of c- Rel in B cell apoptosis. In mammals, c -Rel and p65 serve as essential transcription factors in the NF -B family, which function in regulating B-cell development and apoptosis [46, 47]. Prior studies in genetic knockout mice demonstrated that mitogen -activated c-Rel-/- B cells failed to proliferate, by contrast, they underwent enhanced apoptosis compared with normal B cells [48]. Another former model stimulated with mitogen revealed that p65-/- B cell proliferation was impaired, whereas apoptosis did not change significantly [49]. Such evidence offers a plausibility that the existence of c- Rel is more critical than p65 for B cells to inhibit apoptosis induced by particular mitogenic signals [50]. Our observation shows an increased c- Rel mRNA level coinciding with a decrease of B cell ap optosis in Guiyu group, which is consistent with the explanation above. Meanwhile, the MCA map signifies affirmatively that low c- Rel mRNA level is associated with high B cell apoptosis (in the lower right quadrant of Figure 5 ), in other words, high c- Rel mRNA level is associated with low B cell apoptosis (in the lower right quadrant of Figure 5 ). Additionally, the association of c- Rel mRNA level with blood Pb and Cd value was found, possibly providing a link of B cell apoptosis with heavy metal exposure. The development, proliferation, isotype switching and immunoregulation ability of B cells are heavily dependent on cytokine production in the microenvironment [17, 51]. The plasma IL- 4 level presently observed is lower, and concomitantly, the IFN -/IL-4 ra tio was increased in Guiyu group, indicating a bias toward Th1 immune responses. IL-4, mainly produced by activated Th2 cells, was initially described as a B cell growth factor attributing stimulating B cell proliferation, survival and the preferential secretion of certain immunoglobulin isotypes, such as IgG1 and IgE [17, 52]. The Th1 response was reported to be responsible for IFN- primary source and ha s generally 5 - to 10- fold less efficient than Th2 in inducing B cell proliferation [17, 53]. IFN- /IL-4 ratio reflects the balance of Th1/Th2, which is also known to be related to B cell proliferation and isotype switching [54]. Based on the observation in the MCA map, we found a negative interaction between IFN - and B cell apoptosis, which suggests 84Exposure to lead and cadmium and their effects on CD19+ B cell s that IF N- o r Th1 bias is likely to decrease B cell proliferation relative to Th2 or IL -4. Accordingly, alterations in IL -4 and IFN- /IL-4 ratio indicate that there is an unfavorable microenvironment to support the development and immunoglobulin isotype switching of B cells in Guiyu children. It is worth noting that our findings are varied from previous studies. In the present study, our results show that exposure to Pb and Cd is inversely associated with B cell apoptosis level, suggesting that exposure to Pb and Cd might contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis in CD19+ B cells. However, in vitro and animal studies have shown that Pb and/or Cd stimulation can promote cell apoptosis [20, 55-57]. The inconsistency may be re lated to the difference in exposure dosages and duration; on the other hand, our study populations were exposed to the superimposition of two or more pollutants, thus our findings may differ from in vitro and animal studies. We also explored the impact of individuals' characteristics and social -behavioral factors on the association between heavy metal exposure and B cell apoptosis by multiple linear regression models ( Table 2 ). For example, a negative association between high Cd exposure and B cell apoptosis was found in model 1 without adjustment, while neither model 2 nor model 3 shows a significant estimate, which suggests that not only individuals' characteristics (child age, gender, head circumference, chest circumference and BMI) but also social -behavi oral factors (outdoor time, frequency of washing hands before meals and milk consumption, parents' education level, family member daily cigarette consumption, etc.) may pose an implication in their relationship. Our previous studies have reported that soci al-behavioral factors, such as parents' education level, milk consumption and frequency of washing hands before meals, were negatively associated with Pb and Cd in child blood due to their favorable role in the prevention of and protection from heavy metal exposure [58, 59]. Meanwhile, as aforementioned, child BMI was found to be inversely associated with blood Pb and Cd levels [37, 38] . Therefore, adjusting for these possible confounders is likely to remove bias and show a relatively credible relationship between heavy metal exposure and B cell apoptosis. In conclusion, children living in the e- waste recycling area suffered from relatively high exposure to Pb and Cd. The association between CD19+ B cell apoptosis and Pb and Cd exposure provides significant evidence suggesting the role of Pb and Cd exposure in suppressing CD19+ B cell apoptosis in a population study. Our preliminary investigations into the mechanisms showed that caspase -9 activation and NF- B transcription factor c-Rel mRNA4 85Chapter 4 level li nk t he suppression of B cell apoptosis to Pb and Cd exposure. Decreased IL-4 production and Th1 bias probably point to the existence of adverse disturbance in the development and functioning of either B cells or T cells, which however needs further health surveil lance and assessment. Based on our results, we are concerned about the consequences of the inhibition of B cell apoptosis in Guiyu children in the future.

Faas, Xijin Xu Chemosphere, 2020. 257:127257 Chapter 5 Abstract He avy metals generate adverse health effects by interfering with immune homeostasis and promoting inflammation in individuals. Our objective was to explore the induction of immune and inflammatory responses by multiple heavy metals in children living in th e e-waste contaminated area. A total of 147 preschool children were recruited, including 73 children from Guiyu, a typical e-waste recycling area, and 74 from a reference group. Blood levels of heavy metals, including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As), were detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). Immune cell counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) were determined by an automatic blood cell analyzer, pro- inflammatory cytokines (IL -1, IL-6, analyzed a Luminex 200 multiplex immunoas say instrument. Multiple correspondences and linear regression analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between heavy metal exposure and relevant parameters. Results showed that Guiyu children had higher levels of Pb, Cd, Hg, As, IL-1 and IL-6, but decreased lymphocyte, IL-1RA and IL-13. Neutrophil count was positively correlated with Pb, Cd and Hg exposure. Anti-inflammatory IL -1RA concentration was negatively related with Pb, Cd, Hg and As, while pro-inflammatory IL -1 and IL- 6 were positively correlated with Pb. Guiyu children may have dysregulated immune response and high inflammation risk. Exposure to Pb, Cd, Hg and As could be harmful to immune response and inflammatory regulation. Our finding of decreased IL-RA production in children exposed to Pb, Cd, Hg, and As is novel and could be an opportunity for future research. 90Aberrant Immune Homeostasis and Inflammatory Activation 1. Intr o duction Electronic waste (e- waste) is defined as those discarded electrical and electronic equipment and components, which has become a rapidly increasing global problem [1, 2]. E- waste recycling, especially informal and unprotected recycling processes such as acid dissolution, incineration, pyrolysis and gasification, allows the emission of dangerous chemicals, including heavy metals and persistent organic pollutant s [1]. Generally, residents living in close vicinity of an e- waste recycling area are also at risk of environmental exposure due to the contamination in the environment, food and water [1]. As one of the largest e- waste destinations and recycling areas in China and worldwide, Guiyu has a 30-year history of e-waste disposal and recycling [3, 4]. Elevated Pb and Cd levels were found in the plac enta, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and urine of the Guiyu population [2, 5, 6]. Recently, our studies demonstrated that exposure to Pb may contribute to cardiovascular endothelial inflammation and restricted physical growth and development, and cause adverse changes in blood morphology, hemoglobin synthesis and erythrocyte complement receptor 1 expression in Guiyu children [6-9]. Growing evidence indicates that heavy metals exert toxicity to individuals by interfering with immune homeostasis and promoting inflammation [10- 12]. Heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As), have been sufficiently underscored by prior mechanistic studies. They can cause oxidative stress by inducing the production of rea ctive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [13] , and promote DNA damage and cell necrosis [14 -16]. Due to the loss of membrane integrity, necrotic cells release intracellular inflammatory molecules to the extracellular space and consequentially provoke inflammation activation [13, 17]. Epidemiological studies and animal models have indicated that chronic inflammatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, gout, recurrent pericarditis, heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis and smoldering myeloma, are strictly related to high exposure to environmental contaminants [18-22]. Inflammation is a part of the complex immune response in the body initiated by injurious stimuli, such as damaged cells, pathogens and stimulants. Evidence suggests that infla mmation is strictly linked to the genesis of diseases in humans [23]. As a protective response, the function of inflammation is to eliminate injury -inducing agents, clear out necrotic cells, tissues damaged from the original insult, and initiate repair proc esses and restore the physiological function of 5 91Chapter 5 the tissue or organ affected [24, 25]. However, prolonged inflammation may contribute to a wide range of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disea ses [26 -31]. Inflammation involving the innate and adaptive immune systems requires proper coordination of blood vessels, immune cells and molecular mediators in the development and maintenance of inflammation. In the acute inflammatory phase, neutrophils respond to various harmful stimuli and tissue damage. Studies have confirmed that monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) constitute the predominant immune cell infiltrates in chronic inflammation [32 -35]. As the largest corpuscle of leukocyte s, monocytes in the bloodstream migrate to tissue and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, both of which are capable of phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine production involved in the ongoing inflammatory process and immune r esponse [36-38]. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that critical cytokines, including pro-inflammatory or anti- inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 , receptor antagonis t (IL-1 RA), IL -4, IL-10 and IL- 13, play pivotal roles in mediating inflammatory responses as well as in regulating immune homeostasis [39, 40]. Consequently, inflammation- related immune cells and cytokines circulating in the bloodstream can be used to monitor inflammation in the body. Concern about the toxicity of heavy metal exposure from e- waste is increasing. In our previous studies, parameters involved in immune and inflammatory regulation, such as aberrant alteration of cytokines, increased memory T c ell, low percentages of natural killer (NK) cells and decreased concentrations of hepatitis B vaccine titers, have been reported to be associated with exposure to trace levels of environmental chemicals [41-43]. Even so, unequivocal evidence of immune and inflammation activation in children suffering from early -childhood exposure to heavy metals remains little. Hence, we carried out this study to explore and reveal the alterations in immune and inflammatory response resulting from heavy metal exposure. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Recruitment and questionnaire survey of the study population This analysis used partial data from our earlier study [42] . A total of 147 preschool children, 3- to 7-years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (23\u00b0327N, 116\u00b0342E, the e -waste-exposed area, Haojiang 116\u00b043E, the reference area, n=74) in December, 2014. Haojiang is about 31.6 km to the east of Guiyu, without any e-waste pollution. The two regions both belong to Shantou, Guangdong province, and has similar characteristics in latitude, demographic characteristics, life- styles, eating habits, traffic conditions, cultural background and socioeconomic status, as described in our previous study [44]. All enrolled participants from both Guiyu and Haojia ng in this study were somatically healthy and free from medications, inflammation or disease history within 1 month before sampling. All parents or guardians of participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The questionnaire collected detailed information on general characteristics of parents and children: child age, gender and BMI, distance of the road from the residence, milk consumption frequency, parents' education level, daily smoking by family members, parents' residence time, fr equency of washing hands before meals, child born locally (Guiyu or Haojiang), child e-waste contact, ventilation of house, e-waste pollution within 50 meters (m) of residence, maternal occupation associated with e - waste dismantling, residence used as a wo rkshop. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. 2.2. Collection and processing of blood samples Venous blood samples were obtained from participants and collected in vacuum tubes by trained nurses from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Blood samples in EDTA -containing vacuum tubes were used for the detection of heavy metals and inflammation -related cells. Blood without anticoagulants was centrifuged for 10 min at 855 \u00d7 g at room temperature, and the isolated serum supernatant was stored at -80 \u00b0C until assayed for inflammatory cytokines. 2.3. Determination of heavy metals The detection methods of heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb and As) were according to Lu et al. and Wu et al. [45, 46]. Metal concentrations were detected using spectrometry (ICP -MS) (Agilent 7700x; Agilent, USA) in the S henzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A standard solution of heavy metals was obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology of China (NIM, Beijing, China). 2.4. Analysis of immune cells Venous blood samples collected in EDTA -containing vacuum tubes were immediately sent to the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College after drawing from 5 93Chapter 5 participants. Counts of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes were determined by an automatic b lood cell analyzer (XE -2100, Sysmex, Japan). 2.5. Measurement of immune and inflammation regulation -related cytokines In our previous study, we described multiple immunoassays of 34 cytokines [43]. Immune and inflammation regulatory cytokines serum, including four pro -inflammatory [interleukin (IL)- 1, IL-6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis and four anti- inflammatory cytokines IL- 13] were quantified by a ProcartaPlex Human Cytokine & Chemokine Panel 1A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Concentrations of these cytokines were analyzed by Luminex 200 multiplex immunoassay instrument (Luminex, USA). 2.6. Statistical analysis All stati stical analyses were carried out using R v3.6.3, SPSS 25.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using the chi-square test and t- test, respectively. Abnormal distributions, including heavy metal level, cell count and cytokine concentration, were presented as the median, and comparisons between two groups were m ade by the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple correspondence analysis was conducted to investigate the pattern of relationships between heavy metal exposure and socioeconomic factors from questionnaires. It can provide a structural organization for the variables and categories in a dimensiona l space that is useful for identifying patterns in the data and associations between the investigated parameters [47]. Multiple categories, such as child gender, distance of the road from the residence, milk consumption frequency, parents' education level, daily smoking by family members, parents' residence time, frequency of washing hands before meals, child born locally (Guiyu or Haojiang), child e- waste contact, ventilation of house, e-waste pollution within 50 m of residence, maternal occupation associa ted with e -waste dismantling, residence used as a workshop (see Table 1 ), as well as quintile data of heavy metal levels were all located as a point in a two -dimensional space. These factors reflect the situation in the aspects of children's behavior habits, diet, nutritional status, physical growth and development, dwelling environment as well as parents' care awareness. On the other hand, most of them have been reported to have an inverse association with blood Pb levels. For example, milk consumption may be a part of nutritional intervention to reduce Pb absorption and is considered as a protective factor for Pb exposure [6]. 94Aberrant Immune Homeostasis and Inflammatory Activation Multi p le linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of heavy metal exposure with immune and inflammation regu latory cells/cytokines. For this analysis, data of heavy metals, cell counts and cytokines were ln- transformed to normalize the distribution. Potential confounders including child age, gender and BMI were adjusted in the models. Model 1 represents a crude model without any adjustment; model 2 was adjusted for child gender, age and BMI; model 3 was adjusted for child age, gender and BMI, distance of the road from the residence, milk consumption frequency, parents' education level, daily smoking by family mem bers, parents' residence time, frequency of washing hands before meals, child born locally (Guiyu or Haojiang), child e-waste contact, ventilation of house, e-waste pollution within 50 m of residence, maternal occupation associated with e- waste dismantling, residence used as a workshop. Meanwhile, the interaction effects of Pb, Cd, Hg and As on immune cells and cytokines were assessed by a centering methodology in the multiple linear regression models. For hypothesis testing, a p < 0.05 in a two- tailed test was considered statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics of the study population Study participant characteristics for the exposed and reference groups are provided in Table 1 . The mean child's age in the exposed group was 5.0 years and 4.6 years in the reference group (p = 0.007). The mean child BMI was not significantly different between the two groups. All categories were significantly different between exposed and reference groups with the exception of child gender and smoking by family members. 3.2. Elevated heavy metal levels in Guiyu children Blood concentrations of heavy me tals are shown in Figure 1 . The median values of Pb, Cd, Hg and As in the exposed group (37.23 g/L, 0.33 g/L, 1.46 g/L and 5.91 g/L, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the reference group (22.74 g/L, 0.23 g/L, 1.10 g/L and 4.18 g/L, respectively) (all p < 0.001). It indicates that the risk of heavy metal exposure in the e- waste- exposed area is more serious than in the reference group. . 5 95Chapter 5 Table 1.

V alues of * p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 were considered statistically significant. 3.3. Im pact of contributing factors on heavy metal exposure Multiple correspondence analysis was performed to determine which socioeconomic factors were linked to changes in heavy metal levels. Data of heavy metals from all participants were processed into different percentiles, which are presented in Table S1 (see Supplementary Material). Some categorical variables did not show significant differences in each sub -group of heavy metals determined by the chi-square test (data not shown) and were excluded in the following analysis. A joint plot of category points for the first and second dimensions showed an association of socioeconomic factors to heavy metal distributions (Figure 2 -A, B, C, and D). For instance, in Figure 2 -A, dimension 1 contributed with 53.2% of the inertia, while dimension 2 contributed 33.7%. The first quartile of Pb was likely to be associated with milk consumption frequency and not being born locally, and the fourth quartile of Pb was probably associated with residence used as a workshop, e- waste pollution existing within 50 m of residence, and a lack of milk consumption. For Cd, the first tertile was associated with a residence as not being a workshop, and the highest tertile was associated with occasion al ventilation of the house. In addition, the highest tertile of Hg was associated with a long residence time of the mother (>10 years), and the highest tertile of As was inclined to be associated with variables such as maternal education level (primary) a nd occasional child hand washing before meals. 98Aberrant Immune Homeostasis and Inflammatory Activation Figure 2. A joint plot o f category points for the first two dimensions showing the association of relevant variables to blood Pb (A), Cd (B), Hg (C), and As (D) levels. Various identified points represent different variables. The relative distance of points in the same quadrant indicates the correlation level between variables. 3.4. Alterations in immune cells and inflammatory cytokines The median lymphocyte count was lower in the exposed group than in the reference group (3.71 \u00d7 109 cells/L versus 4.17 \u00d7 109 cells/L) (p = 0.007); whereas there were no significant differences in neutrophil and monocyte counts between the two groups ( Figure 3 ). The median concentration of IL-1 and IL-6 were higher in the exposed group (0.88 pg/mL and 6.12 pg/mL, respectively) compared with those in the reference group (0.67 pg/mL and 4.51 pg/mL, 5 99 Chapter 5 respectively) (both p < 0.05) ( Figure 4 ). Howeve r, anti- inflammatory cytokines IL -1RA and IL-13 were both lower in the exposed group (83.72 pg/mL and 3.67 pg/mL, respectively) compared with those in the reference group (162.21 pg/mL and 4.41 pg/mL, respectively) (both p < 0.001). The concentrations of IL- 8, TNF- , IL-4 and IL- 10 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Figure 3. Counts of immune cells in child peripheral blood. A. Neutrophil counts; B.

A ssociation between heavy metals and immune cells Ln-transformed data supported the use of multiple linear regression models for the association of heavy metals and immune cells ( Table 2 ). In the unadjusted model 1, neutrophil count was positively related with Pb, Cd and Hg exposure [ (95% confidence intervals 2 neutrophil count was Pb and Hg (0.003, 0.394), Hg: 0.157 (0.002, 0.313)]. with neutrophil count [ (95%): 0.117 (0.028, 0.263)] ( p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the positive association of monocyte level with Cd exposure [ (95%): 0.109 (0.009, 0.226)] was found in model 3 ( p < 0.05). The interaction effects of 4 metals on immune cells was also analyzed, however, we did not discover a significant interaction between them ( Table S2 in Supplementary Materials). 3.6. Association between heavy metals and immune and inflammation regulatory cytokines In the linear regression analysis (Table 3 ), the association between heavy metals and cytokines involved in immune and inflammation regulatory processes w as explored. Both Pb and Cd positively correlated with IL -1 production in the crude model Cd remained a positive relationship with IL -1 level after adjusting for child age, gender and BMI [ (95% CI): 0.165 (0.023, 0.352)] ( p < 0.05). Results showed that the association between Pb and IL -6 maintained positive in all 3 models [model 1: 0.287 (0.056, 0.518), (0.036, 0.617), respectively] (all p < 0.05). The association between heavy metals and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Table 4 ) indicates that all four heavy metals were negatively related to IL -1RA in Model 1 and 2 (all p < 0.05). Interaction associations between metals and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines were not found ( Table S3 in Supplementary Materials ). 5 101Chapter 5 Table 2.

Disc ussi on In this study, children from the e-waste recycling area had higher heavy metal levels (Pb, Cd, Hg and As) but lower lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood. Altered production of cytokines involved in the immune response and inflammatory regulation were observed. Pro- inflammatory IL -1 and IL -6 were elevated , but anti -inflammatory IL -1RA and IL-13 were decreased . These changes might suggest aberrant immune homeostasis and inflammatory activation in children living in the exposed area. Moreover, our results revealed that exposure to Pb, Cd, Hg and As is associated with the alterations in neutrophils, IL-1 , IL-6 and IL- 1RA. Our data demonstrated the associations between heavy metal exposure and relevant factors in questionnaires ( Figure 2 ). Although previous studies have performed similar analyses with regard to the association between confounding factors and heavy metal exposure by linear regression analysis or spearman correlation analysis [43, 48], this study applied MCA analysis because it is a multivariate exploratory analysis method for visualizing large datasets of categorical variables [47]. The contrib uting factors, such as residence used as an e- waste workshop, maternal occupation associated with e-waste dismantling, and e- waste pollution within 50 m of the residence, were related to the highest quartile of Pb levels. In multiple correspondence analysis, education levels of parents were found to be negatively linked to heavy metal As concentration. We speculated that parents with higher educational levels have healthier awareness to prevent their children from e -waste hazards. Some behaviors involved in the prevention of and protection from e-waste exposure, such as high frequency of milk consumption, hand washing before meals, and house ventilation, were respectively associated with the lowest blood levels of Pb, As and Cd. Milk consumption frequency ma y reflect child nutritional status and intervene with Pb accumulation, it thus is considered as a protective factor for Pb exposure to some extent [6]. Heavy metals can accumulate on dust particles and other materials in the environment [49]. Ventilation a nd handwashing may decrease the contact opportunity of exposure to heavy metals. Furthermore, the maternal residence time in the e- waste area also determines heavy metal exposure to children, especially those who were born in Guiyu. Previous epidemiological studies have confirmed that those mothers with a long- term residence in an e- waste recycling area had relatively high levels of heavy metals in their blood and milk; these toxins can enter the body of the offspring through the placental barrier or breast feeding process, increasing child exposure to heavy metals, accordingly [5, 50-53]. 5 105Chapter 5 Immune cells and cytokines play an indispensable role in immune function and inflammatory regula tion. We observed that different heavy metals exhibit distinct impacts on n eutrophil counts. In the early stage of inflammation, neutrophils in the blood are initially recruited by sensing chemoattractant gradient, then traverse the vascular endothelium, and ultimately reach the sites of infection or inflammatory stimuli within minutes [54, 55]. Thus, sufficient amounts of neutrophils are required for surveilling and eliminating heterologous microbes and irritants. Although no remarkable difference in neutrophil counts between the two groups exists, our results showed positive rel ationships between neutrophil counts and exposure to Pb and Hg in all 3 models (Table 2 ). It suggests that the impact of individuals' characteristics and social - behavioral factors on the association between neutrophil counts and exposure to Pb and Hg is not obvious. Interestingly, a positive association between Cd exposure and neutrophil counts was found in both model 1 and model 3, while it disappeared in model 2, which may be due to the variation of child age, gender and BMI. A previous population study by Di Lorenzo et al. found an increased number of blood neutrophils in lead-exposed workers [56], which is in accordance with our result. The animal studies concerning Cd toxicity suggested Cd- treated mice had increased monocytes and neutrophils in the bone marrow and spleens, while a significantly higher neutrophil count was observed in the peripheral blood of Cd-exposed rats [43, 57]. Our finding is also in line with a prior animal study showing enhanced neutrophil counts concerning increasing Hg exposure [58], but not identical with a recent cohort study reporting no significant correlation of neutrophil counts with the Hg concentration [59]. Due to the difficulty of evaluating tissue- resident macrophages, as well as the rarity of dendritic cells in human blood [60], we could only analyze monocyte counts in child peripheral blood. However, a significant alteration in monocyte amount was not found in the present study. Despite that, our finding of reduced lymphocyte count in exposed populations is in accordance with several studies [59, 61, 62]. It is well known that the migration of circulating lymphocytes plays a more prominent role in eliminating pathogenic microorganisms or noxious stimuli in chronic inflammation; hence, the decreased lymphocyte quantity is not conducive to the immune system in response to harmful conditions [63- 66]. A decr ease in lymphocyte count might hint that the proliferation of lymphocytes is disturbed or suppressed, which could lead to an ineffective immune function of children in e- waste areas. Heavy metals upset the balance of the pro - and anti- inflammatory process es. Our study 106Aberrant Immune Homeostasis and Inflammatory Activation demons t rated that children from the e -waste recycling area have elevated pro -inflammatory IL - 1 and IL-6, but lower anti- inflammatory IL -1RA and IL-13 levels. No difference in IL- 8, TNF- , IL-4, and IL -10 production was found between the two groups, which is not surprising because the release of cytokines may partially be attributed to stimulators, but could be driven by genetics, cytokine half-lives or other unexpected confounders. The half- life of each biomarker is shown in Table S4 in Suppl ementary Materials. IL -1 is mainly monocytes, tissue macrophages and dendritic cells. It exerts diverse effects on multiple cell types, culminating in broad inflammation, although often being at best only slightly elevated in human inflammatory diseases even under conditions of severe pathology [67, 68]. IL- 1RA is expressed by various cells in an inflammatory environment and is regarded as an essential negative feedback mechanism to limit inflammation mediated by IL -1 [69]. IL-13 is primarily generated by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and is excessively produced in allergy, asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases [70, 71]. At present, we cannot identify far- reaching health consequences, such as chronic diseases and malignancies in children from e -waste areas. According to the imbalance of inflammatory cytokines, our finding suggests that children living in the e- waste areas gravitate towards an inflammatory status or at least possess a relatively high inflammation risk. We noticed that abnormal cytokine expression, including of IL-1, IL-6 and IL- 1RA, is dependent on heavy metal exposure. Our observation indicates that Pb exposure induces IL-1 and IL-6 but suppresses IL-1RA production. The association between Pb and IL-1 can be weakened when adjusting individuals' characteristics and social -behavioral factors, indicating that these factors may contribute to IL -1 production. In parallel with our results, previous research in both humans and animals has also shown IL-6 is over- expressed following Pb exposure [72- 75]. IL-6 is proposed as a predictor for malignancy since elevated IL- 6 level is closely associated with tumorigenic progression; in addition, dysregulated IL- 6 synthesis plays a pathological role in chronic inflam mation and autoimmunity [76-78]. Moreover, Pb, Cd, Hg and As exposure all exhibit inhibitory contribution to IL-1RA synthesis. With regard to the associations between all 4 metals and IL -1RA, they did not exist in model 3, suggesting that they may be hampe red by social -behavioral factors. There unfortunately is no supporting evidence for the correlation of their exposure and IL-1RA secretion. In this case, our finding is novel and could be an opportunity for future research. As a consequence of the alterations in 5 107Chapter 5 pro-inflammatory IL -1, IL-6 and ant i-inflammatory IL -1RA, we speculated that individuals exposed to Pb, Cd, Hg and As might sustain a potential threat by immune imbalance and inflammatory conditions. Exposure to heavy metals could be harmful to Guiyu children. In general, immune function may be enhanced, as a protective mechanism, to respond to danger signals derived from endogenous and exogenous molecules after acute exposure to occupational and environmental pollutants [79, 80]. However, long- term exposure to heavy metals (either low-dose or high-dose) uniformly causes immunosuppression and directly interferes with the sensitization of the immune system to antigens [81 -84]. So to some extent, our observation is in agreement with previous findings that exposure to heavy metals prompts several subtle changes in perturbing immune regulation. Continuous heavy metal exposures could inevitably impair immune function, subsequently resulting in the occurrence of the disease. This however needs further health surveillance and assessment. Several limitations of our study should be stated. Considering the sample size, we explored the impact of heavy metal exposure on cells and cytokines involved in the immune regulatory and inflammatory processes after merging all data from both groups. Therefore, a few unknown confounders will interfere with our established linear models. Many other toxic compounds and pollutants, for example, persistent organic pollutants are also a major concern of the e -waste dismantling are a [85, 86]. It is challenging to run all items of tests in this study due to the insufficient volume of blood samples. Some customs and individual habits may affect immune homeostasis and inflammatory activation in children. However, we failed to provide t he evidence for the analysis in this regard. Moreover, since inflammation is generally accompanied by tissue injury, monitoring tissue -resident macrophages or mast cells would be very important in assessing different inflammatory period s. Thus, additional studies are sorely needed to better understand the influence of heavy metal exposure on the occurrence and development of inflammation and other diseases in future investigations. 108Aberrant Immune Homeostasis and Inflammatory Activation 5. Conclu s ions This study identified the alterations of immune cells and cytokines in preschool children exposed to heavy metals Pb, Cd, Hg and As. Children living in the e- waste recycling area had higher levels of heavy metals. Decreased blood lymphocyte amount was obse rved in children from the e -waste recycling area, which might suggest that their immune function is either disturbed or suppressed. Elevated pro- inflammatory IL -1 and IL-6, and declined anti- inflammatory IL -1RA and IL -13 may indicate that Guiyu children had dysregulated immune response and high inflammation risk. Association analysis reveals that exposure to Pb, Cd, Hg and As is likely to contribute to the alterations in neutrophils, IL -1, IL-6 and IL- 1RA, prompting adverse effects on immune response and inflammatory regulation. Our finding of the inverse association between IL -1RA and heavy metals is novel and could be an opportunity for future research.

Lewis, SIGNALLING ACTIVATION IN MONOMAC 6 CELLS EXPOSED TO HEAVY METALS LEAD AND CADMIUM Yu Zhang, Luis Silva -Lagos, Bart de Haan, Xijin Xu, Xia Huo, Paul de Vos, Marijke M. Faas Chapter 6 ABSTRACT Heavy me tals lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) impair host defense to pathogens, while the precise mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to demonstrate whether Toll- like receptor (TLR) and NF -kB activation are induced by Pb and Cd. Using Monomac 6 cells, we evaluated how Pb and Cd induce cell death and cell apoptosis, as well as cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release of monocytes; we also studied the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in these cells by Pb and Cd. The activation and inhibition assays in TLR reporter cell lines showed that Pb exposure enhanced agonist-induced activation of TLR4, 5 and 8, but inhibited agonist-induced activation of TLR3 and 9. Exposure to the high Cd concentration attenuated agonist- mediated TLR2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 activations; on the other hand, Cd also increased agonist -induced activation of TLR, 4, 5, and 8 at a relative ly low concentration. In Monomac 6 cells, Pb and Cd induced cell death and cell apoptosis in the absence and presence of LPS. Pb slightly incr eased ICAM- 1 expression, while both Pb and Cd decreased LPS- induced ICAM-1 expression on Monomac 6 cells. LPS- mediated p ro-inflammatory TNF - production of MonoMac 6 was elevated by Pb, while anti- inflammatory IL -10 was down- regulated by both Pb and Cd exposure. Moreover, Cd exposure was found to elevate phospho- p38 expression. LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation was up-regulated by Pb and Cd, indicating that Pb and Cd exposure could promote LPS-mediated p38 MAPK activation in MonoMac 6. Taken together, our findings revolving around TLRs, NF- B and p38 MAPK in MonoMac 6 provide an insight into a possible mechanism that Pb and Cd exposure may disturb immune reactions of monocytes affecting host resistance to pathogens. 118Toll-like receptor, NF -B and p38 MAPK in MonoMac 6 1. Introduction The heavy m etals lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. Various mechanical studies concerning Pb and Cd toxicity demonstrated that both Pb or Cd could result in decreased cell viability, enhanced oxidative stress and lipid pe roxidation, mitochondrial and DNA damage, cohesion loss and cell apoptosis [1-4]. Exposur e to Pb and Cd has also been shown to exert detrimental effects on the i nnate immune cells, even at low concentrations [5, 6]. Studies indicated that Pb negatively affected chemotaxis in neutrophils, and decreased phagocytosis and eicosanoid metabolism in [7-9]. Cd could i nduce oxidative stress of macrophages and mast cells in response to infections [10] . In vi vo, Cd exposure has been reported to be associated with an increase in neutrophil counts in children from an electronic waste recycling area and monocyte counts in Cd-exposed w orkers [11, 12]. The mechanism by which Pb and Cd affect the innate immune cells is not precise ly known. It has been suggested that these heavy metals affect Toll -like rece ptor (TLR) signalling. TLRs serve a vital role in host def ense combating invading infectious agents. In the vertebrate innate immune system, TLRs sense and recognize diverse damage/danger -associat ed molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated by the host itself, as well as pathogen -associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [13- 15]. To da te, 10 TLRs in humans have been well demonstrated to be involved in the process of adaptive immune and inflammatory responses [13, 16, 17] . All TLR s except TLR3 utilize a common myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD) 88 media ted by Toll -IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains resulting in the activation of the downstream signall ing pathways nuclear factor and cell apoptosis [13, 16]. Although various studies have shown the effects of Pb and Cd on TLRs, the effects of Pb or Cd on TLR activation remain unclear. Luna et al. considered TLR4 as a target of environmentall y relevant Pb exposure ( 5 g/dL est ablished by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) [18]. Studi es concerning gene expressions observed that TLR3, TLR5, and TLR9 in the Madin-Darby c anine kidney cell line and TLR2 and TLR4 in rat kidney tissue were up-regulated by Cd treatment [19, 20]. Although little is known about the effects of Pb and Cd on TLR activation, the TLR signal l ing pathway has been associated with other heavy metals, 6 119Chapter 6 such as mercury, copper, nickel and zinc. For instance, Pollard et al. showed tha t mercury elicited NF -B activat ion and pro- inflammatory cytokine expression via endosomal TLR7 and TLR9 trafficking and signalling [21]. Schmidt et al. identified nickel ion as one of the chemical activators of the TLR system, which activated human TLR4 t o promote the in flammatory response through NF- B-, p38- and IRF3-depende nt signal pathways [22]. An in vivo study by Hu et al. revealed that zinc supplementation is beneficial to protect intestinal tissu e from inflammation via inhibiting the TLR4 -MyD88 signalling pa thways [23] . Similar observations made by Jarrousse et al. demonstrated that zinc could inhibit TLR2 expression to alleviate inflammation [24]. In the present study, we hypothesize that Pb and Cd may affect the immune system via TLRs. Therefore , this study aimed to determine whether heavy metals Pb and Cd exposure alters the immune cell ac tivation by interacting with TLRs and the downstream NF -B and p38 MAPK signalling. We used a TLR repor ted cell line (HEK -Blue -hTLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) to study whether Pb and Cd could activate or inhibit TLRs and NF- kB signalling . We a lso used the MonoMac 6 cell line to study p38 MAPK activity, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokine production following exposure to Pb and Cd. 2. Materials and M ethods Experimental setup: The human monocytic leukemia reporter cell line (THP1- XBlue - MD2 -CD14) was used to evaluate whether Pb and Cd could activate or inhibit monocytes via TLRs; HEK- Blue reporter cells were used to identify which TLR signalling can be specifically activated or inhibited by Pb and Cd. After showing that Pb and Cd affected TLR activation, we next explored the effect of Pb and Cd on MonoMac 6 cells, a monocytic cell line, by studying the effects of Pb and Cd on cell apoptosis and cell activation as measured by ICAM- 1 expression and TNF- and IL -10 production. Finally, we studied the effects of Pb and Cd on p38 MAPK activation in MonoMac 6 cells. 2.1. Lead and Cadmium Lead chloride (PbCl 2) and cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich, the Nether lands, then diluted in sterile water (Fresenius Kabi, F rance) and filtered by 0.22 M 120Toll-like receptor, NF -B an d p38 sterile syringe filters (Sigma -Al drich, The Netherlands) prior to cell stimulation. Endotoxin measurements for PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 stock solutions were carried out by pierce LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and no endotoxin contamination was found. Cells including THP1 and HEK-Blue reporter cells, MonoMac 6 were treated with PbCl 2 at the final concentration of 0.18 (equal to 50 g/L) , 1.8, 18 and 100 M, or with CdCl 2 at the concentration of 0.027 (equal to 5 g/L), 0.27, 2.7 and 10 M. 2.2. Reporter cell stimulation and Quanti- Blue assay The human monocytic -XBlue -CD14) (InvivoGen, Toulouse, Franc e) and seven human embryonic kidney (HEK) reporter cell lines (HEK- Blue - hTLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) were applied to explore the effects of Pb and Cd on TLR signalling in this study. As previously described [25, 26], THP1 -XBlue- MD2 -CD 14 can produce endogenously and carry an insert for MD2 and CD14 that boosts TLRs/NF- B signalling . THP1- XBlue -MD2 -CD14 but also Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase NF- B/AP-1 promotor and is capable of expressing SEAP once TLR signalling and NF- B are activated. The released SEAP in the supernatant can be measured supplemented calf (FCS, Sigma The Netherlands), 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate B.V. Meppel, The Netherlands), 100 (Invivogen, Toulouse, France), 2 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 U/mL Penicillin, 50 g/mL Streptomycin, all purchased from Sigma Aldrich according to the recommendations of the supplier. To measure the TLR activation in THP1, cells were kept at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL as presented in Table 1 and cultured in 200 L per well with different dosages of PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 in a flat -bottom 96-well plate (Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The negative and positive control was treated with medium and 100 ng/mL LPS (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France), respectively. After 24 -hour incubation, the supernatant was taken out to a new 96- well plate and mixed with Quanti-Blue reagent in a ratio of 1:10 and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C incubator. The measurement of absorbance at 650 nm was performed on a Bio- Rad Benchmark Plus 6 121Chapter 6 microplate reader and data acquisition was obtained by Microplate Manager version 5.2.1 (Bio- Rad La boratories, USA). The color change for ea ch well was shown as the fold -change of NF - B activation normalized to the negative control. HEK-B lue cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's mM L-glutamine, glucose, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin, all ordered from Sigma Aldrich and 100 mg/mL Normocin (Invivogen, Toulouse, France) according to the recommendations of the supplier . To maintain stable expression of TLR genes, the selection antibiotics in Table 1 were added in the medium of reporter cell lines. When cells reached approximately 80% confluence , to assess the activation and inhibition of individual TLR signalling , they were diluted at their respective density and seeded in a total of 200 L per well in the 96- well flat bottom plate according to manufacturer's instructions ( Table 1). The negative and positive control was treated with medium and or the corresponding TLR agonis ts, respectively (all from InvivoGen, see Table 1). For activation assays, the procedure was similar to that in THP1 cells, as described above. For inhibition assays, cells were seeded at a relevant density and incubated with different concentrations of PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 for 1 h prior to adding individual TLR agonists. For both the activation and inhibition assay, after 24 h of incubation, the supernatant was diluted 1:10 with Quanti- Blue reagent and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C incubator. The absorbance at 650 nm was measured as mentioned before. Data for each well was presented as the fold- change of NF- B activation compared to the positive control (inhibition assay) or the negative control (activation assay). Per experiment, each condition has three replicat ions and each experiment was repeated 6 times. 122Toll-like receptor, NF -B and p 38 MAPK in MonoMac 6 Table 1.

MonoMac 6 ce ll culture To explore the effects of Pb and Cd on monocyte activation and apoptosis, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, MonoMac 6, was used. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% heat- inactivated (Sigma- Aldrich, The Netherlands), 2 mM glutamine (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 50 M mercapto -ethanol (Merck, Germany), g/mL gentamycin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), and 2.2 g/mL amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2. Cells were diluted with the culture medium at 1:5 ratios in a new flask twice a week. 2.4. Cell viability assay by WST-1 WST- 1 assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, MonoMac 6 cells were harvested and were seeded in the 96- well flat- bottom plate (Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at the cell density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells/mL. After treatment with various doses of PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 in the presence or ab sence of 100 ng/mL LPS for 24 h, 10 L cell proliferation reagent WST -1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was added to each well and kept in the plate 6 123Chapter 6 at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. The absorbance of each well was read at 440 nm, meanwhile, 620 nm was set as the referen ce wavelength. The relative cell viability of each group was presented as the percentage calculated by comparison to that of the control group treated with the medium. This experiment was performed in triplicates for each condition and repeated three times. 2.5. FACS analysis of cell apoptosis MonoMac 6 cells ( 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells/mL) were seeded in a 12 -well plate (Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and incubated with different concentrations of PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL LPS for 24 h. Cells treated with the medium were considered as the negativ e control, and 100 ng/mL LPS were served as the positive control. Fluorescein USA) staining were performed for apoptotic test. In brief, cells were harvested in Falcon round -bottom polypropylene tubes (Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and washed twice with 1 ml cold PBS. After spinning at 4 , 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min, cell pellets in each tube were resuspended in 100 L binding buffer (0.01M HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2, PH7.4) 5 \u00b5L Annexin V and 1 \u00b5L PI staining solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Afterward 1 mL PBS was added to each tube. After Spinning at 4 , 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min, cell pel let was resuspended with 400 L PBS containing 2% heat- inactivated FCS. Annexin V and PI staining by using a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). Data analysis for the percentage of live, early apoptotic and late apoptotic (or necrotic) cells in each condition were obtained by Kaluza 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, USA). 2.6. ICAM -1 expression To assess the ICAM-1 expression on MonoMac 6, cells were treated in the same way as stated above for the apoptotic test. After washing twice with cold PBS, cells in each FACS tube were stained with 5 \u00b5L FITC or 5 control antibody (all 1 \u00d7 PBS containing 2% heat- inactivated FCS at a final volume of 50 \u00b5L and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The mixture was washed twice with 2 ml of cold PBS by centrifugation at 4 , 300 x g for 5 min, then cell pellet was suspended in 300 \u00b5L 1 \u00d7 PBS containing 2% heat -inactivated FCS. Finally, flow cytometric data acquisition was collected immediately by a BD FACSVerse instrument and data analysis was performed by Kaluza 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, USA). 124Toll-like receptor, NF -B and p 38 MAPK in MonoMac 6 2.7. Quantification of TNF- and IL -10 by E LISA To measure cytokine TNF- and IL -10 production by MonoMac 6 cells following exposure to PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL LPS for 12 h; thereafter, the supernatants were collected. The 12 hr activation period was chosen, since a pilot experiment showed that this incubation with PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 and LPS showed maximal cytokine production (results not shown). The commercially available ELISA kits from R&D systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for human TNF -alpha (Catalog number: DY210) and used to detect cytokine concentration via sandwich assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNF - and IL -10 concentrations were calculated based on standard curves and expressed as pg/mL. The values below the limits of the assay's detectability were depicted as 0. 2.8. Western blot analysis for p38 MAPK signalling pathway MonoMac 6 Cells were challenged with the various dosages of PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 as described above with or without 100 ng/mL LPS and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 for 0.5 h. A pilot experiment revealed optimal results after stimulation with PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 and LPS for 0.5 h (results not shown). Cells from each set of experiments at 0.5-hour time points were solubilized in ice-cold 1 \u00d7 RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo USA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, The Netherlands). After sonication, the lysates were separated by 10 -min 14000 \u00d7 g centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C. Proteins in the supernatant were colle cted and protein concentrations were measured by using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of 15 g heat-denatured total protein was loaded into each well of 15- well so dium dodecyl Millipore, USA) membranes. The membranes buffer), then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C primary antibody for phospho-p38 (pp38 Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and -actin (mouse- anti-human, 1:2500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The following day, the membranes were washed with 1 \u00d7 TBST buffer three times and incubated with the corresponding peroxidase -conjugated 6 125Chapter 6 secondary anti-mouse, 1:5000; all from Dako, Agilent, Denmark) for 1 h. After adding Supersignal west pico plus chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA ), protein band intensity was quantified by ChemiDoc Imaging and ChemiD oc MP Imaging System (Bio -Rad Laboratories, USA). The data were processed and analyzed by Image J software (bundled with 64-bit Java 1.8.0_112 for windows system, from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The target protein expression was normalized to the band intensity of p38 or -actin on the same membrane. Each experiment was repeated 6 times. 2.9. Statistical analysis All results were analyzed using Graphpad prism software version 8.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). Normality of data distribution was confirmed using the Kolmogorov- Smirnov test. Normally distributed data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) and non- normally distributed data were presented as median with interquartile range. The groups treated with LPS, PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 only were compared with the negative control, while the comparison between groups incubated PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 with LPS and the positive control was performed. Parametrically distributed data were assessed using the one- way repeated measures analysis of varia nce (rmANOVA) followed by Dunnet's post- test. Nonparametric data were log - transformed and further analyzed using the rmANOVA with Dunnet's post- test. Significant difference level was defined as P < 0.05. A P < 0.1 was considered to be a statistical trend. 3. Results 3.1. Exposure to PbCl 2 may have an inhibitory effect on TLR8 activation To explore whether PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 are able to activate or inhibit TLRs/NF -kB signalling, TLR reporter cell lines were used. We first made sure that no endotoxin components existed in the solutions with PbCl 2 or CdCl 2. We found that that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 stock solutions were endotoxin-free (data not shown). To investigate the possible activation and inhibitory actions of metals on TLRs/NF- B signalling, THP1 -MD2 -CD14 and HEK-Blue reporter cell lines expressing TLRs (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) were exposed to PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 without ( Figure 1) or with (Fig ure 2) corresponding agonists. As presented in Figure 1 , PbCl 2 did not activate TLR s in cel M APK in MonoMac any of the TLR-expressing H EK reporter cells. CdCl 2 at the concentration of 10 M was found to inhibit TLR8 activation (0.69 -fold change, P < 0.01, Figure 1G ). Figure 1. Activation of THP1 and HEK reporter cells carrying individual TLRs. Cells cultured with medium served as the negative control, cells treated with their corresponding TLR agonist served as the positive control. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n=6). The negative control was set to 1 and all other data were presented relative to t his negative control. Significant difference compared to the negative control were determined by rmANOVA followed by altered response to PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with agonists Next, we evaluated whether PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 affected the responses of TLRs to their agonists (Figure 2 ). In contrast to the previous results that showed no activation of TLRs by PbCl 2 or CdCl 2, they both affected the response of TLRs to their agonists. Although PbCl 2 did not affect the response of TLR2 or TLR7 towards their respective ligands, it did significantly increase the LPS- induced TLR4 activation at the concentrations of 0.18 M (1.35-fold change, P < 0.05) and 1.8 M (1.38- fold change, P < 0.05). TLR5 signalling was increased by PbCl 2 (1.18- fold change, P < 0.05) at the dosages of 0.18, 1.8 and 18 M (1.18, 1.13 and 1.14- fold change, respectively, all P < 0.05) when agonist FLA -ST existed. PbCl 2 at the concentration of 10 M had a tendency to increase the FLA -ST-induced TLR5 activation ( P < 0.1). TLR8 activation by its agonist ssRNA40 was enhanced in the presence of 0.18 M PbCl 2 (1.82- fold change, P < 0.001). However, TLR3 and TLR9 activation by their agonists were suppressed due to the existence of 100 M PbCl 2 (0.88 and 0.79-fold change, respectively, both P < 0.05). CdCl 2 decreased TLR2/1 activation by its agonist Pam3CSK4 at the concentration of 2.7 M and 10 M (0.70 and 0.51- fold change, respectively; both P < 0.001). TLR3 activation by its 6 127Chapter 6 agonist Poly (I:C) LMW was elevated in the presence of 2.7 M CdCl 2 (1.42-fold change, P < 0.001). LP S-induced TLR4 activation was enhanced by CdCl 2 at 0.27 M (1.25- fold change, P < 0.05), but was inhibited at 2.7 and 10 M (0.46 and 0.31-fold change, respectively, both P < 0.001). Intriguingly, TLR5 activation by its agonist FLA- ST was increased by CdCl 2 at 0.027 and 2.7 M (1.16 and 1.18- fold change, respectively; both P < 0.05), while TLR5 activation was decreased with a higher CdCl 2 dosage (10 M, 0.64- fold change, P < 0.001). TLR7 activation by its agonist CL264 was suppressed in the presence of 10 M CdCl 2 (0.58-fold change, P < 0.05). TLR8 activation by its agonist ssRNA40 was increased by 0.027 and 0.27 M of CdCl 2 (1.48 and 1.56-fold change, respectively, both P < 0.05) but was suppressed by 10 M of CdCl 2 (0.51- fold change, P < 0.05). CdCl 2 did not affect the response of TLR9 to its ligand. Figure 2. Effects of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on HEK reporter cells carrying individual TLRs activated by their respective ligands.

PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 exposure caused apoptosis in MonoMac 6 cells As mentioned above, TLR signalling by agonists can be affected in the presence of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2. We next used MonoMac 6 cells to further investigate the effects of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on monocytes. We focused on TLR4 since this TLR was one of the TLRs mostly affected by the presence of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2. Therefore, we used LPS to stimulate MonoMac 6 cells via TLR4. 128Toll-like receptor, NF -B We studied toxicity, apoptosis, activation, cytokine production and activation of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway. The WST- 1 cell p roliferation assay was performed to study the viability of MonoMac 6 cells challenged with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2. Tabl e 2 shows that viabili ty decreased little as a result of treatment with either PbCl 2 or CdCl 2. T able 2. MonoMac 6 Cell viability following treatment with PbCl2 and CdCl2 with or without LPS.

After 24 -hour treatment (Figure 3 ), all 4 dosages of PbCl 2 slightly, but significantly decreased the percentage of living cells (0.18 M: compared with the negative control (86.7%) (all P < 0.01). This was associated with higher percentages of both early and late apoptosis in MonoMac 6 cells, especially at the Furthermore, all 4 dosages of PbCl 2 aggravated both the early and late apoptosis of MonoMac cells in the presence of LPS (all P < 0.001, Figure 3D and 3F ). Likewise, CdCl 2 treatment affected ce ll survival of MonoMac 6. Due to the presence of 2.7 and 10 M of CdCl 2, the percentage of living cells (84.7% and 77.6%, respectively, versus the negative control: 86.7%) was but significantly decreased (both P < 0.001, Fi gure 3C ). All 4 dosages of CdCl 2 helped decrease l iving cell percentage induced by LPS (all P < 0.001). The early apoptot ic percentage was found increased in MonoMac 6 treated with 0.027 and 10 M of CdCl 2 (25.6% and 11.9% , respectively, versus the negative control: 9.6%) (both P < 0.001) . Similar findings were determined that CdCl 2 at 0.027, 2.7 and 10 M (9.82%, 4.24% 6.36% , respectively, versus the negative control: 3.34% ) induced an elevation in late apoptosis (all P < 0.01, Figure 3G ). Moreover, all 4 dos ages of CdCl 2 were observed to promote the pro -apoptotic effects (both early and late a poptotic) of LPS on MonoMac 6 (all P < 0.001) . Figure 3.

(B) Results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM from 6 independent experiments and analyzed by using One-Way Repeated M e asures ANOVA followed by Dunnet's Versus control without LPS: ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, * P ###P 2 and CdCl 2 increased LP S-induced cytokine production in MonoMac 6 cells We further evaluate whether PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 incuba tion resulted in the activation of MonoMac 6 cells, as measured by the expression of ICAM- 1 (an activat ion marker of monocytes), and production of TNF- and IL -10. ICAM -1, also known as CD54, is an adhesion molecule in immune- mediated an d inflammato ry processes and functions as a co -stimulatory s ignal that is functionally implicated in trans - endothelial trafficking of leukocytes and T cells upon activation with PbCl 2 at 0.18 and 18 M (4.81% and 4.58%, respectively, versus the negative control 3.25%, both P < 0.05, Figure 4B). Besides, PbCl 2 at 18 and 100 M had a tendency to reduce ICAM -1 expression i nduced by LPS (both P < 0.1). The effect of CdCl 2 on ICAM -1 express ion was not found. Nevertheless, LPS induced ICAM- 1 expression (57.7%) was inhibited by CdCl 2 at the c oncentration of 2.7 and 10 M (52.6% and 50.6%, respectively, both P < 0.01) ( P < 0.01, Figur e 4C). Figure 4.

Although PbCl 2 itself did not alte r the production of the pro -inflammatory cytokine TNF it increased LPS -stimulated TNF ( P < 0.05, Figure 5 ). CdCl 2 did also not affect TNF - production nor did it affect the LPS -induced TNF- pr oduction. The anti -inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 was not affect ed by either PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 alone. However, the LPS-induced IL- 10 production was significantly down-regulated by both PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 (both P < 0.001). Figure 5. TNF- and IL -10 production by MonoMac 6 cells. MonoMac 6 cells were treated with 100 M PbCl 2 and 10 M CdCl 2 alone or combined with 100 ng/mL LPS (the positive control) for 12 h. Untreated MonoMac 6 cells were served as the negative control. The values below the limits of the assay's detectability were concerned as 0 . Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 6).

Versus control without LPS: control LPS: ###P ##P < 0.01. 3.5. 2 activated LPS -i nduced p38 MAPK signalling pathway We showed that the heavy metals PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 alter T LR4 activation in the presence of LPS. We next studied whether this was associated with activation of p38 MAPK. As shown i n Figure 6 , the expression of p38 (p38/ -actin ) was not alte red after treatment with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in the presence or absence of LPS. The production of phospho-p38 (pp38/p38), which indicates the activation of the p38 MAPK, was not affected by PbCl 2 alone. However, a n elevation in phospho- p38 expression by MonoM ac 6 cells was found due to the existence of 10 uM CdCl 2 (1.79- fold change, P < 0.05, F igure 6E ). Moreover, both PbCl 2 (except for 0.18 uM) and CdCl 2 (all concentrations) increased LPS -induced pho-p38 MA in MonoMac 6 with incubation with LPS alone (1.91-fold change show n in Figure 6D and 1.63-fold change shown in Figure 6E , P < 0.05).

Discussion In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of Pb and Cd on monocyte TLR activation an d downstream NF- B and p38 MA PK signalling pathways. By using THP-1, HEK TLR reporter cells and MonoMac cells, our observations showed that Pb and Cd could signif icantly enhance or reduce agonist- mediated p38 MAPK actions. Our f urther findings indicate that Pb and Cd treatment affected MonoMac 6 cells in their cell viability, apoptosis, and expression of ICAM -1, production of TNF - and IL -10 in the presence of the TLR4 agonist LPS. Our results thus demonstrated that Pb and Cd may affect immune cells via TLRs. By using THP1- MD2 -CD14 and the st able HEK reporter cell lines expressing TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, we showed an effect of Pb and Cd on immune cells via TLRs. TLR s are expressed b y all innate immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, ma st cells, NK cells, epithelial and endothelial cells [28-32], and are responsible for cellular recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs [33]. Upon TLRs ' activation, an immune response is induced to clear the pathogens [34, 35]. According to our observations, Pb and Cd alone did 6 133Chapter 6 not activate TLRs/NF -B signalling , h owever, they affect the response to the respective ligand. Our findings revealed that Pb could increase the agonist-induced acti vation of TLR4, 5 and 8; however, Pb was found to attenuate TLR3 and TLR9 activation by their agonist. High exposure to Cd negatively affected TLR2, 4, 5 and 7 activation induced by their agonists, while this may increase TLR3 activation. On the other hand, the lower dose of CdCl 2 increased T LR4, 5 and 8 activations. Not many studies have been performed on the effect of either Pb or Cd on TLR signalling activation. Our data for TLR4 activation by Pb may not be in line with previous research reporting the immunom odulatory eff ect of Pb on macrophages and showing that Pb at environmentally relevant levels (lower or equal to 5 g/dL) interferes with the binding of LPS to TLR4, suggesting Pb can disrupt LPS-induced TLR4 s ignalling [18] . The difference between our study and the study of Luna et al. may be the difference in Pb concentrations. Also, the study of Elshaer et al. appeared not to be in line with our study since they showed in an in vivo study in rats that renal TLR4/NF- B was activa ted by Cd supplementation to mediate deleterious effects in renal injury [20]. Our study, how ever, was an in vitro study with TLR reporter cell lines. One study showed that Cd may affect TLR expression: in spite of differential concentration and cell line, a study by C apellini et al. demonstrated that Cd exposure lowers TLR3 and 5 gene expression in Madin-Darby canine ki dney cells [19] ; Hence, alteration of TLRs mRNA expression by Pb and Cd might be an explanation for their effects on TLR. Further studies are needed to substantiate this hypothesis. Although few papers report on the effects of Pb or Cd on TLR signalling, var ious papers report on the effect of other metals on TLR signalling. Rachmawati et al. demonstrated that ionized gold can mimic viral dsRNA in triggering TLR3 in keratinocytes; other investigations verified that cobalt, nickel and zinc ions are involved in TLR4 signalling, cont ributing to the release of the pro- inflammatory mediators NO, IL -6 and IL -8 [ 35-39] . Additionally, the binding of nickel ion was reported to ligate with two histidine residues of the TLR4 molecule [22, 35] . Thus, because of the similar physical properties of metal divalent cations, we suggest tha t Pb and Cd ions also bind to two histidine residues of TLRs in order to affect TLR function. Since we observed that Pb and Cd were able to affect TLRs/NF -B signalling , w e next want ed to verify whether incubation of monocytes (using the M onoMac 6 c ell line) results in activation 134Toll-like receptor, NF -B and p38 MAPK in MonoMac 6 of monocytes, as measured by effects of Pb and Cd on MonoMac 6 apoptosis, ICAM -1 expression, production of cytokines and p38/pp38 MAPK expression. MonoMac 6 possesses the characteristic of human mature blood monocytes, including expression of CD14, TLRs and cytokines, and phagocytotic ability, therefore, this cell line has been applied for demonstrating the actions of monocytes in vitro studies [40] . Si nce the prominent effects of Pb and Cd were observed on TLR4, we choose to further study the effects of Pb and Cd on thi s TLR on MonoMac 6 cells. Both Pb and Cd have been known as poisonous metals with cytopathological toxicity, for example, promoting ROS generation, apoptosis, and DNA damage [41, 42] . In accor dance with this knowledge, our results showed that Pb and Cd incubation of MonoMac cells inhibited cell viability, and increased both early and late apoptosis. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that exposure to Pb and Cd affected cell sur vival [42-4 5]. LPS, also known as endotoxin, is a component of Gram- negativ e bacterial cell wall and recognized by the TLR 4 in association with MD-2 and CD14 [46, 47] . It has been shown to activate monocytes to elicit a series of responses, including phosphorylation of p38, and secretion of TNF - and IL -10 [48, 49] . In the present study, our findings suggest that exposure to either Pb or Cd causes an increase in pp38 phosphorylation and TNF- expressi on but a decrease in IL - 10 production in the presence of LPS. Although different cells and LPS dosage were used, a former study [50] repor ted that Pb increased TNF - expre ssion of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with 1 ng/mL of LPS, w hich is partially in line with our results. Nevertheless, LPS -induced I CAM- 1 expression was significantly decreased when MonoMac 6 cells were treated with Cd at 10 M, which may be attr ibuted to cell death by the collaborative pro-apoptotic effect o f Cd and L PS. It is known that TLR induced not only a subsequent response of NF- B but also p38 MAPK activation [34, 51] . The p38 MAPK is responsive to a variety of cellular stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines and LPS, and is important for the regulation of immune responses, including cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis inflammatory cytokines production [51, 52]. Although the results of the activation of p38 MAPK in Figure 6 show Pb and Cd alone do not evoke a significant increase in the activation of p38 MAPK, they both increase the phosphorylation of LPS-induced p38 M APK. Based on this finding, the MonoMac 6 ce ll survival, apoptosis, and activation affected by Pb and Cd can be associated with not only TLRs induced NF-kB activation, but also with p38 MAPK activation. 6 135Chapter 6 Previous studies in other cell lines supported that Pb and Cd can induce p38 MAPK activation. For instance, Cd- induced tox icity promotes cell death of adult subventricular neural stem cells and cerebral cortical astrocytes via MAPK pathway [53, 54] ; Pb was repor ted to induce significant activation of p38 MAPK, which eventually inhibits the proliferation and viability of rat C6 glioma cells [55] . An earlie r study carried out in human monocytic THP-1 cells observe d that Pb exposure can upregulate TNF- mRNA express ion and protein secretion via the activation of MAPKs [56] . However, our st udy showed TNF- production might not be affected by Pb stimulation in the absence of LPS. It's also known that Cd stimulation could increase ICAM -1 expression mediated by NF- B activat ion in mouse brain microvessel endothelial cells [57]; nevertheless, the same cell line applied in another study demonstrated that the elevation of ICAM -1 production is associated with Cd-induced p38 MAPK activation [58] . Although its role in MonoMac 6 cells challenged with metals remains unclear, according to our data, it is evident that p38 MAPK is affected by Pb and Cd and is probably involve d in the activation process of MonoMac 6. 5. Conclusions This study provides evidence of the effect of the heavy metals Pb and Cd on TLRs, NF- B, and p38 MAPK signalling. Our f indings suggest that Pb and Cd alone only slightly induce monocyte activation. However, they do interfere with TLR signalling wit h their ligands. Both Pb and Cd seem to affect monocytes TLR activation by their ligand and affect NF -kB p38 MAPK activation affecting apoptosis, cell activation and cytokine production. Therefore, the involvement of TLR and the downstream NF- B an d p38 MAPK in me tal-induced immunoregulatory actions of MonoMac 6 is one possible mechanism by which Pb and Cd exposure affect immune responses and thus host defense to pathogens.

Faas Chapter 7 ABSTRACT Heavy meta ls lead and cadmium are widespread environmental contaminants capable of impeding immune function. Nuclear factor- kappa B (NF- B) transcription factors and mitochondria are known as key targets for various stimuli, but their roles in mediating the survival, proliferation, and activation in T cells in response to heavy metals ha ve been incompletely demonstrated. Here, Jurkat, an immortalized human T cell line, w as treated with series of dosages of lead chloride (PbCl 2) and cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) in the presence or absence 13 -acetate/calcium ionophore (PMA/Ca2+ ionophore). PbCl CdCl viability of Jurkat cells without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore activation. PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 were also found to increase cell apoptosis and reduce IL -2 production in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- stimulated Jurkat cells. PbCl 2 induced an elevation p65 and IB in non-activated Jurkat cells, in non- activated Jurkat cells. 2 CdCl 2 enhanced DNA number Jurkat cells. Suppressed transcription levels genes: mtND2 , regulator TFAM and NRF1 , were associated with either PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 treatment. Our findings indicate that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 tend to pose an adverse impact on the survival, prolifer ation and activation of T cells in vitro. We proposed a potential mechanism whereby PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 affected T cells by disrupting NF -B activity and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, the toxic effect s of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 may be associated with the act ivation state of T cells. 140Effects of lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics 1. Introdu ction The heavy metals lead and cadmium are widespread immunotoxic contaminants. Exposure to lead and cadmium has been linked with an impaired immune system of individuals due to their potential to suppress or stimulate the immune system [1, 2]. As an essential c omponent of the adaptive immune system, T lymphocytes (or T cells) help defend the body against pathogens, allergens, and tumours [3]. Much of the existing evidence demonstrates that lead and cadmium are capa ble of modulating T lymphocyte functions, such as cell death, proliferation, and cytokine production [2, 4] . A population study showed that the T helper (Th) lymphocyte count in peripheral blood of lead-exposed workers was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls, suggesting that lead may det rimentally affect T cell survival [5]. Another study carried out in pres chool children from an e-waste recycling area demonstrated that blood lead levels showed a positive correlation with the CD4+ central memory T cell percentage [6]. Lead has also been sh own to disrupt the balance between Th1 and Th2 by reducing Th1 and enhancing Th2 cell proliferation [7]. Similarly, a significantly greater cad mium -induced reduction in Th1- derived cytokines (IL -2 IFN- ) was observed as compared with Th2-derived cytokine (IL - 4) in BALB/c mice. Cadmium has been shown to induce apoptosis in T cells [8, 9], both in the CD4+ and CD8+ T sub sets [4]. This may be due to the effec ts of cadmium on interleukin (IL) - 2 production. IL- 2 is the major growth factor essential for T cell proliferation and survival. Il - 2 production could be inhibited by lead treatment; however, in activated T cells, IL- 2 release was promoted as a result of exposure to cadmium [2]. Nuclear factor -kappa B (N F-B) is well documented to be a crucial player to allow cells to adapt and respond to environmental stress [10, 11]. The mammalian NF -B trans cription that associate with each other to form distinct transcriptionally complexes [12]. Among them, p65 is the best- studied fa mily member that, together with p50, forms the most common heterodimer in the NF -B signalling pathway in most cell types [13] . IB is the primary inhibitory IB proteins which bound to nearly all of the NF -B family of transcription factors leading to the inhibition of nuclear localization and transcriptional activation [14] . Studies supp ort the notion that NF -B activation is responsible for the transcription of specific sets of target genes associated with inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, apoptotic or anti- apoptotic regulators, NF-B 15, membrane- bound organelles in the eukaryotic cytoplasm that served as the powerhouse of the cell because they generate large quantities of cellular energy in the f orm of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation [17]. Besides, mitochondria are known to be essent ial for cellular function, including ROS production and consumption, cellular metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic regulation [18]. Mitochondrial function depends on the amount and quality of mitochondria, which are largely controlled by a balance between fission and fusion processes as well as nuclear signall ing-mediated nuclear and mitochondrial transcription [17- 20]. So far only a few studies have addressed the effects of lead and cadmium on T cell survival apoptosis in vitro, while no in vitro studies have addressed the impact of lead and cadmium on NF-B and mitochondrial function. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of lead and cadmium on T cell survival and function, as well as NF -B activity and mitochondrial biogenesis in T cells in vitro. For this, Jurkat cells, an immortalized T cell line, were cultured with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in the absence or presence of the non-specific T cell activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13 -acetate IL- 2 production, NF-B activity and mitochondrial function wer e evaluated. 2. Materials and Methods Experimental design In this study, we studied the effect s of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 treatment on resting and activated T cells. Therefore, Jurkat cells were incubated with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in the presence or absence of phorbol 12- myristate 13 -acetate and calcium ionophore A23187. We used the WST -1 assay to evaluate the viability and proliferation of Jurkat cells; flow cytometric analysis was carried out to check cell survival, apoptosis and IL -2 production of Jurkat following PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 treatment in activated and resting cells . We also evaluated the activation status of NF -B and mitochondrial dynamics in these Jurkat cells following treatment with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 by western blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT -PCR), respectively. 142Effects o f lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics 2.1. Cell C ulture and Treatment Jurkat cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (clone E6 -1, ATCC TIB- 152, France) The mM glutamine (Lonza, Switzerland), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Lonza, Switzerland), 50 M mercapto- ethanol (Merck, Germany), gentamycin (Lonza, Switzerland), a nd 2.2 g/mL amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. The culture was diluted at the split ratio of 1:15 and passaged twice a week. Cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) were exposed to lead chloride (PbCl 2) (Sigma -Aldrich, The Netherlands) at the final concentration of 0.18 (equal to 50 g/L), 1.8, 18 and 100 M, or with cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) (Sigma -Aldrich, The Netherlands) at the concentration of 0.027 (equal to 5 g/L), 0.27, 2.7 and 10 M in the pres ence or absence of -Aldrich, The Netherlands). The lowest concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 were chosen as concentrations similar to the safety limit of lead and calcium in blood issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As a negative control, cells were treated with medium only. Cells incubated with PMA (10 nM)/Ca2+ ionophore (500 nM) only were used as the positive control. Pilot experiments were performed to verify the appropriate exposure time of Jurkat cells to stimulus depending on different parameters tested in this study (data not shown). All experiments in the present study were performed 6 times separately. 2.2. Cell viability assay Jurkat cell viability was measured by water -soluble -1 (WST -1) assay according (Roche, Switzerland). Jurkat cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/100 l) were seeded in 96- well plates (Corning, the Neth erlands) and treated with the various concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. After incubation for 24 hours, 10 l WST-1 reagent solution was added to each well and plates were incubated for an extra 4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. The absorbance at 440 nm and 620 nm (the reference wavelength) was analyzed by using a Bio- Rad Benchmark Plus microplate reader (Bio -Rad Laboratories, USA). The relative value of viable cells was expressed as a percentage of the controls, i.e. cells only incubated with the medium. 7 143Chapter 7 2.3. Cell death an alysis The Annexin V and PI staining was carried out to monitor apoptosis. Jurkat cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) were cultured with the various concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore in 12 -well plates (Corning, the Netherlands). After 24 -hour incubation, cells were collected in Falcon round -bottom polypropylene tubes (Corning, the Netherlands) and washed twice with 1 ml of 1 \u00d7 cold phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) (Lonza, Switzerland). Cell pellets were suspended in 100 l Annexin V binding buffer (0.01M HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 (PI) (Invitrogen, USA) staining solution for 15 minutes at room temperature. Afterward, cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS unti l flow cytometric analysis immediately. Flow cytometry data collected from 10,000 cells were obtained on a FacsVerse cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed in a dot -plot manner on logical/biexponential scales by Kaluza 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, USA). The gati ng strategy for selecting cells, i.e. living, early, and late apoptotic, is presented in Figure 2 . 2.4. IL- 2 expression Intracellular IL -2 was detected by flow cytometry. Jurkat cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) were exposed to the various concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA (10 nM)/Ca2+ ionophore (500 nM) in 24- well plates (Corning, the Netherlands). After 19 hour -incubation, 10 ug/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma -Aldrich, The Netherlands) was a dded to each well and incubated with cells at 37 for another 5 hours. Treated cells were washed once with ice- cold PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS and then incubated with fluorescence- activated cell (FACS) lysing buffer according to the manufacture's protocol (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After centrifugation at 4 , 300 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes, cell pellets were incubated with permeabilization buffer (Invitrogen, USA) for 10 minutes on ice. The permeabilized cells were washed once and incubated in 50 l permeabilization buffer containing 5 l FITC - conjugated anti-human IL- 2 antibody (BioLegend, The Netherlands) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were washed once with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in 1 \u00d7 PBS containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde prior to acquisition on the BD FACSVerse instrument. 144Effect s of lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics Ten thous and events were ac quired for each sample and data analysis was performed by Kaluza 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, USA). 2.5. Evaluation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF- B) activation The expression of NF- B proteins, including phosphorylated-p65, p65 and NF- B inhibitor alpha (IB) in Jurkat cells were measured by western blot. Jurkat cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) treated with the various concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in the absence or presence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore were cultured at 37\u00b0C. Pilot experiments were performed to test the incubation time and 2 hours was shown to be optimal (data not shown). After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice- cold PBS. Cells were collected in 100 \u00b5L radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) (Thermo Fisher protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, The Netherl ands) and lysed by sonication. The total protein concentration of each sample was determined by using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Equal amounts of protein (10 \u00b5g) were separated in 10% polyacrylamide mouse anti -human internal control -actin (1:3000) (all from Cell Signalling Technology, USA). Immunoreactive proteins with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-mouse (both from Dako, Agilent, Denmark) and analyzed by ChemiDoc Imaging and ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio -Rad Laboratories, USA). Quantitation of bands was conducted by Image J software (bundled with 64- bit Java 1.8.0_112 for windows system). The target protein expression was normalized to the band intensity of p65 or actin on the same membrane. 2.6. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression Cells at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml were seeded into 12 -well plates (Corning, the Netherlands) and treated with the various concentrations of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in the absence or presence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. Pilot experiments were performed to test the incubation time and 6 hours was shown to be optimal incubation time (data not shown). Total RNA and DNA (for mitochondrial DNA copy number analysis) were isola ted from cells using the Trizol reagent7 145Chapter 7 (Thermo Fish er Scientific, USA) following the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, cells were collected in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube after twice washing with 1 \u00d7 PBS, then incubated with a 500L of TRIzol\u00ae reagent at room temperature for 5 minutes. Next, 0.1 ml chloroform (Sigma- Aldrich, The Netherlands) was added, and the sample was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. This was followed by 15-minute centrifugation at 12,000 x g at 4\u00b0C. Once the three phases were separated, the aqueous phase and the interphase w ere used for subsequent RNA and DNA isolation, respectively. For RNA, the separated aqueous phase was incubated with isopropanol (Sigma -Aldrich) at room temperature for 5 minutes. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol (Sigma- Aldrich ). Followed by centrifuging, the RNA pellet was dried in a dry bath and then resuspended in Nuclease- Free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The concentration and purity of total RNA extraction w ere measured by a NanoDrop 1000 UV- vis spectrophotometer (Ther mo Fisher Scientific). RNA samples with 260/280 and 260/230 ratios of 1.90 were used for further analysis. A total of 500 ng of RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcriptase cDNA synthesis. Briefly, RNA was mixed with 300 ng of random hexamer primers and 10 mM dNTP and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Afterward, a mixture containing 4 l 5 \u00d7 First -strand buffer, 2 l 0.1 mM DTT, 1 l RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor and 1 l superscript II (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific) was adde d to have a final volume of 20 l for each sample. Reactions were carried out at 25\u00b0C for 10 minutes, 42\u00b0C for 50 minutes and 70\u00b0C for 15 minutes on a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio- Rad Laboratories, USA). The mRNA expression levels of genes associated with mit ochondrial fission and fusion process, mitochondrial function regulators and genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome ( Table 1 ) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT -PCR) method and performed in a Viia 7 -time PCR system (Applie d Biosystems, USA). The cDNA product was 25- time diluted with RNase- free water and then 5 l of each dilution was mixed with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche, Switzerland) and corresponding forward and reverse primers (Table 1) reaching a total volume of 10 l. Reaction conditions were set up as follows: denaturation step, 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes; amplification step, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds; and melting curve step, 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute, 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds. The annealing temperature and efficiency of primers were 146Effects of l ead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics verified using a 5-point standard curve obtained from a pool of total cDNA diluted 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 t imes. The acceptable efficiency of each primer is 90 -110%. The expr ession level of each gene was normalized to the housekeeping genes (HKG): -actin and Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and was calculated using the following method: 2(Ct gene of interest - Ct HKG). 2.7. copy number Mitochondrial DNA copy or mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratio was measured by qRT- PCR method performed as described above. Total DNA including mitochondrial and genomic were extracted from cells that were used for total RNA isolation. Followed by removing the upper aqueous phase, the interphase was separated and incubated with a back extraction buffer (4M Guani dine Thiocyanate, 50 mM Sodium Citrate, 1M Tris, all from Sigma -Aldrich) for 5 minutes at 55 \u00b0C. After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase w as separated and then mixed with acrylamide carrier and isopropanol (Sigma -Aldri ch) to precipitate the DNA. The DNA pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol and then was solubilized in 1x TE buffer (Sigma- Aldrich). DNA concentration and purity was measured by a NanoDrop 1000 UV -vis spec trophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 500 ng DNA was incubated with RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C prior to amplification. The amplification of D-loop, a chondria, and -2-microglobulin ( B2M ), a nuclear single- copy gene, were evaluated to quantify mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratio. Their primers' efficiency was measured by a 5- point standard curve from a pooled total DNA of measured sa mples. The results were calculated using the following method: 2(Ct B2M \u00d7 primer efficiency - Ct D -loop \u00d7 primer efficiency). 2.8. Statistical analysis Graphpad software was used to perform statistical analysis (version 8.0a, GraphPad InStat, USA). The nor ma lity of data distribu tion was confirmed using the Kolmogorov- Smirnov test. Data that are normally distributed are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, data not normally distributed are shown as median with interquartile range. Not normally distributed data were log -trans formed before data analysis. The groups treated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore , PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 only were compared with the negative control, while the comparison between groups incubated PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore and the positive control was performed. Statistical diff erence 7 147Chapter 7 was assessed using th e one- way repeated measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA) followed by Dunnet's post- test. Significant difference level was defined as P < 0.05. Table 1. Primer sequences for qRT -PCR. Gene Forward Sequence : optic atrophy-1; TFAM : mitoch ondrial transcription factor A. 3. Results 3.1. PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 challenge inhibited Jurkat cell viability Our results of the WST -1 assay showed that Jurkat cell viability was slightly, but significantly reduced by PbCl 2 exposure for 24 hours at the concentrations of 18 and 100 M (92.6% and 93.5%, respectively) when compared with non- treated control (100%) ( Figure 1 A, both P < 0.05). Cells treated with 10 M of CdCl 2 alone (93.3%) also had lower viability than the negative control (Figure 1 B, P < 0.05). 148Effects of lea d and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics Cells treated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore showed a decreased viability (62.9%) as compared with control cells (P < 0.001). PbCl 2 did not affect the effect of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore on Jurkat cell viability (Figure 1 A). CdCl 2 exposure (10 M) in the presence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore significantly decreased living cell percentage of Jurkat (52.9%) compared with cells treated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophor e alone (62.9%) ( Figure 1 B, P < 0.05). Figure 1. Assessment of Jurkat cell viability following treatment with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. Cells were incubated for 24 hours with different concentrations of metals alone or in combination with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (10 nM/500 nM). The percentage of cell viability in the negative control group treated with medium only was set to 100%. T he relative cell viability of each group was presented as a percentage and median with interquartile range that was calculated b y comparison to that of the negative control group from six independent experiments. After log-transformation, data analysis was determined by using rmANOVA followed by Dunnet's post-test. Versus the ***P ionophore: #P < 0.05. 3.2. PbCl increased PMA/Ca2+ ionophore -induced apoptosis As indicated above, Jurkat cell viability was affected by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. We next performed FACS analysis to evaluate whether PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, both PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 did not significantly alter living cell percentage, while PMA/Ca2+ ionophore was found to decrease the percentage of living cells (71.8%) as compared with non- treated Ju rkat cells (96.3%) (P < 0.001); moreover, both PbCl M: 67.8%, P < 0.05; 18 M: P < and CdCl M: P < 0.001; 10 M: 61.5%, P < 0.001) further decreased the percentage of living cells induced by PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. Neither PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 alone showed a significant influence on early and late apoptosis in Jurkat cell. However, PMA/Ca2+ ionophore treatment increased both early and late apoptosis (13.7% and 12.8%, respectively ) as 1.4%) 0.001). Early apoptosis induced by ionophore was increased by PbCl 2 (100 M; 16.1%, P < 0.01, Figure and CdCl (10 M; 16.3%, Figure 2E, P < 0.05). CdCl 2 at 2.7 and 10 M in the presence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (16.7% and 19.8%, respectively) also increased late compared with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore alone (Figure 2G , both P < 0.001). 150 Figure 2.

Effects of lea d and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics 3.3. CdCl 2 lowered i ntracellular IL -2 expression of Jurkat cells induced by PMA/Ca2+ ionophore treatment IL-2 is the major growth factor of activated T lymphocytes, which not only is responsible for T cell proliferation but also inhibits cell apoptosis in these cells [21] . Therefore, we measured intracellul ar IL -2 in Jurkat cells after incubation with PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. In the present study, neither PbCl 2 nor CdCl 2 alone significantly altered IL -2 production by Jurkat cells. Cells treated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (16.7%) increased IL -2 production compared with non- treated cells (3.0%) (Figure 3B or 3C, P < 0.001). PbCl 2 at 1.8 M (14.4%) inhibited IL -2 production in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore stimulated cells ( Figure 3B , P < 0.05). We also observed a significant reduction in IL -2 expression by Jurkat cells with stimulation of CdCl 2 (all four concentrations) plus PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (14.4%, 13.8%, and 11.0%, ionophore- treated cells ( Figure 3C , all P 0.01).

PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 di sturbed NF- B activation in Jurkat cells NF-B activation is involved in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis in many cell types [21, 22]. Besides, the induction of IL- 2 expression following T cell stimulation relies on NF -B activation [12, 22] . In our study, the protein expression of transcription factor p65, an important member of NF-B family, and its phosphorylation level were analyzed. An increase of total p65 protein level in Jurkat cells was found after incubation with PbCl 2 at the concentr ations of 1.8, 18 and 100 M ( Figure 4B, 1.69, 1.87 and 1.72 fold- change, respectively) or with CdCl 2 at 0.027, 0.27 and 2.7 M ( Figure 4C, 1.53, 1.58 and 1.66 fold- change, respectively) (all P < 0.05). PMA/Ca2+ ionophore did not affect p65 expression. With regard to the phosphorylation status of p65 in Jurkat cells, this was not significantly altered by PbCl 2 alone ( Figure 4D ). CdCl 2 10 M: respectively) ( Figure 4E , both P < 0.05), and this elevation was also found in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- treated cells (1.46 fold -change shown in Figure 4D , or 1.43 fold-change in Figure 4E , P < 0.01).

CdCl 2 did not significantly change IB production ( Figure 4G ). A significant reduction of IB expression was found in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- treated cells (0.79 fold-change in Figure 4G , P < 0.01), which was not altered by PbCl 2 or CdCl 2. 152Effects of lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics T cells.

PbCl and CdCl 2 increased mitochondrial DNA content in Jurkat cells Mitochondria have been recognized as playing a central role in activating apoptosis and subsequent IL-2 induction in T cells [24, 25]. To gain insight into the possible role of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in mitochondrial function, we investigated alterations in mitochondria of Jurkat cells stimulated with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. We firstly evaluated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, as an accessible proxy for the mtDNA content to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction [26]. According to our findings, PbCl 2 treatment significantly increased mitochondrial DNA copy number at the concentrations 0.18, 18 and 100 M (2.85, 1.28 and 2.16 fold-change, respectively, Figure 5A , both P < 0.05); CdCl 2 in the concentrations of 0.027, 2.7 and 10 M also increased mitochondrial DNA copy number in Jurkat cells (2.19, 2.22 and 1.94 fold-change, respectively, Figure 5B , all P < 0.05). PMA/Ca2+ ionophore increased DNA copy number by 2.56 fold- change ( Figure 5A or 5B, P < 0.001). Neither PbCl 2 nor CdCl 2 affected DNA copy number s after incubation with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. 7 153Chapter 7 Figure 5. Mitochondrial DNA content in Jurkat cells.

CdC l2 only slightly affected mitochondrial fusion gene expression in Jurkat cells To maintain a functional balance when cells experience environment changes, mitochondria exist within a network of dynamical fusion and fission that is involved in apoptosis, differentiation an d various stress responses [27, 28]. Mitochondrial fusion requires OPA1, MFN1 and MFN2, 2 did both fusion and fission genes. CdCl 2 at 0.027 M was found to decrease MFN1 mRNA level (0.74 fold- change) compared with non- treated cells ( Figure 6D , P < 0.05). No significant effects of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore on mitochondrial fusion and fission gene expression in Jurkat cells were found. However, the fusion gene OPA1 was significantly upregulated in Jurkat cells after coincubation with 10 M of CdCl 2 and PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (1.49 fold- change) compared with cells exposed to PMA/Ca2+ ionophore (1.11 fold- change) ( Figure 6B , P lead and cadm ium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics Figure 6.

PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 altered mRNA expression of mitochondrial regulators in Jurkat cells Since mitochondrial biogenesis, such as mtDNA replication and transcription, and fission and fusion events, has been reported to be regulated in concert with a set of nuclear -encoded transcriptional regulators, such as TFAM and NRF1 [31, 32] , we performed RT -qPCR analysis to verify whether the expression of these two genes was affected by PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 alone or in combination with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore . As shown in Figur e 7A , PbCl 2 did not affect TFAM mRNA level in Jurkat cells, while CdCl 2 at a concentration of 0.027 M decreased TFAM gene expression by 33.5% compared to the non-treated condition ( Figure 7B , P < 0.01). PbCl 2 at a concentration of 100 M significantly reduced NRF1 mRNA levels by 18.0% (Figure 7C , P < 0.01). CdCl 2 (2.7 and 10 M ) also decreased NRF1 gene expression (13.0% and 13.5%, respectively) ( Figure 7D , both 0.05). A/Ca2+ ionophore treatment did not7 155Chapter 7 alter NRF1 gene However , the expression of NRF1 in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- treated cells was reduced by 15.0% due to the presence of 0.18 M PbCl 2 (Figure 7C , P < 0.05).

The mRNA expression of genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome, including the respiratory chain component mtND2 (complex I), mtCYB (complex III), mtCO1 (complex IV) and mtATP8 (compl ex V), and ribosomal unit mt12S and mt16S, measured in Jurkat cells after incubation wi th PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 with or without PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. Our results showed that, except for the highest concentration, PbCl 2 significantly decreased the mRNA level of mtND2 in Jurkat cells by 14.0%, 10.0% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the untreated cells (Figure 8A , all P < 0.05). At the concentrations of 18 and 100 M, PbCl 2 inhibited mtCYB mRNA by 11.5% and 12.5%, respectively (Figure 8C and 8G , all P < 0.05).

Moreover, when its concentration was 0.027 and 2.7M, CdCl 2 reduced mtATP8 gene expression by 11.5% and 14.5%, respectively (Figure 8H , both P < 0.05).

Discussion In th e present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on a human T cell line, Jurkat cells. Our findings showed that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 slightly affected Jurkat cell viability and apoptosis. However, the effects of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on viability and apoptosis were more prominent when cells were also activated by PMA/Ca2+ ionophore . We further demonstrated the impa cts of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on Jurkat viability and apoptosis were associated with a decline of IL -2 production after stimulation with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore . The activation of the NF- B pathway was also altered by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 in Jurkat cel ls with or without activation. An elevation in mitochondrial DNA content by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 was observed, which suggests that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 treatment might affect Jurkat mitochondrial function. Only minor effects were found on fusion and fission gene expression. PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 were sh own to downregulate the mRNA expression of mitochondrial regulator genes: TFAM . We also 2 and CdCl 2 might in fluence mitochondrial DNA transcription in Jurkat cells by of mtND2 , mtATP8 activation and mitochondria by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 may be a potential mechanism of how PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 affect T cells in terms of cell viability, survival, and function, especially under activation states. Jurkat is a well -characterized CD4+ T cell line that is widely used for T -cell research in vitro [33, 34]. T cells are known as a major component of the adaptive immune system responsible for controlling multiple aspects of immune responses, while their functional role highly depends on cell survival and apoptosis [3, 35] . In this study, we showed a slight, but significant decline in Jurkat cell viability after exposure to PbCl 2 and CdCl 2, which is in accordance with previous studies [36, 37]. The reduced cell viability is not reflected by an increased apopt osis rate in these cells following incubation with PbCl 2 and CdCl 2. This may indicate that apoptotic cell death might not be the mechanism involved in the downregulation of cell viability by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2. Unfortunately, we did not measur e the proliferation rate of the cells. It might be suggested that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 may decrease the proliferation of J urkat cells. It has been reported that both lead and cadmium could promote apoptosis in most cells, which is not in line with our finding. This conflicting finding may be due to the fact that we used a different cell type but also to a different exposure dose and duration of exposure [38- 40]. For instance, lead treatment was shown to induce apoptosis in cerebellar neurons even at a minor conc entration 158Effects o f lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics as 1 M ; n evertheless, this phenomenon is not observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at a very high concentration of 500 M [41, 42]. The apoptotic effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 m ay thus indeed be cell -dependent. Interestingly, PbCl 2 (100 M) and CdCl 2 (10 M) significantly enha nced cell apoptosis in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- treated Jurkat cells, suggesting that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 tend to promote apoptosis events of activated Jurkat cells. It has been demonstrated before that the process of apoptosis in na\u00efve T cells and activated T cells regulated by pro- and anti- apoptotic molecules (such as the BCL -2 family) are remarkably different [35], which may partially explain our results of a different pro -apoptotic effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on non- activated and activated Jurkat cells. Activated T cells synthesize IL -2, which in turn drives the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of T cells [43]. We observed PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 a lone did not affect IL -2 synthesis in non- activated Jurkat cells . This was different in other studies : in vivo studies have previously shown that lead treatment significantly inhibited IL -2 expression in chicken, while cadmium exposure caused a decreased production of IL- 2 in mice splenocyte [44, 45]. In vitro studies regardi ng T cells demonstrated that lead (1 M) resulted in a suppressed IL -2 secretion by Jurkat cells [1], while cadmium (50 M) downregulated IL -2 productio n by primary T cells derived from BALB/c mice [4]. In spite of this, we noticed that IL -2 production in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- activated Jurkat cells was significantly declined by PbCl 2 and CdCl 2, which indicates that the effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on IL-2 synthesis may be related to the activation state of Jurkat c ells. The NF -B pathway has emerged as an important contributor to T cell development and function [46-48]. Among NF -B sub units, p65 has received the most attention in studies of NF - B phosphorylation, in which serine 536 is one of the best-understood phosphorylation target within this subunit [49]. We show that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 seem to have different effects on p65 activation. While both PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 increased the protein expression of p65, only CdCl 2 slightly but significantly increased p65 phosphorylation and thus activation. This difference in effect could be due to their different effects on IkBa. It was previously demonstrated that p65 is sequestered in the cytoplasm in a comple x with an inhibitor subunit IB, with inhibited NF activity [12, 49]. Therefore, our finding of elevated IB expression in PbCl 2-treated cells and not in CdCl 2-treated cells may explain why increased phosphorylation of p65 was only observed after PbCl 2 treatment. Again we 7 159Chapter 7 demonstrate a difference in effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on activated and resting cells. I t is worth noting that the effect of CdCl 2 in non- activated Jurkat cells was not associated with alterations in apoptosis rate and IL-2 production. We suggest CdCl 2 may rely on other mechanisms, i.e. increasing the depleti on of intracellular glutathione or inducing oxidative stress [ 50-52], to directly or indirectly influence the association between the NF -B pathway and apoptosis rate and IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. Mitochondria are critical targets for the accumulation of cationic metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and manganese [53, 54]. In this study, our comparative analysis on copy number demonstr ated that PbCl 2 and enhanced mitochondrial content only in non- activated Jurkat cells. A previous study demonstrated that increased mtDNA copy number is protective for cells under s tressful conditions [55] . Our findings, therefore , may indicate that Jurkat mitochondria react to the stressful condition of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 stimulation . As activation with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore per se also increased mtDNA copy number, it may be suggested tha t PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 were not able to further increase mtDNA copy number. To obtain a good insight into the effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 on mtDNA transcriptional activity, we assessed the gene expression of mtDNA and mitochondrial regulators. The replication and transcription of mtDNA are regulated in part by TFAM and NRF1 , which are respectively encoded by TFAM and NRF1 in the nuclear genome [31, 32]. Our observations showed a reduction in m RNA level of TFAM and NRF1 in Jurkat cells by PbCl 2 or CdCl 2, mainly in non- activated cells, implying that both PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 may affect mitochondrial biogenesis. This finding seems to be inconsistent with the fact that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 increased mtDNA copy number. It may therefore be that increased mtDNA replication leads to negative feedback regulation of TFAM and NRF1 mRNA levels [56]. Further studies , however, need to show that a reduction in the mRNA levels of TFAM and NRF1 reflect s a decrease in protein levels. Our present study also revealed that PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 declined the transcription level of mtDNA, such as mtND2 , mtCYB and mtATP8 in non- activated Jurkat cells. This suggest s that PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 are most likely to inhibit Jurkat mitochondrial transcription and function, particularly in the aspect of mitochondrial respiration and the ATP synthesizing capacity, since these genes enco de proteins being components of complexes I, III and V of the electron transport chain [57, 58]. Although unfortunately the protein levels of these above- noted genes were not evaluated 160Effects of lead and cadmium on NF -B activity/mitochondrial dynamics in this s tudy, our results are in line with previous experiments showing heavy metals can disrupt mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain [59, 60] . For instance, lead and cadmium bind to complex III to block the mitochondrial electron transport chain, consequently elevating ROS formation [ 61, 62]. In summary, by using an immortalized Jurkat cell line, our findings demonstrated that exp osure t o PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 tend to pose an adverse impact on the survival, proliferation and activation of T cells in vitro. This study also shows that the toxic effect of PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 may be associated with the activation state of T cells. Most importantly, we proposed a potential mechanism whereby PbCl 2 or CdCl 2 may affect T cells by disturbing NF -B acti vity and mitochondrial biogenesis. In further research, additional parameters, such as DNA binding activity of NF -B transcription factors, ATP generation and ROS production, should be evaluated to decipher the changes in NF- B and mitochondrial function i n other cell types under numerous experimental settings.

[62] Ma, L., et al., Toxicity of Pb(2+) on rat liver mitochondria induced by oxidative GENERAL DIS CUSSION Chapter 8 Heavy metals are naturally occurring compounds, however, anthropogenic activities introduce them in large , toxic, quantities in the surroundings [1, 2] . With the worldwide increase in the use of heavy metals in numerous applications, such as industrial, agricultural, domestic, and technological, we are all exposed, either voluntarily or involuntarily , to these heavy metals [3, 4]. It has been increasingly acknowledged that heavy metals pose a major threat to human health because of their toxicity, environmental persistence, and bioaccumulative potential [1 -3]. Exposure of c hildren to heavy metals should receive attention , as they are more susceptible to heavy metal exposure compared to adults [4, 5] . The vulnerability of children to environmental pollution of hea vy metals is largely due to the following reasons: multiple exposure routes (e.g. , breastfeeding, placental exposures, hand -to-mouth habits, and object- to-mouth activities), higher demand for food and ventilation per minute in relation to body size, lower toxin metabolic rate; more contacts with secondary pollution from the soil via the near -surface air layer due to their short stature, restricted movement as they live, play outdoors and attend kindergarten in the same residential area [5, 6]. Thus the exposure of children to heavy metals is higher than the exposure of adults [5, 6] . Next to this increased exposure, children are also more sensitive to heavy metal exposure. In early childhood, the immune, respiratory and central nervous systems are still in the developing stage, during which exposure to hazardous heavy metals imposes adverse impacts causing impaired functional consequences and permanent structural changes [4, 6] . In this thesis , we studied the effects of heavy metal exposure on children's health, with a special focus on the immune system. Children living in the e- waste recycling area face a high risk for heavy metal exposure Although adverse implications of heavy metals on children's health have been extensively emphasized by international bodies such as the WHO for a long time, the expos ure of children to heavy metals still is a problem [7, 8] . The intensive uncontrolled processing of e- waste in Guiyu has caused large amounts of heavy metals to be present in the surrounding air, dust, soils, sediments, and plants, which pose local residents' children at risk of exposure unavoidably. According to our findings in Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5, children living in Guiyu had higher blood levels of heavy metals , including lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic . This is probably due to 166General Discussion the serious environmental pollution of heavy metals derived from the e -waste dismantling processes. As reported previously, nearly 60-80% of families in Guiyu are engaged in e- waste informal recycling activities conducted by small scale family- run workshops [9]. No or less regulation of processing and deposition of the e-waste contributes to heavy metal contamination in the ir living environment. Thus, children of Guiyu residents can unavoidably become exposed to heavy metals through many routes, such as the ingestion of contaminated food and water, inhalation of heavy metal-bound dust and atmospheric suspended particulates, and dermal contact of hazardous materia ls. Although adults are obviously also exposed to heavy metals, as indicated above, children have a higher risk of heavy metal exposure than adults due to pica and play behavior as wel l as an increased sensitivity to heavy metal toxicity [5, 6] . It has been reported that there has been a surge in cases of medical problems, such as leukemia, skin infections, respiratory and stomach diseases in Guiyu children [10]. Our group has previously observed higher blood chromium and manganese respectively associated with more cough and wheeze in children of Guiyu, which suggests that living in an e- waste exposed area may result in elevated levels of heavy metals accompanied by the accelerated prevalence of respiratory symptoms and asthma [11]. Our studies in this thesis showed that the levels of heavy metals in Guiyu children were lower than those reported in our previous studies . Taking blood lead level in preschool children of Guiyu as an example, the reported value has been gradually decreased from 13.2 g/dl of 2004 [12], and 10.3 g/dl of 2011 ( Chapt er 2) to 6.0 g/dl of 2014 ( Chapter 3). This is primarily attributed to the environmental protection laws and regulations promulgated by the Chinese government to tackle e-waste pollution throughout the country. However, the impacts of heavy metals still remain in the local surrounding of Guiyu owing to a 30- year history of informal and uncontrolled e- waste dismantling activities, leading to relatively bigger body loading exposure in children in this area. As a consequence, we observed approximately 80% of the children from Guiyu with a blood lead level exceeding the safe ty limit of 5 0 g/l issued by the U.S . CDC [13], indicating that concern is still required to monitor heavy metal exposure and child's health risk in this area. To fi nd out the contributed and protective factors for high exposure of children to heavy metals is very important. Although the severe e- waste -induced environmental contamination of the local environment has lasted for decades, lowering the exposure chances fr om the point of the 8 167Chapter 8 child's habits, diets, and contaminant contact sources and duration would be helpful for children li ving in Guiyu. In our population studies (Chapter s 2, 3 and 5) we found various child factors to be associated with high levels of heavy metals in blood, including high frequency of contact with e -waste, longer dwelling time of parents in Guiyu, the residence used as an e- waste workshop, parents' occupation associated with e-waste dismantling, and distance between the residence and e- waste deposition within 50 meters were found. As mentioned previously , most e-waste dismantling activities in Guiyu are performed in or around the residence, leading to a large accumulation of heavy metals on the surface s of the surroundings as well as atmospheric suspended particulates [12, 14] . It is evident that children living in such surroundings would be highly exposed to heavy metals. Prior studies have demonstrated that high levels of heavy metals are present in the blood and milk of mothers with a long- term residence in an e- waste recyclin g area , which contribute s to increased exposure of their children to heavy metals via the placenta or breastfeeding [15-17]. Therefore, the maternal residence time in Guiyu was positively associated with the loading burden of heavy metals in their children, especially those who were born and raised locally. If parents were engaged in e- waste recycling work, it also may put thei r children at a high risk of heavy metal exposure when in close contact after working. It is worth noting that smoking or passive smoking is also a source of non- occupational lead and cadmium exposure for humans [18, 19]. Although our study ( Chapter 2) did not show a significant association between a family member who is smoking daily and a child's blood levels of heavy metals, our group has previously reported that parental smoking may promote an increase in child blood lead and c admium levels [12]. Also , the education levels of the parents were associated with heavy metal levels in the blood, albeit negatively (Chapter 5). This can be explained by the fact that parents with a higher educational level may have more awareness of how to prevent their children from e -waste contamination. This suggestion is supported by the fact that high frequency of milk consumption, intake of bean products and supplements of calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin C, hand washing before meals, and house ventilation, were associated with low blood levels of lead, arsenic and cadmium in children (Chapter s 2 and 5). Milk is an ideal source of macroelements (calcium and potassium) and microelements (copper, ion, zinc and selenium), which are known to play a crucial role in the protection of a human body against the negative effect of toxic free radicals [20]. Thus, milk consumption is considered as a protective factor for exposure to lead as well as other toxic 168General Discussion metals [12]. Keeping ventilation and handwashing is also an effective method for children to decr ease the contact opportunity of exposure to heavy metals. Population studies provide evidence for the toxic effects of heavy metal exposure on both innate and adaptive immune systems This thesis contains four chapters of population studies describing the effects of heavy metals on both innate and adaptive immune systems of children (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5, Figure 1 ). Over the last decades, the immunotoxicity of heavy metals has been well documented in in vitro or animal studies, but few have been done in humans, especially in children from an e- waste recycling area. In Chapter 2, we demonstrated that the alterations in the number and percentage of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils , basophils and natural killer (NK ) cells, were linked to higher blood lead and cadmium levels in children. Our results showed that blood lead level was positively correlated with monocyte percentage in child's peripheral blood. Although prior studies suggest ed that exposure to lead and cadmium can supress the viability of monocytes in bullfrog tadpoles as well as in vitro [21, 22] , it may be different in population studies in humans. The animal and in vitro studies are short- term studies. In vivo, heavy metals may also have an effect on the precursors of monocytes. This needs to be the subject of future studies, since no data are available yet on the effects of heavy metals on immune cell precursors. Therefore, the changes in monocytes in the human body may be a reflection of long- term exposure to heavy metals. Elevated neutrophil percentages were also found in children with higher blood lead and cadmium levels. An increase in these innate immune cells usually suggests the presence of inflammation [23, 24] . Indeed, lead and cadmium are able to provoke inflammatory response [25, 26] . We also noticed a trend towards increased eosinophil and basophile counts as a result of enhanced blood lead concentration when it ranged from 9.60 g/dl to 12.04 g/dl and from 7.69 g/dl to 9.60 g/dl, respectively. Animal studies provided supporting evidence that acute and chronic feeding of lead nitrate resulted in the elevation of basophils and eosinophils [27, 28] . Nevertheless, prior studies in humans showed conflict ing results that lead exposure has a positive or negative correlation with eosinophil count [29-31]. 8 169Chapter 8 The conflicting results may be att ributed to the variation in populations, duration and level of exposure, and analysis method. NK cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes essential for regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Two subsets exist: CD56dim subset, co- expressing are abundant cytokine producers [32] . With respect to the cytotoxic action of heavy metals on NK cells in children, our findings of both Chapters 2 and 3 showed a significant reduction in the percentage of NK cells in Guiyu children as compared with the reference group . However, an association between blood lead level and total NK cell percentage using univariate linear regression analysis was not found in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. As noted in Chapter 3, the percentages of both subpopulations of NK cells were significantly lower in Guiyu children. Moreover, high blood lead level may be one of the causes of a reduced percentage of CD56bright NK cells , since the blood level of lead negatively correlated with the population of CD56bright NK cells in children by a univariate linear regression analysis . Based on these findings, it is reasonable to suggest that exposure to lead may inhibit the development and proliferation of NK cells in children. This chapter also demonstrated that elevated IL- 1 and decreased IL -27 expression probably linked the adverse consequence in the development and function of NK cells to lead exposure to some extent. Not only innate immune cells but also lymphocytes appeared to be affected by heavy metal exposure. Our findings in Chapters 3 and 5 showed that children living in Guiyu had a reduced lymphocyte count as compared with the reference group, suggesting that the proliferation , development and apoptosis of lymphocytes in Guiyu children might be affected. Although no associations between lea d and cadmium exposure and lymphocyte count were observed in these two chapters . The observations in Chapter 4 showed a decreased IL -4 production and an elevated IFN -/IL-4 ratio in Guiyu children, suggesting that T cells' function might be also affected. In line with this, our in vitro study ( Chapter 7 ) conducted with a T lymphocyte cell line demonstrated that lead and cadmium may indeed influence the cell viability and function of T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes play a large role in the humoral immune response defending against pathogens [33]. We also conducted an investigation on how heavy metals affect B cells of Guiyu children in Chapter 4 of this thesis. Although in this chapter, we did not measure B cell counts in 170General Discussion children from the e -waste r ecycling area, we assessed the survival and development of B cells in children with high blood lead and cadmium levels. We observed that the apoptosis rate of B cells in children from the e -waste area was lower than the reference group. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis showing the relationship between blood lead and cadmium levels and B cell apoptosis indicated that lead and/or cadmium may suppress B cell apoptosis in children. This seems to be in contradiction to in vitro and animal studies , which mainly show that lead and cadmium tend to promote apoptosis in many cell types [34, 35], including our own studies in Chapters 6 and 7. However, studies evaluating the effect of lead or cadmium on B cell apoptosis are scarce in humans . Future studies should focus on this, since this cell type seems to respond differently to lead and cadmium than most other cell types. Noteworthy, we observed a suppression in caspase -9 activity and an increase in the NF-B transcription factor c-Rel mRNA level in B cells of children in the e -waste area, indicating that these factors may play a mechanistic role in the decreased apoptosis rates in e- waste area children. It has been reported that lead can increase B cell activation/proliferation [35], which is consistent with our finding. From this point of view, heavy metals may exert an adverse effect on the development and functioning of both B cells or T cells , disrupting both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Based on the above- described findings, heavy metals appear to have adverse effects on the immune system in children . By using a multiple linear regression analysis, our work of Chapter 5 further demonstrated that exposure to multiple heavy metal s, including lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic, appears to res ult in aberrant immune homeostasis and inflammatory activation in children . Different from other chapters, more potential confounders, including characteristics and habits of children, and parents' information, were considered in this chapter in order to find out more profound associations of heavy metal exposure with immune parameters. In addition to their respective effect s, the interaction effects of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic on immune cells and cytokines were also assessed by a centering methodology in the multiple linear regression models. As important players in mediating inflammatory responses as well as in regulating immune response, measuring pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)- 1, IL -6, IL -8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and anti -inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL -1 RA), IL -4, IL-10 and IL -13 could help in showing the alterations in immune homeostasis [36-39]. As shown in Chapter 5, high concentrations of IL- 1 and IL - 6 but low IL-1RA and IL-13 were observed with high blood levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, 8 171Chapter 8 and arsenic in Guiyu children. Prior data from the ep idemiological, animal, and in vitro studies have shown that all these four heavy metals possess pro- inflammatory activities characterized by increasing the production of ROS, TNF -, IL -6, and IL-8 but r educing IL -10 and IL- 1RA [40-43] , which is in parallel with our findings. Although we cannot identify far -reaching health consequences in children living in Guiyu at present, our finding s showing an immune imbalance and inflammatory state may indicate that children exposed to toxic heavy metals might have a potential risk for developing immune associated d iseases in the future. Taking into consideration that prolonged inflammation may contribute to a wide range of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases [44-46] , more attention is needed for a better understanding of the exact impacts of heavy metal exposure on children's health in the long term in future investigations.

The effects of heavy metals on the immune response have been studied in this thesis , as well as by other researchers [47- 49]. Existing in vitro studies have shown that heavy metals could inhibit cell viability, enhance oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial and DNA damage, cohesion loss and cell apoptosis in many cell types [47-49]. However, the precise mechanism of how heavy metal affect the immune cells is not yet fully understood and therefore requires more effort to elucidate. In Chapters 6 and 7 of this thesis, the human MonoMac 6 and Jurkat cell line was applied to demonstrate the effects of the heavy metals lead and cadmium on monocytes and T cells, respectively . We first wanted to explore a possible mechanism by which the heavy metals lead and cadmium could affect immune cells. We studied whether lead and cadmium affect TLR activation, since it has been known that many immune cells, such as monocytes, and T lymphocytes, express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [50-52]. TLR activation can initiate downstream signalling pathway, including NF- B and MAPK, consequently triggering host defensive responses and orchestrating immune responses [50, 53] . In Chapter 6 we used THP1 -MD2 -CD14 and various HEK- Blue reporter cell lines (stably expressing either TLR 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, together with NF-kB inducible secreted alkaline phosphatase) to evaluate whether lead or cadmium could activate or inhibit TLRs. We demonstrated that lead and cadmium may exert toxic effects on immune cells via TLRs and the NF-B pathway (Figure 2 ). Although both lead and cadmium hardly activated TLRs by themselves, lead was found to promote the activation of TLR4, 5 and 8 induced by their corresponding agonists. Moreover, lead attenuated TLR3 and TLR9 activation by their agonists. High doses of cad mium negatively affected TLR2, 4, 5 and 7 activation by their agonists, while high cadmium increased TLR3 activation by its agonist. However, the lower dose of cadmium can elevate TLR4, 5 and 8 activations in the presence of their agonists. Our findin gs provide evidence that exposure to lead and cadmium may affect the response of the immune system against pathogens by affecting activation of TLRs. Although 8 173Chapter 8 reports regarding the effects of lead and cadmium on TLR4 signalling are scanty, previous studies showe d that other metals, i.e. nickel, can ligate with two histidine residues of the TLR4 molecule [63, 64]. Potentially, lead and cadmium may also bind to TLR4 histidine residues to influence TLR4 and its downstream signalling, since lead and cadmium have similar physical properties of divalent metal cations compared with nickel. Alternatively, lead and cadmium may also bind to LPS, altering the interaction between LPS and TLR4, however, this has not been studied yet. Figure 2. A summary of the effect of heavy metals on TLRs.

Monocytes play important roles in the immune defense, inflammation and tissue remodeling by phagocytos is, antigen processing and presentation, and cytokine synthesis [54, 55] . As described in Chapter 2, the number of monocytes in peripheral blood was increased in children with high blood levels of lead and cadmium. Besides, a positive association between blood lead level and monocyte percentage was noted, indicating that exposure to lead may influence the survival of monocytes themselves or their precursors. MonoMac 6 is a monocyte cell line with many similar properties to monocyte , such as CD14 expression, phagocytic ability and cytokine 174General Discussion production, which t herefore is considered as a good model for mature blood monocytes [56]. In our study in Chapter 6, we used this cell line to explore the effects of lead and cadmium on monocytes in vitro ( Figure 3). Since TLR4 is prominently expressed on monocytes and since our study on the effects of lead and cadmium are obvious for TLR4, we focussed on the effects of lead and cadmium on this receptor in the MonoMac 6 cells. Our findings showed that lead and cadmium suppress ed cell viability and induce d apoptosis in MonoMac 6 cells, which is in accordance with many previous in vitro studies with other cell models [57-59]. We further observed the expression of ICAM- 1, an activation marker of monocytes, is upregulated by lead treatment, while both lead and cadmium slightly decreased ICAM- 1 expression after stimulation with the TLR4 agonist LPS. Therefore, it seems that lead and cadmium can alter the function of monocytes in vitro, but that the effects may be depended on the activation status of the monocytes . Another functional marker for monocytes, i.e., cytokine production, was also affected by lead and cadmium. Although lead and cadmium did not affect TNF- and IL -10 per se, it was show n that LPS-induced pro- inflammatory TNF - production was elevated, while anti-inflammatory IL -10 production was inhibited by lead and/or cadmium . This is in agreement with our findings in our vivo studies in Chapter 5, suggesting that lead and cadmium have the ability to induce pro- inflammatory effects. These effects may be induced via TLRs, since monocytes express TLRs, such as TLR4. The role of lead and cadmium in mediating the TLR4 downstream MAPK pathway has also been demonstrated in Chapter 6 . Our data showed that cadmium but not lead alone did elevate p38 phosphorylation in MonoMac 6 cells, which is not completely consistent with previous studies in other cell lines [60-62] , in which both lead and cadmium can induce p38 MAPK activation . This difference may be associated with the different lead concentration s, or different cell models. However, we also observed both lead and cadmium further activate MAPK signalling pathway by increasing phosphorylati on of p38 in MonoMac 6 after LPS stimulation , indicating that the effect of lead and cadmium is different in LPS stimulated vs unstimulated MonoMac 6 cells. O ur findings in Jurkat on the impact of lead and cadmium on mitochondria in Chapter 7 suggest that lead and cadmium predominantly affect mitochondria in unstimulated cells rather than that in stimulated cells. The se differences could explain why lead and cadmium induce d different effects on stimulated and unstimulated MonoMac 6 cells . 8 175Chapter 8 Futur e investigations should therefore also focus on the effects of lead and cadmium in mitochondria in monocy tes. Figure 3. Heavy metals affect the monocytic cell model via TLR 4 and the downstream NF-B and MAPK signall ing pathway; A and C represent non-activated MonoMac 6 model; B and D represent LPS -activated MonoMac 6 model. TLR4 localizes to the cell surface and is an important sensor for LPS. The sti mulation of TLR4 by LPS initiates the intracellular MAPK signal ling pathways and inflammatory cytokine release, which plays an important role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.

We conducted an in vitro study in Jurkat 176General Discussion cells to investigate how lead and cadmium affect T cells w ith respect to cell viability, survival and activation ( Chapter 7) (Figure 4). In line with previous studies [65, 66] , our data showed a slight, but significant reduction in Jurkat cell viability as a result of lead and cadmium treatment. Our in vivo studies ( Chapters 3 and 5) also provided evidence that lymphocyte count s were reduced in children with lead and cadmium exposure, although the changes in T cells were not specifically studied. Although it has been extensively reported that lead and cadmium -induced apoptosis in most cell types [57-59] , lead and cadmium per se did not increase apoptosis of Jurkat cells in our study. Mitogenic activation of resting lymphocytes induces phosphoinositide hydrolysis of the cell membrane leading to the generation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which act as second messengers to liberate intracellular calcium stores and to activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. In in vitro model studies, these events can be mimicked with agents, i.e. , PMA/Ca2+ ionophore [67 ]. PMA can activate PKC, whose acti vation triggers cellular signals that lead to the activation of the transcription factor NF -B in various cell types [ 67, 68, 69]. Ca2+ ionophore treatment elevates intracellular calcium level to bypass the transmembrane signalling inducing the lymphocytes to proliferate and activate [67]. Interestingly, we observed that lead and cadmium promoted apoptosis in Jurkat cells induced by PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. IL-2 is an autocrine growth factor that drives the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of T cells [70]. In parallel with the observation that lead and cadmium did not induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, lead and cadmium per se also did not increase the production of IL-2 in these cells. However, IL -2 production in PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- stimulated cells was inhibited by lead and cadmium. Therefore, the de creased IL -2 production induced by lead and cadmium after PMA/Ca2+ ionophore stimulation may be (partly) responsible for decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis induced by lead and cadmium in activated Jurkat cells. Lead and cadmium thus also affect ed PMA/Ca2+ ionophore- activated cells and non -activated cells differently. We expanded our understanding of how lead and cadmium affect J urkat cells by evaluating NF- B activity. Jurkat cells also express most TLRs ( TLR1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9) [71] , offering us a hint that the effects of lead and cadmium on Jurkat cells may be via the se TLRs. Although we did not test this in our experiments, this suggestion is supported by our observations in Chapter 6 that lead and cadmium affect NF -kB activation, one of the intracellular signalling pathways induced by TLRs. Whether this NF -kB activation is indeed induced via TLR s needs further 8 177Chapter 8 investigation. In Chapter 7 , lead was found to induce an elevation in p65 and IB in non- activated Jurkat cells, indicating that lead may not elicit NF -kB activation in non- activated Jurkat cells. Lead i nduced a decrease in p65 phosphorylation in activated Jurkat cells, therefore it inhibits NF-kB activation in activated Jurkat cells. Cadmium increased NF-B activation by increasing both p65 and p65 phosphorylation in non- activated Jurkat cells , while it does not affect NF -B activation in activated cells. NF-B may thus act as one of the key target s for heavy metal- induced toxic actions in Jurkat cells. This is in line with a previous paper [72], however, the molecular mechanisms involved in how lead and cadmium impact NF -B activation remain s unclear. As lead and cadmium can readily bind to sulfhydryl groups and displace zinc and calcium ions from proteins and enzymes, converting them structurally to an inactive form and completely altering their activity [73, 74 ], we speculated that they are also likely to change NF-B p65 and IB in this way . Given the pivotal role of NF -B transcription factors in mediating cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, more studies into the effects of lead and cadmium and other heavy metals on the NF-B family and their binding activity with DNA would be helpful to reveal the precise mechanism of the immunotoxicity of heavy metal s. Apart from TLRs and the downstream NF -B signal ling, lead and cadmium can enter cells via ionic mechanisms, for example, via calcium channels [75]. Prior research has demonstrated that intracellular mitochondria are responsive to these heavy metals [76]. Thus, there may be another mechanism by which lead and cadmium may induce toxi c effects on Jurkat cells: by disturbing mitochondrial biogenesis ( Chapter 7 ). Our study found an increase in mtDNA copy number of Jurkat cells in response to lead and cadmium , suggesting that Jurkat mitochondria enhance biogenesis to adapt to a lead and cadmium challenge. Indeed, it has previously been shown that an increased mtDNA copy number is protective for cells under stressful conditions [77]. We also assessed the effect of lead and cadmium on mtDNA replication and transcription, which are regulated in part by TFAM and NRF1 [78, 79]. Our results showed a reduction in mRNA level of mitochondrial regulators TFAM and NRF1 in non- activated Jurkat cells treated with lead and cadmium , with little and no effect of lead and cadmium in activated cells. It was known that genes in the mitochondrial genome, including mtND2 (complex I), mtCYB (complex III), mtCO1 (complex IV) and mtATP8 (complex V) encode polypeptides for subunits of enzyme complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system [80] . We observed that lead and cadmium 178General Discussion reduced the transcription level of mtND2 , mtCYB and m tATP8 in non- activated Jurkat cells. This therefore indicates that lead and cadmium may play an inhibitory role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function (i.e. respiration and ATP capacity) of non- activated Jurkat Figure 4. Schematic overview of NF-B and mitochondrial biogenesis in a T cell model (Jurkat cells) lead treatment; (D ) cadmium plus PMA/Ca2+ ionophore treatment. The effects of lead and cadmium on Jurkat cells are probably via TLRs and ionic channels, which respectively impact NF-B signalling pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis, accordingly changing the activation, viability and survival of Jurkat cells. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in Ca2+ signalling and Ca2+ homeostasis and are sensitive to the substitution of lead and cadmium for calcium. Moreover, their effects on Jurkat cells may be associated with cell activation state.

The risk of exposure to and body loading of heavy metals in Guiyu children remain s high, reflecting that u nregulated e- waste recycling activities in Guiyu largely pose local children at risk. The local residents should pay more attention to this issue and awareness should be strengthened to protect their children from heavy metals and e -waste pollution. Some factors, such as frequency of contact with e- waste, dwelling time in Guiyu, the residence used as an e- waste workshop, the distance between the residence and e- waste deposition, and parents engaged in e- waste dismantling, were observed to contribute t o heavy metal exposure, which could be clues of how to lower the exposure risk of heavy metals. Importantly, t he effect s of heavy metals on the immune cells of Guiyu children were evaluated (Chapters 2 , 3, 4 and 5). We suggest that the development and function of immune cells, such as monocytes, NK cells, B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, were affected by heavy metals. This part of the work provides a series of evidence proving the immunotoxic effects of heavy metals on children, especially those who reside in an e- waste recycling area. Although we did not see the adverse consequence resulted from aberrant immune alterat ions yet, further risk assessment of health problem s in children could be necessary to conduct. It is also essential to carry out studies to investigate the association between heavy metal exposure and health problems in adults who have lived in Guiyu for their whole life. Guiyu populations also suffer from exposure to other environmental chemicals result ing from e-waste dismantling, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which also have immunotoxicity [81-83] . The synergistic or antagonistic interactions between heavy metals and POPs on the immune cells may be important in vivo factors, which we did not study ye t. Therefore, further analysis of the interaction between heavy metals and POPs in vitro and in vivo in mediating the immune response are necessary to explore their exact toxic effects on the immune system in humans. Moreover, our results in vitro only re flect the short -term effects of heavy metals on immune cell models, long- term exposure experimental studies, for instance , in animals, are needed in order to obtain a better understanding of the role of heavy metals on the immune response in vivo. 180General Discussion We demonstrated that the toxic action of heavy metals on the immune cells may be via TLRs a nd their downstream activation of NF-B and MAPK. It is noteworthy to mention that the exact effects of heavy metals on the immune cells potentially depend on the ac tivation status of cells. This could also be concluded from our findings of TLR activation and inhibition experiments with HEK- Blue reporter cell lines ( Chapter 6 ) showing that TLR activation is only affected by lead and cadmium in the presence of the liga nds. Exploring how lead and cadmium interplay with functional domains of TLRs in the absence or presence of their ligands could profoundly clarify the specific role of lead and cadmium in activated immune cells via TLRs. However, the effect s of lead and cadmium may not only relate to TLRs but these heavy metals can also enter the cells via , for instance, calcium channels and thus affect intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria. Our studies showed that lead and cadmium increased mtDNA content but may inhibit mtDNA replication and transcription in non -activated Jurkat cells. However, further insight into the effects of heavy metals on mitochondrial function and biogenesis is important for our understating of the effects of heavy metals on immu ne cells. Our in vitro work expands the understanding of how heavy metals affect the immune cells and brings new insights for exploring heavy metal toxicities in other cell types. Besides, our in vitro studies leave us a hypothesis for the in vivo effects of lead and cadmium that heavy metals may not induce immunological diseases in animals and humans in a direct manner, but may exaggerate diseases once they are caused by other inducers. Further investigations, for instance , in animal models, are necessary in order to substantiate this hypothesis. Additionally, the findings of TLR activation and inhibition exp eriments provide us some significant information that not only the role of TLR4, but also the role of various other TLRs (including TLR1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) and their intracellular adaptor molecules (such as MyD88, IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, TRAF6 and TRAF3) [50] should be explored in the future research. Also, other immune receptors, including T cell recep tor, B cell recepto r, C-type lectin receptor , NOD- like recept or, and RIG-I- like receptor , play a vital role in the infection and immunity of human body [84-86]. To extend our work on how heavy metals affect these receptors and their crosstalk with TLRs, particularly in the presence of the ligands or activators , will obtain more comprehensive knowledge to understand the toxic effects of heavy metals on the immune response. 8 181Chapter 8 REFERENCES [1] Masindi, V. , et al., Environmental contamination by heavy metals.

H eavy metals generated during the e-waste dismantling proce ss can persistently remain in the environment, food, and water, putting people who live within a specific distance of e- waste recycling areas at an increased risk of developing severe irreversible health conditions. The immune system of children is still in the developing stages and is more susceptible to threats from toxic heavy metals as compared with the immune system of adults . However, data on how heavy metal exposure affect s the immune system in children, especially those who live in an e- waste- exposed area, is relatively scarce. As one of the largest e- waste recycling areas in China a nd worldwide, Guiyu has received much attention. Our population studies ( Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5) in this thesis investigated exposure to heavy metals (lead, cadmiu m, mercury and arsenic) and their effects on the immune system of children living in this area. Besides, our in vitro studies ( Chapters 6 and 7 ) in this thesis used cell lines of immune cells (MonoM ac 6 and Jurkat) to evaluate potential mechanism s by which heavy metals impact immune function. In Chapter 2 , the alterations in innate immune cells (including monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils and NK cells ) in preschool children from Guiyu and a non-e- waste - exposed area were evaluated. We found that Guiyu children had significantly higher absolute counts of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils but a lower NK cell percentage as compared with child ren in the non-e- waste- exposed area. Our further association analysis showed that lead exposure is positively associated with the counts of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, and cadmium is positively associated with the count and percentage of neutrophils. This suggests that exposure to e- waste -originated lead and cadmium might impact the development and proliferation of innate immune cells in children. In Chapter 3 , lead exposure and its effect s on NK cells (total NK, CD56bright and CD56dim subpopulations ) in Guiyu children were explored. We observed that children in Guiyu had a higher blood lead level and a lower NK cell percentage than children in the non-e- waste - 186Summary exposed group. Blood lead level was negative ly asso ciated with total and CD56bright NK cell percentages, indicating that lead exposure may result in the reduction in percentages of total NK and CD56bright cells. In addition, platelets, IL- 1 and IL -27, which are important for the development and differentiation of NK cells , were al tered and associated with lead exposure. These data suggest that lead exposure might affect the proliferation, differentiation, and function of NK cells in children. In Chapter 4 , the effect of lead and cadmium on B cell apoptosis in Guiyu children were investigated. We observed a reduction in CD19+ B cell apoptosis, caspase -9 activation and IL- 4 levels, and an elevation in NF-B transcription factor c-Rel mRNA level and IFN- /IL-4 ratio, as well as blood lead and cadmium levels in Guiyu children as compared with children in the non-e- waste -exposed group. Our findings after multiple correspondence analysis and linear regression analysis showed that both blood lead and cadmium levels were inversely associated with CD19+ B cell apoptosis. Thus, w e concluded that exposure to lead and cadmium is likely to disturb the survival and development of B cells of children. This chapter also showed that NF-B signalling and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in heavy metal -induced immunotoxic action. The decrease in IL -4 production and the elevation in the IFN- /IL-4 ratio suggest that an imbalance of T helper cell (Th) 1/Th2 ratio might occur in Guiyu children. However, this needs further studies to validate. In Chapter 5 , the alterations in immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes), pro- cytokines (IL -inflammatory cytokines (IL -1RA, IL-4, IL-10, 13) in children of Guiyu and the non-e- waste- contaminated area were monitored. Guiyu children not only had high blood levels of lead, cadmium, mercur y and arsenic, they also had increased IL -1 and IL -6 but decreased lymphocyte count, IL- 1RA and IL-13 levels as compared with the children in the non-e- waste-exposed group. Moreover, the neutrophil count was inversely associated with lead , cadmium and arsenic exposure. IL-1RA concentration negatively correlated with lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic , while IL-1 and IL -6 were positively correlated with blood lead level . These data suggest that exposure to heavy metals in children induced aberrant immune homeostasis and inflammatory activation. Although, we did not study the long- term health consequences of these heavy metals in the present studies, if these abnormalities in the immune system exist permanently , they may induce immune- related A 187Appendices disease in children in the future. Therefore, follow -up studies of Gui yu children's health are needed. In Chapter 6, we firstly used the human monocytic leukemia reporter cell line (THP1 - XBlue -MD2 -CD14) and seven human embryonic kidney (HEK) reporter cell lines (HEK- Blue -hTLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) to determine whether lead and cadmium activate TLRs and NF-B pathway s. We observed that lead alone did not activat e TLRs and NF- B in THP1 - MD2 -CD14 or any of the TLR-expressing HEK reporter cells, while cadmium exposure (at 10 M) had an inhibitory effect on TLR8 activation. Nevertheless, lead treatment could promote the activation of TLR4, 5, and 8 but attenuate TLR3 and 9 activation in the presence of their corresponding agonists; high exposure to cadmium reduced TLR2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 activation, while this may increase TLR3 activation, and the lower dose of cadmium increased TLR4, 5 and 8 activation induced by their agonists. These data suggest that lead and cadmium can affect TLR and NF -B activation in the presence of TLR ligands. In this chapter, we also used the human monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6) to identify how lead and cadmium affected monocytes via TLR4. We demonstrated that lead and cadmium induce d cell death and cell apoptosis in the absence and presence of the TLR4 ligand LPS. Lead , in the absence of LPS, slightly increased ICAM-1 expression, while both lead and cadmium inhibited LPS- induced ICAM-1 expression on MonoM ac 6 cells. Besides, an upregulat ion of p38 phosphorylation was found after lead and cadmium exposure in the presence of LPS, indicating that another downstream signalling pathway of TLRs, MAPK , is also activated . We concluded that p38 MAPK activation is associated with lead and cadmium exposure and this could explain the effect of lead and cadmium on MonoMac cell apoptosis and ICAM -1 expression . This chapter also showed that lead and cadmium increased TNF - but inhibited IL-10 production in MonoMac 6 cells following LPS stimulation. In Chapter 7 , we used a T cell model, Jurkat cells, to evaluate the effect of lead and cadmium on cell survival, proliferation , NF-B and mitochondria in the absence or presence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore. Lead and cadmium were found to slightly decrease Jurkat cell viability , mainly in activated cells. In activated cells, i.e. in the p resence of PMA/Ca2+ ionophore, lead and cadmium not only promoted cell apoptosis but also reduced IL-2 production. Further results showed that lead and cadmium increased NF -B levels in non- activated cells. Cadmium also increased phosphorylation of NF-kB in non- activated cells, while l ead inhibit ed p65 188Summary phosphorylation in activat ed cells. This suggest s that the effect of lead and cadmium on NF -B activity may rely on Jurkat activation state. Additionally , we demonstrated that lead and cadmium enhanced mitochondrial mtDNA copy number in non- activated Jurkat cells, indicating that mitochondria in non- activated Jurkat cells are more susceptible to lead and cadmium stimulation than those in activated Jurkat cells. In line with this, o ur findings showed that lead and cadmium reduced TFAM and NRF1 mRNA level s accompanied by a decreased , mtCYB and mtATP8 transcription in non- activated Jurkat cells, which also suggests that the effect of lead and cadmium on mitochondrial biogenesis is predominant in non- activated Jurkat cells. Since these genes encode proteins to regulate the replication and transcription of mtDNA or constitute complexes I, III and V of the electron transport chain, we speculated that exposure to lead and cadmium might inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis and function of Jurkat cells, such as mitochondrial respiration and the ATP synthesizing capacity. Furth er studies are needed to substantiate this suggestion. This thesis combines population and in vitro cell model studies to gain a better understanding of the toxic action of heavy metals on the immune system . Our current work provided evidence of the toxic effects of heavy metals on the immune system in a particularly susceptible population, i.e. children . On the other hand, in vitro studies with cell models helped us to evaluate several potential mechanisms of how heavy metals affect immune cells. These are TLR s, NF-B pathways, MAPK pathways and mitochondrial function. Future studies should also include animal models to study the effects of heavy metals on immune cells.
