Good question! Our name says a lot about who we are, what we do, and what you can study here. SPEA was founded as a response to the needs and problems of modern society\u2014needs that were not being addressed by other more traditional schools such as business, arts and sciences, or political science. Our scope is wide, and we address such issues as public finance, nonprofit management, public management, environmental management, policy analysis, health administration, criminal justice and arts administration. Even better, this year we have welcomed several new faculty members who are already making a difference and leading our school into the future. You can see who they are by going here. The school's broadening globalization is already being realized in the expanded programs of studies in several countries around the world through SPEA Overseas Education. Additionally, we are strengthening our research in energy policy, sustainable development, and the prevention of poverty, and building on traditional strengths in public finance, management of nonprofit and public sectors, and arts administration. Beyond your degree program, SPEA offers many opportunities to enrich your academic career, such as the Honors Program, Washington Leadership Program, Accelerated Master's Program, and many more. Seek out what speaks to you to expand your experience here at SPEA! To us, a public or environmental affair is an issue or problem that affects the quality of life on this planet for its citizens. That's a big list, obviously, and our graduates go on to jobs in many fields\u2014public, private, and nonprofit.

This bulletin has additional information specific to the IUPUI campus. Explore the IUPUI bulletin here: http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ Bloomington Campus Bachelor of Arts in Environmental and Sustainability Studies (B.A.E.S.S) Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M) Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S) Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A) Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and Policy (B.S.H.M.P) Minors Certificate Programs About the Degree Programs The School of Public and Environmental Affairs recognizes the complex problems facing our society such as global climate change, hazardous waste, escalating health care costs, balance of trade, and international relations. Through the five bachelor of science degree programs, the students develop problem-solving abilities and organizational skills so that they may contribute possible solutions to these and other problems. More than ever, people who take on leadership roles in society\u2014whether as professionals or volunteers\u2014 need formal training in managing staff, fiscal resources, information, public relations and marketing, and technology. With its focus on managing resources and solving problems, the Bachelor of Science in10 September 13, 2017 Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) degree prepares students for careers in diverse areas such as federal, state, and local politics and administration; public policy evaluation; management consulting; public relations; management of nonprofit organizations; and monitoring, assessment, and amelioration of environmental problems\u2014to name only a few. Majors in the degree program include: human resource management, management, nonprofit management and leadership, law and public policy, public management and leadership, policy analysis, public financial management, and environmental management. Students who choose to continue with their education after earning an undergraduate degree frequently study law, planning, public affairs, environmental science, or business administration. There is a critical need for scientists who can incorporate their expertise into policies that address environmental concerns, such as global climate change, pollution of water and air, conservation of endangered species and habitats, urban sprawl, and human illnesses caused by environmental problems. To meet that need, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences developed the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) degree, a unique cooperative program between two leading schools at Indiana University. Designed as a rigorous interdisciplinary science curriculum, the degree prepares students either for direct entry into an environmental science career or for graduate study in the traditional sciences or environmental science. Both government and private organizations are seeking ways to maintain or improve the quality of health care in the United States. At the same time, there is an increasing need to control skyrocketing costs. The Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and Policy (B.S.H.M.P.) prepares students to meet those challenges. The major prepares students for health management careers by developing their organizational, analytical, managerial, and leadership skills. Graduates often pursue careers in the public, private, or nonprofit sector in areas such as public health, environmental health, health administration, epidemiology, or health policy and planning. B.S.H.M.P. students have gone on for post-baccalaureate training in diverse areas such as public health, health administration, public affairs, law, business administration, and environmental science and policy. Now more than ever, institutions in the arts need a well trained, dedicated cadre of administrators able to navigate minefields underlying financial pressures, organizational constraints, and shifts in competitive entertainment, as well as consumer interest. The Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) provides undergraduate students with the background and skills necessary to function in the management aspects of the arts industry. Graduates of this degree program are prepared to seek entry level careers in areas such as: development and donor relations, marketing, audience development and public relations, artistic direction and programming, financial management, volunteer coordination, arts education, public policy, and advocacy. The Bachelor of Arts in Environmental and Sustainability Studies addresses the interactions between humans and the environment and their connection with ecological,societal, and economic processes at local, regional, and global scales. Understanding these interactions is a core competency in today's world. The study of sustainability bridges the arts and humanities, social sciences, and the physical and life sciences. It complements traditional disciplines by offering an opportunity for education in coupled natural and human systems that encompasses study of the environment, society, economy, and the arts. The degree, awarded jointly by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, is administered by the Integrated Program in the Environment. Potential career areas include environmental education and communications, sustainability coordination or consulting in the private or public sector, green design, environmental law or public affairs, or further academic pursuits with graduate study. Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Environmental and Sustainability Studies Bachelor of Arts Major in Environmental and Sustainability Studies The Bachelor of Arts Major in Environmental Sustainable Studies, which is offered jointly by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, focuses on systems-level-interaction of the social and economic spheres with the natural environment, provides an introduction to the complex system scale challenges of sustainability as well as the tools needed to address problems that transcend solely social or environmental domains. Students pursuing this degree can expect to integrate experience in the humanities with the natural and social sciences. See the College of Arts and Sciences bulletin for more information about the major and concentration areas: http://bulletins.iu.edu/iub/college/2017-2018/departments/ env-sus-studies/ess-major.shtml.
