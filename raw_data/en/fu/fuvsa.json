Lincoln Blvd., Ste. 300 Oklahoma City, OK 73105 HealthChoiceOK.com THE HEALTHCHOICE PROVIDER NETWORK You can seek care from a network or non-network provider; however, the amount you are responsible for paying is greatly increased when you use a non-network provider for non- emergency services. With a statewide and multistate network of more than 24,000 physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals and facilities, the HealthChoice Provider Network is one of the largest in Oklahoma. Finding a HealthChoice network provider You can find a HealthChoice network provider by going to HealthChoiceOK.com . You can also contact Customer Care to find a network provider. A Customer Care member advocate can give you the names of network providers in your area. If you are unable to locate a HealthChoice network provider in your area, you can nominate a provider for participation by completing the online provider nomination form or contacting EGID Member Services. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. Importance of selecting a HealthChoice network provider Network providers are contracted with HealthChoice and have agreed to accept HealthChoice allowable amounts for the services and equipment they provide. Network providers have agreed not to bill you for charges greater than allowable amounts. You are still responsible for your plan's copays, deductibles, coinsurance and charges for non-covered services. 5 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022Non-network providers are not contracted with HealthChoice and have not agreed to accept allowable amounts. This means you are responsible for paying the difference between the amounts the provider bills and allowable amounts. This process, known as balance billing, can be a large amount of money out of your own pocket. Even after you reach your plan's out-of- pocket maximum, you are still responsible for all amounts above allowable amounts when you use non-network providers. HealthChoice Select Program HealthChoice Select is available to any HealthChoice health plan member and provides specified medical services at no cost to the member when Select services are performed on the same day at a Select facility . If you have one of the qualifying HealthChoice Select procedures done at a participating HealthChoice Select facility, there is no copay, deductible or coinsurance applied. Note: High Deductible Health Plan members must meet their annual deductible before they are eligible to have any costs waived (unless the service is considered preventive). However, since HealthChoice Select facilities accept one consolidated bundled payment for certain procedures at a reduced rate, HDHP members can still save by utilizing a Select facility for one of these procedures. In addition to offering these services at no cost to you, HealthChoice will also pay you a $100 incentive payment when you have a qualifying colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at a Select participating facility. Note: HealthChoice will pay High Deductible Health Plan members who have a qualifying preventive colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy done at a participating Select facility $100 even if your deductible hasn't been met. If HealthChoice is not the primary payer, the Select benefit does not apply. To find out what other procedures qualify under the HealthChoice Select Program and which network facilities throughout Oklahoma are participating for those procedures, go to HealthChoiceOK.com or contact Customer Care by phone. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. In addition, Care Guides are available through the HealthChoice benefits app to help guide you through the HealthChoice Select process and ensure that all members have a positive, beneficial experience. . 6 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022HEALTHCHOICE HIGH AND HIGH ALTERNATIVE PLANS Plan features If you use the HealthChoice medical or pharmacy provider networks, you are responsible for: Office visit copays.

This is in accordance with section 1867(e)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(e)(1)(A)). All related facility and professional emergency department claims and all ambulance transport claims are processed in accordance with your network benefits, regardless of network status. This includes your plan provisions for copays, deductible and coinsurance. You are still responsible for any charges for non-covered services. If you receive emergency services from a non-network provider, you should not be responsible for charges above the allowable amount if you are billed by the provider. (Balance billing for emergency services is prohibited by federal law.) There is a $200 emergency room copay for each emergency department visit under the High Option plans and the HDHP. The Basic Option plans do not require a $200 emergency room copay. This copay is waived if the patient is admitted or if death occurs prior to admission. Certification is required for the inpatient admission. Refer to Certification. If emergency treatment cannot be provided, and the patient is referred to another emergency room for treatment, the emergency room copay is waived on the emergency room that could not provide treatment. 25 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022PREVENTIVE SERVICES These are covered services provided for overall health maintenance \u2014 such as routine health/ wellness exams and tests, vaccinations, well-baby care and well-child care.

Non-network Non-network providers are not required to submit claims on your behalf. You can ask the provider to submit the claim on your behalf, but if they will not, you will have to file the claim. A member self-submission medical claim form is available by logging on to HealthChoiceOK. com or by contacting Customer Care. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. Reimbursement for non-network claims is usually paid to you; however, you can choose to assign benefits to be paid directly to your provider. When a valid assignment of benefits to the provider is submitted with your claim, payment is made to the provider. When there is no valid assignment of benefits, payment is made to you, and you are responsible for paying your provider. For HealthChoice to process a member self-submission claim, the following information is required. Member information: Name, Date of Birth, Member ID, and Address. Patient name. Billing CPT/HCPCS code(s). Diagnosis code(s). NPI number. Date(s) of service. Total billed amount. Your provider will need to provide you with the CPT/HCPCS code(s), diagnosis code(s) and the required provider information. Completed claim forms should be submitted to the address listed on the back of your HealthChoice ID card. For questions on how to complete or submit a member claim form, contact Customer Care. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. Claims filing deadline Claims must be submitted in accordance with the Plan policy. Claims for services outside the United States If you receive medical treatment, services, supplies or prescription drugs outside the United States, follow these claim procedures: Make arrangements to pay for the services or supplies. 40 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022 Have claims translated into English with U.S. dollar amounts before you file your claim. Convert charges to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates applicable for the date of service. Submit an itemized statement for reimbursement.

Box 99011 Lubbock, TX 79490-9011 Allowable amounts are paid in accordance with your plan's non-network benefits. You are responsible for amounts above the allowable amounts. Coordination of benefits You are required to annually verify if you or any of your covered dependents have other medical or pharmacy coverage. You should also notify us anytime you or your covered dependent(s) adds or drops other health insurance. You may complete your verification by registering at HealthChoiceOK.com or by calling Customer Care at 800-323-4314. You can also do this when completing the annual Tobacco-Free Attestation. Failure to verify other insurance coverage will result in denial of claims until verification is completed. This process establishes which insurance plan is primary when two plans must work together to pay claims for the same person. Coordinating benefits ensures that the two plans do not pay more than the total amount of the claim, thereby helping to reduce the cost of insurance premiums. If you have questions about how your pharmacy benefits will be af fected by coordination of benefits, contact the pharmacy benefit manager. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. Explanation of benefits Each time a claim is processed, Customer Care creates an explanation of benefits that explains how your benefits are applied. Your EOB includes: Amount allowed.

Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. Claims requiring additional information If your medical claim requires additional information for processing, your EOB identifies the specific information needed. In some instances, a letter is also sent that explains what information is required to complete claim processing. Your claim is closed until this information is received. Please be sure to include your member ID number and claim number when returning the requested information. Once the information is provided to Customer Care, your claim is automatically processed. You do not need to resubmit your claim. Disputed claims procedure If your claim is denied in whole or in part for any reason, either you or your authorized representative can request that the claim be reviewed by submitting a written request to the HealthChoice Appeals Unit at the address listed below within 180 days of your receipt of a denial.

If you believe your situation is urgent, follow the instructions above for filing an internal appeal and also call Customer Care to request a simultaneous external review. Your HealthChoice plan's internal appeals process includes two internal review levels. If you are not satisfied with the final internal review determination due to denial of payment, coverage or service requested, you may be able to ask for an independent, external review of our decision by either an independent review organization or a grievance panel. The entity that performs the external review depends on the nature of your appeal. When considering complaints by insured members, the three-member grievance panel shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether EGID has followed its statutes, rules, plan documents, policies and internal procedures.

Subrogation Subrogation is the process through which HealthChoice has the right to recover any benefit payments made to you or your dependents by a third party or an insurer because of an injury or illness caused by the third party. Third party means another person or organization. Subrogation applies when you are sick or injured as a result of the negligent act or omission of another person or party. If you or your covered dependents receive HealthChoice benefits and have a right to recover damages, the plan has the right to recover any benefits paid on your behalf. All payments from a third party, whether by lawsuit, settlement or otherwise, must be used to repay HealthChoice. The Make Whole and Common Fund Doctrines do not apply. Example: While in your vehicle, you are hit by another driver who is at fault. In the accident, you have injuries that require medical attention. HealthChoice processes your medical claims, and when the auto insurance claim is settled, the other driver's insurance (third party) or your uninsured/underinsured/med pay motorist policy repays HealthChoice the amounts it paid for your accident-related medical claims. If the third party or an insurer pays you or your dependent directly, you are responsible for repaying HealthChoice. If you are asked to provide information about the injury or accident to the HealthChoice subrogation administrator at the law firm of McAfee & Taft, any related claims are pended until you have supplied the necessary information. Failure to provide the required information in a timely manner may result in your claim being denied. Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. 43 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022GENERAL PROVISIONS Provider-patient relationship You can choose any provider or practitioner who is licensed or certified under the laws of the state in which they practice, and who is recognized by the plan . Each provider offering healthcare services and/or supplies is an independent contractor. Providers retain the provider- patient relationship with you and are solely responsible to you for any medical advice and treatment or subsequent liability resulting from that advice or treatment. Although a provider recommends or prescribes a service or supply, this does not necessarily mean it is covered by the plan. For information on the types of providers recognized by the plan, contact Customer Care. You can also search for a HealthChoice network provider at HealthChoiceOK.com . Intentional misrepresentation Coverage obtained by means of intentional misrepresentation of material fact is canceled retroactive to the effective date, and premiums you paid for coverage are refunded. Refunded premiums are reduced by any claims paid by HealthChoice. Confirmation statements and corrections to benefits elections When a change is made to your coverage, you are mailed a confirmation statement, which lists your coverage and the effective date and premium amount for your coverage. It is provided so you can review changes and identify errors as soon as possible. If you find errors to your benefits elections, you should submit corrections within 60 days. Current employees must submit corrections to their insurance/benefits coordinator , and former employees must submit corrections directly to EGID. Corrections reported after 60 days are effective the first of the month following notification. Member Audit Program Despite your provider's best efforts, the complexity of arranging for your care and treatment may result in inaccurate billing, so it is important to check your bill carefully.

Options for current employees called to active military service Under USERRA, coverage can be continued for up to 24 months. USERRA provides certain rights and protections for all employees called to serve our nation. All branches of the military, all military reserve units and all National Guard units come under USERRA. In addition to health care provided by the military, you have the following four choices regarding your current coverage: Retain all coverage. Your current employer is responsible for collecting and forwarding all premiums to EGID. Discontinue member coverage but retain dependent coverage. This is the COBRA option and dependents are billed directly at 102% of premiums, the COBRA rate, for health, dental and/or vision coverage. Under COBRA rules, life insurance cannot be retained. 51 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022 Discontinue all coverage except life insurance. You are billed directly. Discontinue all member and dependent coverage. Each month, you must pay the full premium for the coverage you selected. Failure to pay premiums timely can result in the termination of coverage at the end of the month for which the last full premium was received. There is no penalty for renewing coverage upon discharge from active duty if coverage is elected within 30 days of your return to the same employment. Regardless of whether you receive written or verbal military orders, EGID staff and/or your insurance/ benefits coordinator will assist you in making any benefits arrangements. If you are a member of a military reserve unit or the National Guard and anticipate being called to active service, notify your insurance/benefits coordinator at work. Leave without pay - current employees If you are on approved leave without pay through your employer, you can continue coverage for up to 24 months from the day you begin leave without pay status. You must make timely premium payments in full each month to your insurance/benefits coordinator . If your coverage terminates for failure to pay premiums on time, you can re-enroll upon returning to work. If you take leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, please make premium payment arrangements with your employer before you take leave. Special rules for those eligible for Medicare If you are a current employee and you or your covered dependents become eligible for Medicare, either as a result of age or because of disability, your employer's group plan remains primary and Medicare is your secondary coverage. You can accept or reject coverage under your employer's group health plan. If you reject your employer's plan, Medicare becomes the primary payer for Medicare-covered health services. Additionally, your employer cannot provide you with a plan that pays supplemental benefits for Medicare-covered services or subsidize such coverage. Upon termination of employment, Medicare coverage becomes your primary insurance carrier. If you are a former employee and you or your covered dependent is under age 65 and eligible for Medicare , you must notify EGID and provide the Medicare number as it appears on the beneficiary's Medicare Health Insurance card. Medicare supplement coverage is effective the date you become eligible for Medicare, or the first day of the month following notice to EGID, whichever is later. Late notice does not allow for a refund of excess premiums paid. For further information regarding Medicare enrollment, call Social Security toll-free at 800- 772-1213.

This means the prescription drug coverage offered through HealthChoice is at least as good as the standard Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and meets the benefits guidelines set by Medicare. If you or your spouse leave the employment that allows you to participate in HealthChoice coverage, you have the option to continue coverage through the HealthChoice Medicare supplement plans, which includes either Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage or creditable prescription drug coverage. 53 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022CONTINUING COVERAGE AFTER LEAVING EMPLOYMENT If you leave employment, you and/or your eligible dependents may be able to begin or continue coverage through one of the following options: Vesting or retirement rights through a state-funded retirement system established by the State of Oklahoma.

If you were an employee of an education entity other than a common school (e.g., higher education, charter school, etc.), you can continue coverage through the plan as long as the education entity from which you retired or vested continues to participate in the plan. If your 54 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022former employer terminates coverage with the plan, you must follow your former employer to its new insurance carrier. Note: You cannot reinstate coverage that you discontinue or allow to lapse unless you return to work as an employee of a participating employer.

If your employer discontinues participation with EGID, some or all of the employer's retirees and their dependents (depending on the type of employer) must follow the employer to its new insurance carrier. This is true regardless of the amount of time you were employed with any participating employer. If you retire and then return to work for another employer and enroll in benefits through your new employer, in most instances your benefits are tied to your new employer.

Refer to HealthChoice Plan Contact Information. 66 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022PLAN DEFINITIONS ACA Affordable Care Act. Accidental injury Bodily injury sustained as the direct result of an accident, independent of any other cause, which occurs while insurance coverage is in force. Allowable amount HealthChoice pays benefits based on set amounts known as allowable amounts. This the maximum amount HealthChoice will consider for payment for a covered service or supply, regardless of the amounts billed by a provider. A network provider will have agreed to accept the allowable amount as payment in full for the services rendered. A network provider cannot bill you for amounts above the allowable amounts. If you use a non-network provider that charges more than the plan's allowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. This is referred to as balance billing. Example: A provider may charge $150 for a service. HealthChoice's allowed amount is $90. A network provider will accept the $90 in full as payment for the service. HealthChoice will pay up to the $90, depending on any copay or deductible you may owe. A network provider will write off the remaining $60 and you cannot be billed for that amount. If you use a non-network provider, then you are responsible for everything that HealthChoice does not pay, up to the full charge of $150, if you are billed by the provider. Alternative plans (High and Basic) The HealthChoice Alternative plans are designed for members and their dependents who do not or cannot complete a tobacco-free attestation when required during the annual Option Period. The alternative plans are identical to the regular plans in benefits and exclusions but many differ in deductibles, first-dollar payments and maximum out-of-pocket amounts. Balance billing When a provider bills you for the difference between the amount they charge and the amount HealthChoice pays. HealthChoice network providers cannot balance bill members, but non- network providers can. Certification A review process used to determine if services are medically necessary according to HealthChoice guidelines. Certification is performed by Customer Care. 67 High, High Alternative, Basic and Basic Alternative Plans and High Deductible Health Plan HandbookPlan Year 2022Coinsurance Coinsurance is a percentage of a medical charge that you pay, with the rest paid by your health insurance plan, after your deductible has been met. Example: Your plan has coinsurance of 20% and you have met your deductible. If the plan's allowed amount for an office visit is $100, you pay 20% of $100, or $20. Your insurance covers the other 80%, or $80. Copays This is a fixed amount you pay for certain covered services. Copays usually apply before you meet your deductible, but they do not count towards meeting your deductible. Copays are applied towards meeting your out-of-pocket maximum. Note: There are no network copays in the Basic plans, and your deductible must be met before copays apply in the HDHP. Cosmetic procedure A procedure that primarily serves to improve appearance. Deductible This is the initial total you must pay of allowable amounts for network and/or non-network covered services before any benefit is paid by the plan. This includes, but is not limited to, amounts you pay for lab work, X-rays, surgical procedures, hospital admissions, etc. Copays do not count toward the individual or family deductible. Expenses for non-covered services and any expense you pay over the allowable amount for non-network services do not count toward your deductible. Once you meet your deductible, you will share the cost of covered services with HealthChoice by paying coinsurance. Note : For the HDHP, the cost of prescriptions and office visits are included in the deductible. For Basic plans, the deductible applies after first-dollar coverage. Example: Your plan has a deductible of $1,000, and you have $2,500 in covered medical charges. You pay the first $1,000 of the allowed amount in covered charges to meet your deductible, and then you share the cost of covered services with HealthChoice by paying coinsurance.
