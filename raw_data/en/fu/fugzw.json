We found significant variation in the reported rat es of influenza detection in individuals with acute asthma exacerbations making it unclear to what degree influenza causes exacerbations of underlying asthma. The strongest evidence of an association was seen in studies of children. Countries in the Europe an Union currently recommend influenza vaccination of adults with asthma; however, coverage varied between regions. Coverage was lower among children with asthma. Limited data suggest that good seroprotection and seroconversion can be achieved in both children and adults with asthma and that vaccination confers a degree of protection against influenza illness and asthma related morbidity to children with asthma .

Introduction Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by intermittent airflow obstruction and increased reactivity to bronch oconstrictive triggers . Presently, an estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma (1). In Europe, more than 30 million people are affected , with six million suffering severe symptoms and 1.5 million life- threatening attacks (2). Asthma onset and acute asthma exacerbations () have been strongly associated with r espiratory viral and (to a lesser extent ) bacterial infections (3-11) Influenza virus es cause respiratory infection s, typically during winter months. Most signif icant disease is caused by influenza A and B, which may escape immune pressure by undergo ing antigenic drift and recombination; such genetic changes lead to new subtypes , which can cause epidemic or pandemic outbreaks (12, 13) . Each year, influenza virus infection affects 5 to 20% of the global population (14), while annual vaccination greatly contributes to reduce related morbidity and mortality (15). Upon vaccination, coordinated activity of innate and adaptive immune responses leads to generation of short - and long - lived antibody producing plasma cells and memory B cells. The importance of influenza as a cause of serious illness and AAE is increasingly appreciated (16, 17) . Despite uncertainties about their effectiveness, infl uenza vaccines are widely recommended for those with asthma (18). To address uncertainties over the prevention and management of influenza in patients with asthma, we performed a s coping review and discuss the current knowledge of the burden imposed by influenza on patients with asthma, current vaccine recommendations and vaccination coverage in various regions, the evidence regarding immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness and safety of influenza vaccines, and the possible benefits of antiviral drugs in patients with asthma. We conclude by identifying knowledge gaps and future research needs in relation to influenza in asthma patients. 1. Methods We systematically searched relevan t published, unpublished and in -progress original research and systematic reviews that were pertinent to the subject matter of this EAACI Task Force. This involved searching databases of peer -revie wed published literature (Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL, MEDLINE and Google Scholar) and research in progress (i.e. http://www.controlled -trials.com/ and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ) for the period 2000 -2015. In addition, we wrote to a panel of international experts in an att empt to identi fy additional unpublished or in -progress work. There were no restrictions on language of publication . We were par ticularly interested in randomiz ed controlled trials (RCTs) on questions relating to the immunogenicity, efficacy and/or effectiveness of influenza vaccine among asthmatics , and epidemiological studies relating to the influenza incidence/prevalence and public health burden and safety of influenza vaccine. Systematic reviews with or without meta -analysis were of interest if they focused on any of the questions of interest. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. The searches (see Appendix 1) were undertaken and allocated to relevant sub -group leads depending on the focus of the inquiry. Where possible, stud ies reported in languages other than English were translated. Within subgroups, two reviewers independently reviewed the titles and if necessary abstracts of potentially eligible studies to decide on eligibility; disagreements on study eligibility were res olved through discussion among the reviewers. Studies were then - in the specific context of asthma/allergy - categorized by topic area, namely: i) Global burden of influenza; ii) Influenza vaccination recommendations and coverage; iii) Immunogenicity of i nfluenza vaccines; iv) Efficacy of influenza vaccine s; v) Effectivenes s of influenza vaccines ; vi). Safety of influenza vaccines; and vii). Antiviral treatments against influenza. Reports were then scrutinized and interpreted by experts on the subject matt er. Any disagreements on issues to do with interpretation were resolved through discussion. The searches were first conducted in 2014 and then updated in October 2015. The key characteristics and findings of all eligible studies were summarized in data tables, and the findings narratively synthesized. These are presented by topic in Table 1. 2. Global burden of influenza in patients with asthma 2a. Influenza -attributable health care utilization in asthma patients Asthma is the most common underlying disease in patients with influenza admitted to healthcare facilities, both in adults (19-33) (7.6-46% (34, 35) ) and children (26, 36 -47) (8.3- 42% (48, 49)). Chil dren with asthma accounted for a significantly larger proportion of those hospitalized with p andemic H1N1 than with seasonal influenza (24, 50 -53). Asthma was also the most common comorbidity among pregnant women hospitalized with H1N1 infection, with a prevalence ranging from 8 -33% (54-57). Asthma represented a risk factor for hospitalization during influenza seasons in the general population (58), with an OR of 2.6 (95% CI 1.6 -4.0) in two Canadian studies (59, 60) , and a relative risk ( RR) of 4.47 (95% CI 1.49 -13.39) in Israel (61). The same applied to children (47, 62, 63) , where asthma confe rred a 4-fold risk of hospitalization (USA (64), Germany (41), and Argentina (65)), with a 21 -fold risk observed in South Korea (66). Interestingly, influenza -related hospitalization costs in children with asthma may be lower than in children with other chronic conditions , and were very close to costs in children without comorbidity (67). Asthma patients seem ed to have a higher risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or to have a more severe disease course when hospitalized for influenza (26, 33, 43, 45, 50, 66, 68 -70), with an OR of 4.92 (95% CI 1.38 -17.33 ) in Argentinian children (69) and a RR of 15.20 (95% CI 1.16 -199.63) in Chin a >15 years of age (71). Severe disease wa s especially common in those developing pneumonia (33), but did not seem to be related to the severity of underlying asthma (51). In a multivariate analysis of H 1N1 pediatric patients, asthma wa s associated with increased mortality in ICU -admitted children and adolescents (OR 1.34, p=0.05) (68). However, a retrospective analysis performed in the UK on 1 ,520 patients showed that patients with asthma hospitalized because of influenza A infection we re less likely to require ICU or die compared with those without a sthma, with a n OR of 0.51 (95%CI 0.36 -0.72) for severe outcome (28). Two o ther studies confirm ed this finding (25, 29), which may be even more pronounced in those with pre-admission inhaled (OR 0.34 ; 95% CI 0.18 -0.66) or (OR 0.36 95% CI 0.18 -0.72) for Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

Influenza -induc ed acute asthma exacerbations Influenza , like other respiratory viral infection s, can lead to AAE and was found to account for 32.0% (72) and 9.8% (73) of AAEs in two studies of ad ults with asthma outpatient s. However, the method used to identify the presence of influenza in AAE episodes largely determines the outcome. A direct comparison of molecular (PCR), serological , and immunofluorescent (IFA) detection in the same cohort of a dults with a sthma found influen za rates of 24.0%, 18 .3%, and 2 .0% respectively in AAEs (74). Thus, the validity of studies that applied conventional influenza identification techniques such as cytopathic effect in cell culture followed by i ndirect immunofluoresence to confirm viral presence (75) is questionable . Among hospitalized adult s with asthma patients, rates of influenza -induced AAE were reported at 10.0% (76), 19.0% (77), 20.7% (78), and as high as 37.9% (73). Available data on influenza -associated AAE among chil dren vary considerably. For outpatient visits, three studies did not detect any influenza -positive samples (75, 79, 80) , while several groups identified influenza infection as the cause of AAE, with most report ing rates of influenza -positive samples between 2 .4% and 15.5% (63, 81 -84). A recent study showed an accentuated propensity for loss of asthma control when children were infected with pH1N1 (38%) compared with other common respiratory virus infections (85). Among children with asthma hospit alized for severe AAE, three studies reported an influenza - associated burden of 2.6% (82), 3.4% (86) and 3 .7% (63) of AAEs. In summary, t here were significant inter - and intra -group variation s in the reported influenza -induced AAE burden among children and adults with asthma , with fewer studies on adults. Various factors compromise the interpretation of the available data. First, the use of differe nt diagnostic methods for influenza detection may sig nificantly influence the study outcome. The advent of molecular techniques and their universal use may solve this issue. Second, the absence of harmonized criteria for appropriate inclusion of patients a nd the lack of a standardized definition and diagnosis of influenza infection disallow direct comparison of results and complicate the identification of relevant studies. Third, the lack of large cohorts of patients with asthma studied for influenza induce d AAE, raises questions about the validity of the currently available findings. Furthermore, seasonal rather than perennial influenza testing and selective testing only in hospitalized AAE cases could lead to inaccurate estimation of the actual contribution of influenza to AAEs . 3. Current influenza vaccine recommendations and coverage for people with asthma In common with most economically -developed nations (Fig. 1), all 28 countries of the European Union currently recommend influ enza vaccination of people with chronic respiratory disease asthma (87-89). Trivalent (TIV) and vaccines are available , with TIV the most widely used throughout the EU. An intradermal vaccine is also available and more recently a quadrivalent live attenuated intranasal vaccine (LAIV) was approved for use in the UK in children aged 2 -18 years (88, 90) . Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. However, vaccine uptake for clinical risk groups varied from 31% in Portugal to 82% in Northern Ireland (88, 91) , as did influenza vaccination coverage of adults with asthma , with 30-50% in Spai n (92-95) and 40% in the UK (96). Self -reported uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine amongst adults with asthma in the US v aried from 54% in the community to 71% in secondary care (97). Children with asthma had significantly lower coverage rates of approximately 18 -20% in Spain (93, 98) , 15% in France (99) and 2. 5-20% in Italy , across multiple season s (91). In comparison, in the USA vaccination coverage r eached around 50% in adults and childre n (100) . To address the question of such historically low vaccination rates amongst those with asthma, many studies employed cross -sectional surveys to analyse the socio -demographic variables that predict vaccine uptake. The strongest factors associated with higher vaccin e coverage, we re older age , recent contact with healthcare providers, non -smoking status, presence of co -morbidities, m ore severe asthma , and (surprisingly) lower household income (92-95, 100-106), although regarding there are conflicting reports for the latter (98). Variables that we re associated with lower vaccination uptake include d younger age groups (96, 100, 107, 108) , belonging to certain ethnic groups (102, 105, 108) and lack of awareness about the vaccine (91, 99, 100). A more detailed exploration assessing h ealth attitudes suggested that the mis belief that the vaccination wa s not necessary or could actually cause influenza or side effects was predictive of non -adherenc e (97, 109 -112) and contributed to lower vaccination coverage (96, 107, 108) . Reports of low effectiveness probably also contribute d to poor uptak e (18, 113, 114) . Healthcare wor ker endorsement of vaccination wa s highly predictive of adherence (109, 110, 112) . A survey of 1225 US allergis ts suggested that 85% of these offered influenza vaccinations to adults and childre n. Younger allergists (<45 years) we re more likely to offer vaccination, especially to childre n (115) . Pediatricians we re more likely than family physicians to routinely recommend influenza vaccination to children with asthma (adjust ed OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.68 -7.22), with decisions also being made depending on asthma phenotype (i.e. intermittent vs. persistent) (116) . The success of vaccination programmes was affected by complex factors such as the nature of healthcare provision (e.g. free care or insurance based), education levels , and cultural acceptance of the vaccine. Therefore, national health surveys with information on vaccination status linked with medical and socio -demographic details , (such as that of Spain with data spanning more than two decades (92-95, 117) can aid in assessing the impact of influenza vaccination, at population level. Simple interven tions such as allowing for year -round scheduling of appointments for vaccination can be effective (118) . Nevertheless, it is likely that only major policy shifts will lead to significantly higher vaccination rates , due to more clear and consistent messaging about the importance and acceptability of influenza vaccination to patients and healthcare workers alike. This is illustrated by t he increase in influenza vaccination uptake among children with asthma from 36% (2005 -2006) to 50% (2010 -2011) after the US Centre for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) advised vaccinating all children, regardless of risk (100) . With its favourable safety and cost -benefit profile (18, 119, 120) there is a need for health campaigns to raise awareness amongst the public and clinicians of the benefits of influenza vaccination and to improve implementation of guidelines.

Immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in asthma There is uncertainty about the level of protection that influenza vaccines afford in people with asthma. Influenza vaccine immunogenicity, a prerequisite for protection, is usually assessed by haemagglutinin inhibition assay (HI) measuring seroprotection rate ( percentage of subjects with antibody titres 1:40), seroconversion rate (percentage of subjects with 4 -fold increase in antibody titre), antibody geometric mean titre GMT ratio (GMT post vaccination/ GMT pre -vaccination). We identified limited data on influenza vaccine immunogenicity in asthm a. Only one study of TIV in children aged 0.5-3 year s compared healthy controls to recurrent wheezers. It found good and similar seroconversion and seroprotection rates to all three vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) in both groups (after 1 month), with higher pre -and post -vaccination GMTs in children with wheeze, but a higher GMT ratio in healthy controls (121) . In children with asthma, TIV and a virosomal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine induced goo d seroprotection and seroconversion at 1 month in both pre -school and school -age children, with some reduction in GMTs by 6 months (122, 123) . A 2009 H1N1 vaccine given to adolescents and adults induced equally good seroprotection if 15 \u00b5g or 30 \u00b5g vaccine were given in those with mild -to-moderate asthma. In contrast, in severe asthma the higher dose resulted in better seroprotection, which in e lderly severe asthma patients ( 60 years) was only achieved with the high 30 \u00b5g dose (124) . In the latter group and in young children with recurrent wheeze , corticoster oid treatment or corticosteroid dose did not influence influenza vaccine immunogenicity (121, 124) . 5. Efficacy of influenza vaccine s in asthma Data on the efficacy of influenza vaccination in asthma are limited, with only two randomiz ed studies addressing the efficacy of TIV in patients with stable asthma. One study, conducte d in Turkey, included 128 adults with asthma who received either TIV or no vaccination (125) . No significant difference in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or AAE rate was found between vaccinated and non -vaccinated participants ; however, this study had significant limitations (see T able 1). In a larger randomized , double -blind, placebo - controlled trial from the Netherlands (81) in 6-18 year -old children with asthma , TIV had no significant effect on the number, severity, or duration of AAEs caused by confirmed influenza infection, or on the respiratory symptoms recorded ; however, it moderately improved quality of life during the weeks of influenza -positive illness (126) . In contrast, a conference abstract (127) reported significantly lower AAE rates in children < 5 years with asthma following TIV (13%) compared with placebo (53%). For LAIV, we found no efficacy data in asthma compared to non -vaccination. A large Europea n multi -center, randomiz ed, cold -adapted LAIV to intramuscular TIV in children and adolescents aged 6 -17 yea rs with asthma , and reported a 34.7% reduction in culture -conrmed influenza illness after LAIV (128) . A re -analysis of efficacy data from two randomiz ed, multinational trials (129, 130) comparing LAIV to TIV, demonstrated that 2 -5 year old children with mild -to-moderate asthma or prior wheezing, receiving LAIV had fewer cases of culture -confirmed influenza illness than TIV recipients (131) .

Effectiveness of influenza vaccination in asthma While efficacy studies reflect a treatment's performance in tightly controlled clinical trials, effectiveness studies reflect how well a treatment works in practice and are m ore representative of real life . Influenza vaccination may be less effective than expected due to differe nces between the characteristics of patients vaccinated in the general population and those recruited into efficacy trials. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine may not contain the prevalent virus strain , and vaccine coverage may be suboptimal. There are limited data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma or high -risk popu lations that included asthma. Six studies assessed the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine s, while one other studied the H1N1 pandemic vaccine (132) . In children , two retrospective cohort studies found that influenza vaccination was associated with a reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations (133) and fewer acute respiratory problems (only in those less than 6 years of age) (134) . A survey found that vaccination in children with asthma was associated with less use of rescue prednisolone (135) , while a nested case -control study suggested that influenza vaccination was associated with fewer acute general practice visits for respiratory problems in children with long -term conditions (136) . However, another case -control study suggested that vaccination was associated with an increased risk of unscheduled attendance for asthma care (137) . In this study, the cases and controls were poorly balanced in terms of ethnicity and likelihood of vaccination in previous years. Although an adjusted analysis wa s undertaken, this may not have taken into account all the differences between the groups. Only one stud y focused on adults with asthma (132) . In this study, the H1N1 influenza vaccine was fo und to be protective against influenza in those aged under 61 years , but not in older patients. Also, i t did not protect against AAE. Two other st udies enrolled adults with long-term (136) or high -risk conditions (138) ; the first demonstrated a reduction in gen eral practice visits, hospitaliz ation and deaths from respiratory problems , while the second demonstrated a protective effect against influenza and influenza rela ted hospitaliz ation. Asthma was not analysed separately in these studies and it is thus not clear if influenza vaccination was beneficial for people with asthma. A recent systematic review reports a 59 -78% reduction in asthma attacks leading to emergency visits and/or hospitalizations after influenza vaccination and a vaccine effect iveness of 45% (95% CI 31 to 56) for laboratory -confirmed influenza in people with asthma based on a metanalys is of two test -negative design case -control studies (139) . 7. Safety of influenza vaccine s in asthma Large retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the safety of influenza vaccines in children and adults with asthma, for both TIV and LAIV (131, 140 -142). In these studies , vaccinated patients did not have more frequent asthma exacerbations than unvaccinated patients, and no other adverse event was more common in asthmatics. A study of adult asthma patients who reported bronchospasm after influenza vaccination, indicated that these symptoms were not related to vaccine hypersensitivity (143) . A common concern is the safety of egg -derived influenza vaccines in patients with egg - allergy , a frequent co -morbidity in children with asthma . The last case of anaphylaxis after influenza vaccination occurred more than 25 years ago at a time when the egg c ontent of Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. vaccines was much higher. The ovalbumin content of most curren t vaccines is less than 1.2 g/mL, and an egg -free influenza vaccine is also available. Several studies demonstrate d that influenza vaccines containing low levels of egg protein (1.2 mg/mL ) were safe even in egg-allergic patients (143-149). This also seemed to be true in egg -allergic p atients with associated asthma . The recent SNIFFLE stud ies of LAIV in egg allergic children, including 634 children with asthma/recurrent wheeze (79.7% on daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment), found no immediate systemic allergic reactions (150, 151) . For 6.6% of children with asthma/recurrent wheeze, the parents reported wheeze within 72 hours of LAIV, but most wheeze episodes only required routine treatmen t; there was no hospitaliz ation and no increase in respiratory symptoms in the four week s after LAIV. Based on the robust evidence that influenza vaccines are safe in asthma patients with and without egg allergy, British immunization guidelines (152) now recommend administration of LAIV in the community to children from 2 years of age , including those with asthma, irrespective of egg allergy, unless they have severe or acutely exacerbated asthma . US and Canadian guidelines remain more conservative and still suggest that vaccines containing egg proteins ( e.g. LAIV) should not be used i n children with egg allergy and/or asthma (153- 155). 8. Antiviral treatment against influenza in patients with asthma For asthma patients with suspected influenza infection, treatment with antiviral medication as early as possible, prior to laboratory confirmation of influenza, is currently recommended (156-160). Since amantadine and rimanta dine are limited by drug resistance , they have been replaced by neuraminidase inhibitors (NI). The currently marketed NI s are zanamivir and oseltamivir. However, post -marketing surveillance has revealed bronchospasm and worsening of lung function in a few cases when asthma patients were treated with zanamivir inhalation (161) . Therefore, the manufacturer does now not recommend zanamivir for patients with chronic respiratory disease , including asthma (157, 158) . Oseltamivir was not associated with any significant res piratory adverse effects and is reco mmended for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza in children and adults with high-risk chronic conditions , including asthma (162-164). However, large -scale telephone surveys in the USA show ed that having as thma, in contras t to diabetes, wa s not associated with increased rates of antiviral treatment of influenza cases (165) . Data on the efficacy of NI in asthma patients (162, 166 -168) are limited . A benefit of oseltamivir treatment was found in children in a n RCT that showed significant ly improved pulmonary function and fewer AAEs (168) . A meta -analysis, based on a single RCT, reported improved FEV1 after oral oseltamivir given to children with asthma and influenza infection, but no effects on peak flow or AAEs (169) . Two recent systematic review s found that oseltamivir relieved influenza symptoms in otherwise healthy children , but had no effect on children with asthma who have influenza -like illness (170, 171) , a finding th at is currently controversial . As h igh rate s of resistance limit the effectiveness of the currently available antiviral drugs , new NI (laninamivir, peramivir) and an RNA -depen dent RNA polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir) are currently undergoing clinical trials (172) . Laninamivir show ed similar efficacy and safety to oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in asthma patients (173) . Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

Conclusions We observed significant variation in the reported rates of influenza detection among AAE episodes in both children and adults, with high er rates observed in the latter age group. This may be attributed to major differences in inclusion criteria, disease definitions, virus detection methodology, small population sizes and the limited number of available studies. Therefore, it is presently unclear to what degree influenza causes ex acerbation of underlying asthma. All European Union countries currently recommend influenza vaccination of people with asthma, with TIV being the most widely used vaccine . Nonetheless, vaccination coverage varies between regions, and is significantly lower among children with asthma . Several factors and misbeliefs have been shown to predict non -adherence to influenza vaccination , while healthcare worker endorsement highly promotes vaccination. Major policy shifts a nd health campaigns may help in raising awareness and improve guideline implementation. The limited immunogenicity data suggest that good seroprotection and seroconversion can be achieved in children and adults with asthma. However, higher vaccine doses may be required in elderly patients . Available studies suggest increased efficacy of LAIV in reducing influenza illness in children/adolescents with asthma compared to TIV, but do not provide evidence of efficacy of TIV in reducing influenza illness in ast hmatics concurring with a recent systematic review (18). There are some limited data to suggest that influ enza vaccination reduces asthma -related morbidity in children in real -life settings , as has been concluded in another recent systematic review (139) . The only data to suggest tha t vaccination may have a beneficial impact in adults with asthma are from studies of patients with lon g-term or high -risk conditions, not just asthma. The eff ectiveness outcomes of these studies are difficult to interpret due to lack of an agreed definition for asthma and/or influenza, and insufficient information on the type of vaccination used. Lack of randomization is also a limitation, as differences in the characteristics of those wh o do and do not receive the vaccine, such as disease severity and socioeconomic status, may independently impact on the likelihood of asthm a morbidity, and analyses may not control for all these differences. Despite these limitations, population - based effe ctiveness studies are the only way to assess th e impact of vaccination in real -life healthcare settings. Inactivated influenza vaccines appear to be safe for people with asthma , and, provided they have lo w egg protein content (1.2 g/mL ), also for those with egg allergy. LAIV is also safe in asthma and egg allergy with the exception of severe or acutely exacerbated asthma , where LAIV cannot be given. Oseltamivir is the NI that is currently used in asthma. Although it has moderate ly benefic ial effects on influenza ill ness in healthy people, t here are insufficient data to determine its efficacy and effe ctiveness in people with asthma . However, novel NIs are currently in development. 10. Recommendations and future needs People with asthma are at high risk of more severe forms of influenza, with increased hospitalization and adm ission at healthcare facilities, therefore: Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Education campaigns for both the general population and hea lthcare providers are needed to promote an increase in annual influenza vaccination, early case recognition and consideration of ea rly empirical antiviral therapy , and to reduc e influenza -attributable healthcare utilization among asthmatics. Large cohort and case control studies using standardized definitions (for A AE), sensitive influenza detection methods , such as PCR , and comprehensive assessment of respiratory pathogens are necessary in both children and adults with asthma. There is a need to develop more internationally co -ordinated registries , e.g. for Europe, that accurately collate vaccination status along with medical and socio -demographic details to assess the impact of public health interventions over time. Multiple sources of data must be used to record vaccination status (e.g. self -reported as well as medical notes, vaccination card or billing data). Targeted vaccination of children and at -risk groups is needed. Further studies of influenza vaccine immunogenicity , comparing healthy and asthmatic populations, are required to determine i f people with asthma have normal influenza vaccine responses or if they require influenza vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity. The discovery and development of improved immune correlates of protection against influenza will enable more meaningful testing of vaccine immunogenicity. In view of the uncertainty around the degree of protection that influenza vaccination affords in people of all ages with asthma, further efficacy data need to be collected in this population. Data should be stratified by age an d asthma severity, using adequately powered, randomised, placebo -controlled trials that compare both TIV and LAIV to non - vaccinated controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma, but mu st be designed to minimize any risk of bias. Safety data in asthma with and without egg allergy are required for new influenza vaccines, and, depending on egg protein content, for new LAIV batches. There is a need to collect more safety data on zanamivir in patients with chronic respiratory disease, and efficacy data on oseltamivir in children with asthma .

Lin et al. 2006 (162) China 2002 -2003 Randomized, open -label, controlled trial Oseltamivir 7 5 mg twice daily for 5 days (oseltamivir group), or symptomatic treatment (control group) within 48 h after symptom onset Duration and severity of illness in influenza - infected patients, incidence of complications, antibiotic use, hospitalization and total medical cost. Oseltamivir is effective and well tol erated in high -risk patients with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases. It can reduce the duration and severity of influenza symptoms and decrease the incidence of secondary complications and antibiotic use, without increasing the total medical cost. 118 Chinese patients (mean age 48.1 years) with chronic respiratory diseases (chronic bronchitis, obstructive emphysema, bronchial asthma or bronchiectasis) or chronic cardiac disease. Only 8 patients with bronchial asthma. Cass et al. 2000 (166) UK 2000 Double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled, two way cross -over study, 7 day wash out period. 10 mg zanamivir as a dry powder (265 mg) or a placebo, twice daily on day 1 and then four times daily from day 2 to day 14. Safety of Zanamivir in asthmatics. Zanamivir inhaled as a dry powder d oes not significantly affect the pulmonary function and airway responsiveness of subjects with mild/moderate asthma and therefore its use in such patients/subjects is not precluded. 13 subjects, aged 19-49 years, with asthma.

Jefferson et al. 2014 (170) Systematic review NA Potential benefit and harm of oseltamivir by reviewing all clinical study reports (or similar document when no clinical study report exists) of randomized placebo controlled trials and regulatory comments. Ozeltamivir had no effect in children with asthma, but there was an effect in otherwise healthy children. Children and adults who either were healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension) but excluding people with immune suppression. Jefferson et al. 2014 (171) Cochrane review NA Potential benefit and harm of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports of published and unpublished randomized, placebo -controlled trials and regulatory comments. For th e treatment of adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% CI 8.4 -25.1, p<0.0001). This represents a reduction in the time to first alleviation of symptoms from 7 to 6.3 days. There was no effect in asthmatic ch ildren, but in otherwise healthy children there was a reduction by 29 hours (95% CI 12 -47 hours, p=0.001). All age groups. 53 trials in Stage 1 and 46 in Stage 2 (formal analysis), including 20 oseltamivir (9623 participants) and 26 zanamivir trials (14,6 28 participants).
