In 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted Pfizer's ABRYSVO\u00ae marketing authorization application [EMEA-002795-PIP01-20](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/paediatric-investigation-plans/emea-002795-pip01-20) under accelerated assessment for older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. On [August 24, 2023](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/european-commission-approves-pfizers-abrysvotm-help-protect), the EMA and [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_23_4261) issued approval. In February 2023, [Pfizer Japan](https://www.jpma.or.jp/english/about/member/p050001.html) announced an application filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare for RSVPreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, [Pfizer Canada](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/pfizer-canada-initiates-submission-to-health-canada-for-its-bivalent-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-vaccine-887097508.html) announced that Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. ABRYSVO Safety Information Pfizer [reported](https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=19589) in August 2023 that ABRYSVO's potential risks include preterm birth. In clinical trials where ABRYSVO was compared to placebo, infants born to pregnant individuals experienced [low birth weight](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/us-fda-approves-abrysvotm-pfizers-vaccine-prevention-0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CABRYSVO's%20approval%20as%20the%20first,and%20Chief%20Scientific%20Officer%2C%20Vaccine) (5.1% ABRYSVO versus 6.7% placebo. In addition, although not commonly reported, a dangerous hypertensive disorder known as [pre-eclampsia occurred in 1.8%](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-pregnant-individuals-prevent-rsv-infants) of pregnant individuals who received Abrysvo compared to 1.4% of pregnant individuals who received a placebo. To avoid the potential risk of preterm birth using ABRYSVO before 32 weeks of gestation, administer ABRYSVO as indicated in pregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks of gestational age. ABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of its components. Fainting can happen after injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO. Precautions should be taken to avoid falling and injury due to fainting. Adults with weakened immune systems, including those receiving medicines that suppress the immune system, may have a reduced immune response to ABRYSVO. In adults 60 years of age and older, the most common side effects (10%) were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. The FDA requires Pfizer to conduct postmarketing studies to assess the signal of serious risk of preterm birth and to assess hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia. ABRYSVO Dosage For intramuscular use only and, administer as a [single](https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=19589) approximately 0.5 mL dose. ABRYSVO Coadministered With Influenza Vaccines Pfizer [reported](https://s28.q4cdn.com/781576035/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Q1-2023-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf) on May 2, 2023, positive top-line results from the Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of its RSV bivalent vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF, coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in adults 65 years and older. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and RSV groups. Pfizer's [Briefing Document,](https://www.fda.gov/media/165625/download) presented on February 28, 2023, offered limited insights into the side effects or effectiveness of ABRYSVO when coadministered with influenza vaccines in [Older Adults](https://www.fda.gov/media/165649/download). ABRYSVO Pregnancy In a phase [2b clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04032093), we randomly assigned pregnant women at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation to receive either 120 or 240 g of RSVpreF vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or a placebo. Across the range of assessed gestational ages, infants of immunized women had similar titers in umbilical cord blood and similar transplacental transfer ratios. STUDY [CONCLUSIONS](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2106062?query=TOC): RSVpreF vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses with efficient transplacental transfer and without evident safety concerns. A post-hoc efficacy analysis estimated a VE of 84.7% (95% CI 21.6-97.6) against medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and 91.5% (95% CI -5.6 to 99.8) against severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness. ABRYSVO Dosage A [phase III trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05035212) of a single 120 g dose of RSVpreF without aluminum hydroxide is ongoing.

One study ( [NCT04424316](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04424316)) of the RSV vaccine candidate, RSVpreF, in pregnant women to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RSVpreF in infants born to immunized pregnant women as compared to placebo. [May 22, 2018](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_begins_a_phase_1_2_study_to_evaluate_respiratory_syncytial_virus_rsv_vaccine-0) - Pfizer Inc. announced that it had started a Phase 1/2 trial of its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate in healthy adult volunteers. The highest risk of severe outcomes from RSV occurs in the first months of life. RSVpreF RSV Clinical Trials RSV preF is currently being tested in [several](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=pfizer&cond=RSV+Infection&draw=2&rank=6) clinical trials. RENOIR (NCT05035212) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a single dose of the vaccine in adults 60 years of age and older. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published the efficacy and safety results. RENOIR is ongoing, with efficacy data being collected in the second RSV season of the study. MATISSE (NCT04424316) is a global, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF against medically attended lower respiratory tract illness (MA-LRT) and severe MA-LRTI due to RSV in infants born to healthy individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. The New England Journal of Medicine also recently published the efficacy and safety results. On August 21, 2023, the FDA [reported](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-pregnant-individuals-prevent-rsv-infants) a clinical study that evaluated the effectiveness of Abrysvo in preventing LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants born to individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. Among approximately 3,500 pregnant individuals who received Abrysvo, compared to about 3,500 pregnant individuals who received a placebo, Abrysvo reduced the risk of severe LRTD by 81.8% within 90 days after birth and 69.4% within 180 days after delivery. In a subgroup of pregnant individuals who were 32 through 36 weeks gestational age, of whom approximately 1,500 received Abrysvo and 1,500 received placebo, Abrysvo reduced the risk of LRTD by 34.7% and reduced the risk of severe LRTD by 91.1% within 90 days after birth when compared to placebo. Within 180 days after delivery, Abrysvo reduced the risk of LRTD by 57.3% and 76.5% for severe LRTD compared to placebo. The safety of Abrysvo was evaluated in two studies. In one study, approximately 3,600 pregnant individuals received a single dose of Abrysvo, and about 3,600 received a placebo. In the second study, about 100 pregnant individuals received Abrysvo, and approximately 100 received a placebo. The most commonly reported side effects by pregnant individuals who received Abrysvo were pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, and nausea. In addition, although not commonly reported, a dangerous hypertensive disorder known as pre-eclampsia occurred in 1.8% of pregnant individuals who received Abrysvo compared to 1.4% of pregnant individuals who received a placebo. In the safety studies, infants' low birth weight and jaundice occurred more in the pregnant Abrysvo recipients than in pregnant placebo recipients. The [Phase 3 Study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05035212) to Evaluate the Efficacy, Immunogenicity, and Safety of RSVpreF in Adults. (RENOIR), at the [interim analysis](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2213836?query=featured_home) (data-cutoff date, July 14, 2022), 34,284 participants had received the RSVpreF vaccine (17,215 participants) or placebo (17,069 participants). RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms occurred in 11 participants in the vaccine group (1.19 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 33 participants in the placebo group (3.58 points per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 66.7%; 96.66% confidence interval [CI], 28.8 to 85.8); 2 cases (0.22 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 14 cases (1.52 cases per 1000 person-years of observation), respectively, occurred with at least three signs or symptoms (vaccine efficacy, 85.7%; 96.66% CI, 32.0 to 98.7). RSV-associated acute respiratory illness occurred in 22 participants in the vaccine group (2.38 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 58 participants in the placebo group (6.30 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, 37.1 to 77.9). The incidence of local reactions was higher with the vaccine (12%) than with the placebo (7%); the incidences of systemic events were similar (27% and 26%, respectively). Similar rates of adverse events through 1 month after injection were reported (vaccine, 9.0%; placebo, 8.5%), with 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, considered by the investigators to be injection-related. Severe or life-threatening adverse events were reported in 0.5% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were reported in 2.3% of participants in each group through the data-cutoff date. Pfizer has initiated two additional clinical trials evaluating ABRYSVO. One trial is conducted in children at higher risk for RSV disease, ages 2-<18.8. A second trial is evaluating adults ages 18-60 at higher risk for RSV due to underlying medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and COPD, and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high risk for RSV.8 Pfizer also plans postmarketing studies and surveillance programs to describe the safety of the vaccine further. In a [Phase 2 Efficacy study](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Earnings-Charts-FINAL.pdf#page=21), Pfizer reported that the RSV vaccine showed 100% efficacy against mild to moderate RSV illness in adults (N=62). On June 24, 2022, the peer-reviewed journal NEJM published an [Original Article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116154) based on a [phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04785612) findings that concluded that the RSVpreF vaccine was effective against symptomatic RSV infection and viral shedding. In addition, no evident safety concerns were identified. In April 2020, positive top-line results were achieved for a Phase 2b proof-of-concept study of RSVpreF, which evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF in vaccinated pregnant women ages 18 through 49 and their infants. Pfizer will publish outcomes from this clinical trial at a future date. "}
