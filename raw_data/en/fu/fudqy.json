Introduction [1](#B1-neurosci-02-00015)]. In recent decades, research on the immunological profile of ASD and identifying potential biomarkers of immunological dysfunction in ASD have become more vigorous [ [2](#B2-neurosci-02-00015)]. Multiple studies have discovered that abnormal levels of various inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are found in the brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and serum of individuals with ASD, which are believed to trigger neuroinflammation and disrupt neurodevelopment in [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)]. Cytokines are polypeptides with a major function of signaling immune responses to infection and inflammation. Chemokines, a form of cytokine, function as chemoattractant molecules to attract cells to migrate to local sites of infection and inflammation. In the central nervous system (CNS), chemokines regulate neuronal cell migration, proliferation, neuronal cell differentiation, and mediate communication between neurons and microglia. [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015), [5](#B5-neurosci-02-00015), [6](#B6-neurosci-02-00015), [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)], which suggested a between the expressions of these chemokines and neuroinflammation in ASD. Relatively more empirical evidence revealed an association of the elevation in macrophage-related CCL2 and neutrophil-related CXCL8 with the impaired developmental and adaptive function associated with ASD as well as its core social communication and behavioral symptoms. As examples, higher CCL2 was related to greater problems in expressive language, fine motor skills, visual reception, and daily living skills [ [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)]. In addition, higher CXCL8 was related to less social responsiveness, more stereotypic and hyperactive behaviors, and lower functional level in language and daily living skills in ASD [ [6](#B6-neurosci-02-00015)]. Researchers even found that elevated CXCL8 increased the risk of having ASD [ [8](#B8-neurosci-02-00015)] and postulated that CXCL8 is a correlator to the underlying nature of brain damage in ASD [ [9](#B9-neurosci-02-00015)]. A few studies have examined the links between elevated T cells, eosinophils, and basophils-related CCL5 and the risk of ASD and social deficits in ASD [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)]. Our recent study [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015)] detected a significant correlation between CCL5 and inattention and hyperactive symptoms in ASD. Another chemokine, T helper type 1-related CXCL9, although relatively less investigated, is featured in emerging evidence suggesting that there is a deviated concentration in ASD. While some studies suggested the suppression of CXCL9 [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [10](#B10-neurosci-02-00015)], others reported an elevation in ASD [ [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. [11](#B11-neurosci-02-00015), [12](#B12-neurosci-02-00015)], this aspect of evidence warrants further verification in more well-designed controlled studies. On the other hand, an emerging line of research has proposed certain lifestyle factors (e.g., diet modification, exercise program) to improve the symptomatology of ASD, and some have reported positive outcomes [ [13](#B13-neurosci-02-00015), [14](#B14-neurosci-02-00015), [15](#B15-neurosci-02-00015), [16](#B16-neurosci-02-00015)] and improved [18](#B18-neurosci-02-00015)]. [19](#B19-neurosci-02-00015)], is \"the use of evidence-based lifestyle therapeutic approaches, such as a predominantly whole food, plant-based diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, avoidance of risky substance use, and other non-drug modalities, to prevent, treat, and reverse the lifestyle-related chronic disease\". Cumulative scientific evidence supports the effects of replacing unhealthy lifestyles with positive ones for preventing, treating, and even reversing various common chronic diseases, including heart disease [ [20](#B20-neurosci-02-00015)], cancer [ [21](#B21-neurosci-02-00015), [22](#B22-neurosci-02-00015)], stroke [ [23](#B23-neurosci-02-00015)], diabetes [ [24](#B24-neurosci-02-00015)], pain [ [25](#B25-neurosci-02-00015)], and overweight/obesity [ [26](#B26-neurosci-02-00015)]. Healthy lifestyles include eating whole, plant-based foods (i.e., veggies, fruits, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts, and seeds) that are full of fiber, nutrients, and health-promoting; adopting a habit of regular moderate to vigorous intensity of physical activities; improving sleep quality through dietary and environmental changes; abstaining from tobacco; practicing effective coping and stress reduction techniques; and maintaining social connectedness to boost emotional resiliency and overall health. Findings from this line of research have demonstrated that comprehensive lifestyle changes can reverse the progression of even severe coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, hypercholesterolemia, and high blood pressure [ [20](#B20-neurosci-02-00015), [24](#B24-neurosci-02-00015), [27](#B27-neurosci-02-00015)]. [28](#B28-neurosci-02-00015), [29](#B29-neurosci-02-00015)], on improving various neurological conditions. The Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program is a comprehensive lifestyle intervention approach and is developed upon the medical principles originating from the Chinese Chan Medicine. Chinese Chan Medicine is a holistic approach facilitating better well-being and quality of life through modification of one's life habits, including diet modification, mind-body exercises, and self-realization. Cumulative empirical and clinical evidence of this Chinese lifestyle medicine program have suggested positive treatment outcomes on brain functions, mood state, problematic behaviors, and the physical health of normal individuals [ [30](#B30-neurosci-02-00015), [31](#B31-neurosci-02-00015), [32](#B32-neurosci-02-00015)], elderly with memory complaints [ [33](#B33-neurosci-02-00015), [34](#B34-neurosci-02-00015), [35](#B35-neurosci-02-00015)], and patients with various brain epilepsy [ [45](#B45-neurosci-02-00015)]. Children with ASD, who have adopted our Chan-based diet for 1 month, showed significantly enhanced executive functions (including cognitive flexibility, impulse control, and planning ability) and reduced social communication problem and repetitive behaviors, whereas those without changes in their diet did not show such improvement [ [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015)]. Those positive changes in cognitive performance and problem behaviors were in line with their increased EEG brain activity at the anterior cingulate cortex. Another two randomized controlled studies have detected a positive effect for a 1-month regular practice of the mind-body exercises (a component in our lifestyle intervention) on impulse control ability [ [39](#B39-neurosci-02-00015)] and memory retrieval strategy [ [41](#B41-neurosci-02-00015)] in children with ASD, together with their elevated neurophysiological activity in anterior cingulate cortex and fronto-posterior EEG coherence, respectively. Such beneficial effects were not observed in the control group practicing progressive muscle relaxation. Two other case studies on ASD with the adoption of the Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program also demonstrated significant improvement in executive functions, memory, and symptomatology of ASD [ [36](#B36-neurosci-02-00015), [37](#B37-neurosci-02-00015)]. [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015)], children with ASD demonstrated elevated CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL8 and reduced CXCL9. Therefore, we anticipate that after the intervention, there will be a decrease in CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, and an increase in CXCL9 in the experimental group. Such immunologic alteration would also be in line with their improvement in social and behavioral problems. Such positive changes are not expected for children in the control group. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants [46](#B46-neurosci-02-00015)], and the caregivers' responses were obtained from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) [ [47](#B47-neurosci-02-00015)]. Children who had any neurological disorder or infectious and allergic diseases such as influenza, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis, or were prescribed immunosuppressive drugs were excluded from the study. All children were not taking any psychotropic medication, except for one child who was prescribed with Risperdal. Among the 32 boys, 20 of them were trained with the Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program (i.e., the experimental group), whereas the remaining 12 boys who did not receive the lifestyle medicine program served as the control group. [Table 1](#neurosci-02-00015-t001)presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups of children. These groups were matched for age (t = 1.71, p = 0.10) and level of intelligence (t = 1.46, p = 0.15), as estimated by the short form of the Chinese version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition (Hong Kong) (WISC-IV(HK) [ [48](#B48-neurosci-02-00015)]. These children also showed a comparable level of autistic symptoms as assessed by the ADI-R (t = 1.27 to 0.11, p = 0.22 to 0.91), and social and behavioral problems, as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition (SRS-2) [ [49](#B49-neurosci-02-00015)] (t = 0.80, p = 0.43), the Hyperactivity subscale of short version of Conners' Rating Scales\u2014Revised (CRS-R) [ [50](#B50-neurosci-02-00015)] (t = 2.00, Stereotypic Behavior and Hyperactive/Noncompliance subscales of Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) [ [51](#B51-neurosci-02-00015)] (t = 0.64 and 1.72, p = 0.53 and 0.10). 2.2. Procedures [Figure 1](#neurosci-02-00015-f001)illustrates the flow of the experimental procedure of the present study. 2.3. Intervention [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015)]; (2) Practice a form of mind-body exercise, namely Neigong, which composes sets of breathing exercises and gentle and calm movement. This type of exercise, similar to Tai Chi, is classified as a moderate intensity level of physical activity. For detail of instruction please visit the website [https://chanwuyilifestyle.psy.cuhk.edu.hk](https://chanwuyilifestyle.psy.cuhk.edu.hk)(accessed on 11 February 2021). Our previous research has found that regular practice of Neigong helps to induce a relaxed and attentive brain state [ [31](#B31-neurosci-02-00015)] and to improve impulse control and memory ability of children with ASD [ [39](#B39-neurosci-02-00015), [41](#B41-neurosci-02-00015)]. Children were encouraged to practice Neigong daily at home. (3) Self-realization is a process of self-awareness and understanding of how our greed, anger, and obsession negatively affect our behaviors, emotions, and health. During the program, children learned to cultivate gratitude and kindness to get rid of those negative beliefs and to combat stress through interactive games and self-expression. 2.4. Immunological Measures 2.5. Behavioral Measures 2.5.1. Social Communication and Stereotypic/Repetitive Behaviors 2.5.2. Hyperactivity Behaviors 2.6. Data Analyses 3. Results 3.1. Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program Modulated Pro-Inflammatory Chemokines in ASD [Table 2](#neurosci-02-00015-t002)). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the four immunological measures given the adjusted alpha value at 0.013, t ranges from 0.66 to 2.15, p 0.04. [Figure 2](#neurosci-02-00015-f002)shows the pre-post changes of each chemokine concentration in the two groups. Statistical results showed a significant Group (Experimental vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (Pre vs. Post) interaction effect on the concentration level of CCL2 and CXCL8 (F = 4.38 and 10.98, p = 0.045 and 0.002), partial eta squared = 0.13 (medium effect size) and 0.27 (large effect size), respectively. Post hoc paired sample t-tests found that the experimental group demonstrated a significant reduction in the concentration level of CCL2 and CXCL8 after a 7-month intervention (t = 4.07 and 4.71, effect size = 0.91 and 1.05 respectively, p 0.001). In contrast, the concentration level of CCL2 and CXCL8 remains constant after 7 months in the control group (t = 1.48 and 1.10, p = 0.17 and 0.29, effect size = 0.43 and 0.32 respectively). [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015)], children with ASD were found to have an approximately two-fold lower level of CXCL9 concentration than typically developed children, and this between-group difference was statistically significant. Their reduced CXCL9 concentration was also found to be associated with higher social and behavioral problems. In the present study, children from the experimental group showed a 42% elevation in CXCL9 concentration after intervention (from 232.33 to 329.35), whereas the control group showed a 19% reduction in CXCL9 concentration after 7 months (from 347.52 to 282.17). In addition, the variability in the experimental group at post-intervention (SD = 358.04) is much larger than that of the control group (SD = 196.51). Although the pre-post changes in the experimental and control groups did not reach statistical significance (t = 1.29 and 0.93, p = 0.21 and 0.37, effect size = 0.29 and 0.27 respectively), the incremental trend in CXCL9 concentration mainly found in the experimental group might suggest a potential positive effect of Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program on this chemokine subset that would be worth further investigation as part of a future study with a larger sample size. 3.2. Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program Reduced Core Symptoms in ASD [Figure 3](#neurosci-02-00015-f003)and [Figure 4](#neurosci-02-00015-f004)demonstrate the change in mean rating on the respective scales before and after the intervention. A post hoc paired samples t-test revealed that the experimental group showed a significant reduction in core autistic symptoms, as measured by the SRS-2 after the intervention (t = 2.89, p = 0.009, effect size = 0.65) ( [Figure 3](#neurosci-02-00015-f003)). Although children from the control group demonstrated a trend of reduction in the SRS-2 total score (t = 2.30, p = 0.042, effect size = 0.66), such change did not reach statistical significance when the adjusted alpha level (0.013) was adopted. Interestingly, the pre-post change in SRS-2 total score was significantly correlated with the change in CCL5 concentration (r = 0.41, p = 0.02); that is, the greater the extent of reduction in CCL5 concentration, the larger the reduction in SRS-2 score (i.e., fewer social communication problems). Yet, any change in SRS-2 total score did not correlate with other chemokine indices (r ranges from 0.01 to 0.23, p ranges from 0.21 to 0.96). For the Stereotypy subscale in ABC, both groups showed reduced scores, but the change was not statistically significant at an adjusted alpha level (t = 2.15, p = 0.045, effect size = 0.48 in the experimental group, and t = 1.73, p = 0.11, effect size = 0.50 in the control group) ( [Figure 4](#neurosci-02-00015-f004)). There was no significant correlation between any chemokine concentration levels and the Stereotypy score (r ranges from 0.06 to 0.17, p ranges from 0.35 to 0.76). 3.3. Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program Reduced Hyperactivity Behaviors in ASD [Figure 5](#neurosci-02-00015-f005)shows the pre-post changes in measures of hyperactive behaviors in both groups. In repeated measures ANOVA, there is a significant Group \u00d7 Time interaction effect on CRS-R subscale (F = 7.75, p = 0.009, partial eta squared = 0.21 (large)), and a significant Time effect on the ABC subscale (F = 1.99, p = 0.17, partial eta squared = 0.06 (medium)). A post-hoc paired samples t-test showed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly reduced hyperactivity behavior in both CRS-R and ABC subscales (t = 3.65 and 3.15, p = 0.002 and 0.005, effect size = 0.82 and 0.70, respectively). In contrast, the control group did not show such a significant reduction (t = 0.50 and 1.38, p = 0.63 and 0.20, effect size = 0.14 and 0.40, respectively). The two hyperactivity measures were not correlated with any chemokine indices (r ranges from 0.03 to 0.22, p ranges from 0.22 to 0.86). 4. Discussion [37](#B37-neurosci-02-00015), [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015), CCL2 protein expression maximizes the probability of acute and chronic inflammation in the brain, which thereby affects an individual's level of cognitive functioning. Elevation of CCL2 and CXCL8 has been repeatedly reported to be linked with the inflammatory responses in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease [ [53](#B53-neurosci-02-00015), [54](#B54-neurosci-02-00015), [55](#B55-neurosci-02-00015), [56](#B56-neurosci-02-00015)]. Increased CCL2 was also found to be associated with Parkinson's disease, encephalitis, and a brain tumor [ [57](#B57-neurosci-02-00015), [58](#B58-neurosci-02-00015), [59](#B59-neurosci-02-00015)], whereas increased CXCL8 was found to be related to epilepsy, HIV-1, and neurosyphilis [ [60](#B60-neurosci-02-00015), [61](#B61-neurosci-02-00015), [62](#B62-neurosci-02-00015)], The link between CCL2 and CXCL8 with also recurrently evidenced. Levels of chemokines macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 were found to be about two-fold higher in the anterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum in the brain tissue of ASD than in the controls [ [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with autism showed a 12-fold increase in CCL2 when compared with controls [ [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. Elevation of CCL2 in plasma was repeatedly reported in ASD [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [6](#B6-neurosci-02-00015), [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)]. Similarly, neutrophil chemotactic factor CXCL8 was found to be higher in the brain cortex of ASD in comparison to the control group [ [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. Given the potent chemotactic effects of CXCL8 on neutrophils and granulocytes, Li et al. (2009) [ [5](#B5-neurosci-02-00015)] have postulated that such elevation might implicate a chemokine-mediated neuroinflammation that could be related to possible brain damage led by infiltrated neutrophils and granulocytes. Furthermore, the increased peripheral level of CXCL8 in plasma samples was also found in children with ASD than typically developed children [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [6](#B6-neurosci-02-00015)]. The increased CCL2 and CXCL8 have been reported to be associated with greater impairment in developmental and adaptive function and more frequent social withdrawal and stereotypic and hyperactive behaviors in ASD [ [6](#B6-neurosci-02-00015), [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015)]. Therefore, the significant downregulation of CCL2 and CXCL8 in ASD after the 7-month Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program has shed some light on the potential benefits of the adopting a healthy lifestyle on improving the immunologic state of ASD. [58](#B58-neurosci-02-00015)], multiple sclerosis [ [63](#B63-neurosci-02-00015)], and Alzheimer's disease [ [64](#B64-neurosci-02-00015)], it has a stronger linkage with HIV-related disease and cancers [ [65](#B65-neurosci-02-00015), [66](#B66-neurosci-02-00015)]. The association between CCL5 and ASD remains inconclusive. While a few studies have detected elevated CCL5 in ASD [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [7](#B7-neurosci-02-00015), [10](#B10-neurosci-02-00015)], other studies found a decline [ [67](#B67-neurosci-02-00015)] or did not find an abnormal concentration of CCL5 in ASD [ [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. Similarly, the role of Th1-related CXCL9 in neuroinflammatory diseases has been minimally explored. Some studies have suggested its association with encephalitis, ischemic stroke, and epilepsy [ [68](#B68-neurosci-02-00015), [69](#B69-neurosci-02-00015), [70](#B70-neurosci-02-00015)]. Few studies have addressed either an elevated or a suppressed level of CXCL9 in ASD [ [3](#B3-neurosci-02-00015), [4](#B4-neurosci-02-00015)]. Given the relatively less known mechanism of CCL5 and CXCL9 underlying pathogenesis of ASD, the non-significant treatment-induced alteration in these chemokines in the present study warrants further investigation to delineate the explanation for such results. [71](#B71-neurosci-02-00015)], stroke [ [72](#B72-neurosci-02-00015)]), and alleviating inflammatory responses in some physical illnesses (e.g., coronary heart disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [ [73](#B73-neurosci-02-00015)]). A few studies have also suggested the modulating effect of diet change in altering immune responses in ASD [ [74](#B74-neurosci-02-00015)]. On the other hand, the practice of a moderate intensity mind-body exercise (Neigong) and education on taking a more positive living attitude in the Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine Program are believed to enhance the capacity of children with ASD for promoting proper stress coping, which are protective factors for anti-neuroinflammation. The benefits of physical activity on reducing inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and arthritis have been extensively studied with positive results [ [75](#B75-neurosci-02-00015)]. A review conducted by Spielman, Little, and Klegeris [ [76](#B76-neurosci-02-00015)] concluded that physical activity helped attenuate neuroinflammation associated with the major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Positive life attitude, such as gratitude, can boost immune function and reduce the risk of stroke [ [77](#B77-neurosci-02-00015)]. Although exercise-induced modulation of immune function in ASD has been rarely studied, children with ASD were found to be less physically active than typically developing children [ [78](#B78-neurosci-02-00015)], and some research has supported the positive effects of physical activity (e.g., swimming, jogging, cycling, weight training, and walking) on improving their balance and flexibility [ [79](#B79-neurosci-02-00015)], social communication skills [ [13](#B13-neurosci-02-00015)], peer relations [ [79](#B79-neurosci-02-00015)], and reducing stereotypical behaviors [ [15](#B15-neurosci-02-00015)], inattention [ [79](#B79-neurosci-02-00015)], and self-stimulation [ [79](#B79-neurosci-02-00015)]. Therefore, it is worth exploring the potential benefits of regular exercise on the immunological function of ASD in the future. [37](#B37-neurosci-02-00015), [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015), [39](#B39-neurosci-02-00015)]. While our previous randomized controlled studies were focusing on the short-term effect (i.e., one month of training), the present study replicated similar positive outcomes over a longer term of intervention (i.e., 7 months). In the present study, the mean reduction of problematic behaviors in the experimental group (mean reduction: 35.8%, range of changes: 21.3% to 51.6%) is more than double that in the control group (mean reduction: 14.6%, range of changes: 12.6% to 41.9%). As compared to the 13% reduction in problematic behaviors after one-month Neigong practice [ [39](#B39-neurosci-02-00015)] and 21% reduction after one-month Chan-based diet modification [ [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015)] reported in our previous studies, the extent of treatment effect (35.8%) is relatively more substantial in the present study. The present greater effect could be related to the longer duration of intervention and the more comprehensive intervention protocol adopted. In previous studies, we have explored the neural mechanism underlying the treatment-induced behavioral changes and discovered enhanced brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex in ASD [ [38](#B38-neurosci-02-00015), [39](#B39-neurosci-02-00015)]. Such findings imply that the Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine changes behaviors of ASD by altering their neural activity pattern. Given the association between behavioral deficits and immunological abnormality in ASD, the present study substantiated the positive effect of the Chanwuyi Lifestyle Medicine on the immunologic state of children with ASD, which could be a possible contributing factor for the positive behavioral changes in ASD. 5.
