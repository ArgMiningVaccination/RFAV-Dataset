IV Therapy at The Upper House IV drips aren't only reserved for the hospital anymore. Health junkies around the world have been obsessed with this wellness trend the last few years, welcoming the slight discomfort of a needle for the sake of optimal health. With promises to boost your [immune system](https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/alternative-immunity-boosting-methods-in-hong-kong), improve [skin appearance](https://hk.asiatatler.com/style/best-hydrating-overnight-masks), combat [jet-lag](https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/beat-jet-lag-by-hanging-upside-down) and even rehydrate your body to promote faster muscle recovery, IV therapy will become your new best friend\u2014as long as you brave the needle. The hardest part of this therapy treatment? The beginning. Much like a normal IV drip, a nurse or a healthcare professional will first insert a needle into a vein to connect the small IV tube into your bloodstream. After that, all you'll have to do is sit back and relax and let the cocktail of vitamins seep into your system. To choose the right IV therapy treatment for you, consult with the medical professional at the centre to learn about the different vitamins they have on offer. Each treatment session lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on how fast your body absorbs the vitamins.
