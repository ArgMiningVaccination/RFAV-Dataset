The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility. The vaccine is developed using Whole- Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. KEY ATTRIBUTES IMMUNE- POTENTIATORS 01 No Sub-zero Storage, No Reconstitution Requirement, And Ready To Use Liquid Presentation In Multi-dose Vials, Stable At 2-8oc. 03 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart. 02 81% INTERIM EFFICACY in preventing COVID-19 in those without prior infection after the 04 CONSTITUENTS AND ACTION It is an inactivated vaccine which is developed by inactivating (killing) the live microorganisms that cause the disease. This destroys the ability of the pathogen to replicate, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognise it and produce an immune response. It is expected to target more than just the spike protein. It also aims to develop an immune response to the nucleocapsid protein (the shell of the virus that encloses its genetic material). WHAT SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR VACCINATION PROVIDER BEFORE YOU GET COVAXIN? Tell the Vaccinator/supervising your vaccination about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Are on regular medication for any illness, for how long and for which condition. It is advisable not to take the vaccine in any of these conditions. Have any allergies Have fever. Have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. Are immun-o-compromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system. Are pregnant. Are breastfeeding. Have received another COVID-19 vaccine. SOME QUESTIONS WHO SHOULD GET COVAXIN? COVAXIN has been approved for restricted use in emergency situation in individuals 18 years of age and older. WHAT IF I DECIDE NOT TO GET COVAXIN? It is your choice to receive or not receive COVAXIN SOME QUESTIONS WHAT IF I AM PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING? If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should not get the vaccine as the effect of the vaccine has not been studied in pregnant women and nursing mothers. WHAT IF I HAVE ALLERGIES? Individuals who have a known severe allergy to any component of COVAXIN are NOT advised to be \u00aevaccinated. SOME QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF BHARAT BIOTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE (COVAXIN)? Side effects that have been reported with the Bharat Biotech COVID-19 (COVAXIN) include: Injection site pain / Swelling / Redness / Itching / Headache/ Fever / Malaise / body ache / Nausea/ Vomiting / Rashes. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF COVAXIN? In an ongoing clinical trial, COVAXIN has been shown to generate immunity following 2 doses given 4 weeks apart. Phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing in 25,800 participants, with an interim analysis results showing vaccine efficacy of 81%.Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed. \u00aeA severe allergic reaction may very rarely occur after getting a dose of COVAXIN. \u00aeThese may not be all the possible side effects of COVAXIN. Serious and unexpected side effects may \u00ae occur. COVAXINis still being studied in clinical trials. "}
