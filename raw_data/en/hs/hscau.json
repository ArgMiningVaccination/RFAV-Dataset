I highly recommend Liz and her amazing skills to anyone who is willing to try acupuncture. A doctor recommended acupuncture to me last year and I was so ready to finally feel better, I put my fear of needles and fear of trying something new aside. To say that going to see Liz was life changing is an understatement. I am so glad that I tried it and keep going back. Liz is kind, thorough and patient. She understands when I'm not ready to try something new and lets me negotiate - knowing that the following appointment I am usually ready. She listens to everything I have to say and I truly appreciate her mind and body approach to my wellness and healthy life. And I feel safe continuing treatment with her during the pandemic. What are you waiting for?!? Try it and see for yourself! You Might Also "}
