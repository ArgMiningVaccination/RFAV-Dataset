The journal is particularly seeking studies that either incorporate the most relevant 18 educational outcomes (effects on clinical prac tice and patient care, r ather than measures of knowledge, skills, or attitudes) or address better techniques for their measure. Recent articles in JAMA have addressed the relationship between educ ation an d medical d ecision making; the effects of stress on trainees and clinicians; models for prov iding incentives to faculty for teaching; career choices and the physician workforce; the Internet and professional behavior; education in evidence-based medicine; method s, quality, and funding of medical e ducation research; effects of communication skills; teaching quality improvement ; diversity in medical education; cross-cultural care; ch anges in resident work hours and patient mortality, patient safety, and physician he alth; inaccuracy of physician se lf- asse ssment; and the effects of the Internet on e ducation. While these remain of interest, other potential topics include (but are not limited to) continuing professional development, physician reentry programs, the ap propri ate use of medical literature, and the use of interdisciplinary approach es to learning. Given the role of educator that is played by all physicians, the journal is also interested in studies of the effectiveness of training ph ysicians to be teachers, if these studies are cond ucted with methodol ogical rigor and include impo rtant objective outcome measures. The journal will consider all original research papers, s ystematic reviews, and scho larly com mentaries addressing medical e ducation, including randomized trials, high-quality observational studies, evidence-based reviews, and presentation of novel method ologies. The effects of medical e ducation at the student, physician, patient, and soc ietal levels are all appropri ate for consideration.
