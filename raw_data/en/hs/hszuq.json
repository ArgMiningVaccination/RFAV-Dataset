Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia it is subject to the stringent assessment and approval processes of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. The TGA rigorously assesses all vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. The approvals are subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for sponsors to continue providing information to the TGA on longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. Emerging clinical trial evidence, as well as real world data, continues to be monitored by technical experts. The TGA provisionally approved the Comirnaty (Pfizer), Spikevax (Moderna) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccines after a complete assessment of all the available data. This is the same process as any vaccine approved in this country. The TGA will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. While the Government encourages all eligible Australians to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they are eligible, vaccination in Australia is voluntary, and individuals need to undertake appropriate individual risk-benefit analysis and give informed consent before being vaccinated against COVID-19. There is a wide range of resources available to the general public to inform their decision-making. As part of a vaccine's provisional approval process, the TGA requires that a comprehensive Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) leaflet and Product Information (PI) document be available for healthcare professionals and consumers for all prescription medicines. These documents are available at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccines: information for consumers and health professionals'. The CMI leaflet contains information for consumers on the safe and effective use of a vaccine, including side effects. It also contains a list of all ingredients found in the vaccine. The PI provides information for healthcare professionals to guide their prescribing, dispensing and administering decisions and to assist them to provide patient education, and also includes a list of all ingredients found in the vaccine. The TGA monitors the safety of vaccines after they are registered in Australia so that any safety concerns can be detected and responded to. TGA publishes weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety reports that include information about reported suspected side effects and other safety information from Australia and overseas. These reports are available at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report'. Active surveillance is also undertaken through the AusVaxSafety surveillance system, which sends follow up messages to recipients of COVID-19 vaccines to ask if they have experienced any potential side effects. The results of this surveillance monitoring are available at: www.ausvaxsafety.org.au. Informed consent for COVID-19 vaccines should be obtained as per usual consent procedures for other vaccinations. This can depend on the state or territory in which the vaccine is being obtained. Verbal or implied consent is acceptable and written consent is not required. Vaccination providers can use the 'Consent form for COVID-19 vaccination', which is available on my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccination provider resources'. The form is provided as an example and use of the form is not mandatory. Vaccination providers are welcome to use the form as presented or adapt the content for their unique requirements. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must undertake a mandatory online COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program. The program is comprehensive and is informed by the latest advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee , the TGA, the World Health Organisation, and clinical experts across my Department. The COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program outlines specific questions that need to be discussed with patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination. This supplementary screening includes questions that cover contraindications and precautions, pregnancy and breastfeeding, age, immunocompromised individuals, and current symptoms or illness, and is in addition to the standard pre-screening checklist in the Australian Immunisation Handbook, the COVID-19 vaccination consent form and the corresponding 'Information for providers and Frequently Asked Questions' which is available at the link above. Specific precautions for each COVID-19 vaccine are covered within focussed training modules for each COVID-19 vaccine. Providers are required to complete each vaccine-specific module for the vaccines they administer. Updates are regularly provided to health professionals to ensure that best practice clinical information is available and followed. These updates reflect the latest findings of global clinical trials and research regarding risks, benefits and efficacy of vaccines for various cohorts. My Department continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines to the public, and clinical guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to health practitioners. Consumer resources on COVID-19 vaccines are available on my Department's website to ensure people can be informed about COVID-19 vaccines. These resources cover the different COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia and include information on preparing for vaccination and what to do after vaccination. These resources are available at: www.health.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccination patient resources'. My Department's COVID-19 communications materials strongly encourage individuals to seek expert medical advice from their GP if they have any questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. GPs and other healthcare providers are able to provide advice specific to the circumstances of each individual. ATAGI has developed a number of resources to assist people with their decision-making and to inform their discussions with their GP or other healthcare provider. Resources include ATAGI's clinical guidance, shared decision-making guides and statements on use of COVID-19 vaccine in outbreak settings. These resources are available at the above links (provider or patient resources). All resources include a reference list with links to the research, studies and other information that have informed the development of that advice. ATAGI meets weekly to consider emerging evidence and information (including safety monitoring information and weekly safety data published by the TGA) and recommendations may be updated as required. ATAGI publishes statements following these meetings to ensure the general public has access to the most up-to-date information, including rare but potentially serious adverse events following immunisation. These statements are available at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'ATAGI' and clicking on the link to 'Statements'. I note that the Nuremberg Code, developed in 1947, primarily applies to scientific experimentation on unwilling participants, outside the definition of 'Permissible Medical Experiments' established through the Nuremberg Trials in 1945 and 1946. As the vaccine is not mandatory and has been approved by a regulatory body for use in the general population, it is considered that the Nuremberg Code does not apply to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Thank you for writing on this matter. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mr Hunt "}
