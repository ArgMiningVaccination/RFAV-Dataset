That's where my services come in. As an Acupuncturist and Reiki Master, I work with you to restore your balance and find your center. These treatment options may be combined to create the most supportive treatment for your individual situation. Acupuncture Balance Your Qi Acupuncture is part of the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM explains that the human body has acupuncture points connected by meridians. These meridians are pathways that create an energy flow (Qi, pronounced \"chee\") through the body that is responsible for overall health. Disruption of the energy flow can cause disease. By inserting needles in specific points along these meridians, it improves the flow of Qi, thereby improving health. Studies have shown that acupuncture is effective for a variety of conditions. I have completed specialty training in Women's Health, Fertility, Pregnancy and Postpartum, and Cancer Care. Microneedling Protect Your Skin Barrier Microneedling is a cosmetic procedure that uses small, sterilized needles to prick the skin. The purpose of this treatment is to generate new collagen and skin tissue to smooth, firm, and tone skin. Microneedling is mostly used on the face and neck and may reduce the appearance of acne, scars, dark or light spots, wrinkles, and large pores. It can also be used on the scalp to promote hair growth. Microneedling treatments are available in discounted packages that may include microneedling, nanoneedling, AcuGlow facial treatment, infrared light therapy, and products to support your skin after treatment. AcuGlow Facial Move Blood and Lymph This treatment releases toxins from the skin and supports lymphatic function. It helps to hydrate skin, disperse hyperpigmentation, reduce pore size, and reduce puffiness. You will experience increased blood flow, strengthening of connective tissues, and stimulation of collagen producing cells. AcuGlow treatment includes facial gua sha and cupping and may include infrared light therapy to stimulate collagen production. Cupping, Tui Na, and Gua Sha Ease Your Tension Cupping involves placing special cups on your body to create suction. Tui Na is a form of Chinese medical massage. Gua Sha is a scraping technique done with a stone, ceramic, or metal tool. These three modalities can be used together for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage. LED Light Therapy Support Your Healing LED light therapy is a non-invasive treatment that utilizes different wavelengths of infrared light to help treat various skin issues such as acne, fine lines, wounds, and pain. Learn more about the many uses of different LED light colors on my blog page. Reiki Balance Your Energy Reiki is an energy balancing technique that promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety through gentle touch. Reiki practitioners use their hands to improve the flow and balance of your energy to support healing. Aromatherapy Healing from the Earth Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that retain the natural smell and flavor, or \"essence,\" of their source. Inhaling the aromas from essential oils can stimulate areas of your limbic system, which is a part of your brain that plays a role in emotions, behaviors, sense of smell, and long-term memory. Meditation Calm Your Mind Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. It was originally meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, it is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine that can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. "}
