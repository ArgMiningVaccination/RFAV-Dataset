Hum Vaccin Immunother ; 19(1): 2182527, 2023 ID: covidwho-2286513 ABSTRACT [Coronavirus](COVID-19) [vaccines]have proved to be effective in the [pandemic]response but can cause adverse events such than [IgE]-mediated [immune response]. [Lymphocyte [drug allergy], may be helpful in suspected [COVID-19 vaccine]and/or its [excipient]-related DHRs. To investigate the use of LTT in two suspected cases of [COVID-19 vaccine]-induced DHRs, two suspected LTT ChAdOx1 [vaccine], but Delayed- [reading]IDT returned negative to both [vaccines]and no adverse [vaccine]. performed 3 months later revealed reactivity to the [BNT162b2]but not PEG 2050. Repeat LTT following subsequent natural Severe Acute Respiratory NVX-CoV2373 [vaccination]with no symptom [recurrence]. LTT may be a useful tool in suspected [COVID-19 vaccine]-related DHRs.
