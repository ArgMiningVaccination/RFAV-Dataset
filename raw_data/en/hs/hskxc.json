Exemplar questions from each chapter of both the books have been prepared. These exemplar questions are for the question number 3,4,10,11,12, and 13 of the Sample Question Paper 2020-21 and have been numbered accordingly. This resource will equip teachers and learners to become familiar with the new patterns and understand, acquire and practice the requisite skills and competencies listed in the curriculum. It will also serve as a guideline for teachers to prepare a question bank individually and collaboratively. As you will observe, the questions in the document are not based on mere recall or rudimentary comprehension. Rather, they have been designed to foster in students the skill to think critically and creatively with a focus on inferential abilities. It is important to note that the larger intent of this resource is providing to teachers an indicative framework to conceptualise and practice analysis-based learning and problem solving. It is hoped that the questions herein will also enable teachers to reflect on their teaching practices, and promote a movement away from 'teaching to the test' towards a focus on the process of discovery, openness, imaginative engagement and activity-based learning in the ways that they bring the text to the child, as much as the child to the text. It is our belief that the potential of the Language and Literature curriculum to stimulate learners and teachers can be glimpsed in this Resource. We hope that teachers will welcome this document as a reminder of this potential, and find in it a ready resource not only to equip their students, but to jumpstart their own thinking and engagement processes. 3 First Flight 4 L-1 A Letter to God Text-First Flight Q3 Multiple Choice Questions based on an extract (A) The house- the only one in the entire valley -sat on the crest of a low hill.

This time I won.\" The next year his science fair project was testing the theory that viceroy butterflies copy monarchs. The theory was that viceroys look like monarchs because monarchs don't taste good to birds. Viceroys, on the other hand, do taste good to birds. So, the more they look like monarchs, the less likely they are to become a bird's dinner. Ebright's project was to see whether, in fact, birds would eat monarchs. He found that a starling would not eat ordinary bird food. It would eat all the monarchs it could get. i Choose the option listing Ebright's qualities as depicted by the above extract. 1. persevering 2. visionary 3. determined 4. liberal 5. conceited a) 1, 2 b) 3, 5 c) 1, 3 d) 4, 5 e) ii According to the dictionary, 'fair' as a noun, shows the following meanings.

But he believed that, along with his findings about insect hormones, the photos gave him the answer to one of biology's puzzles: how the cell can 'read' the blueprint of its DNA. DNA is the substance in the nucleus of a cell that controls heredity. It determines the form and function of the cell. Thus, DNA is the blueprint for life. Ebright and his college room-mate, James R. Wong, worked all that night drawing pictures and constructing plastic models of molecules to show how it could happen.
