Summary of Authorizations of Appropriations Expiring on or Before September 30, 2012, by Appropriations Subcommittee 14JANUARY 2012 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 5 CBOOverview As required, the Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) reports each January to the Congress on the following: All programs and activities funded for th e current fiscal year for which autho- rizations of appropriations have expired, and All programs and activities for which author izations of appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year. Those requiremen ts are specified in section 202(e )(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act).1 The Role of Authorizations The term \"authorization\" is used to describe two types of laws. One is an \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" statute, which creates a federa l agency, establishes a federal program, prescribes a federal function, or allows a particular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may allow a federal agency, program, or function to continue indefinitely or only fo r a specific period. Such an authorization may constitute direct spending (also known as \"mandatory spending\") if it provides the direct authority to draw money from th e T reasury to implement the statute, or it may simply specify a purpose for which a subsequent appropriation is made available. This report focuses on the second type of law described by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision that authorizes the appropriation of funds (generally providing for what is known as \"discretionary spending \") to carry out the program or function established in the enabling statute. Such a provision constitutes guidance to the Congress regarding the amount of funding that will be necessary to implement the enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be contained in an enabling statute or may be provided separately. Such an authorization may set a specific dollar amount (definite authorization) or allow the appropriation of \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefinite authorization) and may be permanent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this report, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's authorization of appropriations has expired. This report does not address appropriations that have never been authorized. 1. See H. Rept. 99-433, at 114 (1985), the conference report accompanying the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report. The stated purpose of the requirement is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legislation that must be in place before the regular appropriation bills can be considered.\"6 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS JANUARY 2012 CBOHouse and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19t h century\u2014contain restrictions on the consideration of appropriations that are unauthorized, although the rules and their application are different.2 Whether an appropriation is unauthorized and whether it is a violation of a House or Senate rule are determined by the Speaker of the House or the Presiding Office of the Senate, respectively, on advice of the respective House's Office of the Parliamentarian. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriations that have expired or will expire this year, it is not\u2014and should not be considered\u2014definitive with respect to the application of House or Senate rules. Listings of Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations This report covers all programs funded through the annual appropriation process that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has since expired (see Appendix A) or will expire this year (see Appendix B). Each listing includes the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year in which the authorization was in effect, and the amount (definite or indefinite) authorized in that year. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing committee, and by appropriations subcommittee. Each entry is listed only once\u2014generally under the primary committee to which the bill was referred. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonpermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the first session of the 112th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropriations committees, in their reports on general appropriation bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014includ ing programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never b een enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or is scheduled to expire. Many laws also establish programs with an authorization of appropriations that does not expire. The reports of the appropriations committees as well as this report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent. 2. See Rule XXI of the House Rules and Manual, H. Doc. 110-162, at 836-891; and Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, S. Doc. 110-9, at 11-12.JANUARY 2012 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 7 CBOPrograms Funded in Fiscal Year 2012 with Expired Authorizations of Appropriations Appendix A lists the programs and activities funded by an appropriation for fiscal year 2012 whose authorization of appropriations has expire d. If the applicable 2012 appropriation law or its legislative history provides an explicit amount of funding for a program, that amount is shown under \"Unauthorized 2012 Appropriations\" in Appendix A. If no specific amount is provided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account, or a program that is funded in several appropriation accounts ), CBO determines whether the program is still being funded and, if so, how much is allocated for it. If that amount cannot be identified, the listing notes that the specific dolla r amount of the unauthorized 2012 appropriation is \"not available.\" The Congress has appropriated about $261 bi llion for fiscal year 2012 for programs and activities whose authorizations of appr opriations have expi red (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). In 2010, the last year for which appropriations in formation was provided in this report, about $291 billion was appropri ated for programs whose authorizations had expired. The 2012 amount is lower pr imarily because several agencies or programs were reauthorized in 2010 and 2011, including the Na tional Aeronautics and Space Administration (about $14 bi llion appropriated in 2010), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (about $7 billion in 2010), the Department of Energy science program (about $5 billion in 2010), and the Indian Health Service (about $4 billion in 2010). Several large agencies or programs have expired authorizations, including the National Institutes of Health (with appropriations of $31 billion for 2012), the Coast Guard (with appropriations of $10 billion for 2012) and the Community Development Block Grant program (with appropriations of $3 billion for 2012). Other large appropriations with expired authorizations include programs authorized in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-162, $26 billion), the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (P .L. 105-276, $25 billion), and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P .L. 107-110, $24 billion). Authorizations of Appropriations That Expire on or Before September 30, 2012 For certain programs and activities, the auth orization of appropriations expires by the end of fiscal year 2012. (Appendix B shows the amounts authorized to be appropriated in 2012 for the expiring programs and activities, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year.) Definite authorizations (specifically, those contained in laws under the jurisdiction of House and Senate authorizing committees) that will expire by the end of this fiscal year total about $708 billion (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). Most of that amount, about $663 billion, is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act for 8 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS JANUARY 2012 CBOFiscal Year 2012 (P .L. 112-81). Typically, authorizations for de fense funding are renewed annually. Some of the other definite authorizations for programs that are expiring at the end of 2012 include provisions in the Energy Inde pendence and Security Act of 2007 (P .L. 110-140, with authorizations of $4.9 billion), the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2008 (P .L. 110-335, with authorizations of $4.9 billion), and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P .L. 110-234, with authorizations of $1.1 billion). In addition, in the past few months, lawmakers have enacted temporary authorizations that will expire during fi scal year 2012. They include authorizations for surface transportation programs and programs of the Federal Aviation Administration (through March 31, 2012).
