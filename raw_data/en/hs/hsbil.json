These vaccines \"teach\" your child's body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. WHY CHILDREN AND TEENS SHOULD GET VACCINATED It's true that most children and teens are at lower risk from becoming very sick from COVID-19. But low risk does not mean no risk. Children and teens can: Children with underlying medical conditions are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. So, vaccination is very important to help protect against the virus. There are many good reasons to have your child or teen get a COVID-19 vaccination: ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS Children ages 6 months to 17 years can get either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine given to children and teens has the same active ingredients as the vaccine given to adults. Dosage is based on the child's age on the day of vaccination. It is not based on the child's size or weight. The original mRNA vaccines, also called monovalent vaccines, are no longer available. The updated mRNA vaccines, also called bivalent vaccines, are currently in use. These updated (bivalent) vaccines protect against the original COVID-19 virus and certain variants of the COVID-19 virus. VACCINATION SCHEDULE Your child's vaccination schedule is based on age and vaccination history. Children who DID NOT get the original vaccine can have the following shots. Children who DID get the original vaccine can have the following shots: OTHER VACCINES Children ages 12 years and older who are unable or who choose not to get an updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can get the Novavax vaccine. VACCINE MYTHS COVID-19 vaccines: To get up-to-date accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website: VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS While COVID-19 vaccines will not make children sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms. This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your child's body is making antibodies against the virus. Common side effects include: Side effects from the shot may affect your child's ability to do daily activities, but they will go away in a few days. Even if your child has side effects, they should get the second shot. Any side effects from the vaccine are far less dangerous than the potential for serious illness or death from COVID-19. HOW TO GET THE VACCINE COVID-19 vaccines are available to all children living in the United States at no cost. Children can get this free shot regardless of their immigration or health insurance status. There are several ways to find vaccination providers near you. VACCINE SAFETY The safety of vaccines is the top priority, and COVID-19 vaccines for children have passed rigorous safety standards before approval. They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective. Serious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare. Rare cases of [myocarditis](content.aspx?productid=117&pid=1&gid=000149) (inflammation of the heart muscle) and [pericarditis](content.aspx?productid=117&pid=1&gid=000182) (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children and teens ages 5 years and older after getting the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include: If your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.
