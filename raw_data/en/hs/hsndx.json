A Note from epilepsy.com's Editors (August 2017) This forum post was originally created in 2007. Over the years, many of the links provided in the comments have expired or may not have been updated. To find reliable, expert-verified information, visit the following sections of this site: In late 2016, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) approved a new way of organizing seizures that reflects recent advances in our understanding of the brain and seizures. This new system will make diagnosis and classification of seizures easier and more accurate. [Learn more here.](/learn/types-seizures/new-terms-seizure-classification) These terms don't change what occurs during a seizure, but offer a different way of naming seizures. More accurate ways of naming seizures can lead to more appropriate treatment.

The following modifying factors apply: * Motor activity often is modified by sensory stimuli. * Frequency is usually 0.1-6 Hz. * An occurrence of EPC can continue for long periods of time (sometimes years) without spreading, although spread can occur at times. * EPC often is associated with postictal or interictal weakness. * Clinical evolution distinguishes 2 forms (ie, Bancaud type 1, Bancaud type 2): type 1 is usually symptomatic of a focal brain lesion, and the prognosis is the same as that of the associated lesion; type 2 is associated with progressive, idiopathic, neurological deterioration, usually in the form of Rasmussen encephalitis... Re: Re: Psychomotor Seizures Submitted by spiz on Sat, 2007-03-31 - 02:49 [Eclampsia](http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic633.htm):Convulsions are the other most common feature of this syndrome. Convulsions are the most common neurologic manifestation in eclampsia because the occurrence of convulsions confirms the diagnosis of eclampsia. Convulsions are usually generalized tonic-clonic in nature. Usually a brief single seizure occurs. Multiple seizures can also occur; however, status epilepticus is rare. Partial seizures or complex partial seizures can also occur. The seizures can occur prepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum. If the seizure occurs postpartum, it usually occurs within the first 24 hours after delivery; however, late postpartum eclamptic convulsions are by no means rare and have been reported as late as 23 days postpartum. Re: Re: Re: Psychomotor [Benign Neonatal Seizures](http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic240.htm):Benign neonatal convulsions are defined as seizures with onset after birth through day 28 in an otherwise healthy child with no other known medical or neurological problems. Such cases may be familial or isolated. Psychomotor development should be normal for a full-term or near full-term infant with benign convulsions. Between seizures, findings on neurologic examination should be normal. Clinically, the seizures are frequent and brief, occasionally occurring many times within a day. The episodes usually resolve within days but may continue for several months and have no neurological sequelae. The occurrence of status epilepticus is common in benign idiopathic neonatal convulsions (BINC) but is uncommon in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). Because BINC is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is nearly always made in retrospect, when the seizures spontaneously resolve and the infant is found to have neurologically normal development...

Perceived odors are usually unpleasant, often with a burning quality. o Gustatory seizures usually are associated with temporal lobe origin, although the insula and parietal operculum also have been implicated. Perceived tastes are typically unpleasant, often with a metallic component. o Vestibular seizures originate from various areas, including frontal and temporal-parietal-occipital junction.

Physical: The physical examination may show subtle or obvious neurological focality. * Immediately following a SPS, the focality may become more pronounced owing to postictal inhibition (eg, Todd paralysis). * If an examination is performed during a SPS, no impairment of awareness or responsiveness is observed. o Preservation of awareness implies that a person is able to recount simple events that happen during the ictus. This is best established by giving a specific, uncommon 2-syllable word to the patient during the SPS and asking for its recall soon after the seizure has resolved. o Preservation of responsiveness implies that a person is able to carry out simple commands or directed volitional actions. o Responsiveness may appear to be impaired because of interference by the motor manifestations of the SPS. o This is best established by asking the patient to perform simple, unilateral and bilateral neurological functions during the SPS. o If the patient is unable to perform a task because of the manifestations of the SPS, recollection of the instructions implies responsiveness was preserved. * Motor, sensory, special sensory, psychic, and autonomic manifestations may begin in a small anatomical area and spread to a larger area of the body.

[Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome):a chronic disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep at very late times, and also have difficulty waking up in the morning...People with DSPS tend to be extreme night owls. They feel most alert and say they function best and are most creative in the evening and at night. DSPS patients cannot simply force themselves to sleep early...There have been a few cases of DSPS developing into non 24-hour sleep-wake syndrome, a more severe and debilitating disorder in which the individual sleeps later each day... [Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_24-hour_sleep-wake_syndrome):In people with this disorder, the person's body essentially insists that the day is longer than 24 hours. This tends to not allow socially accepted sleeping patterns, and makes it difficult for the sufferer to sleep at \"normal\" times...Left untreated, non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome causes a person's sleep-wake cycle to change every day, the degree determined by how much over 24 hours the cycle lasts. The cycle may go around the clock, eventually returning to \"normal\" for one or two days before going \"off\" again...

Diseases that cause cerebral atrophy include: ...epilepsy, in which lesions cause abnormal electrochemical discharges that result in seizures... [Cortical Dysplasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_dysplasia):a benign tumor which occurs when the infant brain is developing in the womb. Occasionally neurons will develop that are larger than normal in certain areas. This causes the signals sent through the neurons in these areas to misfire, which sends an incorrect signal.

[Pyridoxine-Dependant Seizures (PDS)](http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2408.htm):Although rare, pyridoxine-dependent seizure (PDS) is a recognized cause of intractable seizures in neonates, psychomotor developmental delay, and, sometimes, death in untreated patients (Gupta, 2001; Baxter, 2001; Yoshikawa, 1999). Hunt et al first described PDS in 1954 (Gupta, 2001; Burd, 2000). Since then, fewer than 100 cases have been reported worldwide (Gupta, 2001; Yoshikawa, 1999). Later onset seizures due to pyridoxine deficiency have been reported (Gupta, 2001; Grillo, 2001). The 2 types of presentations are classic and atypical. The classic presentation consists of intractable seizures that appear within hours of birth and are resistant to conventional anticonvulsants. The seizures respond rapidly to administration of parenteral pyridoxine (Gupta, 2001). A trial of pyridoxine is recommended in all seizures that have no clear etiology and occur before the child is aged 18 months (Grillo, 2001)... [Epileptic and Epileptiform Encephalopathies](http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic547.htm):Recently, the ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology (Engel, 2001) proposed a modified diagnostic scheme for epileptic seizures and epilepsy that for the first time recognizes a distinct category for epileptic encephalopathies in which the epileptiform abnormalities may contribute to progressive dysfunction. This category includes the following: early myoclonic encephalopathy, Ohtahara syndrome, nonprogressive encephalopathies, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and epilepsy with continuous slow wave sleep (CSWS)...

Thus, it consists of an etiological concept, not of a syndrome with homogeneous electroclinical pattern. In fact, it comprises several subgroups, each subgroup consisting of an epilepsy syndrome. These subgroups are reported as \u00e2\u20acsevere myoclonic epilepsy in infancy\u00e2\u20ac in infancy\u00e2\u20ac (Dravet et al 1992b), and cases that begin later in childhood. Thus, series reported by Doose and coworkers include at least three different syndromes of myoclonic epilepsy...
