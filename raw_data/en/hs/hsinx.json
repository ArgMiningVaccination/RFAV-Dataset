Mind-body therapies (MBTs) are promising forms of treatment for cancer patients living with depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of MBTs in cancer patients living with depression, anxiety, or insomnia. EMBase, PubMed, Cinahl, PsychINFO, IndMED, CSI-NISCAIR, CNKI, Clinicaltrial.gov, ChiCTR, and CTRI will be searched until October 2020 for relevant studies. Randomized controlled studies in which MBTs were tested in a cancer population will be selected. The authors of the selected studies will be contacted to obtain individual participant data. The participants who reached a defined clinical threshold for depression, anxiety, or insomnia will be selected for the three sub-studies on depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. Pairwise and network meta-analyses will be used to assess the changes in depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and completion rate. We will assess the effect of the treatment dose (number and frequency of interventions) on effectiveness. The results of this study will inform clinical decision-making for the treatment of psychological disturbances in cancer patients. If MBTs are found effective, they will potentially be recommended as treatments for cancer patients with psychological symptoms.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-19", "cleaned_text": "Patients Living with Depression, Anxiety or Insomnia (MIRACLE): A Systematic Review with Individual Participant Data which is roughly double the rates of the general population [ [3](#B3-mps-04-00076), [4](#B4-mps-04-00076), [5](#B5-mps-04-00076), [6](#B6-mps-04-00076)]. This higher prevalence can be attributed to the shock caused by a cancer diagnosis [ [7](#B7-mps-04-00076)], the burden of cancer treatment [ [8](#B8-mps-04-00076)], and the correlations between different psychological symptoms and between these symptoms and fatigue and pain [ [9](#B9-mps-04-00076), [10](#B10-mps-04-00076), [11](#B11-mps-04-00076), [12](#B12-mps-04-00076), [13](#B13-mps-04-00076), [14](#B14-mps-04-00076)]. In this context, treatments targeting different aspects of physical and psychological health have a decisive advantage in the treatment of psychological disturbances in cancer patients. [15](#B15-mps-04-00076)] and impacts treatment outcomes [ [16](#B16-mps-04-00076), [17](#B17-mps-04-00076), [18](#B18-mps-04-00076)]. Moreover, the hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA) present in psychological disturbances weakens the immune system, affecting its ability to fight cancer [ [19](#B19-mps-04-00076)]. For the above reasons, psychological disturbances increase mortality in cancer patients [ [20](#B20-mps-04-00076), [21](#B21-mps-04-00076)]. The effective management of psychological symptoms improves both adherence to anti-cancer treatment and mortality rates [ [22](#B22-mps-04-00076), [23](#B23-mps-04-00076), [24](#B24-mps-04-00076)]. [25](#B25-mps-04-00076), [26](#B26-mps-04-00076)]. Although the efficacy of these treatments has been proven, they tend to induce adverse reactions, such as morning sedation, anterograde amnesia, falls, undesired sleep behavior, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight and anxiety [ [27](#B27-mps-04-00076), [28](#B28-mps-04-00076), [29](#B29-mps-04-00076), [30](#B30-mps-04-00076), [31](#B31-mps-04-00076), [32](#B32-mps-04-00076)]. Moreover, long-term use of psychotropic medications increases the risk of dementia, diabetes, and cancer, and increases the overall mortality rates [ [33](#B33-mps-04-00076), [34](#B34-mps-04-00076), [35](#B35-mps-04-00076), [36](#B36-mps-04-00076), [37](#B37-mps-04-00076), [38](#B38-mps-04-00076), [39](#B39-mps-04-00076)]. Patients non-pharmacological approaches [ [40](#B40-mps-04-00076), [41](#B41-mps-04-00076)]. [42](#B42-mps-04-00076), [43](#B43-mps-04-00076)]. They include ancient practices, such as yoga, qi gong, and tai chi, and modern therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training and progressive muscular relaxation (PMR). Due to their broad effect on well-being, including improved mood, reduced pain, higher energy levels, and higher social functioning, MBTs seem to be ideal treatment approaches for psychological disturbances in cancer patients [ [44](#B44-mps-04-00076), [45](#B45-mps-04-00076), [46](#B46-mps-04-00076), [47](#B47-mps-04-00076), [48](#B48-mps-04-00076), [49](#B49-mps-04-00076), [50](#B50-mps-04-00076)]. They are also relatively safe and widely accessible to cancer patients in many parts of the world. [51](#B51-mps-04-00076), [52](#B52-mps-04-00076), [53](#B53-mps-04-00076), [54](#B54-mps-04-00076), [55](#B55-mps-04-00076), [56](#B56-mps-04-00076)]. However, these reviews included both participants living with and not living with psychological disturbances. They did not report the acceptability of the interventions, which is an important aspect to consider in decision-making, as cancer patients have limited time and energy. They did not report either the treatment dose (number and frequency of treatments) necessary to achieve clinically significant improvements. Thus, a review of the effectiveness and acceptability of MBTs in cancer patients living with depression, anxiety, or insomnia is needed. [57](#B57-mps-04-00076)]. Therefore, it is crucial to collect the individual participant data (IPD) from these RCTs and conduct a meta-analysis with the data from participants who meet the clinical thresholds for depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia. Different MBTs are rarely compared to each other in clinical trials; therefore, a network meta-analysis (NMA) is necessary to assess the relative effectiveness of different MBTs. 2. Methods [58](#B58-mps-04-00076), [59](#B59-mps-04-00076)]. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021240595). The results of this review will be published separately for each of the sub-studies. The Human Research Ethics Committee of Western Sydney University, Australia exempted the present review from ethical review. The methodological processes of the study are reported in [Figure 1](#mps-04-00076-f001). 2.1. Study Selection 2.1.1. Study Design 2.1.2. Participants [60](#B60-mps-04-00076)]; (2) CES-D score 20 [ [61](#B61-mps-04-00076)]; (3) BDI score 16 [ [62](#B62-mps-04-00076)]; (4) HAMD score 12 [ [63](#B63-mps-04-00076)]; (5) POMS depression score 7 [ [64](#B64-mps-04-00076)]; (6) PHQ-2 score 2 [ [60](#B60-mps-04-00076)]; (7) HADS-D 11 [ [65](#B65-mps-04-00076)]; (8) PROMIS depression scale score 8 [ [66](#B66-mps-04-00076)]; (9) DASS-D score 10 [ [67](#B67-mps-04-00076)]; (10) SCL-90 depression score 25 [ [63](#B63-mps-04-00076)]; (11) MADRS score 12 [ [68](#B68-mps-04-00076)]; and (12) BDI-II score 14 [ [69](#B69-mps-04-00076)]. If the participant was assessed with two of these tools, the decision will be based on one assessment tool, in the above order of priority. [70](#B70-mps-04-00076)]; (2) HAMA score 11 [ [71](#B71-mps-04-00076)]; (3) BAI score 12 [ [72](#B72-mps-04-00076)]; (4) HADS-A 11 [ [65](#B65-mps-04-00076)]; (5) STAI-S 51 [ STAI-T [ [73](#B73-mps-04-00076)]; (6) DASS-A 8 [ [67](#B67-mps-04-00076)]; (7) PROMIS anxiety score 8 [ [66](#B66-mps-04-00076)]; (8) GAD-2 3 [ [70](#B70-mps-04-00076)]; (9) POMS anxiety score 16 [ [74](#B74-mps-04-00076)]; and (10) PSWQ 62 [ [75](#B75-mps-04-00076)]. If the participant was assessed with two of these tools, the decision will be based on one assessment tool, in the above order of priority. [76](#B76-mps-04-00076)]; (2) PSQI score 6 [ [77](#B77-mps-04-00076)]; and (3) AISI score 6 [ [78](#B78-mps-04-00076)]. If the participant was assessed with two of these tools, the decision will be based on one assessment tool, in the above order of priority. 2.1.3. Interventions [79](#B79-mps-04-00076)]. Meditation, mindfulness-based therapies, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, yoga-based interventions, tai chi, qigong, visualization and imagery, hypnosis and self-suggestion, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation training\u2014including compound interventions of the above\u2014will be included in this review. Psychotherapy, exercise therapy, and acupuncture will not be accepted. Compound interventions, including MBT and counseling, education, and/or diet, will not be accepted except in cases where the non-MBT interventions are minor. In the NMA, the interventions will be grouped by label (e.g., \"yoga\", \"qigong\") rather than treatment components (e.g., breathing techniques, mindfulness). For example, two interventions respectively labeled \"yoga\" and \"qigong\" by the study authors but involving the same components (e.g., breathing techniques and posture) will be grouped under two different categories. 2.1.4. Controls 2.1.5. Outcomes 2.2. Search 2.3. Screening 2.4. Data Extraction - List of authors and contact details - Year of publication - Treatment arms with sample size (intention-to-treat) - Selection of participants according to insomnia, anxiety, or depression diagnosis and diagnostic tool - Participant characteristics (gender, age, type and stage of cancer, type and stage of anticancer treatment) - Intervention details (intervention name, treatment frequency and duration, session duration, mode of delivery, presence of home practice) for both experimental and control groups - Outcome measures - Outcome at baseline, during treatment, and at post-treatment 2.5. Data Request - Participant covariates (gender, age, type and stage of cancer, type and stage of anti-cancer treatment, presence and type of psychotropic treatment) - All relevant outcomes for any time point - Adherence to treatment (number of sessions completed) - Completion status, with the withdrawal time point and reason in the case of non-completion 2.6. Data Management and Preparation 2.7. Risk of Bias Assessment [80](#B80-mps-04-00076)]. The risk of bias, in terms of the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcomes, selection of the reported results, and overall bias, is judged using the categories of \"low\", \"some concerns\", or \"high\". The risk of bias will be assessed for the primary outcome of the study. In case the information from the report(s) is not sufficient to reach a judgment about the risk of bias, the author of the study will be contacted for clarifications. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion and consulting a third team member reviewer. 2.8. Publication Bias Assessment 2.9. Heterogeneity and Consistency Assessment [59](#B59-mps-04-00076)]. In the case of a high level of heterogeneity, the reason for the heterogeneity (e.g., participant type, intervention type, or duration) will be investigated. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of these factors on the results of the studies. [84](#B84-mps-04-00076)] will be included in the NMA. Inconsistency between direct and indirect sources of evidence will be statistically assessed globally (through the comparison of the fit and parsimony of the consistency and inconsistency models) and locally (through the calculation of the differences between direct and indirect estimates in all closed loops in the network). 2.10. Pairwise and Network Meta-Analyses 2.11. Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses - Cancer site - Cancer stage, separating early stages (stages 0 and I) and late stages (stages II, III, and IV) - Presence or absence of concomitant anti-cancer treatment - Concomitant usage of psychotropic treatment - Presence or absence of home practice - Gender - Only studies in which the overall risk of bias was low - Studies in which the IPD was available and studies in which the IPD was not available (the aggregated mean from the reports will be compared) - Studies in which mental disorders were diagnosed according to a recognized diagnostic standard 3.
