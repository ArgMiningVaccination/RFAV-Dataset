Now that your kids are back in school, it's time for you to explore some new things too, right? I'm working through two different e-courses (gotta show my kids that learning never ends!) and am so very excited to share more about and recommend one of them today \u2014 [Vaccines Demystified](https://naturopathicpediatrics.com/?ref=34). Honestly, I've been on the lookout for something like this for ages. Like, since Jemma was born eight years ago. Over the years I've read books and taken a few in-person classes on the topic of vaccinations, but this one is definitely the most thorough ... and unbiased. Vaccines Demystified doesn't say vaccinations are evil, it doesn't say they're 100% fool proof, it doesn't say to do these and not those. Rather, it provides data and studies and opens up a conversation with a naturopath who truly cares. Vaccines Demystified was created by Dr. Erika Krumbeck, a naturopathic pediatrician practicing in Missoula, Montana. In her self-paced webinar, she outlines each vaccination currently recommended for infants and children and provides unbiased, reliable information answering the most common questions about vaccines. The links to studies she references in her video discussions alone are a gold mine! In this course you'll learn: - How to naturally support your child through vaccinations - What vaccines contain thimerosal - What vaccines have preservatives and what is known about vaccine additives - Why aluminum is in vaccines, what a vaccine adjunct is, and what vaccines are low in aluminum - What side effects can happen and how common they are - Why your child should avoid Tylenol around the time of vaccinations - What vaccinations your child really needs - ... and so much more! If you've ever asked, \"What is the actual chance of my child contracting a vaccine preventable disease? How serious would it be?\" or \"What is the actual chance of my child getting a vaccine side effect or vaccine adverse reaction?\" this course is definitely for you! On the flip side, if you feel super convinced about vaccines - one way or the other - you probably won't be happy. So, just keep that in mind :) Vaccines Demystified is normally $149, but I was so impressed with the class and wanted to share so I connected with the team at Naturopathic Pediatrics and became an affiliate. Better yet, I was able to coordinate a wonderful sale just for my readers - $39.95!
