This rise can also be attributed to our health system's tendency to treat symptoms and not address root causes and an increased need for integrative therapies that don't carry side effects. PEMF is a technology with a long history of supporting those with health issues, yet they are unknown to the average person. What are EMFs? EMFs, or electromagnetic fields, are produced by the body's atoms, chemicals, and cells. Each organ in the body generates its unique bio-electromagnetic field. These fields enable cells to communicate with each other, facilitating trillions of chemical reactions per second. For the body to maintain optimal health, these cellular communications must be precise, synchronized, and uninterrupted. Any disruption or blockage can compromise the cells, tissues, and organs, leading to unhealthy symptoms. EMF therapies, such as magnetic therapy, have been researched and used worldwide for decades. Magnetic therapy is based on treating the body with specifically designed EMF signals. These signals enable each cell to resonate sympathetically, reinforcing its internal vibration. This helps to facilitate the body's healing processes. Georges Lakhovsky first proposed the principle behind magnetic therapy in 1939. Understanding EMFs is crucial to maintaining optimal health. Ensuring that the body's cellular communications are fluid and precise can prevent unhealthy symptoms and promote overall wellness. EMF therapies, such as magnetic therapy, can also be useful tools in facilitating the body's healing processes. How EMFs Affect You EMFs that are man-made and unnatural come from electrical wiring and equipment, producing potentially harmful electrosmog that stresses the body. With the increasing use of technology, people are constantly bombarded with EMFs from wi-fi, cell phones, and other devices, which can add to the daily burden. Therapeutic PEMFs, however, are different and can provide beneficial balancing frequencies to decrease the negative effects of electrosmog and promote healthy cellular communication. PEMF therapy differs from EMFs in that its central principle is enhancing cell-cell communication. This communication is essential for multiple functions within the body. PEMF therapy is like charging a battery, stimulating cells, and generating small microcurrents that tend to run along nerve pathways. This increases intercellular communication, metabolic processes, circulation, oxygenation, alkalization, ATP production, and optimized cell membrane potential. As a result, cells regenerate, oxidative stress and inflammation are reduced, immune responses are strengthened, feel-good endorphins are boosted, and depleted adrenal, and other endocrine gland functions are restored. Improving intercellular communication is crucial because defects in this communication are associated with various diseases, including diabetes, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis, cancer, neuropathy, infertility, and other conditions (Trosko et al., 1998). Activating the intracellular signaling mechanism is a key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of PEMFs (Seegers, 2001). PEMF Therapy Explained PEMF stands for Pulsed Electromagnetic Field therapy, which is a type of therapy that promotes cellular communication to enhance self-healing and wellness. This therapy has gained popularity recently for its effectiveness in treating autoimmune and chronic disease states. Patients struggling with physical and cognitive issues resulting from Lyme disease, infectious disease, injury, and autoimmune disease often benefit from PEMF therapy. At our center in Ridgefield, CT, we use PEMF to help those struggling with mental health issues. We offer in-person treatment and remote treatment options with mobile devices. CALM PEMF is a portable PEMF device that offers PEMF therapy wherever you go. Cellular communication plays a critical role in the body's adaptation and regulation processes that help maintain overall health and manage the symptoms and causes of cell deterioration and disease. Each organ in the body has its bio-electromagnetic field, and every cell communicates through electromagnetic signals or fields at a rate of trillions of chemical reactions per second. To maintain balance and good health, the body's organs, tissues, and subsystems require precise communication to process these instantaneous exchanges effectively. When these critical communication exchanges are disrupted or blocked, the body's cells, tissues, and organs may be compromised, leading to unhealthy symptoms. How PEMF Affects Cellular Communication Every organ in the body generates its unique bio-electromagnetic field. PEMF therapy is a technique that modifies these energy fields to enhance cellular functioning. Health-enhancing EMFs can be provided by delivering controlled and pulsed electromagnetic frequencies (PEMF) to the cells, which can counteract the negative impact of environmental stressors and toxins that affect people daily. Low-frequency PEMFs, even at their weakest strengths, can penetrate every cell, tissue, organ, and bone without being absorbed or altered. PEMF technology uses pulsed low-frequency energy fields, which stimulate electrical and chemical processes in the tissues as they pass through. PEMF therapy enhances cellular energy, resulting in better cellular health and function. With PEMF therapy, the body can more efficiently process cellular communication channels' electrical and chemical exchanges. This can help to address imbalances or dysfunctions in those areas, leading to improved adaptation and natural healing. Overall, PEMF therapy can be a powerful tool for improving cellular communication and promoting better health and wellness. What Are PEMF Therapy Side Effects? Side effects after a PEMF aren't typical. Less than five percent of individuals experience side effects after a session. The majority of side effects can be resolved by changing protocols. Detoxification effect or death of bacteria (herxing) is the most common source of side effects. Detoxification support before or after sessions can also be a helpful tool to support the body's healing process. Research and PEMF The therapeutic use of magnetic therapy is now well-established, with a growing number of double-blind placebo-controlled studies and many modalities now approved by the US FDA and regulatory bodies worldwide for pathologies such as bone repair, pain, inflammation, and chronic repair (Pilla, 2006). Recent research studies have added to the growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of PEMF therapy in enhancing cellular communication and promoting healing in the body. For instance, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that PEMF therapy significantly reduced pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Zeng et al., 2021). Another study found that PEMF therapy can improve sleep quality in individuals with chronic low back pain (de Pedro et al., 2020). A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that PEMF therapy can significantly reduce pain intensity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Wang et al., 2021). Another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that PEMF therapy can improve wound healing in individuals with diabetic foot ulcers (Choi et al., 2020). These recent studies add to the growing evidence of the beneficial effects of PEMF therapy on cellular communication and overall health. By utilizing low-frequency energy fields to stimulate electrical and chemical processes in the tissues, PEMF therapy can improve adaptation and natural healing, making it a promising treatment option for various pathologies. What is CALM PEMF? [CALM PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) is a unique approach to health and wellness that uses low-frequency Hz-based Electromagnetic Technology to help the body better self-regulate, adapt, and heal naturally. It helps to align the body so the brain can work better. It is used to support a variety of physical and mental health needs. Through a unique customized program, PEMF combines frequency, intensity, and signal modulation to stimulate the specific channels needed best to support the natural electromagnetic activities of the body. PEMF signals target specific communication channels to clear blockages and restore communication pathways. It does this by filtering out the disharmonic \"unhealthy\" vibrations that interfere with optimal cell communication to promote optimal functioning. During a therapeutic session, \"healthy\" harmonic frequencies are amplified and returned to the cells. These harmonic frequencies \"invigorate\" the cells and promote beneficial cellular communication. Once the cells work more optimally, the nervous system calms down, diminishing the disruptive signals, such as pain, which have become magnified over time. PEMF provides feedback to the body about those bioelectrical signals. The nervous system then uses that feedback to reorganize and improve intercellular communication. With the feedback, the cells better align themselves within the organ system and the entire body. The individuals experience feelings of wellness. The great part of PEMF is that it often works synergistically with various traditional and [holistic therapies](https://drroseann.com/24-holistic-remedies-chronic-conditions-healing-whole-person/), including nutrition therapy, homeopathy, [neurofeedback](https://drroseann.com/httpcertify-bcia-org4dcgievents520-htmlactionconference_detailconfid_w520/), biofeedback, psychotherapy, OT, PT, etc. For example, it is common for a patient with addiction to use PEMF with Neurofeedback, naturopathic care, and psychotherapy. How is CALM PEMF different from Traditional PEMF Therapy? Our [Calm PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) device devices employ PEMF signals uniquely designed to couple with the body's vibrations, thus providing therapeutic benefits by enhancing the body's natural healing abilities. Unlike other devices, Calm PEMF uses frequencies for mental wellness and sends them to the cells. Our customized protocols were created to address attention/learning, stress/anxiety, infections/toxins, mood/behavior regulation, and obsessions and compulsions. How Does PEMF Help the Body and Brain? PEMF has many therapeutic advantages. Most patients notice the immediate benefit of feeling relaxed. It is a potent tool to support [detoxification](https://drroseann.com/pans-pandas-cases-are-on-the-rise/), essential for healing.

Autoimmune illness and chronic disease states are on the rise. PEMF is used to support a variety of conditions to aid the body in self-healing. At our office, we use CALM PEMF with individuals suffering from stand-alone issues like pain or depression, but we also use it with patients experiencing multiple issues simultaneously. There are many [benefits of PEMF in supporting mental health](https://drroseann.com/pemf-for-anxiety-ocd-and-depression/) because PEMF calms the central nervous system and helps to move on from a stress-activated sympatric dominant state to a relaxed parasympathetic state. - Mental health conditions, including [anxiety](https://drroseann.com/anxiety-treatment/), [OCD](https://drroseann.com/what-causes-ocd-in-children-and-teens/), [Depression](https://drroseann.com/depression-mood-issues/), [Behavioral issues](https://drroseann.com/behavioral-issues/), etc. - Allergies & Sensitivities - Chronic Illness ( [Lyme](https://drroseann.com/how-does-lyme-affect-the-brain/), [PANS/PANDAS](https://drroseann.com/pans-pandas-cases-are-on-the-rise/), autoimmune conditions, &, etc.) - Medication Detoxification - Detoxification - Pain - Sports Injury - Sleep What is a PEMF Therapy Session Like? An in-office PEMF session encompasses sitting in a comfy chair during a therapy session. A pad on your back and various sensors are attached to your body. There is a constant process of measurement and altering to support your body's change. The body's nervous system then uses that feedback to reorganize itself and improve its own intercellular communication. It is a very relaxing, low-stress experience. Patients often sleep, meditate, watch movies, listen to music, or read books. At our office, it isn't unusual for a clinician to conduct a psychotherapy session when someone is hooked up to PEMF. As noted previously, the majority of patients feel very relaxed after. Each patient's experience is completely subjective, and the number of sessions needed to support wellness varies from patient to patient. Our [Calm PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) device is portable, with no pads and wires. No matter how busy you are, you can use it easily. PEMF is a non-invasive [holistic therapy](https://drroseann.com/24-holistic-remedies-chronic-conditions-healing-whole-person/) that is clinically valid and offers another tool to help promote wellness and healing. It is safe for both children and adults and should be considered to improve wellness and reduce chronic stress, as [long-term stress](https://drroseann.com/how-does-stress-affect-your-child/) will always lead to physical and mental health issues and should never be ignored.
