Participant nutrition, physical activity, cooking knowledge, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were measured before, during, and three months after the parent education intervention. To address the research questions, this dissertation employed mixed -methods and pre-experimental survey design in evaluating the effectiveness of the parent workshops. The planned inter vention consisted of a 4 -week program, meeting once a week for 2\u00bd hours at each meeting, for a total of 10 hours of instruction. In order to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in changing participant s knowledge and behavior, quantitative data were collected through survey administration . There were a total of 202 participants who consented to participate in the research study . To augment the quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from participants in the program during xi debriefing session s at week 4 and at the follow up sessions in week 12. In addition, during the follow up sessions in week 12, one-on-one questioning was completed with each participant . Results suggest that participants used the knowledge gained in the classes to create healthier home environments for their children and families. Using both quantitative and qualitative measures, major findings indicated participants in all five schools reported : (1) significantly increasing their nutrition, cooking, and physical activity knowledge from pretest to posttest and follow -up; (2) significantly decreasing their body weight and BMI from pretest to posttest; and (3) making significant changes in cooking, eating, and physical activity behaviors. 1 CHAPTER 1 STATEMENT OF T HE PROBLEM The dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity, now being described as a pandemic, as well as the serious consequences of childhood obesity including the health and financial burdens that transpire as a result, have prompted the need for broad interventions in order to address this public health issue (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole, Waldrop, DAuria, & Garner, 2006; Foster et al., 2007). To further compound this issue, evidence indicates childhood obesity and unhealth y diets may also lead to poor academic performance in school ( Florence, Asbridge , & Veugelers, 2008; Hunt, 2008). One of the greatest concerns sur rounding the obesity epidemic is also the racial/ethnic disparities that exist in the prevalence of obesity th roughout the United States (Whitaker & Orzol, 2006). Based on the National Health and Nutrition Surveys, the prevalence of overweight conditions among preschool children has almost doubled in the last three decades (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001), and is hi ghest in Latinos (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Ogden & Carroll, 2010), nearly 50% higher than other ethnicities in the U nited States (Whitaker & Orzol, 2006). Latino children are the largest minority group in the U.S. educational system (U.S. Department o f Education, 2011), and they compose half of the school population in California (Madsen , Weedn, & Crawford , 2010) where this study took place . Given the dramatic concerns about childhood obesity, it is imperative to provide interventions early on so that children develop and adopt healthy eating and fitness habits 2 that they can carry into adulthood. Public schools can be ideal settings for intervention programs given that they typically serve 1 to 2 meals a day, can provide physical activity in a safe en vironment, and have educators who can be trained in the curriculum (Cole et al., 2006). In addition, e ffective interventions for weight loss in obese children have been shown to be successful when parents and adult caregivers are motivated and understand their role in establishing healthy eating habits among their children (American Academic of Pediatrics, 2003; Golan & Crow , 2004; Must et al., 1992 ). In response, the development of partnerships between schools and community agencies to provide family - based interventions has been suggested ( Cole et al., 2006 ; Evans et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2008 ). However, there have been limited systematic follow -up evaluation s of the effectiveness of such programs in changing families nutrition and fitness habits af ter the completion of programs ( Gonzalez -Suarez , Grimmer -Somers, & Dones, 2009 ; Story, 1999 ). Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this study examined the effectiveness of a school/community based partnership intervention program located in a culturally diverse region in California where Latino families compose the majority of the community and school district population (Madsen et al. , 2010) . The intervention was designed to increase families nutrition knowledge and modify nutrition and p hysical activity behaviors. Specifically, this study evaluated participants perceptions of the intervention program and evaluated whether participants and their families made changes to their eating behaviors, nutrition, cooking, and physical activity du ring the intervention and three months after the completion of the program. Problem Statement Childhood obesity is reaching pandemic proportions particularly for Latino 3 families (Carmona, 2003; Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Ogden & Carroll, 2010 ) resulting in significant health issues for children such as diabetes, heart disease, apnea, asthma, etc. ( American Diabetes Association [ ADA ], 2010; Centers for Disease Control [CDC ], 2009), as well as poor school perfo rmance 2008 ; Schwartz & Puhl , 2003). According to the CDC (2009), childhood overweight is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) at 85th to 95th percentile of the growth chart, while childhood obesity is defined as a BMI over the 95th percentile. BMI is a key index for relating a person's body weight to their height. The BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared. BMI has become the standard medical measure used for determining overweigh t and obesity. Using BMI as the medical measure, data from the CDC indicate d that 15% of children between ages 6 and 19 are overweight and that one in five children is overweight or obese. There have been several interventions developed to combat childhoo d obesity. Some are school -based interventions that could be defined as interventions designed fo r children in the school setting (Lane, 2001) , and some are school -based parent interventions. School -based parent interventions may be defined as partnering with schools to implement interventions that focus on educating the parent s regarding healthy lifestyles (Reschly, n.d.). Story (1999) reviewed the research on the evaluation of school -based obesity intervention programs for twelve controlled experimenta l studies , which were published between 1965 and 1996. He found that only two of the twelve studies had conducted follow -up research to determine the effectiveness of the program. In his review of these 4 studies, Story found the key interventions for prev enting a nd treating obesity were increasing physical activity and increasing the consumption of healthier foods . However, he found very little research regarding the actual effectiveness of intervention programs in changing eating habits, physical activit y, and cooking had been conducted . The interventions in schools that he reviewed were not school -based parent interventions. More recently, Gonzalez -Suarez et al. (2009) conducted a meta -analysis of school -based obesity intervention programs published be tween 1995 and 2007 . The meta - analysis showed there was convincing evidence that school -based interventions were effective, at least short -term, in reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity. However, based on their meta -analysis they suggested the need for follow -ups, after the completion of the intervention, to determine the long -term effectiveness of the programs . Similar to Story (1999), no school -based parent interventions were noted. Research by Cole et al. (2006) found that programs consisting of a curriculum incorporating lifestyle habits, nutrition education, and physical activity may encourage positive behavioral changes in children . They suggested however, that these child -based interventions must consider the childs social context, which in cludes the school, community, and home environment. In addition, Cole et al. noted the importance of family involvement. Other researchers would agree, noting that parents are the decision makers and empirical base of the family ( Golan & Crow , 2004) . Epstein (2009) has suggested parent involvement is a key factor to the success of any program in schools. Interventions that are child and family centered have been tried and found to be influential in combatting the problem (Cooke et al., 2003; Skidmore & Yarnell, 2004). Efforts to intervene at school level have been suggested , and results indicate d that school - 5 based parent education programs are successful and can be effective in childhood obesity prevention (Cole et al., 2006 ; Evans et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2007; Li & Hooker, 2010 ). However, systematic evaluation and long term follow -up of school -based parent education interventions have not been conducted. This dissertation study took place in a culturally -diverse region in Southern California , in wh ich Latino families compose the majority of the population ( Valley Care Community Consortium [VCCC] , 2010), and obesity and diabetes are major health concerns. The intervention program at The Center for Healthier Communities (CHC) at Northridge Hospit al Medical Center (NHMC) focused on reducing childhood obesity and diabetes through their School -based Obesity and Diabetes Initiative (SODI). The parent education component called \"A Taste of Good Health \" focused on increasing awareness and providing guideli nes on healthy nutrition choices, food label reading, recipe modification, smart shopping, and related nutritional and healthy lifestyle information. The SODI program of NHMC has collaborated with California State University, Northridge (CSUN), Northeast Valley Health Corporation (NEVHC), Women , Infant s Children Program , and Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD ) to conduct nutrition education and cooking classes in a number of Los Angeles Unified School District ( LAUSD ) elementary schools for four ye ars. The goal is to increase nutrition knowledge, modify nutrition and physical activity behaviors, and ultimately counter childhood obesity and diabetes in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, CA . The program evaluated in the present study consisted of a 4 -week series of classes, meeting one time a week for two and a half hours. The curriculum consisted of a 30-minute lecture, a 30 -minute session of physical activity, 30 minutes of hands -on 6 learning activit ies, and 30 to 60 minutes of cooking and ta ste testing. Some of the topics covered were label reading, physical activity, eating healthy meals, shopping and dining out tips, the importance of breakfast, easy cooking techniques, and recipe modifications. Similar to other intervention programs, sys tematic evaluation of this program had not been conducted. Although the \"A Taste of Good Health: School -based Parent and Family Healthy Lifestyles Classes \" program had been successful based on verbal feedback from previous participants and a few posttests, a sys tematic empirical evaluation had not been conduc ted to determine if families mad e changes in their eating behaviors, nutrition, cooking, and physical activity during the classes and again 12 weeks after completing the school -based parent education cl asses. Purpose and Significance The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the \"A Taste of Good Health\" program affected healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in a large urban school district. Participant nutrition, physical activity, cooking knowledge , and BMI were measured before, during, and three months after the parent education intervention . Given the pandemic proportions of childhood obesity (American Aca demy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole et al. , 2006; Foster et al., 2007 ), and the research calling for the evaluation of school/community partnerships that are focused on family -based interventio ns, there was a crit ical need to evaluate this program that can be used in other schools and districts implementing school/community partnership interventions with a focus on parent education. This study is significant as it will add to the current body of literature on the effectiveness of school -based parent interventions for obesity prevention. Furthermore, it 7 aimed to inform stak eholders of the importance of conducting a systematic evaluation and follow -up to determine the effectiveness of these interventions. Research Questions and Hypothes is In order to evaluate how \"A Taste of Good Health\" classes affect healthful behavior in p arent partic ipants and their families, it was hypothesized that providi ng an intervention which focused on educating parents on nutrition, physical activity, and cooking would result in their adopting a more healthy lifestyle. The f ollowing research quest ions guide d this study: 1. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on participants knowledge regarding nutrition, cooking, and physical activity? 2. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants? 3. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on cooking, eating habits, and physical activity of the participants and their families? 4. What comments , observations, and suggestions do participants of the program have to guide any changes to the program? Conceptual Framework The conceptual framework that guided this study incorporate d components of Epsteins School, Family , and Community Partnership Mod el (Epstein, 2011) , and Golan and Weizman s (2001) conceptual model of the familial approach to the treatment of childhood obesity . Epstein (2009) proposed that succes sful parent education programs require the involvement and partnership between the f amily, community , and school. Epstein further 8 noted that programs that have included this partnership have been able to produce successful results . Epstein (2011) developed a framework for defining six different types of parent involvement. The six types of parent involvement are parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision -making , and collaborating with the community. This framework assists educators in developing school and family partnership programs. According to Epstein (2011), there are many reasons for developing these partnerships. The main purpose for creating partnerships is to help children be successful in school and throughout life (Epstein, 2011). She stresses the importance of such programs in an effort to help youth deal with issues both present -day and in the future (Epstein, 2009). According to Epstein (2011) , these partnership s have shown an increase in both student achievement and resources from schools community partners , such as physical activity equipment or n utrition experts to conduct workshops. The framework demonstrates why it is important to involve the community, the parents, and schools. It was hypothesized that the partnership developed with participants through the school -based parent nutrition educa tion program in the present study allowed the parents to be involved and take a leadership role in successfully implementing a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their families Similarly, Golan and Weizman (2001) emphasized the importance of parent al involvement . They describe d a conceptual model for a family -based approach to the treatment of obesity in young children. They stress ed the integration of behavioral, social learning, and family system approaches. They place d emphasis on the approach of a healthy lifestyle, and the p arents' role and responsibility in the control of healthy behavior in children. Golan and Weiz man view ed the familial approach to the treatment of 9 childhood obesity as consisting of changes in parental cognition, behavior, a nd environment as they relate to a healthy lifestyle. Parent s cognitive and behavioral changes (e.g., i ncreased nutrition and health skills and increased parenting skills ) can cause parents to become role models for a healthy lifestyle and thus make chan ges in the home environment to incorporate healthy nutrition and fitness habits . The school -based parent education program in this study derived from Golan and Weizmans (2001) conceptual model for a family -based approach in the treatment of obesity in yo ung children. By using the integration of behavioral, social learning , and family system approaches, Golan and Weizman emphasize d healthy lifestyle and parent responsibility in the control of healthy behaviors in children. They stress ed the importance of parental involvement and its benefits in treating childhood obesity. In the long term, they have stressed the importance of a health -centered approach versus a weight -centered approach . A long -term healthy approach was the overall goal. Their approach looked at both the big picture and long -term picture in addressing childhood obesity. They have posit ed that simply focusing interventions on r educing weight in the present without making any behavior changes will not be effective , thus stressing the impo rtance of the health -centered approach. They have posit ed that rather than focusing only on weight reduction, parents need to work diligently to increase their knowledge and reduce childhood obesity as they play an integral role in shaping family practice s and behavior as they relate to leading a healthy lifestyle. Using their conceptual model as a framework, it was hypothesized that helping parents change their own behavior, and becoming role models, would lead to increasing parents ability to change th eir family environment and behavior regarding nutrition and fitness. 10 A logic model (\"A Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model ) is a way to visually represent the various components of the present project organized around the ideas presented in the conceptual fr amework outlined above. McLaughlin and Jordan (1999) developed a Logic Model process that has been used by evaluators and program managers for over 20 years to provide logical descriptions and linkages , which they term program inputs and outputs. They de fine inputs as the programs financial or human resources and partnerships. The program activities are the different steps needed to produce the outputs of the program, such as developing curriculums. The program outputs are the direct services or produc ts developed or provided to the participants. According to Mc Laughlin and Jordan (1999 ), by using this mod el, the performance measurements , defined as long -term, intermediate -term, and short -term outcomes , which are critical to the program , can be identifi ed and measure d. Using concepts from Golan and Weizman (2001) and Epstein (2011) , this study employed a logic model entitled \"A Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model as a method for evaluating the parent education intervention. In this study, the inputs inco rporated the family, community, and school as described by Epstein (2011). The outputs were conducting the actual parent workshops and using parents as agents of change as recommended by Golan and Weizman (2001). The short -term outcomes were to increase participant knowledge regarding healthy lifestyles and the importance of maintaining a healthy weight. The intermediate -term outcomes were to make nutrition, physical activity, and cooking behavior changes in participants. The long -term outcomes were to incorporate these programs in schools and therefore reduce the rates of obesity. It was the goal of this dissertation to evaluate and accomplish the short - and intermediate -term outcomes so that 11 they will be used in an effort to accomplish the long -term o utcomes in the future. Figure 1.1 presents the steps in the projects logic model. Figure 1.1 . \"A Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model Overview of Methodology To address the research q uestions, this study employ ed mixed -methods (Hanson, Creswell , Clark, Petska, & Creswell, 2005) and pre-experimental survey design (i.e., pretest, posttest follow -up design without a comparison/control group ) in evaluating the effectiveness of the parent workshops before, during, and after the intervention. As note d earlier, t he planned intervention consisted of a 4-week program, meeting once a week for two and a half hours at each meeting, for a total of ten hours of instruction. The program was implemented i n five schools in one local district in LAUSD . There we re a total of 202 Latino participants who consented to participate in the research study. There were 19 participants in school one, 38 participants in school two, 62 participants in school three, 51 participants in school four, and 35 participants in scho ol five who completed the pretest. Of the 202 participants, approximately 149 completed the posttest and 108 participants completed the follow -up surveys. In order to measure the effectiveness of 12 the intervention in changing participant s knowledge and b ehavior, q uantitative data were collected through surveys administered before, during, and three months after the completion of the intervention. The survey measured knowledge of healthy eating , physical activity, and cooking of the parents . To measure p articipant behavior changes in healthy eating, physical activity, and cooking, participants completed a behavior frequency questionnaire as a part of the survey. In order to determine whether the intervention influenced participant body weight, body mass, and percent body fat, their body weight and percent body fat was measured at week 0 (baseline), week 4 (posttest), and at week 12 (follow -up). According to Creswell (2008) quantitative research provides an explanation for the relationship among variables and can describe specific, measurable , and quantifiable trends and data. Thus, these methods were appropriate to address the research questions because they provided a narrow and specific measure of the variables indicated above. To augment the quantit ative data, qualitative data were collected from part icipants in the program during debriefing session s at week 4 and at the follow up sessions in week 12. In addition, during the follow up sessions in week 12, one-on-one questioning was completed with ea ch participant while they were being weighed . The following questions were asked during the week 4 large group debriefing session at each site to determine what changes were recommended for the overall improvement of the program and workshops. 1. How can th is program be changed or improved to be more helpful to you? 2. Which parts of the program were most useful? 3. Which parts of the program were least useful? 13 The questions asked during the debriefing sessions with all participants at the week 12 follow -up were: 1. What are some changes that you and your family have made to your cooking techniques because of the program? 2. What are some changes that you and your family have made to your eating and nutrition behaviors because of the program? 3. What are some changes that you and your family have made to your physical activity behaviors because of the program? During the week 12 follow -up session, each participant was individually asked to explain from their perspective how the program had benefited their children and famil y. According to Bogdan and Biklen (2007) , these methods were appropriate to the research questions because they allow ed the researcher to examine more in -depth what participants perceived to be changes in their cooking, physical activity , and eating beha vior as well as their perceptions of strengths and weaknesses of the program . Delimitations and Limitations According to Bryant (2004), delimitations are factors that the researcher uses to constrain the boundaries and narrow the scope of the study. The results may not be applied for all persons, places, or at all times. The delimitations of the study were as follows: 1. This study was being conducted in five schools in one local district in LAUSD, thus findings may not be generalizable to other schools or districts. 14 2. Participants were parents who volunteered to participate in the classes in five schools in one district. As a result, the data obtained may not be generalized or relevant to all populations. 3. All of the participants first language was Spanish. The intervention classes were taught by a bilingual dietitian . The participants completed surveys in their preferred language, and debriefings and one-on-one questions were conducted in participants preferred language. However, language barrie rs may have resulted in accuracy problems as the participants may not have understood the questions or may have misinterpreted the meaning of some questions. 4. The delimited conclusion arises because of the limited numbers. If more parents and schools fr om different districts were used, the findings may differ. For example, other districts may have different demographics and social/financial parents statuses. Parents may also have predetermined and preconceived nutrition knowledge. Limitations are inherent in qualitative and quantitative methodologies and will limit the study (Bryant, 2004). The limitations of the study were as follows: 1. The parents participating were volunteers and were not randomly selected. 2. The limitations for the quantitative methods of the study were small group sizes as it pertains to parents, and it may not be representative of the general population. 3. With the exception of the BMI measurements and researcher observations, qualitative and quantitative data were primarily based on partic ipants self - report. Thus, participants may not have reported information accurately. 15 4. The self-report survey was designed for the evaluation study, thus it was not a validated scale. However, the face validity of the scale was determi ned to be consistent with the curricul um taught in the program. 5. The survey may not have cover ed all the areas taught in the program due to time limitations. Thus, some areas of the program may not have been tested. Organization of the Dissertation Chapter 1 presented the issue of childhood obesity , which is reaching pandemic levels. The problem, purpose, significance , research questions , and conceptual framework were described. The chapter conclude d with an overview of the methodology and the delimits and limits of the study. Chapter 2 reviews current and relevant literature concerning childhood obesity as a pandemic and the effects on childrens health and success in school. Research regarding school -based childhood obesity intervention models and school -based parent interventions will be presented with a focus on parents as agents of change. Chapter 3 articulate s the method s used to address the research questions. Chapter 4 presents both quantitative and qualitative results of the study. Chapte r 5 discusses the findings in relation to the literature, implications for policy and practice, and recommendations for future research . 16 CHAPTER 2 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Childhood obesity is reaching pandemic proportions, particularly for Latino families (Carmona, 2003; Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Ogden & Carroll, 2010). Research tells us that childhood obesity results in significant health issues for children such as diabetes, heart disease, apnea, and asthma, (ADA, 2010; CDC, 2009), as well as poor school performance (Ball et al., 2004; Datar & Sturm, 2006; Datar et al., 2004; Hunt, 2008; Schwartz & Puhi, 2003). In response, schools and agencies across the country have implemented a variety of interventions designed to curb this pandemic. There a re relatively few studies, however, that engage in the systematic evaluation of these interventions, particularly studies that examine the long -term effects (Cole et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2008; Li & Hooker, 2010; Story, 1999). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the \"A Taste of Good Health: School -Based Parent Education Workshops\" program classes affect ed healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in selected schools in LAUSD not only upon immediate c ompletion of the series but also 12 weeks post program start. A formal program evaluation and follow -up has not been conducted on this school -based parent education program to examine the relationship between the workshop series and the participants eati ng behavior, physical activity, and cooking patterns after the completion of the program. The primary research questions that guide d this study were: (1) Are there significant differences at pretest, posttest, and follow -up on participants knowledge regarding nutrition, cooking, and physical activity? (2) Are there significant differences 17 at pretest, posttest, and follow -up on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants? (3) Are there significant differences at pretest, po sttest, and follow -up on cooking, eating habits, and physical activity of the participants and their families? and (4) What comments, observations, and suggestions do participants of the program have to guide any changes to the program? In order to evalua te how \"A Taste of Good Health\" classes affect healthful behavior in parent participants and their families, it was hypothesized that providing an intervention which focuse d on educating parents on nutrition, physical activity, and cooking would result in the adoption of a more healthy lifestyle. To situate this study in what is already known about childhood obesity and intervention strategies, this chapter will review the relevant literature concerning childhood obesity as a pandemic and the effects on ch ildrens health and success in school. Research regarding school -based childhood obesity intervention models and school -based parent education interventions will be presented next with a focus on promising practices. The role of parents as agents of chan ge will then be discussed. The review will conclude with a summary of the research and how this study may contribute to the current knowledge base. Obesity and Childhood Obesity as a Problem This section reviews studies that have focused on and explored obesity, particularly childhood obesity, as a major problem facing our nation today. It first describes the data related to obesity, particularly in the Latino population. Next, literature regarding causes associated with childhood obesity are reviewed. The section concludes by describing what the literature has identified as potential consequences of childhood obesity. 18 Incidence and Prevalence Childhood obesity has become a \"national cris is\" (Carmona, 2003). Based on the National Health and Nutrition Surveys, the prevalence of overweight conditions among preschool children has almost doubled in the last three decades (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001). The prevalence can be witnessed in schools serving K -12 students. In a recent paper, the Association of Latino Administrators and Superintendents (ALAS) emphasized childhood obesity as a growing major national concern and a public health issue which is pressing and that which is having an effect on youth (ALAS, 2011). Data from the Centers for Disease Cont rol (CDC) have indicate d that 15% of children between ages 6 and 19 are overweight (CDC, 2009). One in five children are overweight or obese. Results from the 2007 -2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate d that an estimated 16.9% of children and adolescents aged 2 -19 years were obese. Ogden and Carroll (2010 ) reported that between the years 1976 and 2008, the prevalence of obesity increased from 5.0% to 10.4% among preschool children, 6.5% to 19.6% among 6 -11 year old child ren, and 5.0% to 18.1% among 12 -19 year old adolescents. The rates of overweight are even higher in Los Angeles County where the present study took place . Statewide physical fitness testing programs were conducted in the year 2001 with public school stu dents in grades 5, 7, and 9. The Presidents Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition (2001) indicated that 21% of the students were overweight, and an additional 19% were at risk for becoming overweight. Using the Physical Fitness Testing Program (CaPFT P) data, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (2005) showed that childhood obesity was on the rise. It was on the rise within all 19 groups, but more prevalent in certain places and populations. The study clearly showed higher obesity rates in lower socioeconomic groups. However, there is some promising data arising from a more recent study completed by Frey (2012). Frey found that California's childhood obesity rates were slowing and not rising as rapidly as before. This was a cohort study , which examined 6.3 million student records provided by the California Department of Education for 5th, 7th, and 9th graders in each year between 2003 and 2008. The study found that obesity levels had stabilized and fitness levels ha d improved among 7th and 9th graders. The most important finding of this study was a significant increase in children's aerobic capacity. Dr. William Bommer, a cardiologist at UC Davis, credits these promising results to Californias regulations in implementing a program to promote nutrition standards as well as fitness requirements in schools (Frey, 2012). However, critical to this study was Freys finding that race and ethnicity played a major role in the fitness level of the students. Specifically, Latino students had a 40% higher chance of being physically unfit than the average student. These findings send a clear message that there is a need for a greater level of fitness in Latino students. To summarize, studies indicate d that childhood obesity continues to be a p roblem in the United States. Although there are some promising trends in the rise of obesity rates in children in California (Frey, 2012), obesity rates in the Latino population continue to be a problem. This is significant in that the present study took place in LAUSD where 73% of the student population is Latino (LAUSD, 2012) . The following section examines literature on obesity specific to the Latino population. 20 Latino Population and Obesity California has the fastest growing Latino population. One out of three Californians are Latinos, and approximately 47% of children attending public schools are Latinos (Latino Coalition for a Health y California [LCHC], 2006). California male and female Latino s of all ages have among the highest rates of obesi ty and overweight in the nation. They suffer from the most severe consequences of obesity in Type 2 diabetes. Nearly 70% of California Latino adults are overweight or obese (California Department of Health Services, 2005). Among all California adolescen ts age s 12 to 17, Latino adolescents are the most likely to be overweight or at risk for overweight. The prevalence of overweight among Latino adolescents who are U .S.-born (20%) is nearly twice as high as among non -U.S.-born Latino adolescents. These st atistics contribute to the extremely high prevalence of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes, all of which have obesity as a risk factor, and account for nearly 60% of all deaths among Latinos (Center for Health Statistics, 2003). The risk for diab etes is becoming so great that it is projected that half of Latino newborns will likely develop diabetes during their lifetime. The prevalence of childhood obesity in preschool children is highest in Mexican - Americans (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Ogden & Carroll, 2010), nearly 50% higher than other ethnicities in the U nited States (Whitaker & Orzol, 2006). Considering that Latino children compose half of the school population in California, their fast growing population with the highest susceptibility to obesity signifies the need for intensive effort s to combat this issue (Madsen et al., 2010). Clear ly, research indicates there are high rates of obesity among Latinos. The following section discusses the causes of obesity. 21 Causes of Obesity Obesity can be closely linked to the consumption of high -calorie, nutrient -poor foods such as high fat and high sugar snack foods, fast foods, soda , and other sweetened beverages (Woodward -Lopez, 2006). The consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain pro ducts, and low -fat dairy and protein are associated with healthier weights (Woodward -Lopez, 2006). Many children in the United States are not consuming diets that correspond to dietary guidelines. Of significance to the present study, researchers have fo und that the diets of Latino children to be higher in dietary fat, sweetened beverages, and lower in fruits and vegetables, as compared to other groups ( Over 22% of Latino families in California are living at the poverty level (Bohn, 2011). Limited access to healthy foods in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods has been linked to high rates of childhood obesity (California Center for Public Health Association [CCPHA], 2008). Block, Scribner, and Desalvo (2004) suggested there are less grocery stores and more fast food restaurants in low SES areas compared to higher ones . Many low SES families cannot afford healthy foods, which tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods. Hence, they are buying more fast food due to the prevalence of more fast -food outlets. In addition, fast food tends to b e cheap and convenient (Drewnow ski & Specter, 2004) . The lack of physical activity is also a contributing factor to obesity. The Ce nter for Disease Control has recommend ed a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity for at least five days per week , or a minimum of 20 minutes of vigorous activity three days per week (CDC, 2006). In Los Angeles County, Latino adult males were 22 found to have the highest rate of being sedentary (46%) for any racial/ethnic group (Los Angeles County Health Survey, 2002 -2003). Less than one in four Latino adults engage d in even 20 minutes of physical activity three times a week (California Behavior al Risk Factor Survey, 2001). Only one in five Latino children and youth in grades five, seven, and nine met all six fitness standards in the 2010 statewide fitness test (California Department of Education, 2010). Ten percent of Latino adolescents were found to engage in little to no moderate or vigorous physical activity ( Babey, Diamant, Brown, & Hastert, 2005). This data clearly suggests that low levels of physical activity are affecting the health status of Latino youth as well as putting them at ris k for obesity. Lack of knowledge, understanding , and resources are contributing causes of obesity in this population (Alexander, Sherman, & Clark , 2007) , and lead to medical, psychological, and school performance issues. Research regarding the consequenc es of obesity is presented in the following section. Consequences of Obesity A large amount of literature focuses on the direct and indirect consequences of obesity. Direct consequences can be categorized as medical (ALAS, 2011; CDC, 2009, Deckelbaum & W illiams, 2001 ; LCHC, Puhl & Latner, 2007; Schwartz & Puhl, 2003). Indirect consequences include the impacts on academic performance (Cottrel, Northrup, & Wittberg, 2009; Hunt, 2008). Medical . Major healt h problems associated with obesity are Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and heart problems, cancer, asthma, sleep apnea, orthopedic issues, liver disease, anxiety, depression, and eating d isorders (ALAS, 2011; CDC, 2009; 23 Deckelbaum & Williams, 20 01; LCHC, 2006) . Childhood obesity is also associated with a reduced quality of life and an increased risk for adult obesity (ALAS, 2011; CDC 2009). Childhood obesity comprises the same comorbidities and health disparities as in adults (Deckelbaum & Will iams, 2001), such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dislipidemia, stroke, and diabet es (CDC, 2009). Freedman, Dietz, Srinivasan, and Berenson (1999) conducted the Bogalusa Heart Study, which was comprised of children ages sev en and eight years old. The study indicated a relationship between being overweight and having factors that will contribute to cardiovascular disease. The risk factors measured were blood pressure levels, insulin, and lipids. They concluded that obesity interventions are needed to help lower risks of cardiovascular disease in adults and children. Type 2 diabetes, which is typically known as an adult disease, comprises 25% to 60% of new onsets of childhood diabetes, and it is increasing along with the r apid rise of childhood obesity (Must et al., 1992 ). According to White (2005) , Type 2 diabetes as well as obesity rates among children are growing rapidly in the U nited States. Obesity and diabetes are clearly taking their toll on children. Recent data shows that some areas of the country had 30-40% of children with Type 2 diabetes (White, 2005). In another study, Fogt, Leal -Vasquez, Sosa, Trevino, Woods, and Wyatt (2008) conducted research to determine the prevalence of obesity and its outcomes such as high blood glucose, low fitness, and insufficient energy among children from poor families. This study was conducted with a cross -sectional design. BMI, fasting blood glucose, body fat, step test , and three 24 -hour dietary recalls were among the measure d factors. The participants were fourth graders with ages between 8 and 10. The majority of the 24 children, approximately 80%, were from Mexican American heritage. The results of this study indicated that a great many children who were raised in low -incom e families had health and obesity problems. About a 30% rate of obesity was observed among these children. Problematic outcomes of obesity such as low energy and high glucose were seen among participants as well. Based on the results of the three -day fo od diary, it was apparent that most of the meals these children consumed consisted of energy dense and low nutrient dense foods. Researchers concluded that children who live in poverty are at higher risk of becoming obese and developing Type 2 diabetes. Early detection and intervention is needed to prevent future outcomes. Parental education, more physical activity , and the consumption of more nutrient foods were among the researchers recommendations. Research indicates that another consequence of chil dhood obesity is that it leads to adult obesity. Singh, Mulder, Tw isk, van Mechelen, and Chinapaw (2008) systematically reviewed 25 studies , which tracked childhood obesity leading into obesity during adulthood. All 25 studies reported that childhood obe sity can increase the risk of becoming overweight and/or obese adults. Given these findings, Singh et al. also recommended obesity interventions during childhood. In 2000, diabetes was recognized as the sixth leading cause of death in the U nited States (CDC, 2009). One risk factor for adult mortality and morbidity is childhood obesity, even if it is not present at the time of diagnosis. The risk of adult obesity is much greater for obese children versus non -obese, regardless of the duration of obesity. Obesity in teenagers is significantly related to the incidence of mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, gout, and arthritis in adulthood (Kleinman, 2004). 25 Another medical consequence of obesity is lack of physical fitness, which can lead to poor health. Mastrangelo, Chaloupka, and Rattigan (2008) conducted a fitness study to compare cardiovascular fitness between the children who were obese and those who were non -obese. Approximately 118 children between the ages of eight and eleven were asked to run or walk for one mile. The estimated oxygen peak during the walk was measured. The results clearly showed that children who were obese had poor cardiovascular fitness when compared to children who were not obese. Psychological. Research s uggests that childhood obesity causes stigmatization Latner, 2007; Schwartz & Puhl, 2003). According to a study conducted by Puhl and Latner (2007) , childhood obesity interve ntions are necessary because the consequences of obesity are potentially not only physical, but also social and psychological. Puhl and Latner note d, \"as a result of weight bias and discrimination, obese children suffer psychological, social, and health -related consequences \" (p. 557). In a prior study, Schwartz and Puhl (2003) examined several studies about the major challenges that obese children and their families have encountered. In particular, they examined the amount of stigmatization towards overw eight children and the conflicting advice given to the parents about how to help their children. Results indicated that obese children were often the target of stigmatization from other children and even from adults (e.g., teachers ). Schwartz and Puhl suggested that this stigmatization could lead to eating disorders, depression, low self -esteem , and many other issues later in life. Bacardi -Gascon et al. (2007) studied the stigmatization of Hispanic overweight children. Approximately 433 fifth and sixth graders and 342 mothers were studied to 26 determine stigmatization among Mexican overweight children and non -overweight children by their own peers and mothers. They rated both genders based on physical characteristics. The results showed that both boys a nd girls, whether they were overweight or not overweight, preferred the obese friend the least. Similar to Schwartz and Puhl (2003), Bacardi -Gascon et al. argued that stigmatized children may be vulnerable to psychological effects (e.g., low self -esteem a nd depression ) and social dysfunction (e.g., isolation ). School performance. According to Hunt (2008), childhood obesity may lead to poor academic performance. The Hunt Institutes review of research indicate d that even though a clear link was absent, t here was reason to believe that there was an indirect effect on academic performance. In addition, scholarly articles and studies have specifically examined low school performance in relation to childhood obesity and nutrition ( Ball et al., 2004; Datar & Sturm, al., 2004; Hunt, 2008; Schwartz & Puh l, 2003). As noted previously, the lack of physical activity has been found to be a contributor to childhood obesity. Cottrel et al. (2009) conducted a study to examine the possible relationship between childrens fitness assessment and their performance in four academic areas. Childrens aerobic capacity, abdominal and u pper body strength, and flexibility were measured using FITNESSGRAM. Math, language arts, science, and social studies were te sted using a statewide standardized academic performance test while keeping gender and socioeconomic differences in mind. The results of the study showed that the children who were in the healthy fitness zone (HFZ) performed significantly better on the st andardized academic tests in comparison to the children who 27 were below the healthy zone. Specifically, children in the HFZ for aerobic capacity and abdominal strength p erformed significantly better in math, and the children who were in the HFZ for upper b ody strength performed better in both math and science. These findings provide support to the idea that children who are physically fit tend to also perform better academically. In another study, Crosnoe and Muller (2004) proposed that obesity directly affects an individual s functioning in physical and non-physical ways , includ ing lower educational attainment. The data were gathered using the National Study of Adolescent Health, which is an ongoing national representation of American adolescents in gra des 7 to 12. Multiple factors were measured and studied such as BMI, race, age, gender, parental education, and athletic participation. Their conclusion was that obesity, like many other health measures, is a multifaceted contributer to academic performa nce. Therefore, obesity has psychological as well as physical complications. Simi lar to the findings of Cottrel et al. (2009), longitudinal results indicated a negative association between obesity and achievement in schools, especially in schools where s tudents had higher physical activity. The psychological and physical complications were lower in schools with higher athletic participation. Datar and Sturm (2006) examined the relationship between childhood overweight and elementary school outcomes. The results from the study concluded that girls moving from non -overweight to overweight between kindergarten entry and the end of third grade were significantly associated with the reduction in test scores , as well as behavioral and social problems . The re sults, however, did not show a significant effect on the boys. In a prior study Datar, Sturm, and Magnabosco (2004) examined the association 28 between childrens overweight status in kindergarten and their academic achievement in kindergarten and first gra de. The data were collected from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Class (ECLS -K). Detailed information about the children, their parents, teachers, and school characteristics were gathered at multiple times. Childrens height and weig ht were measured at each data collection ; socioeconomic status, parent -child interaction, birth weight, physical activity, and television watching were among the controlled factors. Results indicated about 10% of kindergarteners were overweight when enter ing kindergarten, with the prevalence of overweight being slightly higher in boys than girls. Overweight children were significantly more likely to be from Hispanic and poor families with less educated mothers. They generally had a higher birth weight an d watched more hours of TV per day. Both overweight boys and girls scored significantly lower in both reading and math tests at the beginning of kindergarten. These differences appeared to be more significant when other factors such as socioeconomic and behavioral factors were considered. The major conclusion in the ECLS -K study w as that being overweight could be a marker, but is an indirect factor for academic performance. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Sabia (2007) conducted research to find the link between academic performance of young adults , mostly in high school , and their body weight status. There are several conclusions to be drawn from this study. Similar to Datar and Sturm (2006), there was vast evidenc e of a negative relationship between body weight and academic a chievement among white female adult s: the higher the weight of the participants, the lower the academic achievement. This negative relationship was much less apparent among male adult s and 29 nonwhite female adult s. These results led Sabia to conclude that body image could be a main factor for white female adult s as it affects their academ ic achievement and self esteem. To summarize, i n reviewing the literature , obesity, particularly childhood obesity, is a major problem facing our nation today, particularly for the Latino population. The main causes of obesity are poor physical fitness, poor nutrition , and acce ss to healthier foods. Lack of understanding and knowledge regarding how to lead a healthier lifestyle are other causes of this epidemic. As reviewed in this section, there are medical, psychological , and academic consequences that are a direct or indirect result of childhood obesity. There are a myriad of interventions focused on prev enting childhood obesity. The following section reviews research on the types of childhood obesity interventions and their effectiveness. For the purposes of the present study , which is focused on the effectiveness of a school -based parent education inte rvention, the primary focus of this portion of the literature review will be on childhood obesity interventions that involve schools as well as those that involve a partnership between schools and parents. Obesity Interventions In response to the problem of childhood obesity, schools and agencies across the country have implemented a number of interventions designed to curb this pandemic. Common to all of these interventions is a focus on education rather than on weight loss (Oude Luttikhuis et al. , 2009 ; Caprio , 2005). For example, Oude Luttikhuis et al. (2009) conducted a systematic review of 54 studies on programs dealing with interventions for treating obesity in children. The 30 interventions focused on diet, physical activity, and behavior changes. The results showed that lifestyle programs can reduce the level of overweight in children and adolescent obesity 6 and 12 months after the beginning of the program. This review confirmed that the short -term effectiveness of lifestyle treatments, and reinforced th e point th at information on the long -term (more than six months ) outcome of obesity treatment in children and adolescents is limited. Many studies have confirmed that it is more economical to pre vent obesity than to treat it (California Department of Health Services, 2005). According to the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California (2006), \"particularly important for Latinos are prevention strategies that strengthen families and communities and e mphasize broad concepts of social and physical health rather than focusing on BMI\" (p. 6). As noted previously, studies indicate d that indiv iduals do not always make healthy food choices Troiano et al. , 2000; Woodward -Lopez, 2006) . This is particularly true for families living in poverty where options for selecting healthy food alternatives may be limited (Woodward -Lopez, 2006). One method to impact lifestyle changes, particularly for children attending public schools, is through legislation. For example, Woodward -Lopez, Gosliner, Samuels, Craypo, Kao, and Crawford (2010) assessed the impact of legislation establishing nutrition standards for foods and beverages that compete with reimbursable school meals in California through pr e and post testing at 99 schools. Results indicated that the availability of nutrition standard -compliant foods and beverages increased, and the availability of noncompliant items had decreased. Most importantly, the biggest reduction in consumption at s chool was sodas, sweetened beverages, regular chips, and candy. However, the consumption of these foods remained 31 unchanged at home. These results suggest ed there needs to be more of a linkage between the school and home environment The two primary conta cts for children are the home and school. Schools are an ideal environment to prevent childhood obesity and provide opportunities to change behavior as they can positively influence a childs health and healthy behavior (APA, 2003; Shaya, Flores, Gbarayor, Aadre, & Joan-Carles, 2010). However, a framework developed by Woodward -Lopez at UC Berkeley, indicate s that the aspects of the environment need to be engaged (LCHC , 2006). This would suggest that involving pare nts in obesity interventions is important. The following section of the literature review will focus on the research of two specific types of interventions, school -based obesity interventions and school -based parent education interventions. School -Based Obesity Interventions According Lane (2001), school -based interventions can be defined as interventions designed for children at the school setting. These interventions primarily involve the school environment, the teachers, and the school curriculum. Some curriculum may focus on health and nutrition education, some on physical fitness, and some may include a combination of both. There are many different school -based interventions that have been implemented successfully over the last few years in the Los Angeles Area (LCHC, 2006). A meta -analysis of 11 school -based intervention studies focused on the potential that schools have in making valuable contributions to the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity (Story, 1999) . Eleven controlled experime ntal studies were reviewed , 32 and the results showed modest positive short -term results regarding success of these interventions. Story (1999) discussed the need for intervention based on findings that childhood obesity is an epidemic in this country and th at childhood obesity results in obesity at the adult level. Story stressed the potential that schools have to make major contributions to the treatment of childhood obesity. However, Story noted, research and publications on the long -term success of scho ol-based interventions were limited. In an effort to develop practical and effective guidelines for school -based obe sity reduction programs, Shaya et al. (2008) studied school -based obesity interventions. Participants included children between the ages of 7 to 19 years old. Their height and weight were reviewed for a duration of 20 years. A total number of 51 intervention studies were reviewed. As many as 15 intervention studies focused solely on physical activity, 16 of them utilized educational mode ls, and 20 used both. At the end, a total of 40 studies reported short -term positive statistically significant results between the baseline and follow -up measurements. The conclusion made from this overall review suggests promising positive effects on re ducing obesity and behavior modifications of children in school . However, due to the variety of interventions, it is not clear which interventions had the greatest impact on reducing obesity and modifying behavior. In a study focused on developing healthy lifestyle behaviors in children, Gortmaker et al. (1999) evaluated the impact of a school -based health behavior intervention known as Planet Health on obesity among 1 ,295 children in grades 6 to 8 from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. The prevalence, incidence, and remission of obesity were assessed using before and after measurements (BMI and skin folds). The subjects participated in a 2 -year interdisciplinary school intervention program 33 that included : increased physical activity, decreas ed fat consumption, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables in daily diet at school. The results of the study suggest ed that this school -based intervention with children had a significant effect on the participating girls in comparison with the control groups , but no significant change was observed among boys. One can conclude from this study that utilization of Planet Health intervention in schools might have promising effects on preventing obesity among children , especially in females. Simil ar to other school-based interventions however, follow -up was not conducted to determine the long-term effectiveness of this intervention. A study conducted in schools in Switzerland concluded that schools were a crucial setting in which to utilize and i mplement strategies to prevent childhood obesity (Torre et al. , 2010). Researchers hypothesized that children spend the vast majority of their days at schools, and as such, they are where the implementation of current obesity prevention must take place. Using qualitative methods, the researchers solicited the opinions of school directors, physical education teachers, catering staff, school nurses, health educators, parents, and adolescents on current obesity prevention strategies. Even though all agreed on the implementation of nutritional standards for food and drinks offered in schools, they believed that making healthy items look more attractive was the best approach in achieving the goal of better eating habits . Participation in physical activity and after-school activities , regardless of physical condition and weight status , was also considered important by participants . It was important to the participants that all stakeholders be integrated into the movement of obesity prevention. In conclusion, the participants agreed that the school setting was the proper setting for the 34 implementation of these childhood obesity prevention strategies. While stakeholders stressed the importance of government involvement and support of interventions, Torre et al. argued that it was important to give the schools autonomy to adopt programs that are relevant to the schools needs and circumstances. Unique to this school -based intervention study, was the participants belief that all stakeholders join in the efforts by sending a consistent , coherent message regarding childhood obesity prevention and supporting parents in their efforts. These school -based intervention studies indicated some positive effects, but as noted, most with the exception of Torre et al . (2010) , did not engage parents or aspects of childrens environment outside of the school setting as the part of the intervention. As explained in Chapter 1, the conceptual framework that guides this study incorporates components of Epsteins School, Family, an d Community Partnership Model (Epstein, 2011), and Golan and Weizmans (2001) conceptual model of the familial approach to the treatment of childhood obesity. Epstein (2009) proposed that successful education programs require the involvement and partnersh ip between the family, community, and school . Golan and Weizman (2001) view the familial approach to the treatment of childhood obesity as consisting of changes in parental cognition, behavior, and environment as they relate to a healthy lifestyle. Both Epstein (2009) and Golan and Weizman (2001) emphasize the importance that the environment plays in making effective changes. Research as to the role environment plays in the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity will be presented in the following section Environmental Effects There are several studies that have examined the effect of environment on 35 childhood obesity (Cullen, Baranow ski, Rittenberry, & Olvera, 2006 ; O'Brien Van der Horst, Oenema, Ferreira, Wendel -Vos, Giskes, & van Le nthe, 2007). These studies suggest that the home environment is pivotal in the formation of childrens nutritional and fitness habits. For example, Van der Horst et al. (2007) conducted a systematic review of 58 papers dealing with socio -cultural and eco nomic environmental factors at the household level, and examined how these factors correlated with obesity - related dietary behaviors in youth. Most consistent associations were found between socio -cultural factors such as parental intake and childrens fa t, fruit/vegetable intakes, parent and sibling intake with adolescents energy and fat intakes, and parental education with adolescents fruit/vegetable intake. Van der Horst et al. (2007) concluded that parental intake and education play an important rol e in children s and adolescents food intake. Similarly, O Brien et al. (2007) studied the ecology of childhood overweight through a twelve -year longitudinal analysis in which they studied childrens interactions with their mothers, the home environment, and opportunities for physical activity. They concluded that the home environment and parent interaction in children's early years played a role in development of overweight or staying within the normal weight. In a si milar study, Cullen et al. (2006 ) conducted a qualitative study of social - environmental influences on children s diets with African -American, Caucasian, and Mexican -American children and their parents. Through separate focus groups with children in grades 4 to 6 and parents, the researcher s discovered factors that influence d healthy food choices in children. Availability and accessibility of healthy foods, TV, peer, and parent factors were found to influence consumption across all ethnic groups. Significant findings included parents eage rness to learn appropriate methods for creating 36 an environment that provided healthy food choices. Lane (2001) ha s argued that \"school -based interventions often affect one certain behavior and lasts only as long as the interventions are maintained. In or der for a change in behavior to be effective, it needs to remain changed in d ifferent settings, home, school, social activities\" (p. 370). Noting the critical role environment plays in childhood obesity, research suggests the importance of interventions t hat link schools and parents through parent education (Cooke et al., 2003; Golan, Weizman, Apter & Fainaru, 1998 ; Golan & Crow, 2004; Skidmore & Yarnell, 2004 ). The following section focuses on the research on school -based parent interventions. School -Based Parent Interventions Studies suggest that influential efforts to improve healthy eating habits among children may result through the education of children and also their families (Cooke et al., 2003; Skidmore & Yarnell, 2004). School -based parent in terventions may be defined as partnering with schools to implement interventions that focus on educating the parents regarding healthy lifestyles. According to Reschly (n.d.), parent and family levels of involvement m ay vary . However , school -based , parent -focused interventions involve parents in an intervention that has been implemented to improve healthy behavior in parents and their families. These types of interventions have been designed outside of the regular school curriculum and specifically target parents. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2003) early interventions are necessary in that increasing awareness of parents is critical. Lobstein, Baur, and Uauy (2004) have also concluded that a whole -family approach appears to be vital. This shows that outcomes are improved if the parents are either the key instigators, part of the process, or engaged in the entire 37 process of childhood obesity prevention. This section of the literature review examines studies that have focused and suppo rted the role of parents as agents of change to prevent childhood obesity. According to a new survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association Foundation (ADAF), when parents are informed about healthy eating and are connected with their children, th e childs eat ing behavior changes (ADAF, n.d. ). Studies conducted by other researchers (Golan et al., 1998; Golan & Crow, 2004) support the focus on parents as the target audience for nutrition training designed to improve the heal th status of the family. Golan et al. (1998) compared two family -based approaches for the treatment of childhood obesity. In one approach, parents served as the exclusive agents of change, and in another approach, children served as the agents of change. The results were posit ive and in favor of the parents as agents of change approach. There are a number of studies which support the work of Golan et al . (1998) showing that parents can have an influence on the eating and physical activity levels of their children (Evans et al ., 2011; Golan & Crow, 2004; Gruber & Halderman, 2009; Hopper, Munoz, & Gruber, 2005; Peterson & Fox, 2007). According to Gruber and Halderman (2009), the family environment is key when trying to treat and reduce childhood obesity, and parents are most ge nerally the primary agents of change. Thus, Gruber and Halderman argued that education should be focused towards the parents, which in turn will facilitate change in the overall family environment. They also indicate d a need for changing family behavior which , they posit , will reduce obesity. Peterson and Fox (2007) conducted a review of several studies involving obesity interventions. Their objective was to provide a resource that could help develop and 38 implement school -based obesity prevention plans and designs. Their review supported the importance of school -based programs and inclusion of parents in the interventions. The review by Peterson and Fox suggest ed that family environment could contribute to the development of childhood obesity. The fam ily is the foundation for setting healthy customs. It is a basis for mediating societal influences on children by instilling both cultural and family values in a child , which in the long term will affect their overall lives. Both parents and primary caregivers play a major role in shaping a childs dietary practices and overall physical activity. Parents set the overall policy of the home environment. They make the decisions on what foods are available to a child as well as the type of physical activitie s that are available. They further control the economics of the home environment, and in turn control what comes into the home. In a subsequent study to Storys (1999) research calling for long -term fo llow-up studies of school -based interventions, Golan and Crow (2004) researched the benefits of treating childhood obesity with parental involvement. Seven years after program termination, the results showed reductions of overweight by 29% in the parent -only group vs. 20.2% in the children -only group. The f amily -based health -centered approach, that targeted parents only, showed greater weight loss at all follow -up visits from year 1 to year 7. The results clearly show the need for parental intervention as it relates to a healthy environment, healthy eating, and activity patterns. In addition, Golan and Crow stressed the importance of a health -centered approach rather than a weight -centered approach in the treatment of childhood obesity. In a similar study, Hopper et al. (2005) studied 238 third grade child ren to determine the effect of a school -based family fitness and nutrition class. The control group consisted of children only versus the treatment 39 group , which included a parent component and activities to be conducted by parents and children at home. The results indicated that children in the treatment group, which included a parent component, scored higher on posttest knowledge and had lower total fat intake. It can be concluded that involving parents in the intervention was more effective than includ ing children only, however no follow -up was conducted to determine if positive changes were sustained. In a previous study, Hopper, Munoz, Gruber, and MacConnie (1996) studied 97 second and fourth grade children and 27 parents. The objective was to eval uate a school - based nutrition and exercise program with parents. A posttest was administered immediately after the ten -week study to determine the changes in dietary behavior and family participation. It clearly showed a positive impact on family partic ipation and changes in dietary behavior. They concluded that inclusion of parents in intervention leads to increased parent nutrition knowledge and short -term dietary changes for children. Several researchers (Davison, Butting & Birch, 2003; Katz, Katz, Treu, Reynolds and Njike, 2011; McGarvey, Keller, & Forrester, 2004) have looked at changing physical activity behavior, and have shown that parent -focused interventions have been more effective in making physical activity and behavior changes in both par ents and their families . For example, Katz et al. (2011) conducted a study involving 1 ,180 elementary students and parents. As a part of the intervention, parents received written nutrition materials at home, and information about label reading was given at school functions. Results indicated that parents showed a significant increase in nutrition label literacy. Katz et al. concluded that the involvement of parents in the intervention increased parent nutrition knowledge. 40 McGarvey et al. (2004) simil arly found that parent -focused interventions have been able to change parent behavior. They studied parents of children served by the Virginia Women, Infants , and Children (WIC) program. The childhood obesity intervention was targeted for preschool child ren and their parents. The program promoted behavior changes to help prevent obesity. The results indicated an increase in parents engaging in active play with their child and offering water instead of juice or other drinks to their children. These stud ies would suggest that parent involvement in obesity interventions is critical. According to Rudolph (2009), \"Indeed it could be argued that children's lifestyles can only change for the better if they live in a household where adults are leading a health y life themselves \" (p. 9). Several studies (Blom -Hoffman, Wilcox, Dunn, Leff, & Power, 2008; , 2003; Gross, Pollock, & Braun, 2010; Rudolph, 2009) have explained that when parents act as role models in changing their own nutrition and physic al activity behavior, there is logistical support for the children. For example, Davison et al. (2003) found that if parents improved their own physical activity, their childrens level of physical activity was likely to increase. Rudolph (2009) has arg ued for the encouragement of parents and caregivers to act as models of a healthy lifestyle. Rudolph found a positive correlation between parents modeling healthy behaviors and children improving their eating behaviors and physical activity. In addition, he suggest ed the importance of parents being role models in encouraging their children to eat new foods. He also provide d a list of interventions that support strategies to encourage healthy lifestyles. Rudolph also suggest ed the importance of parenting skills, which should include firmness, while being accepting and warm, and 41 the importance of family mealtimes, when modeling healthy lifestyle behaviors : \"The emphasis on involving the whole family reinforces parents attempts to model a healthy lifestyle \" (Rudolph, 2009, p. 14). Furthermore, children think it is important for their parents to be involved. A study was cond ucted by ARAMARK Education in 2010 called the Student Viewpoint (ALAS, 2011 ). This study looked at family influence, parent involvemen t, and the importance of communication. Researchers asked 40,000 middle school and high school children to describe their eating behaviors during lunch and break in the cafeteria. Parent -child relationship and communication were show n to have a significa nt influence on the nutritional habits of children. The study found that when parents tal ked to their children about food choices, a childs healthy food consumption increase d from 44% to 73% (ALAS, 2011 ). As reported by the students, there was also an i ncrease from 27% to 63% in label reading among children and making better food choices. Results clearly showed that parent involvement was the reason for making better food choices. However, result s indicated that less than half of parents frequently com municate d with their children, and 39% of children said that they would love for their parents to talk to them and he lp them make healthier choices (ALAS, 2011 ). These results would suggest children value their parents as role models. Similarly, Gross et al. (2010) examined family influence as a key to increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruits among fourth and fifth grade students. Researchers found that parents influence childrens food preferences and intake patterns through the food they make available, the types of child -feeding practices they use, and their own eating behavior. The results of this study suggest ed that nutrition interventions designed 42 to increase a childs fruits and vegetables intake should clearly target parental intake and feeding practices. The study further suggest ed targeting parents for interventions such as explaining the importance of the effect of their behavior on their childrens fruits and vegetables consumption. Reinaerts, de Nooijer, van de Kar, and de Vries ( 2008) conducted a qualitative study on the perceptions of parents and their children around a school -based intervention promoting the consumption of vegetables and fruits among families. Approximately 104 children and 28 parents were interviewed through t en group sessions. The results indicated that when teachers and parents model ed consuming fruits and vegetables, and when fruits and vegetables were accessible to the children, the children were more likely to increase their consumption of fruits and vege tables. The results from these studies suggest school -based parent inte rvention programs that increase parent knowledge and skills and recognize parents as role models are effective , at least in the short term . Studies specifically addressing the compon ents of school -based parent education programs to include curriculum design (Evan et al. , 2011; Gable & Lutz, 2000; McKenna, Lee Baquero, LCHC, 2006 ) are examined in the following section. Components of parent intervention programs. As previously discussed, there are studies that suggest the need for parental involvement and education to combat childhood obesity ( ARAMARK Education, 2010; Golan et al., 2001). Research has reinforced the need to increase the knowledge base of parents in order to effect the change that is necessary in the family (Golan & Weizman, 2001). The parents, through 43 increased knowl edge, can learn and appreciate the importance of a non -diet approach (Savoye et al. , 2005). Studies have also suggest ed that parents need tools and resources to implement changes in their own behaviors, as well as those of their families, and to communica te with their family (Borra, Kelly, Shirreffs, Neville, & Geiger , 2003; Evans et al., 2011; Wechsler et al., 2004 ). Savoye et al. (2005) conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of a weight management program curriculum, and to examine whether a relationship exist ed between the type of diet method utilized and improved weight and psychosocial outcomes in obese adolescents. Parents and adolescents attended n utrition education classes focused on non-diet, curriculum teaching label reading, balancin g meals, portion sizes, making better food choices, recipe modification, and healthful snacks. Results suggested that a weight rebound may not occur after weight loss if a non -diet approach curriculum is used, as it may teach the skills necessary to maint ain weight loss and making changes gradually. Specifically , it was found that the use of a non -diet approach curriculum gave parents and adolescents the tools and foundation to make better food choices over time. Similarly, Wechsler et al. (2004) found t hat curricula are more likely to be effective in improving health behaviors when they teach skills needed to adopt healthy behaviors and provide ample opportunities to practice those skills. Wechsler et al. also suggested that curriculum should focus on h elping participants overcome barriers by providing them with ways to adopt healthy behaviors . In another study, Evans et al. (2011) conducted research with low -income parents of preschool -aged children in an urban center in Texas. The purpose of the stu dy was to obtain more in -depth information from this specific population group to guide the 44 development of culturally relevant nutrition interventions and curriculum . The authors concluded that in terms of location and time of day, schools were deemed \"id eal\" locations . Participants preferred classes to be held during school hours so they did not have to bring the children and beco me distracted. Regarding the audience for community -based nutrition classes, respondents suggested that husbands and fathers should also be invited and included. Regarding topics that should be covered in community -based nutrition classes, participants expressed their desire to improve healthy eating in their households . Researchers concluded that parents would prefer a curric ulum that teach es the skill to purchase and prepare meals that include low -cost and traditional Mexican ingredients, using hands -on activities. Another study indicated the tools and curriculum nee ded to educate parents. Borra et al. (2003) , through qual itative studies with children, parents, and teachers , helped identify communication opportunities to promote healthful lifestyles and the prevention of obesity through healthy messages. Simply hoping that children outgrow the problem has been a major barr ier for p arents of overweight children. Borra et al. found that parents may lack the necessary tools and knowledge to assist their children. The curriculum in the present \"A Taste of Good Health\" program was designed to provide participants with the know ledge and necessary tools such as healthier recipes and fun ways to increase their physical activity. Schwartz and Puhl (2003) have argued that although parents are responsible for what their children eat and the health consequences thereof, responsibilit y must also lie with society and the media. Schwartz and Puhl conclude d that this issue needs to be addressed in the curriculum and brought to the attention of parents during interventions. 45 One of the purposes of the \"A Taste of Good Health\" program was to educate parents about the consequences. Therefore this stud y address ed this need in the curriculum. Culturally appropriate tools will help parents make changes in their lifestyle. Research clearly shows that cultural background may affect families a nd parent al behaviors. Cultural background needs to be addressed in the school -based parent and family education workshops. For example, Ayala et al. (2007) examined the association between family variables and Mexican -American childrens diets. A cross-sectional study with households sampled 187 children between the ages of 8 and 18 who were asked to complete a one -time, self -administered survey, while their mothers participated in a face -to-face structured interview. The results of the study supported the concept that greater family support was directly associated with healthy eating. Researchers concluded the need for culturally appropriate family -based interventions. In addition, Ayala et al. examined the association between family influence and th e dietary intake of the children in the study. The strongest and most consistent correlates were availability of fast food in the home and parents purchasing food that their children had seen advertised on TV. It was important for study participants that families support each other for healthful eating and eat meals together. In another study, Branscum and Sharma (2011) conducted a systematic analysis of nine Hispanic childhood obesity prevention program s. They concluded that interventions were successf ul when incorporating a parental component, sessions were longer in length, and when delivered by staff who were d edicated to and familiar with the Hispanic culture. Clearly, addressing obesity among Latinos requires an understanding not only of the biol ogical causes of obesity, but also of the culture, values, resources, and 46 environments that influence eating and physical activity behaviors and choices in Latino communities ( LCHC, 2006). Rather than placing blame on lack of self -control, and seeking rem edies and quick fixes in weight -loss, the greatest opportunity to halt the obesity epidemic lies in working with the entire population to promote the social and environmental conditions that favor healthy eating and physical activity. Latino communities m ust be involved in a collaborative and comprehensive effort to improve eating and activity behaviors and environments. According to the Latino Coalition for a Health y California (2006), education for children and their families is needed, as well as strong er policies to ensure healthy school nutrition and physical activity environments. In addition, safe communities with ample recreational spaces and affordable healthy foods are needed, and there must be an end to the marketing of unhealthy products to children. Spruijt -Metz (2011) further summarized the importance of family influence on obesity and obesity -related behavior giving an overview of the progress made in childhood and adolescent obesity research in the last decade. Spruijt -Metz stressed the need for large -scale, high -dose, and long -term interventions, taking into account the complex nature of childhood obesity. In sum, as cited here, m any studies have suggested the importance of parent involvement in school -based obesity intervention programs, calling their participation essential to the success of the program. In addition, researchers have suggested the curriculum should have a focus on giving parents tools for developing a healthy lifestyle for their families and should be sensitive to the c ulture of the participants. 47 Summary of the Literature Review As described above, childhood obesity is reaching pandemic proportions particularly for Latino families (Carmona, 2003; Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Ogden & Carroll, 2010). Research tells us that childhood obesity results in significant health issues for children such as diabetes, heart disease, apnea, and asthma (ADA, 2010; CDC, 2009), psychological issues (Latner Stunkard, Latner, 2007; Schwartz 2003 well as poor s chool performance (Hunt , 2008; Ball et al., 2004; Data r & Sturm, 2006; Datar et al., 2004; Schwartz & Puh l, 2003). In response, schools and agencies across the country have implemented a number of interventions designed to curb this pandemic. However, th ere are relatively few studies that engage in the systematic evaluation of these interventions, particularly their long -term effects on changing health ful behavior (Story, 1999). What seems to be prevalent in the literature is the importance environment p lays in promoting or cur bing childhood obesity (Cullen et al., 2006 ; OBrien et al., 2007; Van der Horst et al., 2007) , suggesting a need for community, school and family partnerships for effective interventions (Epstein, 2009; Golan & Weizman, 2001). Research suggests schools are an ideal place for interventions (Gortmaker et al ., 1999 ; Shaya et al. , 2008; Story, 1999; Torre et al ., 2010), and interventions that focus on the family as a unit and parents as agents of change appear to be more effective at l east in the short term (Golan, 2004). Intervention curriculum should include culturally appropriate nutrition education, physical activity , and healthy cooking tips or ideas for parents and families. It should also include culturally sensiti ve materials, information, and recipes to be e ffective to the target audience (ADAF , n.d.; Evans et al ., 2011) . Though there are a number of studies that have looked at this type of intervention 48 (Oude Luttikhuis et al. , 2009), few studies have examined whether the par ticipants have improved their nutrition knowledge, changed their behavior in cooking , or increased their fitness levels, especially after the completion of the intervention. Many studies as summarized here indicate d there is a need for long -term obesity i nterventions that include the family . In addition, there is a need to conduct follow -up evaluations to determine the effectiveness of these types of programs. This study proposes to add to the current body of literature on school -based parent education in terventions by conducting a parent education workshop which includes culturally sensitive curriculum, and that has multi - components such as nutrition education, physical activity , and cooking and evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention both durin g and three months after completion of the workshops. The following cha pter will describe the methods used to conduct this evaluation. 49 CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether \"A Taste of Good Health\" school -based parent education program affect ed healthful behavior in parent participants in a large urban school district by examining whether significant changes occurred at pretest, posttest, and follow -up on the following: (1) participants knowledge regarding nutrition, c ooking, and physical activity ; (2) cooking, eating habits, and physical activity of the participants and their families; and (3) body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants . In addition, the study examined participants vi ews of the program at posttest and follow -up to guide any changes to the program. Given the pandemic proportions of childhood obesity (American Aca demy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2007), and the research calling for the systemat ic evaluation of school/community partnerships that are focused on family -based interventions, there is a critical need to evaluate programs that can be used in schools and districts implementing school/community partnership interventions with a focus on parent education . Although this program had been successful in increasing nutrition knowledge, based on verbal feedback from previous participants, formal research and follow -up evaluation were needed to determine if families make changes in their nutritio n, cooking, and physical activity both during and three months after the completion of the program. This chapter articulate s the methods used to address the research questions . This chapter will describe the research design, research setting, research sample and data 50 sources, instruments and procedures, data collection and analys es procedures, and the role of the researcher. Research Design To address the research q uestions, this dissertation employ ed a mixed -methods design (Han son et al., 2005). The m ixed-method design involves the simultaneous collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data in order to get rich descriptive data, as well as a well -rounded assessment of the program. According to Hendricks (2009), collecting multiple forms of data is vital to a successful research project, so as to establish validity and credibility. The mixed -methods design can also allow for a triangulation of data (Neuman, 2003). Triangulation, which is the use of multiple sources of data, multiple meth ods, and at various points in time, can assist in making sure all factions are being studie d (Bodgan & Biklen, 2007) . Qualitative and quantitative data can help evaluate trends and commonalities and lend a conceptual understanding of the problem (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007). Qualitative data in the present study were useful for understanding the nature of processes in the program, as well as the family. Qualitative data provide d in-depth information regarding participants perceptions of the parent education classes influence on their families nutrition, exercise , and cooking behavior. It gave the study breadth and provide d an in - depth understanding with the small sa mple. The quantitative data allowed the comparison of knowledge and behavioral changes of t he parents between the beginning of the program at week 0, week 4, and during follow -up at week 12. A pre -experimental survey design (i.e., pretest, posttest , follow -up design without a comparison/control group) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of t he parent workshops . 51 According to Bogdan and Biklen (2007) these methods are appropriate to the research questions because they allow ed the researcher to examine the changes in cooking, physical activity , eating behavior , knowledge, BMI, weight, and perce nt body fat due to the program . These methods allow ed for the investigation of the perceived level of information obtain ed during class, verifying the utility of the parent education class experience , and offering areas o f improvement. The research provi ded information by comparing participants cooking, physical activity , and eating behaviors prior to taking the parent education classes and 12 weeks after completing the 4-week series. Research Setting This study took place in a culturally -diverse region of Los Angeles County , in which Latino families compose the majority of the population ( VCCC, 2010 ), and obesity and diabetes are major health concerns. A current intervention program at The Center for Healthier Communities (CHC) at Northridge Hospital M edical Center (NHMC) focused on reducing childhood obesity and diabetes through their School -based Obesity and Diabetes Initiative (SODI). The parent education component, called \"A Taste of Good Health\" focused on increasing awareness and providing guidel ines on healthy nutrition choices, food -label reading, recipe modification, smart shopping, and related nutritional and healthy lifestyle information. The CHC -SODI program of NHMC collaborated with California State University, Northridge (CSUN), Northeast Valley Health Corporation (NEVHC), Women , Infant s and Children, and LAUSD to conduct nutrition education and cooking classes in select LAUSD elementary schools. The goal was to increase nutrition knowledge, modify nutrition, and physical activity behavio rs, and ultimately counter childhood obesity and 52 diabetes in the San Fernando Valley. The setting for the school -based parent education workshops was LAUSD, the largest urban school district in California and the second largest urban district in the natio n. It serves 694,288 students and has 45,473 teachers. The student population consists of approximately 73% Latin o, 11% African -American, 9% White, 4% Filipino , and approximately 1% other. Approximately 78% of students qualify for free and red uced price meals (LAUSD, 2012). LAUSD was an ideal school district to conduct this research study with its high number of Latinos and students eligible for free and reduced meals. The pro gram was implemented in five schools in one local district in the L AUSD . As noted earlier, t he planned intervention consisted of a 4 -week program, meeting once a week for 2\u00bd hours at each meeting, for a total of 10 hours of instruction. The classes were offered to the parents right after student drop -off around 8:30 am in the parent education centers on the campus of each school. Research Sample and Data Sources The project recruit ed parents w hose children attended one of five public elementary schools and who were participating in the parent education classes. All schools had similar characteristics, matched on student and community demographics, and parent income levels and educational attainmen t. Each of the schools had at least 75% or more Latino families and 75 % or more of students on free or reduced lunch progra m. Institutional approval was obtained from the CSUN Office of Research and Sponsored Projects and the LAUSD Office of Research and Evaluation. During the first class session, the researcher, with the aid of a bilingual interpreter, explained the purpose of the study and solicited parent participation (Appendix A). Parents were then asked to 53 sign written informed consent forms, which was provided in both English and Spanish (Appendix D). Incentives , gift cards , and cookbook s, were used to aid in recruit ment. A total of 202 participants consented to participate in the research study. The selection criteria include d: 1. Participants of the class were willing to participate in the posttest and follow -up surveys. 2. Parents who completed at least two out of the four classes. All parents who agree d were included in the evaluation study. Instruments and Procedures The research instruments used include d: (1) a self -report survey that contained knowledge and behavior questions on nutrition, physical activity , and co oking ; (2) fieldnotes taken during debriefing sessions in weeks 4 and 12; and (3) a log containing the body weight, BMI , and body fat percent of participants. The survey was piloted prior to use to ensure validity and reliability. The survey was administ ered at the beginning of the first session of the first parenting class, at the end of the fourth workshop session at week 4, and at the follow -up session at week 12. The researcher administered the surveys, acquired the participants body characteristics , and conducted debriefing sessions as outlined in the next subsections. Please see Appendix A for the pretest survey and questionnaire , Appendix B for posttest and follow -up survey and questionnaire , and Appendix C for debriefing questions. Procedures fo r Survey Administration The survey consisted of 46 questions asking participants to report how many times per week the participants and their families were eating foods from different food 54 groups , using various cooking techniques , and engaging in physical activity . Eight items assessed the cooking techniques, 38 items assessed eating habits of participants and their families, and three items assessed physical activities of participants and their families. In addition, 33 items on the survey measure d nutrition and cooking knowledge of participants and their families, and 10 items measure d participant knowledge regarding the importance of physical activity at pretest, posttest, and follow -up. The 46 -items designed to assess the cooking and eating habits of the participants and their families corresponded to the cooking techniques and healthy eating habits that were presented in the curriculum. Using a scale of 0 = Never , 1 = Once a month , 2 = 1-3 days per week , 4 = 4-6 days per week , 5 = 6 or more times per week , and 6 = 1 or more times per day , the participants were asked to report how often they and their family engaged in various eating habits in the last month. Items included such questions as (1) \"How often do you or your family members remove the skin and trim the fat when cooking meats and poultry?\" (2) \"How often do you or your family members eat fried food (e.g., French fries, fried chicken)?\" The items on the survey were entered and analyzed individually. The three items developed to assess the p hysical activity of the participants and their families corresponded to the physical activity that was encouraged in the curriculum. Using a scale of 0 = Never , 1 = Once a month , 2 = 1-3 days per week , 4 = 4- 6 days per week , 5 = 6 or more times per week , and 6 = 1 or more times per day , participants were asked to report how often they and their family engaged in the following physical activities in the past month: (1) \" Walk for 30 minutes or more a day,\" (2) \"Engage in aerobic activity (e.g., jogging, biki ng, swimming) ,\" and (3) \" Are involved 55 in a group activity (e.g., organized sports, soccer, basketball, baseball) .\" The items on the survey were entered and analyzed individually. The 38 -item nutrition and cooking knowledge portion of the survey and 10 -item physical activity portion were also developed based on the information taught in the curriculum. Participants were asked to respond to questions regarding nutrition, physical activity, and cooking. Two sample items follow: (1) \"How many total servings of fruit and vegetables do you need per day? a. 1-2 Servings , b. 3-4 Servings , c. 6 or More Servings , d. None of the Above , e. Not Sure \"; and (2) \"Eating breakfast will help maintain your weight. 1. Yes , 2. No , 3. Not sure.\" For each item, participants w ere encouraged not to guess, and they were given a not sure option. Each item was scored with 1 = correct and 0 = do not know . Thus, the \"do not know\" score encompassed when participants marked the incorrect item or answered \"not sure.\" There were 10 items on physical activity knowledge section. For each of these items, participants were encouraged not to guess, and were given a \"not sure\" option. Two sample items follow: (1) \"What is the minimum amount of exercise you should do per day ? a. 10 minute s, b. 30 minutes , c. 40 minutes , d. 1 hour, e. Not Sure \"; and (2) \" Exercise is importan t to reduce the risk of disease. 1. Yes , 2. No , 3. Not sure.\" Each item was scored with 1 = correct and 0 = do not know . Thus, the \"do not know\" score encompassed when participants marked the incorrect item or answered \"not sure.\" Procedures for Measuring Body Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Percent Body Fat Body weight was determined using a standing weight scale at the school site. The participants stood on the sc ale without adornments (e.g., purse). Their weight was 56 recorded in pounds. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated with the following formula: BMI= (weight/ height2) x 703. Weight was in pounds and height was measured in inches using a measuring tape and a wall or the height measuring on the scale. Percent body fat was measured using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measuring instrument. One of the requirements of the BIA instrument was for the participants to not eat or drink within 1 -2 hours of measurement. Participants were asked not to drink or eat at least an hour before. These measurements were repeated during the final session of the workshop at week 4 and at the follow -up session at week 12. Gift cards and cookbooks were given as incenti ves to the participants at week 4 and week 12 to aid in bringing parents back to complete the posttest and follow -up surveys and measurements. Procedures for Administering Post test and Follow -up Qualitative Debriefing Questions During week 4 posttest and week 12 follow -up sessions, in addition to participants completing the survey , a debriefing session was held with each group. As noted above, to gain more in -depth information regarding participants lifestyle changes, they were asked to respond to a ser ies of open -ended questions through debriefing sessions in which they were asked to report on the impact the intervention had on their cooking, eating, and physical activity as well as their feedback about the usefulness of the intervention program. The questions asked during week 4 posttest sought recommendations for changes to improve the program and workshops overall . The survey and debriefing questions were presented in Spanish and English; however, all participants preferred Spanish. 57 Responses were transcribed and the researcher coded for themes that were most common across all sites as to changes recommended for program improvement by participants. During the debriefing session in week 12 , approximately 108 participants were in attendance. Partic ipants were encouraged t o share with the group any changes they and their families had made in their cooking, and/or eating habits, and/or physical activity behaviors. Responses were transcribed and the researcher coded for themes that were most common ac ross all sites as to changes in cooking, eating habits , and physical activity. In addition, during this week 12 follow -up, during a one -on-one session with each participant while they were being weighed, each participant was asked to describe how the prog ram had benefited their children and their family. Ninety -one participants responded to this question and their responses were transcribed and coded for themes related to reported changes in behavior. Intervention The planned curriculum consisted of a 4 -week program, meeting once a week for 2\u00bd hours at each meeting, for a total of 10 hours of instruction. The prog ram was implemented in five schools in same administrative local district in LAUSD . Each class consisted of 30 minutes lecture, 30 minutes ph ysical activity, 30 minutes hands -on learning activity , and 30 to 60 minutes of cooking and taste testing. The topics covered included label reading, physical activity, eating healthy meals, shopping and dining out tips, importance of breakfast, easy cook ing techniques, and recipe modifications. As noted above, 73% of the population in LAUSD is Latino. The participants in this study were all Spanish -speaking Latinos. A bilingual re gistered dietitian (RD) who had been trained through the dietetic interns hip program at California State University, 58 Northridge taught the classes . All classes were coordinated and taught by the bilingual RD and at least two trained bilingual graduate n utrition and dietetic students serving as research assistant s. The researc h assistants were trained by the researcher to assist with data collection , note taking, data coding , and assisting with cooking and physical activity . The assistants helped purchas e foods, mak e copies, and purcha se supplies. Data Collection All measure ments were performed at week 0 (baseline), again at week 4 (posttest), and at week 12 (follow -up). The pretest surveys were administered during the first class meeting at the beginning of the study and again at week 4 and the week 12 follow -up. As noted above, q ualitative data were collected from participants in the program through debriefing sessions at week 4 and week 12, in addition to one -on-one questions at week 12 . All data were taken back to a university office for coding, entry, and verification by the researcher and research assistants. Data Analys es The Taste of Good Health Logic Model process (Figure 1.1) helped the research er evaluate the effectiveness of the school -based parent workshops in helping to increase knowledge, change behavior , and make changes in weight and percent body fat. The model describe d the process and linkages between the program or study resources, the program activities, the program outputs, the program participants, and the program outcomes related to childhood obesity . It also show ed logically whether using a set of resources (schools, the community and the family ), and using parents as ag ents of change had an influence on the parents knowledge and behavior in the short term. 59 Quantitative Data Analys es All quantitati ve data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0 on Macintosh computer. SPSS is a computer software designed to conduct social science statistical analys es. Repeated measures analys es of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze the significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up. If a significant difference was found, then post hoc analyses were conducted to examine if the differences were between pretest and posttest, posttest and follow -up, and/or p retest and follow -up. The ANOVAs were used to determine significant differences in (1) nutrition and cooking knowledge ; (2) physical activity knowledge questions; (3) body weight, percent body fat, and BMI; and (4) cooking techniques, eating habits, and p hysical activity of participants and their families. Qualitative Data A nalys es At each of the schools, two bilingual research assistants recorded participants comments and answers during the debriefing sessions in week 4 and week 12 and the one-on-one q uestioning session in week 12. The bilingual research assistants compared their answers with each other and the researche r right after the session. In preparation for data analys es, the Spanish transcriptions of debriefing notes from week 4 and week 12 and responses to the one -on-one questions in week 12 were translated into English by the trained bilingual research assistants and double -checked for accuracy . The researcher coded answers based on the predetermined themes from the conceptual framework an d literature (see Table 3.1) that emerged through the debriefing and one-on-one sessions. Then the researcher collapsed the themes to come up with the final codes. Constructivist Grounded T heory (CGT ) (Charmaz, 2004 ) was used to 60 identify patterns and the mes that emerge d from the qualitative data. The CGT approach provides qualitative researchers a clear, ordered, and systematic analytical plan from which to develop an explanatory model that specifies the impact of the program. Table 3.1 Qualitative Code s and Themes Code s Predetermined Themes Additional Themes Emerged and Identified Changes in Cooking (CC) Healthier meals for families Parents cook healthier Frying less and using less oils Changes in t echniques such as grilling Changes in E xercise (CE) More walking More physical activity More walking as a family and more physical activity Getting variety and additional activities such as biking, dancing, etc. Involving children in more sports and group physical activity Changes in N utrition and Eating H abits (CN) Making healthy family food choices Lowering portion sizes Less soda & more water Eating less fat Eating more fruits/v egetables More meals at home Next, the researcher and two trained coders read the recorded answer s of all of the qualitative data, taking notes on themes that emerge d. The identified themes from the literature and the initial re ading of the transcripts were used to develop the predetermined themes for the second level coding. Next, the three coders engage d in open coding where additional themes (see Table 3.1) we re identified and modified. The debriefing question 61 and one-on-one answers were then coded and compared to the studys research questions . The researcher collapsed the themes to come up wit h the final codes. Once the codes were identified, the codes were clumped together using the \"Taste of Good Health\" Logic Model to get at the major themes. The codes, themes , and results were then checked by colleagues as a form of member checking. The similar responses and codes were then counted to get frequency counts for both the debriefing data and the one -on-one data. In addition, relevant text was categorized into th emes. The selective coding took place where the data were examined for theoretic al implicat ions. These implications were used to evaluate the program with the goal of helping program developers improve the program by capitalizing on aspects of the program that were most effective, as well as understand ing how and whether parents made changes in healthful eating and physical activity at home. The three coder s placed each theme into tables. The tables were devised to track whether the theme was mentioned at each school. The researcher then pulled out quotes that demonstrated each the me. Role of the Researcher The researcher is a faculty member at California State University, Northridge and serves as the dietetic internship director involved with conducting internship orientations, training, and accreditation processes. She is famili ar with the intervention and had worked on this and similar projects prior . Some assumptions already exist ed about the potential findings of the study. Potential bias lay in tw o factors: (1) the researcher was closely tied to the field of nutrition and ob esity p revention; (2) the researcher was personally familiar with the SODI program . The r esearcher was aware of the potential 62 bias and only participated in collection and analys es of the data. The researcher was not teaching any of the workshops. Accord ing to Peshkin (1988 ), researcher subjectivity can be both enabling and disabling. One must always be aware of subjectivity and guard against surprise (Peshkin, 1988). Researcher subjectivity was monitored by using the following techniques . The research er wrote reactions and thoughts throughout the process and then compare d them through interactions and discussions with o thers. For example, if she felt uncomfortable about misinformation or confusion as to the nutritio n topic discussed, she made notes an d then share d thoughts with the presenters and or participants after the session. Consulting with colleagues is another excellent way to monitor subjectivity , and was used by the researcher . In addition the researcher c onsult ed with other Registered Dieti tians and parents working on similar projects , an important avenue of approach. Finally the researcher found that k eeping analytical memos and thinking out l oud w ere important tools . Summary This chapter described the research design, research setting, r esearch sample and data sources, instruments and procedures, data collection and analysis , and the role of the researcher. This pre-experimental research design used mixed -methods , surveys, debriefing sessions, one -on-one questions , and measurements of body weight, BMI and percent body fat were collected. The research setting was five schools in LAUSD , using data sources from 202 parents who attended the workshop series , and analysis from 108 parents who participated in pretest, posttest, and follow -up se ssions. The instruments used were a survey, debriefing sessions, one -on-one questions and weight scale/BIA. The procedures include d collecting survey and weight/BIA data at week 0, week 4, and 63 week 12 follow -ups. Quantitative data analys es consisted of repeated measures ANOVAs testing for significant differences in cooking, eating habits and physical activity at pretest, posttest, and follow -up to determine changes in behavior and knowledge . Repeated measures ANOVAs were also used to analyze the signifi cant differences in body weight, percent body fat, and BMI at pretest, posttest, and follow -up. Qualitative data analys es consisted of the coding of responses from open ended questions at debriefing sessions at week 4, week 12, and one -on-one questioning of each participant during the weighing session at week 12. Chapter 4 presents the findings from the study. 64 CHAPTER 4 RESULTS The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of \"A Taste of Good Health,\" a school -based parent education progr am designed to affect healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in a large urban school district. Participant nutrition, physical activity, cooking knowledge, and BMI were measured before, during, and three months after the parent educa tion intervention. Although this program has been successful in increasing nutrition knowledge, based on verbal feedback from previous participants, no follow -up evaluation to determine whether participants and their families made changes in their nutriti on, cooking, and physical activity both during and three months after the completion of the program had been previously completed. To augment quantitative evaluation data, the study examined participants views of the program at both posttest and follow -up to inform changes to the program and the workshops. Given the pandemic proportions of childhood obesity (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2007), and the research calling for the evaluation of school/community partne rships focused on family -based interventions, there is a critical need to evaluate programs that can be used in schools and districts implementing school/community partnership interventions with a focus on parent education . . In order to evaluate how \"A T aste of Good Health\" classes affect healthful behavior in parent participants and their families, it was hypothesized that providing an 65 intervention which focused on educating parents on nutrition, physical activity, and cooking will result in the adoption of a more healthy lifestyle. The study addressed the following four research questions: 1. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on participants knowledge regarding nutrition, cooking, and physical activity? 2. Are there si gnificant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants? 3. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on cooking, eating habits, and physic al activity of the participants and their families? 4. What comments, observations, and suggestions do participants of the program have to guide any changes to the program? This chapter will be organized by a brief review of the methods followed by the result s of the study organized by research questions. For research question one, the results will be displayed and discussed based on the quantitative analys es of the change in nutrition, cooking , and physical activity knowledge. For research question two, the results will be displayed and discussed based on the quantitative analyses of the changes in weight, BMI, and percent body fat. For research question t hree, the section will be organized by both quantitative and qualitative results. The quantitative res ults will be organized by three main sections: (1) cooking , (2) eating habits , and (3) physical activity. Each subsection in question three will be followed by qualitative results from the debriefing sessions in week 4 , week 12, and the one-on-one sessio ns in week 12. Research question four will only include qualitative analys es and will be organized based on themes. There will be a summary at the end of the chapter 66 Overview of Methods To address the research questions, this dissertation emp loyed mixed -methods (Hanson et al. , 2005) and pre -experimental survey design (i.e., pretest, posttest, follow -up design without a comparison/control group) in evaluating the effectiveness of the parent workshops. As noted earlier, the planned intervention consisted of a 4 -week program, meeting once a week for 2\u00bd hours at each meeting, for a total of 10 hours of instruction. The program was implemented in five schools in one local district in LAUSD . In order to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in changin g participant s knowledge and behavior, quantitative data were collected through survey administration . A total of 202 participants consented to participate in the research study. There were 19 participants in school one, 38 participants in school two, 6 2 participants in school three, 51 participants in school four, and 35 participants in school five who completed the pretest. A total of 202 pretests were completed. Of the 202 participants, approximately 149 completed the posttest , and 108 participants completed the follow up surveys. All survey data were coded and then entered into an Excel spread sheet. The analyses were run in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS ) 20.0 on Macintosh computer. To augment the quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from participants in the program during debriefing session s at week 4 and at the follow up sessions in week 12. In addition, during the follow up sessions in week 12, one-on-one questioning was completed with each participant while th ey were being weighed . The following questions were asked during the week 4 large group debriefing session at each site to determine what changes were recommended for the overall improvement of the program 67 and workshops. 1. How can this program be changed o r improved to be more helpful to you? 2. Which parts of the program were most useful? 3. Which parts of the program were least useful? The questions asked during the debriefing sessions with all participants at week 12 follow -up were as follows : 1. What are some c hanges that you and your family have made to your cooking techniques because of the program? 2. What are some changes that you and your family have made to your eating and nutrition behaviors because of the program? 3. What are some changes that you and your fam ily have made to your physical activity behaviors because of the program? During the week 12 follow -up session, each participant was individually asked to explain from their perspective how the program had benefited their children and family. Quantitativ e Analyses Repeated measures of analys is of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze the significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up. If a significant difference was found , then post hoc analyses were conducted to examine if the differ ences were between (1) pretest and posttest, (2) posttest and follow -up, and/or (3) pretest and follow - up. Post hoc analyses were considered significant if p < .05. The sample size for each analysis was determined by the number of participants who comple ted the specific survey question at pretest, posttest, and follow -up. Since some participants did not complete an item at either pretest, posttest, or follow -up, there is a different sample size ( n) for some 68 analyses. Qualitative Analyses During the week 4 posttest and week 12 follow -up sessions, in addition to participants completing the survey , a debriefing session was held with each group. There were 149 attendees in the week 4 debriefing sessions : 13 participants in school one, 26 participants in school two, 43 participants in school three, 42 participants in school four, and 25 participants in school five. The questions asked during week 4 posttest were to determine what changes participants recommended to improve the program and workshops. Respon ses were transcribed , and the researcher coded for themes that were most common across all sites in regards to recommended changes. During the debriefing session in week 12 , approximately 108 participants were in attendance : ten participants in school one , 23 participants in school two, 31 participants in school three, 19 participants in school four, and 15 participants in school five. Participants were encouraged t o share with the group any changes they and their families had made in their cooking, eatin g habits, and/or physical activity behaviors. Responses were transcribed , and the researcher coded for themes that were most common across all sites as to changes in cooking, eating habits , and physical activity. In addition, during th e one -on-one sessio n at the week 12 follow -up, each participant was asked to describe how the program had benefited their children and their family. Ninety -one participants responded to this question, and their responses were transcribed and coded for themes related to repo rted changes in behavior. 69 Results Research Question 1 Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on participants knowledge regarding nutrition, cooking, and physical activity? The ANOVAs indicated significant difference s between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on (1) nutrition and cooking knowledge , and (2) physical activity knowledge (see Table 4.1). Post hoc analyses indicated that nutrition and cooking knowledge was significantly higher at posttest and follow -up tha n it was at pretest. Similar results were found for physical activity knowledge.

Research Question 2 Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants? The participants were weighed and measured at the beginning of the program (i.e., pretest). Body weight was determined using a standing weight scale at the school site. Participants stood on t he scale without adornments (e.g., purse). Their weight was recorded in pounds and entered into an Excel spreadsheet. BMI was calculated using the following formula: BMI = (weight/height2) x 703. Percent body fat was measured using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measuring instrument. These measurements 70 were repeated during the final session of the workshop at week 4 (posttest) and again at the week 12 follow -up session. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on pounds and BMI, but no significant differences were found on percent body fat (see Table 4.2). Post hoc analyses indicated that weight (in poun ds) was significantly lower at posttest and follow -up than it was at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated that BMI was significantly lower at posttest than it was at pretest.

Research Question 3 Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on cooking, eating habits, and physical activity of participants and their families? Changes in cooking : Quantitative analys es. Eight questions on the survey asked participants to report how many times per week the y had made changes to their cooking techniques. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on (1) cooking with butter or margarine, (2) grilling and baking, and (3) reading food labels for ingredients (see Table 4.3 ). However, no significant differences were found on (1) cooking with oils, (2) removing fat before cooking, and (3) cooki ng together as a family. Post hoc analyses indicated that participants reported significantly 71 less cooking with butter/margarine at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported significantly more grilling /baking at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. And finally, post hoc analyses indicated participants read labels significantly more at follow -up than at pretest or posttest.

Changes in cooking : Qualitative analys es. To augment the quantitative results, participants at each of the sites engaged in a large group debriefing session during week 12 where they were aske d to share any changes they and their families had made to cooking techniques because of the program. As can be seen in Table 4.3a , the most common theme s that arose in debriefing sessions at each of the sites were that participants reported baking, steam ing, and grilling more and frying less. In addition, participants in all five schools reported they were using more fruits and vegetables when cooking. In all five schools, participants reported they were also using less oil or using different types of o ils (e.g., olive, canola, or grapeseed oil, instead of butter or Crisco) . Participants in three out of five schools indicated that they made ingredient substitutions 72 to recipes as such as using (1) turkey meat instead of beef, (2) using whole wheat flour t o bake, and (3) choosing healthier condiments such as (a) mustard and vegenaise over mayonnaise and (b) using agave or stevia over syrup . These responses suggested that participants were using the knowledge gained during class and were making changing to their cooking techniques and behaviors at home.

Out of 91 respondents, 43 (47%) mentioned making changes to their cooking t echniques such as grilling more and frying less. Although survey data were not significant regarding cooking together as a family, 42 out of 91 participants (43%) in the one -on-one sessions reported they and their families were taking an active p art in he althy food preparation, selection, and cooking as evidenced by comments such as , \"My 7 -year-old daughter learned how to read food labels, to read the sodium content and fats. My daughters can also distinguish healthy 73 foods from the unhealthy ones.\" Anothe r participant stated, \"We made changes in food preparation, using Quinoa, changing oil and my family has accepted it.\" Overall, these comments suggested an interest in involving the whole family in making he althy cooking and food choices. One participant s comment summarized this theme when she said, \"I enjoy cooking with my children. They like participating in the preparation of [meals] ... and often help with the addition of healthy ingredients.\" Changes in eating habits : Quantitative analys es. Thirty -eight questions on the survey asked participants to report how many times per week the participants and their families were eating foods from different food groups. In analyzing data and presenting results, the eating habits have been subcategorized by: (a) carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, grains, etc. ; (b) proteins such as soy, meats, nuts, etc. ; (c) dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese ; (d) deserts and sugars ; (e) fats ; and (f) overall eating habits such as eating as a family or ea ting at fast food restaurants. Carbohydrates . The ANOVA s were conducted to compare the pretest, posttest, and follow -up scores on how often the participants and their families reported eating fruits and vegetables, non -sugary cold cereals (e.g., Bran flake s, Cheerios, or Corn Flakes), sugary cold cereals (e.g., Frosted Flakes, Trix, Lucky Charms), hot cereals (e.g., oatmeal or cream of wheat) , whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, whole grain rice, or whole wheat tortillas, and/or white pasta, bread, rice, or tortillas. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on (1) eating vegetables, (2) eating hot cereals, and (3) reducing the intake of white bread, rice and tortillas (see Table 4.4 ). However, no significant differences were found on (1) eating fruits, (2) eating sugary or cold cereals, and (3) eating whole wheat 74 breads. Post hoc analyses indicated that consumption of vegetables reported by participants were significantly higher at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported eating significantly less sugary cereal at follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses in addition indicated that participants reported eating significantly more oatmeal and cream of wh eat at posttest and follow -up compared to pretest. And finally, post hoc analyses indicated participants reported eating significantly fewer white bread s at follow -up than at pretest or posttest.

Proteins . The participants and their families were asked how often they were eating foods from the protein group such as (1 ) chicken, turkey, or lean beef ; (2) soy or soy products ; (3) nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts) ; (4) luncheon meats (e.g., salami, hot dogs) ; (5) higher fat meats (e.g., pork, ham, or bacon) ; (6) beans or lentils ; (7) eggs; and/or (8) egg whites. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on eating (1) soy or soy products, and (2) nuts (see Table 4.5 ). However, no 75 significant differences were found on eating (1) chicken, turkey, and lean beef; (2) luncheon me ats; (3) pork; (4) beans; and (5) eggs or egg whites. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported eating significantly more soy and soy products at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated that participants repo rted eating significantly more nuts at posttest and follow -up compared to pretest. Although the ANOVA was not significant, post hoc analyses indicated that consumption of chicken, turkey, or lean beef reported by participants were significantly higher at follow - up from pretest. Similarly, post hoc analyses indicated participants reported eating significantly fewer luncheon meats at follow -up than at pretest or posttest.

Dairy products . The ANOVAs indicated significant diff erences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on eating reduced fat cheese, yogurt , and cottage cheese (see Table 4.6 ). However, no significant differences were found on (1) eating regular yogurt 76 and cottage cheese ; (2) drink ing regular milk ; or (3) dr inking reduced -fat or fat -free milk. Post hoc analyses indicated participants reported choosing and eating significantly more reduced fat and fat free cheese and yogurt at follow -up as compared to pretest.

Desserts. The participants were asked to report how often they were eating (1) regular ice cream ; (2) low-fat or fat -free frozen desserts (e.g., frozen yogurts, sorbet ); and (3) cookies, cakes , donuts , and candy. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on eating (1) regular ice cream and (2) cookies, cakes , donuts , and candy (see Table 4.7 ). However, no significant differences were found on eating low -fat or fat -free frozen desserts. Post hoc analyses indicated participants reported eating significan tly less regular ice cream at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported eating significantly fewer cookies, cakes , donuts, and candies at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. 77 Table 4.7 Repeat ed Measures ANOVA Desserts Pretest Posttest Follow -up N M SD M SD M SD F p Eta Eat regular ice cream 73 1.75ab 1.13 1.41a 1.08 1.30b .93 6.75 .002 .09 Eat low -fat or fat free frozen desserts 82 1.30 1.15 1.34 .96 1.40 1.10 .24 .77 .00 Eat cookies , cakes, donuts and candy 79 1.44ab .75 1.14a .76 1.19b .66 7.13 .002 .08 Same superscripts (e.g., aa or bb or cc) indicate significant differences (p < .05) in post hoc analyses. Fats. The participants were asked to report how often they were eating (1) chips ; (2) using regular salad dressing, mayonnaise, or cream sa uces; and/or (3) using olive oil, vinaigrettes, or fat -free salad dressings . The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on eating (1) chips ; (2) using regular salad dressing, mayonnaise, or cream sa uces; and (3) using olive oil, vinaigrettes, or fat -free salad dressings (see Table 4.8 ). Post hoc analyses indicated participants reported eating significantly fewer chips at posttest and follow -up tha n at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated that participants reported using less regular salad dressing, mayonnaise, or cream sa uces at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Finally, post hoc analyses indicated that participants reported using more olive oil and fat -free dressings at follow up than at pretest or posttest. 78 Table 4.8 Repeated Measures ANOVA Fats Pretest Posttest Follow -up N M SD M SD M SD F p Eta Eat chips 84 1.63ab .87 1.37a .66 1.21b .71 12.4 .000 .13 Use regular salad dressing or mayonnaise 84 1.65ab .90 1.36a .94 1.34b .78 5.99 .003 .07 Use olive oil, vinaigrette or fat - free salad dressing 84 1.96b 1.41 2.19c 1.53 2.51 bc 1.42 7.04 .001 .08 Same superscripts (e.g., aa or bb or cc) indicate significant differe nces (p < .01 ) in post hoc analyses. Overall eating habits. Participants were asked how often they and their families were (1) eating fried foods ; (2) eating fast foods ; (3) eating ready -made frozen dinners ; (4) eating 5-6 meals per day ; (5) preparing and eating breakfast at home ; (6) eating dinner with the entire family ; and (7) preparing and eating dinner at home. The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on (1) eating fried foods , and (2) eating 5 -6 meals per day. However, no significant differences were found on (1) eating fast food s; (2) eating ready -made frozen dinners ; (3) preparing and eating breakfast at home ; (4) eating dinner with the entire family ; and (5) preparing and eating dinner at home (see Tab le 4.9 ). Post hoc analyses indicated participants reported eating significantly fewer fried foods at follow -up than at pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported they were eating 5 -6 meals per day at posttest and follow - up as compare d to pretest where they reported eating large portions less often. Although not significant in the ANOVA, the post hoc analyses indicated that participants reported eating significantly fewer fast foods at follow -up than at pretest. The post hocs also indicted that participants reported preparing and eating more breakfasts at home at follow -up than at posttest, and participants reported that they were eating more dinners 79 with the entire family at follow -up than at pretest.

Changes in eating habits: Qualitative analys es. To augment the q uantitative results, participants in the large group debriefing session during week 12 at each site were asked to share any changes they and their families had made to their eating and nutrition behaviors because of the program. The most common topics a bout making changes to eating habits and choosing and offering healthier options that came up in the schools are listed in Table 4.9a. As can be seen in the table, participants at all of the schools reported that they were doing one or all of the following: limiting or reducing portion sizes, e ating fewer fats and oils , eating more fruits and vegetables , eating more whole grain , and limiting chips. They also reported that they were limiting white rice , offering children fruits such as blueberries as snacks, and making fruit and vegetable smoothies and offering them to their children . In addition, t hey reported eating less red meat and eating more lean meats such as chicken or turkey. Participants also reported offering children 80 foods low in fat, eliminatin g junk food from their diet , and using healthier condiments (e.g., chili and lemon instead of salt). Participants in four out of five schools (80%) indicated that they were eating more home cooked meals and less takeout and they avoided skipping breakfast . They also reported offering more low -fat milk to their families. In add ition, the participants in four out of the five schools (80%) reported that they were drinking less soda, l imiting juice consumption by offering milk , and encouraging drinking more w ater.

Themes at 12-week Debriefing on Changes in Eating and Nutrition Behavior School Number % Mentioned Theme 1 2 3 4 5 Reduced portion sizes 1 1 1 1 1 100% More fruits and vegetables; more whole grain; limiting white rice. 1 1 1 1 1 100% Eat more home cooked meals, less takeout Avoid skipping breakfast; offering more low fat milk 1 1 0 1 1 80% Less soda consumption , more water , limit juice 1 1 0 0 1 80% In analyzing the qualitative data, two major themes emerged from the sessions. One theme related to overall eating habits, suggesting that participants were proactively creating an environment that focused on healt hy eating habits for the family. Interacting with this theme, a second theme suggested by the responses was that participants were using the knowledge that they had gained in the workshops to make changes in their nutrition and cooking skills. For exampl e, participants spoke of eating more fruits and vegetables as a family. As in the surveys, they reported eating more whole grains and were eliminating sugary cereals. Participants frequently spoke of \"choosing\" and 81 \"offering\" healthier options, all of wh ich indicated they were creating an environment in their homes that emphasized healthy food choices. During the one -on-one session with participants at the week 12 follow -up, while being weighed and measured , the 91 participants in attendance were each a sked \"From your perspective, how has this program benefited your children and your family?\" The themes of proactively creating an environment that focused on healthy eating habits for the family and using the knowledge they had gained in the workshops to make changes in their nutrition and cooking skills were similar to the group debriefing sessions. They can be summarized as (1) eating more fruits and vegetables ; (2) lowering fat intake ; (3) lowering portion sizes ; and (3) drinking less soda and offering more water and low -fat milk. Fifty -two out of 91 (57%) participants mentioned eating more fruits and vegetables as a family. Participants also reported eating more whole grains and fiber as suggested by comments such as , \"We are choosing more fiber and whole grain options such as whole wheat bread and brown rice, over white.\" As in the large group debriefing sessions, participants frequently used words such as \"choosing\" and \"offering,\" which further suggested participants were being proactive by using t he knowledge gained in the workshops to offer healthier food choices for their families based on what they had learned from class. A comment by one participant captured the overall feelings from participants when she stated, \"We have learned so much about nutrition and trying to eat better. I am giving [my family] healthier foods and less junk food. I am offering fruit, salads ... and my children are eating more vegetables and fiber.\" Similar to the quant itative data indicating participants had significan tly reduced 82 their fat intake , 52% of respondents talked about reducing their fat intake and the typ es of fats they were choosing. Responses from participants suggested they were t aking an active role in making healt hy food choices and creating a healthier food environment where families w ere \"reading nutrition labels\" and \"using less high -fat dressing .\" As one participant commented, \"My husband was a big fan of chips but since attending one class he hasnt bought any and said they needed to get rid of the m at home .\" This again suggested the participants had taken the knowledge gained during the workshops and made changes not only in their own eating habits but also in their families eating habits. Not only were participants reporting making better food choices but they were also making changes in the ir environment s through practicing portion control by offering smaller portion sizes. Forty -nine out of 91 respondents (54%) ment ioned they were reducing or lowering their portion sizes. Participants were u sing fewer tortillas and smaller portions of meats. One participants comment represented what most reported when she stated, \"Controlling the portion size of our foods is an accomplishment for our family but also eliminating chips and soda from our diet. Even the kids are following along and when we go to the supermarket they make better choices.\" Fifty -one participants out of 91 (56%) indicated som e type of change in lowering soda consumption and sugars while increasing water and low -fat milk consumptio n. Participants reported offering more water , and comments suggested they understood the importance of drinking water instead of offering juice or soda . One person stated, \"We are drinking more water as a family and make fresh homemade waters by adding lemon, spinach, to the water.\" Another commented, \"The kids only drink soda on Sunday ,\" again suggesting that participants understood the importance of limiting soda. 83 However, responses from some participants suggested there were challenges and barriers th ey will have to overcome as they work to create a healthier home environment for their families. For example, participants spoke of introducing lower fat dairy products to their families that was met with resistance from members of the family. Some indica ted that their children did not like the taste stating, \"1% taste like water.\" Although there was some creativity by one participant who said, \"I am mixing 1% milk with 2%. They dont notice the difference and they drink it.\" This would suggest that maki ng changes in the environment can present some unique challenges for the families.

Three questio ns on the survey asked participants how often they were (1) walking 30 minutes or more per day ; (2) engaging in aerobic activity (e.g., jogging, biking, or swimming) ; and/or (3) being involved in a group physical activity (e.g., group sports, soccer, baske tball, and baseball.) The ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on all three items (see Table 4.1 0) Post hoc analyses indicated that participants reported walking significantly more per day at follow -up than a t pretest. Post hoc analyses also indicated participants reported engaging in aerobic activities significantly more at posttest and follow -up than at pretest. Finally, post hoc analyses indicated participants reported 84 involvement in group activities sign ificantly more at follow -up than at pretest or posttest.

Physical activity : Qualitative analys es. The quantitative results were further confirmed durin g the week 12 group debriefing when the participants were asked , \"What are some changes t hat you and your family have made to your physical activity behaviors because of the program?\" As can be seen in Table 4.1 0a, the most common theme that arose in the debriefing sessions in all five schools regarding making changes to physical activity wer e (1) more walking as a family, (2) involving children in more sports , and (3) participating in group act ivities and engaging in a variety of physical activities such as biking and dancing. Participants in all five schools (100%) indicated that they were walking more, doing Zumba, bike riding, dancing , and involving their children in more sports and activities. In addition, participants in four out of five schools (80%) indicated that they were trying to get more physically active by a voiding public trans portation and driving, and (if they did drive) p arking far from destination, and using stairs instead of the elevator. 85 Table 4.1 0a What are some changes that you and your family have made to your physical activity behaviors because of the program?

Sixty -one out of 91 respondents (67%) reported that they were being more physica lly active. Participants comments suggested they recognized the importance of physical activity and involving their families in many different types of activities. Again, parents were taking a proactive role in their enviro nment, suggesting they were using the knowledge they had gained in their classes. They reported taking the children often to the park and walking more often as a family. They spoke of parking their cars at the end of the parking lot and taking stairs ins tead of the elevator to increase activity. One participants statement summed up the changes in physical activity reported by many others when she stated, \"My family and I walk more in the evenings now and we are doing more exercise ... they ride their bike s ... we dance at home ... we are going to the park and playing baseball and soccer.\" Research Question 4 What comments, observations, and suggestions do participants of the program have to guide any changes to the program? 86 Research question four only includ ed qualitative data from parents responses during a large group debriefing session during week 4 in which they were asked, \" How can this program be changed or improved to be more helpful to you? Which parts of the program were most useful? Which parts of the program were least useful? \" Overall, the data suggested participants were requesting strategies that would increase their knowledge and assist them in applying what they learned to continue to make changes in their lifestyle and environment. With rega rd to how the program could be changed or improved, p articipants in all five of the s chools stated that they would like longer Zumba and exercise classes. Some comments by participants were , \"the classes are only 20 -30 minutes\" and \"longer yoga, Zumba or dance classes will be great .\" Participants in 4 out of 5 schools mentioned they would like more recipes. One participant commented , \"I would like different recipes for quinoa ,\" while another said \"more recipes to make with my children.\" In addition, participants in all five schools said that they would like more overall nutrition and cooking classes. One participant was surprised that the classes would not be ongoing stating, \"You mean this is not each week? We can benefit from a nutrition class each week.\" Another agreed , \"More than four classes will be helpful .\" In addition, participants in three out of five schools asked for classes on diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cholesterol, food allergies, nutrition through lifespan , and high blood pressure . One participant noted, \"We would like to learn more about diabetes and taking care of our heart.\" Another participant said , \"I want to know how to control my blood pressure.\" Another comment from a participant was, \"we want to include children in the classes .\" The participants liked the lesson plans and handouts from each class , commenting, \"I 87 wish we had additional time and more information on food labels .\" Participants in one school asked for one-on-one counseling sessions with follow -ups by a regi stered dietitian , stating, \" I would like to learn how to interpret the body fat percent and work with an RD.\" All of these comments suggested participants were interested in continuing to add to their knowledge base regarding nutrition, cooking, and physi cal activity, which would result in a more healthy lifestyle for themselves and their families. In terms of usefulness of the program, p articipants in all five schools expressed that they found the program to be very useful. They indicated that learning h ow to read food labels and portion sizes was the most useful . One participant stated, \"Learning about the food label has helped us look for different fats in the foods and serving sizes .\" They expressed thankfulness at learning about \"portion control\" an d \"serving sizes\" for protein and other food groups. They also were appreciative about (1) \"learning sources of spe cific vitamins and minerals like calcium and vitam in D,\" (2) \"exercising to lower disease s,\" (3) \"using the recipes as a family ,\" (4) \" learning about Myplate as a guide for portion control, \" and (5) \"Spanish speaking instructor and resources.\" A comment by one participant seemed to reflect the feelings of the many participants when she stated, I really love this program and I wish you could have it more often and we can have you guys around and we could learn more stuff becaus e I have learned a lot from you ... you gave us handouts ... booklets ... recipes. My kids liked them and we use the recipes. The program participants were then asked the third question, \"Which parts of the program were least useful?\" Participants in all five schools said that everything was useful. A participant from one school indicated that she would like more explanation of 88 the material in a simpler format. Most paren ts in this particular debriefing session however, disagreed. As stated by a parent , We really appreciate you giving us the time to show us, the parents and community, how to eat healthy and how to teach our kids to eat healthy and be better so that we co uld have a better health. Not only dieting but better heart and good healthy body ... I really liked this program and you guys did a good job. Many participants expressed appreciation for the classes and indicated how it has helped their families make healt hier choices. One participants stated, This program has benefited me. I dont want my kids to go through what I went though because I was always punked. I was always being called names because of my weight. People are mean now and kids are cruel. This is a good program for all of us to get our kids together and start eating healthy because I do see overweight kids and its pretty sad because these children are more overweight than they were in the 80s . This reflection upon participants own issues with childhood weight problems and how they saw the benefits of the workshops as a way to educate their own children early on about living a healthy lifestyle was expressed by a number of participants , with one participant comment ing, Im really enjoying spen ding time with my children and being able to eat our meals as a fa mily. It has benefited me and my children in many ways. Its a really good program. I like it because Ive had weight problems since I was a little girl and people always made fun of me a nd I like this program because it helps my kids too . I mean to take care of themselves, to eat healthy and do a lot 89 of things like exercise and stuff. I mean I do it more for them than for myself because I dont want them to have weight problems and go t hrough what I went through with people. A participant with tears in her eye stated , \"So, that is why Im taking this class so that my kids could learn how to take care of themselves and [to take care of their] weight and to exercise and how to eat healthy .\" These statements indicated parents felt the program was beneficial to them and their families. They reported that the program was providing them with tools to spend more time with their children, cook with their children, and ma ke healthier lifestyle changes. They reported wanting more nutrition and physical activity classes and additional recipes. They did not report any part of the program as not useful. Overall data suggested participants were requesting strategies that would increase their knowled ge and assist them in applying what they learned to continue to make changes in their lifestyle and environment. Summary This study was conducted to evaluate how the \"A Taste of Good Health\" school - based parent education program affected healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in a large urban school district . The results for research question one indicated that parents in all five schools significantly increased their nutrition, cooking , and physical activity knowledge from pretest to posttest and follow -up. In regards to question number two, parents in all five schools decreased their body weight and BMI from pretest to posttest . Research question three examined participant reports of cooking, eating , and physical activity behavior s. Regarding cooking techniques, parents and their 90 families reported grilling and steaming more , and frying less. In regards to eating behavior, participants reported they and their families were eating more fruits and vegetables, fewer sugary cereals, mor e oatmeal / cream and wheat, and less white bread or rice. Although participants reported they and their families were eating more low -fat meats, soy products , and nuts, there were no significant differences from pretest to posttest on t he consumption of beans, lentils, and eggs. They report ed consuming more reduced -fat cheese, yogurt , and cottage cheese. In regards to des serts, they were eating less regular ice cream, as well as less candy and desserts. They were using less fat, saturated fat, creamy s auces, and mayonnaise while using more olive oil. Participants were drinking more water and drinking less soda. They were buying fewer chips and offering healthier snacks to their families. The participants had significantly decreased their fat intake. In regards to changes in physical activity, they were walking more with their families and for longer periods of time. They were participating in more group activities and organized sports. In regards to program changes, participants indicated that they would like more nutrition classes, longer Zumba classes , more recipes , and additional information on different chronic diseas es. They thought everything was useful and did not indicate the need for any changes. The quantitative data along with the qualit ative data collected at the week 12 debriefing and one -on-one sessions suggested that participants had used the knowledge gained in the classes to create healthier home environments for their children and families. A discussion of these results and their implications for policy and practice are presented in Chapter 5. 91 CHAPTER 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This chapter interprets and discusses the results in light of the studys research questions, and conceptual framework. First, a summary of the study th at includes a brief overview of the problem, purpose, research questions, methodology, and major findings is provided. This is followed by an interpretation and analysis of the findings and their relationship to the literature and conceptual framework tha t guided this study. The chapter concludes with implications for policy and practice and recommendations for future research. Summary of Study The dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity, particularly in Latino populations, as well as the serious consequences of childhood obesity including the health and financial burdens that transpire as a result, have prompted the need for broad interventions in order to address this public health issue (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole et al. , 2006; Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001; Foster et al., 2007; Ogden & Carroll, 2010). Given the pandemic proportions of childhood obesity (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Cole et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2007), and the research calling for the systemat ic evaluation of school/community partnerships that are focused on family -based interventions, there is a critical need to evaluate programs that can be used in schools and districts implementing school/community partnership interventions with a focus on p arent education . 92 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of \"A Taste of Good Health,\" a school -based parent education program designed to affect healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in five schools with a high pe rcentage of Latino families in the LAUSD . The intervention consisted of a 4 -week program, meeting once a week for 2\u00bd hours at each meeting, for a total of 10 hours of instruction. Classes were taught by a bilingual Registered Dietitian and focused on hea lthy eating and cooking techniques. Although verbal feedback from previous participants has indicated this program has been successful in increasing nutrition knowledge, no systematic follow -up evaluation to determine if participants and their families ev idenced changes in their nutrition, cooking, and physical activity knowledge and behavior both during and three months after the completion of the program had been previously completed. It was hypothesized that providing an intervention that focused on ed ucating parents on nutrition, physical activity, and cooking would result in the adoption of a more healthy lifestyle by workshop participants. In order to evaluate how \"A Taste of Good Health\" classes affect healthful behavior in parent participants and t heir families, it was hypothesized that providing an intervention which focused on educating parents on nutrition, physical activity, and cooking would result in the adoption of a healthier lifestyle. The study addressed the following four research questio ns: 1. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on participants knowledge regarding nutrition, cooking, and physical activity? 2. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on body weight, body m ass index (BMI), and percent body fat of the participants? 93 3. Are there significant differences between pretest, posttest, and follow -up on cooking, eating habits, and physical activity of the participants and their families? 4. What comments, observations, and suggestions do participants of the program have to guide any changes to the program? To address the research questions, this dissertation emp loyed mixed -methods (Hanson et al. , 2005) and pre -experimental survey design (i.e., pretest, posttest, follow -up design without a comparison/control group) in evaluating the effectiveness of the parent workshops. In order to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in changing participants knowledge and behavior, quantitative data were collected through a survey administered at week 0 ( pretest), week 4 (posttest), and week 12 (follow -up). There were a total of 202 participants who consented to participate in the research study. Of the 202 participants who completed the pretest survey, 149 completed the posttes t survey, and 108 pa rticipants completed the follow -up survey. All survey data were coded and then entered into an E xcel spreadsheet. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze the significant differences between pretest, postte st, and follow -up. The analyses were run in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0 on a Macintosh computer. In order to augment quantitative evaluation data, a debriefing session and one -on- one questioning of participants was c ompleted at the week 12 follow -up to determine what changes, if any, participants had made based on the workshop series. In addition, the researcher gathered participants views of the usefulness of the program through debriefing sessions with participants at each o f the sites during the week 4 posttest sessions. Qualitative data were coded and themes generated based on a conceptual 94 framework. The conceptual framework that guided this study incorporates components of Epsteins School, Family, and Community Partners hip Model (Epstein, 2011), and Golan and Weizmans (2001) conceptual model of the familial approach to the treatment of childhood obesity. Summary of Major Findings Overall findings suggest that participants used the knowledge gained in the classes to c reate healthier home environments for their children and families. Using both quantitative and qualitative measures, major findings indicated participants in all five schools reported : (1) significantly increasing their nutrition, cooking, and physical activity knowledge from pretest to posttest and follow -up; (2) significantly decreasing their body weight and BMI from pretest to posttest; and (3) making significant changes in cooking, eating, and physical activity behaviors. Regarding cooking techniques, parents and their families reported grilling more , steaming more, and frying less. In regards to eating behavior, participants reported that both they and their families were eating more fruits and vegetables, less white bread or sugary cereals and more whole grain cereals. They also reported eating more low-fat meats, soy products, nuts, more reduced -fat cheeses, less regular ice cream, less candy and fewer desserts. They reported using less fat, saturated fat, creamy sauces, and mayonnaise while using more olive oil. The participants reported significantly decreasing their fat and sugar intake while increasing consumption of drinking water and healthier snacks. In regards to changes in physical activity, th ey were walking more as a families and for lo nger periods of time. They were participating in more group activities 95 and organized sports. Finally, participants indicated they found the classes useful and were desirous of more classes. Discussion Using concepts from the Golan and Weizman (2001) con ceptual model of the familial approach to the treatment of childhood obesity and Epsteins (2011) school, family, and community partnership model, this study employed a logic model entitled \"A Taste of Good Health\" (See Figure 1.1) as a framework for evalu ating the parent education intervention. The model was a way to visually represent the various components of the project organized around the ideas presented in the conceptual framework outlined in Chapter 1. The \"Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model proce ss was utilized by the researcher to evaluate the ef fectiveness of the school -based parent workshops in increasing nutrition, cooking and physical activity knowledge, changing behavior in these areas, and measuring any changes in participants weight and B MI. The model described the process and linkages between the program resources, activities, outputs, participants, and short -term and intermediate -term outcomes related to educating participants about ways to create a healthful home environment with the long-term outcome of curbing childhood obesity. The discussion of this study will be organized around how this school -based parent workshop series affected changes in knowledge, behavior, and the family environment of participants. Changes in Knowledge Both qualitative and quantitative data reported by participants indicate that parents increased their knowledge of cooking techniques, proper nutrition habits, and 96 physical activities that would lead to a healthier lifestyle. These results are consistent with the goa ls of the program and the short -term outcomes from the \"Taste of Good Health\" Logic Model to increase participant s nutrition, cooking , and physical activity knowledge from pretest to posttest and follow -up. The quantitative data suggest ed a significant increase in the parents knowledge from pretest to postte st, and posttest to follow -up. It is apparent from the qualitative data, including the responses of parents regarding the behavioral changes they had made, that they had increased their cook ing, eating , and physical activity knowledge. They continued to learn as they were reading more labels and using different cooking techniques, while including family members in cooking and finding different ways to get physically active as a family. These findings were similar to the findings in a study completed by Hopper et al. (1996), which clearly showed that as parents increased their nutrition al knowledge , short - term dietary changes in the ir children and their families followed . The f indings are a lso consistent with literature from the American Dietetic Association Foundation (ADAF, n.d.) that suggests as parents increased their knowledge in nutrition, cooking, and physical activity, they made changes in their famil ies environment. Research has reinforced the need to increase the knowledge base of parents in order to effect the change that is necessary in the family model (Golan & Weizman, 2001). The parents, through increased knowledge, can learn and appreciate the importance of a non -diet appro ach (Savoye et al., 2005). The findings from the present study confirmed that parents had increased their knowledge and they were using thi s knowledge to make changes in their families eating and physical activity. 97 The findings showed that increases in n utrition and physical activity knowledge were significantly high er at follow up than pretest and even posttest. This indicates that the participants not only increased their knowledge during the program, but they also continued learning and practicing aft er the completion of the program. There could be two explanations for this result. One explanation is that parents were extremely motivated and confident , and they continued to learn and practice. Second, it could be that they knew that they were coming back in three months . and that kept them motivated to learn and make changes to their lifestyles in the short term. This leads to the conclusi on that many families need long -term support, resources, and follow -up to ensure they are successful in making h ealthy behavior changes. Changes in Behavior Changes in behavior led to changes in weight and BMI, cooking techniques, nutrition , and physical activity. Changes in weight and BMI were consistent with the goals of the program and intermediate -term outcomes of the \"A Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model , which was to help participants maintain or lower their BMI. Changes in cooking, eating , and physical activity behavior s were consistent with the goals of the program and short -term outcomes of the \"A Taste of Good Health \" Logic Model to cook healthier and provide healthier meals for their families. With regard to changes in weight and BMI, the ANOVAs indicated significant differences between pretest, p osttest, and follow -up on weight and BMI, but no significa nt differences were found on percent body fat (see Table 4.2). There are two possible explanations for not seeing a change in percent body fat. First, the percent body fat machine has specific instructions to not have participant eat or drink at least on e hour 98 prior to taking the measurements , thus the researcher informed participants during the first session in schools while reviewing the consent forms. However, it is possible that the participants forgot and had consumed something within that period of time. Second, it is possible that parents decreased their percent body fat, but not enough for the analysis to show a significant change. Quantitative data indicated that parents weighed less, and BMI w as lower at posttest and follow -up than at pretest . Specifically, the program teaches the participants how to make better food, cooking and physical activity choices. The focus of this program was not specific to weight loss, but it appears the parents knew the consequences related to being overweight an d were making behavioral changes. During the debriefing session, several participants spoke about the importance of the program while recognizing how they had suffered fr om being overweight, and how they did not want their children to go through a similar ordeal. This would indicate the participants had gained knowledge and appeared to be using the knowledge to make healthier choices for themselves and their families. The study findings were consistent with the literature from the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California (LCHC , 2006), that \"particularly important for Latinos are prevention strategies that strengthen families and communities and emphasize broad concepts of social and physical health rather than focusing on BMI\" (p. 6). This parents in the program were able to accomplish increas ed knowledge and changing nutrition, cooking , and physical activity behaviors in parents , which in turn increased their skills and ability to make changes in their home environment. 99 Research indicate d that another consequence of childhood obesity is that it leads to adult obesity. Singh et al. (2008) systematically reviewed 25 studies that tracked childhood obesity leading into obesity during adulthood. All 25 studies reported that childhood obesity increase d the risk of becoming overweight and/or obese adults. The feedback from the participants of the present study was consistent with this research . Specifically, parents were worried that their chil dren would suffer in the future, similar to how they had suffered with their weight problem s in the past, and thus they felt it was important to incorporate strategies from the workshops in order to ensure their children and families engaged in a healthier lifestyle. In regards to changes in cooking, both qualitative a nd quantitative data indicated that parents engaged in less cooking with butter or margarine , less frying of foods , and more grilling, baking, and reading food labels for ingredients. Important in this study was that these families were provided recipes t hat allowed them to cook the foods consistent with their culture, using healthier cooking techniques. The findings were consistent with ADAF (n.d.) and Evans et al . (2011) , which found that intervention curriculum should include culturally appropriate nutr ition education and healthy cooking tips or ideas for parents and families. It should also include culturally sensitive materials, information, and recipes to be effect ive to the target audience. The present study showed that when parents were provided w ith interventions that include d hands -on cooking techniques and resources, they were able to make changes related to cooking. The quantitative data, however, did not suggest a significant decrease in cooking with oils, removing fat before cooking, or an in crease in cooking together as a family . However, qualitative data from debriefings and one -on-one questioning indicate d that 100 participants understoo d healthy cookin g techniques and made attempts to decrease the use of oils while including their families in shopping and cooking . However, the retrospective survey analyses does not show the decrease. Three explanations are possible. First, in one -on-one interviews, the parents may have been giving more social ly desirable responses (e.g., cooking healthier). Second, it is possible the survey did not give an accurate enough measure to show decreases unless a family substantially decrease d intake. Third, it is possible that parents started cooking healthier as a family, removing fat from the meats while using f ewer oils, but not enough for the survey to show this change. Regarding changes in eating habits, both qualitative and quantitative data indicate d that parents engaged in less intake of white bread, rice , tortillas, ice cream, cookies, candy, chips, and fr ied foods, while engaging in more intake of vegetables, oatmeal, cream of wheat, soy products, nuts, reduced -fat cheese, yogurt, low-fat frozen yogurt, low-fat dressings, and healthy smaller meals . Specifically, the program taught the importance of eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as eating fewer fried foods, sugary foods, and refined foods. The quantitative data did not suggest a significant decrease in consumption of sugary cereals, luncheon meats, fast foods, and frozen dinners , or a significant increase in drinking reduced -fat or fat -free milk or eating low-fat frozen desserts . However, at the follow -up debriefing and one -on-one sessions, the parents said they were decreasing the intake of sugary cereals, and they were offerin g more reduced -fat and fat -free milk. It appears the parents knew the healthful behavior, and they made attempts to decrease use of sugars, fats , white breads, and rice, but the retrospective survey analyses does not show the decrease. As with changes in cooking, 101 there are three possible explanations. First, in one -on-one interviews the parents may be giving more socia lly desirable responses (e.g., eating more healthy). Second, it is possible the survey does not give an accurate enough measure to show d ecreases unless a family substantially decreases intake. For example, t he mean overall for eating fast foods and frozen dinners was not high at pretest . The participants in this study were not eating fast foods and luncheon meats as much, and they were n ot using frozen dinners. Third, as with changes in cooking, it is possible that parents started eating healthier, but not enough for the survey to show healthful behaviors. The quantitative data did not suggest a significant increase in eating fruits, who le grains, beans, eggs, preparing and eating breakfast or dinner at home, and eating dinner with the entire family. T he follow -up debriefing and one -on-one sessions, however, showed parents indicat ed that they were increasing their consumption of fruits a nd whole grain products. They also indicated that they were preparing and eating more meals together as a family. Three explanations are possible. First, similar to cooking and eating changes, in one -on-one interviews the parents may be giving more soci ally desirable responses (e.g., eating more healthy). Second, it is possible the survey does not give an accurate enough measure to show increases unless a family substantially increases intake. For example, the participants were already consuming high am ounts of fruits and beans, therefore the change was not significant. Third, similar to eating and cooking, it is possible that parents started eating healthier, but not enough for the survey to show healthful behaviors. In regards to making changes to p hysical activity, findings were similar to several studies (Davison et al. , 2003; Katz et al. , 2011; McGarvey et al. , 2004) that examined 102 changing physical activity behavior, and sho wed that parent -focused interventions have been more effective in making p hysical activity behavior changes in both parents and their families. Both qualitative and quantitative data from the present study indicated that parents and their families engaged in more physical activity at posttest and follow -up. The program in the present study specifically taught participants ways to increase their overall daily activity, provides resources, and encourages participants to get active with their children and their families. It appears that parents know the healthful behavior regard ing physical activity, and have made attempts to increase the physical activity level of their families. This was confirmed through the survey, the debriefing sessions, and one -on-one questioning of each participant. It was apparent that the program was very effective in encouraging an increase in the overall physical activity of the participants. Participants were using the knowledge gained in the classes to make behavioral and environmental changes in their and their families lifestyles. Changes in En vironment Epstein (2009) proposed that successful parent education programs require the involvement and partnership between the family, community, and school. For the present study, it was hypothesized that the partnership developed between participants, LAUSD, Northridge Hospital, and the California State University Northridge Dietetic Intern ship Program through the school -based parent nutrition education program allow ed the parents to be involved and take a leadership role in successfully implementing a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their families. Findings suggested this collaboration and partnership allowed the parents to obtain knowledge and practice in the area of nutrition, 103 cooking , and physical activity, and to be more involved in creating environments which fostered their families health and well -being. Similar to findings from Golan and Weizman (2001), findings from this study indicated that parents were able to make changes in their families environment. They were incorporating health y cooking techniques such as grilling and baking. They were becoming more physically active by walking more as families and encouraging their children to participate in more group sports. They were offering more fruits and vegetables while reducing porti on sizes. Findings from the study, similar to findings from Evans et al. (2011) suggest ed that parent -focused healthy lifestyle workshops offered in partnership with schools are a great way to increase parents knowledge in nutrition, cooking , and physical activity, and a great way to help parents maintain a healthy weight. In addition, the majority of families represented in this study were Latino and low -income. As indicated by Alexander et al. (2007) , there exists a lack of knowledge, understanding, an d resources specific to the this population, and specific to the causes of obesity in this population which leads to medical, psychological, and school performance issues. What is signi ficant in this study is that after providing participants with educati on and skills, they reported increasing their knowledge in nutrition, cooking , and physical activi ty and making changes in their home enviro nments by making healthier choices for thei r families in cooking, eating, and physical activity behavior s. Moreove r, when asked how the program could be improved, participants asked for more information on chronic diseases and longer and more frequent classes, which suggests that participants really appreciated and valued the program and understood its 104 importance and believe it addressed their needs. Findings also indicate d how motivated they were to learn. These parents showed a sincere interest in learning how to create a more healthy home environment for themselves and their families. Participants request ed strategies that would continue to increase their knowledge and assist them in applying what they learned in continuing to make changes in their lifestyle and environment. It is apparent that participants found the program very valuable. They reflected upon th eir own issues with childhood weight problems and how they saw the benefits of the workshops as a way to educate their own children early on about living a healthy lifestyle. The intermediate -term outcomes outlined in the logic model were for parents to act as role models and identify actions to take to make healthier family choices and maintain or lower BMI. As indicated by the findings, participants had maintained their weight three months after intervention. In addition, parents were starting to gain confidence in making the changes in their home environments indicative of a healthy lifestyle. As their confidence grew, data suggest ed these parents were acting as role models for their families. However, these types of environmental changes take time. Several studies (Blom -Hoffman et al. , 2008; Gross et al. , 2010; Rudolph, 2009) explain ed that when parents act as role models in changing their own nutrition and physical activity behavior, there is logistical support for the children . Overall data suggest ed that parents reported changing the way they were managing food at home. Parents were trying to make changes at home in order to set a good example for their children. During the first four weeks, they had learned how to cook hea lthier, how to read labels, how to eat healthier , and how to become more physically ac tive. At the 105 week 12 follow -up, they continued to report implementing these environmental changes. Follow -up was very important. It indicated to the researcher that parti cipants really used their knowledge to cook healthier, and they really implemented and used what they learned from class in physical activity and nutrition and in creating a healthy environment for themselves and their families. Implications for Policy and Practice The findings from this study suggest several implications for practice and policy. There were five major implications for practice that surfaced. First, this was a 4 week program designed to take place during school hours . Therefore, the w orkshops catered to participants who were not working and it was only four sessions . An implication for practice is to consider designing an alternative program for families who are working during the day , which may involve after school, evening, or weekend classes. The present intervention study was only four weeks in length. Findings suggested that parents wanted more and longer sessions. The study found families making healthy lifestyle changes, but the question is how the changes can be sustained. It woul d be important to examine how to set up alonger series, or a continuous program. Findings showed that s hort-term foll ow-ups were critical. A second implication for practice concerns sustainability. To sustain participants growth, systematic and continu ous follow -ups should be considered. Similar to Spruijt -Metz (2011), there is a need for large -scale, high -dose, and long -term interventions, taking into account the complex nature of childhood obesity. A longer follow -up (e.g., one year ) to assess and evaluate effectiveness is suggested. 106 A third implication for practice concerns the workshop model, which focused on educating participants and actively engaging them in practicing the skills they were learning. Wechsler et al. (2004) also found that curri cula was more likely to be effective in impr oving health behaviors when it was focused on skills needed to adopt healthy behaviors and provide d ample opportunities to practice those skills. The participants in this study had three months to practice the c ooking, eating , and physical activity skills taught during this c lass, and the results at follow -up clearly show ed changes that participants had made in cooking, eat ing, and physical activities . Fourth , the current study used both formative and summative evaluations to examine the effectiveness of this program. These evaluations included quantitative data collected from surveys given throughout the intervention as well as qualitative data where particpants were asked to talk about how the program was inf luencing their ability to create a more healthy lifestyle for themselves and their familites. These methods of evaluation both during and upon completion of the program are important to measure program effectiveness, inform future planning, and inform prac tice. As a part of this study, the researcher aimed to obtain participants feedback to improve the program. As found in this study, it is important to tailor programs to the unique needs of the participants. This can only be done by soliciting feedback throughout the program, not just at the conclusion. Fifth , in the current program participants met weekly . The program was activity - based, and participants had opportunities to talk to and listen to each other. They brought in foods and recipes to share. It is important to provide structured opportunities after the conclusion of such workshops for participants to continue to support each other as they 107 work to make changes in their behavior and ultimately in their home environments. Training and providin g the opportunity for parents to teach classes , and perhaps the development of support groups , would be some possible ways to sustain the support and learning of participants. These implications are important and relevant to policy. As suggested by the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California (LCHC , 2006), nutrition education for children and their families is needed, as well as stronger policies to ensure healthy school nutrition and physical activity environments. Findings from this study provided evid ence that a partnership between schools, community organizations, and the university can be successful in developing such programs. These types of collaboration s and partnership s should be encouraged. Engaging the family, community, and schools is key fo r successful programs. Although this study only looked at the parent component, the involvement of parents is only one pie ce towards a more comprehensive and systematic program that involves parents, children, schools, and the community that will result in greater and more sustainable programs . Based on the results of this study, there are four implications for policy. First, there needs to be a concerted effort to foster relationships and create ongoing partnerships that engage the community, families, and schools in creating effective and ongoing childhood obesity intervention programs. Once these partnerships are created, the design of these intervention programs should be a collaborative effort between schools, familites, and community agencies in order to maximize the use of human and fiscal resources. A third implication for policy involves the systematic implementation of these intervention programs. This requires community agencies and 108 schools to work together to ensure that families are made aware o f the program offerings and the benefits of participation. Providing ongoing support of such programs will create sustainability. Finally, as essential component of these programs needs to be systematic formative and summative evaluations that can then be reviewed collaboratively in order to inform future program planning. Recommendations for Future Research This study examined the effectiveness of a parent intervention to make healthier lifestyle changes. There are five suggestions for future research. 1. This study suggested significant changes at three months. Studies should conduct follow -ups at six months and again at one year to analyze whether changes are sustained over longer periods of time . A further suggestion is to conduct one year or longer foll ow-up to determine long -term effects as described in the Conceptual Framework of this study. 2. This study obtained parent -reported data. For future research, it is suggested to gather data from children in addition to parents, to conduct observational studi es of parents and their families in their home environment , and to collect observational studies of students in the school environment to see how changes are being incorporated. 3. Wech sler et al. (2004 ) suggested that curriculum should focus on helping participants overcome barriers by providing them with coping strategies in order to adopt healthy behaviors. This study and program did not address barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle. Future research on identifying barriers and providing solutions to p articipants to overcome these barriers is suggested. 109 4. This study did not include children nor did it measure student achievement. For the future, it would be important to analyze student achievement with long -term research. Previous researchers (Ball et al., 2004; Datar & Sturm, 2006; Schwartz & Puhl , 2003) have indicated that childhood obesity has an impact on achievement. L ong-term studies, following the children of the families who are making healthy changes in their li festyles, will help understand the effects on student achievement. 5. This study only analyzed the parent compon ent. Future research can focus on how school districts are implementing required wellness policies to curb childhood obesity. Concluding State ment The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of \"A Taste of Good Health,\" a school -based parent education program designed to affect healthful behavior in parent participants and their families in a large urban school district. The dr amatic increase in the prevalence and pandemic of childhood obesity, as well as the serious consequences including the health and financial burdens that transpire as a result, have prompted the need for broad interventions in order to address this public h ealth issue. The goal of this study was to increase nutrition, cooking, and physical activity knowledge, modify nutrition and physical activity behaviors, and ultimately counter childhood obesity and diabetes in the San Fernando Valley. The goal of increa sing knowledge and changing behavior was overall met through this study. Ultimately , to counter childhood o besity and diabetes, there need to be longer interventions, more support and resources for families, and long -term programs and 110 studies. This stud y was consistent with other studies confirming that parents play an important role in developing healthy lifestyles and modeling healthy behaviors for their families. Having a partnership with school, family, and community is critical given this serious h ealth problem, if we hope to ultimately curb childhood obesity. We need to continue to provide systematic evaluation of these programs and involve schools, parents, school personnel, and the community. 111 References Alexander, M.A., Sherman, J.B., & Clark, L.
