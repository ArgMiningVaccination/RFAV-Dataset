Standards of medical care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge advances and patterns of care evolve. The contents of this publication are guidelines to clinical practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to these guidelines may not ensure a successful outcome in every case. These guidelines should neither be construed as including all proper methods of care, nor exclude other acceptable methods of care. Each physician is ultimately responsible for the management of his/her unique patient, in the light of the clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options (ASD) are a group of deve lopmental disorders characterised by impaired communication and social interaction, restricted interests and repetitive behav iours, with onset before 3 years of age. Examples of ASD include Autism and Asperger syndrome. Althoug h the degree of severity and impairment in ASD is highly variable, ASD have a profound impact on the affected children and their families. Current estimates of global prevalence of ASD range between 50 to 60 per 10,000 schoo l-\u00adaged children, making ASD a serious public health conce rn.i Locally, the Singapo re Burden of Disease Study 2004 found ASD to be the leading cause of disease burden in children aged between 0-\u00ad14 years, causing a loss of more than 5110 disability-\u00adadjusted life years (DALYs) in 2004 (20.7% of total DALYs lost in this age group).ii There is significant variance in the assessment practices and diagno stic criteria used by healthcare professionals who work with children with ASD. Furthermore, an increasing number of parents and caregivers of children with ASD are turning to complementary and alternative therapies publicised in the media; these therapies might not have a strong scientific basis and might be ineffective or even harmful to the children. It is therefore timely to deve lop this first national guideline that incorporates the best available evidence from the scientific literature to assist all children with ASD and the healthcare professionals who work with them.

[Online]. 2009 Mar 1 [cited The pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD may require specific medical investigations based on history and clinical examination (pg 35). Grade D, Level 4 C Children with ASD should have a complete audiologic assessment to obtain comprehen sive information on their hearing status including middle ear function (pg 35). Grade C, Level 2+ C Where the hearing status of a child canno t be determined by age-\u00ad appropriate behav response or auditory steady-\u00ad state response is recommended to at least provide good estimates of hearing thresholds (pg 36). Grade C, Level 2+ D Children with ASD with the following features should have a gene tic evaluation: a) microcepha ly or macrocepha ly b) a positive family history (of a gene tic syndrome) c) dysmorphic features. (pg 36) Grade D, Level 3 D Children with ASD may be offered high-\u00adresolution chromosomal studies and DNA analysis to look for an associated medical cond ition following diagno sis (pg 37). Grade D, Level 3 C Children with ASD may be offered selective metabolic testing when an inborn error of metabolism is suspected (pg 37). Grade C, Level 2+ C Brain imaging is not routinely recommended in children with ASD (pg 37). Grade C, Level 2+ 5 C Electro-\u00adencepha lography (EEG) is not routinely recommended in children with ASD but should be considered if any of the following are present: a) clinical seizures b) symptoms sugge stive of sub-\u00adclinical seizures such as staring spells c) a history of deve lopmental regression. (pg 38) Grade C, Level 2+ D Serum lead screening is not routinely indicated in children with ASD but may be considered where there is clinical suspicion of pica (pg 38). Grade D, Level 4 C Food allergy tests are not recommended in the routine assessment of children with ASD (pg 38). Grade C, Level 2+ C Hair mineral analysis is not recommended in the evaluation of children with ASD (pg 39). Grade C, Level 2+ C Immunologic investigation is not routinely indicated in children with ASD (pg 39). Grade C, Level 2+ C Assay of vitamin B6 and magne sium levels is not recommended in children with ASD (pg 39). Grade C, Level 2+ C Investigations to identify yeast over-\u00adgrowth in the gastro-\u00adintestinal tract are not recommended in children with ASD (pg 39). Grade C, Level 2+ Management: Intervention D Every pre-\u00adschoo l child diagno sed with ASD should have an individualised intervention plan that sets out the goals, type(s), frequency and intensity of intervention, in order to address particular deve lopmental and educa tional need s (pg 41). Grade D, Level 4 6 D An individualised intervention plan should consist of a variety of quality programmes and activities. This includes attendance in comprehen sive early intervention programmes, programmes targeting specific need s and also positive engage ment with parents and/or caregivers (pg 41). Grade D, Level 4 C All pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should undergo early intervention as soon as significant deve lopmental need is recogn ized by a trained professional becau se outcomes improve with early intervention (pg 41). Grade C, Level 2++ D The intensity of intervention should be continually monitored and varied acco rding to the child's chang ing need (pg 42). Grade D, Level 4 D Interventions for impaired communication should address the deve lopment of pivotal skills such as spontaneity, initiation, motivation and self-\u00adregulation (pg 43). Grade D, Level 4 A Interventions for impaired communication should aim to increase joint attention and symbolic play in order to improve expressive language deve lopment (pg 43). Grade A, Level 1+ D There is no single language or communication intervention method that is appropriate for all children with ASD. The optimal communication intervention for an individual child with ASD depend s on the need s of that particular child (pg 44). Grade D, Level 4 A Alternative-\u00adaugmentative communication systems may be recommended for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD becau se they expand (spoken or written) communication, may stimulate speech acqu isition in non-\u00adverbal children and enhance expression in verbal children (pg 44). Grade A , Level 1+ 7 A Visual strategies are useful interventions for children with ASD because they offer visual support to communication, increase spontaneous imitation and socially communicative behaviour (pg 45). Grade A, Level 1+ D Parent/caregivers should be educated that the use of alternative-\u00ad augmentative communication systems or visual strategies neither inhibits speech nor replaces the development of expressive spoken language skills (pg 45). Grade D, Level 4 D Social skills are best taught explicitly through modeling and feedback (pg 45). Grade D, Level 3 D Social skills programmes depend on the functioning level of the preschool child with ASD and may include -\u00ad Assessment and teaching of social skills interaction in natural settings -\u00ad Provision of structure, visual cues and predictability -\u00ad Making abstract concepts more \"concrete\". -\u00ad Activities that enable purposeful and appropriate interaction with typically developing peers. -\u00ad Goals focusing on fostering self-\u00adappreciation and self esteem. (pg 47) Grade D, Level 4 B Interventions for children with ASD with challenging behaviours based on functional behavioural assessment are recommended (pg 47). Grade B, Level 1+ B Children with ASD who present with perceptual distortions, fine and gross motor co-\u00adordination difficulties, impaired play skills and impaired self-\u00adcare and adaptability may benefit from consultation with appropriate specialists such as occupational therapists and/or physiotherapists (pg 48). Grade B, Level 2+ GPP In the assessment and management of feeding difficulties in children with ASD, the healthcare professional needs to consider challenges in executive functioning, fears, sensory processing, social and language skills (pg 49). GPP 8 D Management of gastro-\u00adintestinal disorders and feeding difficulties in children with ASD may require collaboration between healthcare professionals such as primary care doctors, paediatricians, gastro-\u00ad enterologists, dietitians and therapists (pg 49). Grade D, Level 4 D Environment, tasks and timing of activities of children with ASD should be adapted to minimize negative sensory reactions and meet their sensory needs (pg 50). Grade D, Level 4 D \"Sensory integration\" intervention is not recommended as standard therapy in management of children with ASD but may be considered where the child has sensory difficulties that affect daily functioning (pg 50). Grade D, Level 3 A Early Intensive Behavior Intervention (EIBI) can be recommended as an intervention option for children with ASD (pg 51). Grade A, Level 1++ C Structured Teaching can be recommended as an intervention option for children with ASD (pg 51). Grade C, Level 2+ D The Hanen \"More Than Words\u00ae\" programme may be considered as an intervention option for children with ASD (pg 52). Grade D, Level 3 D Developmental models such as Developmental, Individual-\u00addifference, Relationship-\u00adbased (DIR)/Floortime and Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) models may be considered as intervention options for children with ASD (pg 52). Grade D, Level 3 Management: Family and caregi ver support D Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to discuss the need for practical emotional support. This enables information to be provided, referrals made and support services made available (pg 53). Grade D, Level 3 9 A Parents and caregivers of pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD are recommended to attend parent educa tion programmes (pg 54). Grade A, Level 1+ GPP Parents and caregivers are recommended to consult appropriate professionals when considering educa tional placement for their child with ASD, e.g. child and educa tional psycho logists who are informed of the special educa tional provisions in Singapo re (pg 55). GPP D Parents and caregivers are recommended to actively collaborate with professionals and teache rs in preparing the child with ASD for the new educa tional setting, as well as modifying the new setting to accommodate the need s of the child (pg 55). Grade D, Level 4 GPP Parents and caregivers should be encou raged to give consent for information abou t special educa tional need s to be shared with schoo l personne l for better planning of intervention and support (pg 55). GPP Management: Pharmacological treatment D Pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD are best managed by a multi-\u00admodal approach (pg 56). Grade D, Level 4 D Pharmacological treatment does not cure ASD. It may be considered when specific indications are present, such as aggressive and self-\u00adinjurious behav iour, anxiety, depression, tics, obsessive-\u00adcompulsive behav iours, hype ractivity and sleep disturbance s (pg 56). Grade D, Level 4 D Pharmacological treatment should be given by doctors with appropriate training in mental health (pg 56). Grade D, Level 4 B Clomipramine may be considered for reduc ing irritability and stereotypical behav iour in children with ASD. Monitoring for tolerance and side-\u00adeffects to clomipramine is recommende d (pg 58). Grade B, Level 1+ 10 D Fluvoxa mine may be considered for repetitive though t and maladap tive behav iour but should be used with caution in children with ASD becau se of limited efficacy and poor tolerance (pg 59). Grade D, Level 3 B Fluoxetine may be considered for the reduc tion of repetitive behav iours in children and adolescents with ASD. Monitoring for the side effects of fluoxe tine is recommended (pg 59). Grade B, Level 1+ B Haloperidol may be considered in the manage ment of temper tantrums, aggression, hype ractivity, withdrawal and stereotypical behav iour in children with ASD, but careful monitoring of side effects is required (pg 60). Grade B, Level 1+ A Atypical (secon d-\u00adgene ration) anti-\u00adpsycho tic medications are associated with potentially adve rse metabolic effects, such as weight gain, insulin resistance , dyslipidaemia and hype rglycemia. Taking a thorough medical history and monitoring of body weight and blood sugar levels is recommended when atypical anti-\u00adpsycho tic medications are administered (pg 60). Grade A, Level 1++ A Risperidone is recommended for the manage ment of irritability, hype ractivity and stereotypic behav iour when used as short term treatment for children with ASD (pg 61). Grade A, Level 1++ D Olanzap ine may be considered in the manage ment of motor restlessness, self-\u00adinjurious behav iour, aggression and irritability in children with ASD (pg 61). Grade D, Level 3 A Olanzap ine administered to children with ASD may result in significant weight gain and healthcare professionals should monitor the child's weight closely (pg 61). Grade A, Level 1+ 11 A Methylphen idate may be considered for treating hype ractivity in children with ASD, although the magnitude of response is often less than that seen in typically deve loping children with attention deficit hype ractivity disorder (pg 62). Grade A, Level 1++ GPP Pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD receiving methylphen idate should be monitored for adve rse effects (pg 63). GPP D Atomoxetine may be considered for manag ing attention deficit hype ractivity disorder-\u00adlike symptoms in children with ASD (pg 64). Grade D, Level 3 B Melatonin may be considered in the manage ment of the disturbed sleep patterns of children with ASD (pg 64). Grade B, Level 1+ Management: Complementary alternative therapies GPP Parents and caregivers should not replace mainstream interventions for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD with complementary and alternative therapies (pg 65). GPP GPP Healthcare professionals caring for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should advise and coun sel parents and caregivers abou t relevan t, safe and effective health services and therapies regardless of whether the therapies are mainstream or complementary alternative therapies (pg 66).

The present worldwide prevalence range s from 50-\u00ad60 per 10,000 schoo l-\u00adaged children compared to 2-\u00ad4 per 10,000 children in the 1980 s. Whilst prevalence rates are unavailable in Singapo re, there are at least 400 new cases diagno sed annua lly at the Department of Child Development, KK Hospital (KKH ) and Child Development Unit, National University Hospital (NUH). Professionals involved are well aware of the importance of accurate diagno sis and early intervention. Increased public awareness coup led with higher expec tations for services in the area of early identification and intervention has provided impetus for the formulation of this clinical practice guideline (CPG). 1.2 Objectives and scope of guideline Accurate diagno sis of ASD can be difficult. Multi-\u00addisciplinary and multi-\u00adagency involvement contributes to complexity of diagno sis and manage ment. The purpose of this CPG is to \"localise\" guidelines for usage within the Singapo re context. This is becau se existing guidelines produced by other coun tries are not always applicable locally. These guidelines are formulated to assist practitioners who are involved in any of the following: surveillance, screening and early identification, referral for assessment, diagno sis and intervention of children with ASD. The uncertainty in screening and diagno stic processes, controversy over pharmacological treatment, early intervention and efficacy of complementary alternative therapy are addressed in this CPG. This CPG was prepared for use as a guideline (not protocol) and intervention for any particular child with ASD must classification The term \"autism spectrum disorders\" (ASD) reflects the broad spectrum of clinical characteristics that enco mpass complex deve lopmental disorders that are behav iourally defined, with onset prior to age 3 years. Characteristic symptoms have been described as impairments in social communication, social interaction and imagination along with restricted interests and repetitive behav iours. Although these features are characteristic of all peop le with ASD, there is a range of severity and intellectual function. ASD tends to be more common in boys than girls. There is no evidence of any association of ASD with social class or ethnicity. There are two approache s to the concep tualisation of ASD: the \"categorical\" and \"dimensional\" approaches. 2.1 Categorical approach The categorical approach is used in the DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR1 and ICD-\u00ad102 classifications (refer Annex A on page 85). In this approach the different disorders associated with autism (such a s Asperger syndrome and atypical autism) are seen as distinct disorders, although the observed behav ioural symptoms may overlap. The assumption is that they represent qualitatively different cond itions. Research has suppo rted the reliability and validity of the 3 diagno stic criteria that are central to the definitions used in DSM-\u00adIV and ICD-\u00ad10; namely, social abno rmalities; impairments in communication; and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behav iour.3-\u00ad5 It is to be noted that using either DSM-\u00adIV or ICD-\u00ad10 increases the reliability of the diagno stic process, and the effect is even greater when inexpe rienced practitioners are making the diagno sis. No studies have so far compared which of the 2 systems (DSM-\u00adIV or ICD-\u00ad10 systems) is the superior classification system. Notwithstanding the increased reliability of diagno sis, some practitioners have raised conce rns regarding the DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR and ICD-\u00ad10 classification. For example, the categorical approach to autism assumes that a clear qualitative distinction can be made between autism and other pervasive deve lopmental disorders. In practical terms, strict adhe rence to diagno stic criteria may result in some children (such as those who may meet the criteria for Pervasive 20 Developmental Disorders - Not Otherwise Specified, PDD-\u00adNOS) being excluded from receiving appropriate intervention services. 2.2 Dimensional approach Arising from the dissatisfaction with the categorical approach, a dimensional approach to the diagnostic classification of autism has been proposed6, 7whereby the 'triad of impairments' is used as a defining parameter, including: 1. difficulties with social communication 2. difficulties with social interaction 3. difficulties with social imagination Using the dimensional approach, children with a wide variety of clinical conditions would thus be seen as having 'autism spectrum disorders' or ASD. The dimensional concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders, or ASD, includes all the pervasive developmental disorders as defined in DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR and ICD-\u00ad10. The spectrum is in fact wider, as it includes even subtle manifestations of the triad. However, no reports have thus far validated the breadth and scope of features that are subsumed as a part of a single autistic continuum, implicitly implied by the concept of the triad of impairments. There are strengths and limitations when using either the categorical or dimensional approach for a diagnostic classification of ASD. However, given the balance of evidence, it is recommended that: C All professionals involved in diagnosing ASD in children should consider using either the ICD-\u00ad10 or DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR systems of classification. Grade C, Level 2+ For the purposes of this CPG, the umbrella term ASD will be used in its broadest sense to include the sub-\u00adgroups found in the category of 'Pervasive Developmental Disorders' (PDD), as defined in the ICD-\u00ad 10 (research criteria) and DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR. It includes Autism (299.00), Asperger syndrome (299.80) and children with similar features who are categorized as PDD-\u00adNOS (299.80) in the DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR, as well as Childhood Autism (F84.0) and Atypical Autism (F84.1) in the ICD-\u00ad10. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder and Rett's Disorder (under the PDD umbrella in DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR) will be excluded in this CPG. 21 3 Surveillance Developmental surveillance is the on-\u00adgoing process of identifying the child at risk of deve lopmental delay, deviance or abno rmality. Surveillance for features of ASD should be part of a gene ral deve lopmental surveillance programme involving parents or caregivers, early childhood educa tors as well as healthcare professionals (nurses, primary care doctors and paed iatricians).8 D Professionals should aim to identify ASD early. Early identification provides oppo rtunity for early referral and intervention, so that the child with ASD may have improved functioning in later life. Grade D, Level 3 Early identification may be achieved by: a. deve lopmental surveillance of all children so that deviations from normal may be detected early b. valuing and addressing parental and/or caregiver conce rns abou t deve services GPP Parents' or caregivers' attention should be drawn to the parental check list(s) in the Health Booklet (provided to parents at the child's birth) that describes normal deve lopment in children. Parents should be encou raged to inform their healthcare professional if they suspect delay or abno rmality in their lopment and behav iour are highly sensitive and specific. In fact, parents or caregivers may notice conce rns in the child's deve lopment as early as 18 months of age. In contrast, the absence of parental conce rn does not mean that the child's deve lopmental are normal.9 C Parental or caregiver conce rns abou t communication, interaction and play skills as well as behav iour should be elicited in a gene ral deve lopmental surveillance programme. Healthcare professionals should be aware that parental or caregiver conce rns regarding delayed or deviant deve lopment are as important as clinically abnormal or atypical features. Grade C, Level 2+ 22 There are a number of barriers to early diagnosis. These include the failure to recognise warning signs, denial of problems, failure to be referred, long waiting times for initial appointment(s), inadequately trained staff in diagnosis and separate waiting lists for each professional group. In particular, early identification depends upon a primary healthcare professional being alerted to the \"key signs\" of ASD (refer to Annex B on page 90) during developmental surveillance and initiating a referral for further diagnostic assessment in a timely manner. Local surveys suggested that the level of awareness and knowledge in childhood developmental and behavioural disorders among general practitioners and early childhood educators could generally be improved to facilitate timely referral for early assessment and intervention.10, 11Education and training programmes in developmental pediatrics should be developed to equip healthcare professionals and early childhood educators to identify children suspected with ASD and refer for assessment. D All professionals who deal with pre-\u00adschool children, whether in health care services or early childhood education centres, should receive training on the \"key signs\" that suggest a diagnosis of ASD. Grade D, Level 4 In Singapore, primary healthcare professionals perform developmental surveillance and immunization for children at 4-\u00ad6 weeks, 3-\u00ad4 months, 6-\u00ad10 months, 15-\u00ad18 months, 2-\u00ad3 years and 4-\u00ad6 years. Whilst a high level of vigilance for features of ASD should be part of the surveillance on any of these occasions, a more pro-\u00adactive stance during two key developmental stages, namely, at 18 months and 24-\u00ad36 months would assist in early identification of children at risk of ASD. Even when developmental surveillance at 18 months appears to be normal, vigilant tracking of development 6 to 18 months later i.e. at 24 to 36 months is still recommended. This is because typical ASD behaviours may not always be evident in children under 24 months of age.12-\u00ad14 Furthermore, absence of prototypical behaviours of ASD does not and should not rule out possibility of diagnosis. D Active surveillance by healthcare professionals is recommended at 18 months and again at 24-\u00ad36 months for key signs of ASD. Grade D, Level 3 23 Surveillance is important at an early age becau se studies showed that a valid clinical diagno sis of ASD could often be made by the time the child is 2 to 3 years old by expe rienced healthcare professionals.15, 16 Other studies demonstrated that problems with eye contact, orienting to one's name, joint attention, pretend play, imitation, non-\u00adverbal communication, and language deve lopment were measurable by 18 months of age.16 These symptoms were stable in children from toddler age through pre-\u00adschoo l age. Furthermore, it had been shown that retrospective analysis of home videotapes identified behav iours that distinguished infants with autism from other deve lopmental disabilities as early as 8 months of age.17-\u00ad19 Diagno sis will gene rally be more difficult in young children who have high cogn itive functioning, as well as in those with severe general deve lopmental delay (for example, children with a mental age below one year old). Notwithstanding the difficulty, children of any age with specific clinical features sugge stive of ASD should be referred for comprehen sive evaluation.13, 20, 21 D Children with one or more of the following clinical features must be referred promptly for comprehen sive deve lopmental evaluation: a. No babb le, pointing or other gesture by 12 months, b. No single words by 18 months, c. No spontaneou s (non-\u00adechoed ) 2-\u00adword phrases by 24 months, d. Any loss of language or social skills at any age. Grade D, Level 4 24 4 Screening Screening consists of using a standa rdised tool to detect ASD at a specific age in a gene ral popu lation of children. An ideal screening test is one with relatively few false nega tives (i.e. test result is nega tive despite presence of disease), resulting in high sensitivity, such that positive cases will not be missed at screening. There are two levels of screening, namely, primary screening and seconda ry screening. Primary screening is conduc ted on a gene ral popu lation who has not been identified as being at-\u00adrisk before testing, while seconda ry screening is conduc ted on a select group within the popu lation who has been identified as being at-\u00adrisk.22-\u00ad24 No single ASD-\u00adspecific screening instrument has been identified as ideal for primary screening of a gene ral popu lation of children. Current evidence sugge sts that the CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHA T) at 18 months and Modified CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-\u00adCHA T) at 18-24 months are useful for primary screening of ASD.25-\u00ad27 However, validation of CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHA T) and Modified CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-\u00adCHA T) will be nece ssary before they can be considered for use as a primary screening tool for the local popu lation. C In the gene ral popu lation, screening for ASD is not recommende d. Grade C, Level 2++ Seconda ry screening for ASD is highly recommended in high-\u00adrisk popu lations. These include those with developmental, emotional and behav ioural problems, specific syndromes or with family members diagno sed with ASD.28-\u00ad30 Seconda ry screening is recommended using standa rdised ASD-\u00adspecific tools that have good validity and reliability in the local popu lation. The use of Modified CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-\u00adCHA T) or CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHA T) may refine the risk of ASD but must not be used to rule out ASD.25-\u00ad27 25 Other tests that may be considered include Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test-\u00adII (PDDST-\u00adII), Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), formerly known as Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ) and Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST).31-\u00ad34 Although these tests have not been validated in the local population, they remain useful for surveillance and secondary screening. C In a high-\u00adrisk population, screening for ASD is highly recommended. Grade C, Level 2+ 26 5 Assessment Diagno sis of ASD is a complex process. Where possible, multi-\u00ad disciplinary or trans-\u00addisciplinary assessment should be conduc ted to identify different aspects of ASD and help make accu rate diagno ses.35-\u00ad38 Ideally, the team should consist of a variety of professionals who are expe rienced with deve lopmental disorders and specifically with the variety of presentation of ASD. The team could include practitioners such as a deve lopmental pediatrician, child psychiatrist, deve lopmental speech and language pathologists, tional therapist and a specialist educa tor. A multi-\u00addisciplinary assessment is typically done sequen tially, i.e. with each professional conduc ting an evaluation focusing on their respective areas of expe rtise. The results are then integrated and a diagno sis formulated. In contrast a trans-\u00addisciplinary assessment is usually conduc ted jointly, for example: an \"arena assessment\" in which any professional may evaluate a specific deve lopmental area such as play skills, with the other professionals observing and inferring functioning. However personne l with this level of expe rtise in Singapo re are few and organizing such sessions is resource intensive. Therefore when such a large team is not available, assessment to diagno se ASD may be conduc ted by smaller teams (such as two-\u00admember teams) or an individual practitioner with recogn ized training and who is very expe rienced with ASD. A child suspected to have ASD following an initial screening should be referred for specialist assessment. A specialist assessment should include ASD-\u00adspecific history-\u00adtaking, clinical observation and obtaining wider contextual and functional information of the child's social and communication behav iour. In addition, the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD should unde rgo clinical and neurological examination by a medical practitioner to determine possible etiologies, exclude treatable cond itions and identify co-\u00admorbid medical cond itions. The purpose of the specialist assessment is to a) review functioning in relevan t domains; b) confirm the diagno sis based on presenting symptoms; c) provide an individualised profile to facilitate intervention 27 D Diagno stic evaluation of a child suspected to have ASD should be carried out by a multi-\u00addisciplinary team or professional who is trained and expe rienced with diagno sis of ASD. Evaluation includes: a) an ASD-\u00adspecific deve lopmental history, b) direct observations, c) obtaining wider contextual and functional information. In addition, the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD should unde rgo thorough clinical and neurological examination to exclude associated medical cond itions. Grade D, Level 4 5.1 ASD-\u00adspecific developmental history An ASD-\u00adspecific deve lopmental history is important to unde rstand reported behav iours in context. A framework designed to systematically elicit information abou t the child's current problems and deve lopmental history is useful. Taking the history of the child's social and communicative behav iour does not substitute for direct observation and should be done in conjunction with direct observation of the behav iour. An ASD-\u00adspecific deve lopmental history should be taken using an appropriate framework. Some examples of an appropriate framework include the Autism Diagno stic Interview - Revised and the Diagno stic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders. The Autism Diagno stic Interview - Revised (ADI-\u00adR), based on the categorical system, is a reliable diagno stic instrument.39, 40 However, it should be used with caution in children with a deve lopmental age that is below two years old.41 The Diagno stic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO), based on the dimensional system, has adequa te inter-\u00adrater reliability for ICD-\u00ad10 categories.42, 43 Whilst administration of either ADI-\u00adR or DISCO is time-\u00adconsuming, they should be utilised when nece ssary to aid in the diagno stic process. Practitioners utilising these instruments should be trained in their use and be aware of both local deve lopmental and cultural practices. C ASD-\u00adspecific instruments should be considered when taking a deve lopmental history as it increases the reliability of an ASD diagno sis. Grade C, Level 2+ 28 5.2 Direct observation Clinical observation and assessment of the child's social and communication behav iours needs to be obtained through direct interaction with the child. Professionals need to have substantial training and expe rience to carry out such observation and evaluation of relevan t behav iours. It may sometimes be impossible to obtain sufficient information within one session. In such situations, focused observations should be taken across more than one setting and information abou t the child's functioning in other relevan t settings (especially in unstructured activities and social play with peers) should be routinely obtained.44 Where direct observation is not feasible, interviews with relevan t persons should be conduc ted. D Professionals should conduc t direct observations of the child's social and communication skills as well as behav iours. Grade D, Level 4 GPP Information abou t a child's functioning in relevan t community and educa tional settings should be routinely obtained either through direct observations or interviews with relevan t persons. GPP ASD-\u00adspecific observational instruments are available to aid in the process of observation. The Autism Diagno stic Observation Schedu le -\u00ad Generic (ADO S-\u00adG) is a reliable diagno stic instrument that can be used to enhance clinical history-\u00adtaking.45 It uses a series of structured social contexts designed to elicit, observe and evaluate relevan t social and communicative functioning. Current evidence shows that the ADO S-\u00adG has exce llent diagno stic validity for differentiating autism from non-\u00adASD cond itions, when controlled for expressive language .45 The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CAR S) is another standa rdised instrument used to observe spontaneou s behav iours associated with autism. However, there is limited research on its use in children who are unde r 3 years old.46 C ASD-\u00adspecific observational instruments should be used to increase the reliability of diagno sis. Grade C, Level 2+ 29 6 Prognosis A common concern of parents is the long-\u00adterm prognosis for the child diagnosed with ASD. Prognosis in a child with ASD depends on a variety of outcomes such as communication skills, cognitive skills, self-\u00adcare skills and independent living skills. Amongst studies that examined the course and prognosis of children diagnosed with ASD before the age of 3 years, early regression of language skills was not associated with poor prognosis because most children regained the lost skills.47,48Other studies suggested that a lack of early joint attention and imitation49,50, as well as failure to develop functional speech by 5 years of age were predictive of poor outcome.51, 52 Cohort studies showed that high intelligence quotients (IQ) and language skills in children with ASD were independently associated with better outcomes.53-\u00ad56 The studies noted that social impairment and repetitive behaviours could still be present when these children grew up. It is difficult to reliably predict later prognosis in children who are diagnosed with ASD before they are three years old. GPP In children diagnosed with ASD before three years old, parents should be advised that it is difficult to reliably predict prognosis, because individual outcomes are extremely variable and depend on many factors. GPP . 30 7 Aetiology The aetiology of ASD is multi-\u00adfactorial. Genetic influence s as well as prenatal, perinatal and postnatal environmental factors had been proposed as possible causes for ASD. However, the role that each of these factors plays in the aetiology of ASD is less well unde rstood and continues to be the subject of research. 7.1 Genetic influences There is a strong role for gene tics in the aetiology of ASD, based on epidemiological evidence .57-\u00ad59 Twin studies and family studies indicate that the heritability estimates of ASD are >90%.60, 61 Many gene tic defects are associated with ASD. Some defects occu r singly (e.g fragile X syndrome) while others are minor mutations that interact with other gene s additively or synergistically to produce the ASD pheno type. Results of popu lation studies are consistent with a multi-\u00adfactorial inheritance, although the exact gene tic model for ASD is currently controversial. Environmental factors have been implicated in the causation of ASD as a sole agen t or possibly via a \"second-\u00adhit\" pheno menon during foetal brain deve lopment to modulate manifestation of ASD in individual children.57, 60, 62-\u00ad64 ASD is classified into Seconda ry refers to cases associated with a medical cond ition or gene tic abno rmality. Generally reported success rates for identifying a major single etiology in individuals with ASD is 6-\u00ad15%,65-\u00ad69 but may be as high as 40%.69-\u00ad71 It is crucial to distinguish seconda ry from idiopathic ASD, becau se many are inheritable and recurrence risks are different. Conditions associated with ASD include (but are not limited) to: % Fragile X syndrome % Other chromosomal abno rmalities Tuberous J M H < G D O D @ N \u0001D I > G P ? D intellectually disabled individuals with tuberous sclerosis (TS) have associated ASD and epilepsy.84-\u00ad87 The number of ASD individuals with TS was estimated to be 0.4-\u00ad3%, increasing to 8-\u00ad 14% if epilepsy was also present.84, 86, 88, 89 In children with ASD presenting with atypical features such as hypotonia, failure to thrive and recurrent episodes of regression or flare-\u00adups, mitochondrial disorders may be considered in the diagnosis. Soto syndrome may be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with autism who have macrocephaly and overgrowth. 7.1.2 Idiopathic ASD Idiopathic ASD is diagnosed when no underlying cause is identified after thorough physical examination and appropriate testing. The recurrence risk to siblings of individuals with idiopathic autism is 4% for autism (range 2-\u00ad8%) and an additional 4-\u00ad6% risk for milder symptoms, including language, social, and psychiatric disorders.57, 62, 90, 91 In families with two or more affected children, recurrence risks ranged from 25 to 35%.92 C Parents of children with ASD may require genetic counselling regarding the risk of recurrence of ASD in the next pregnancy. Grade C, Level 2+ 7.2 Role of prenatal, perinat al and postnatal risk factors Studies showed that children diagnosed with ASD had increased umbilical cord blood levels of specific neuro-\u00adtrophins and neuro-\u00ad peptides.93 Matched case-\u00adcontrol studies suggested that children with ASD were more likely to have been first-\u00adborn children94 with increased risk of antenatal complications94 and neonatal encep halopathy95 as compared to their non-\u00adASD siblings. In a large meta-\u00adanalysis of 40 studies examining over 50 prenatal factors, factors associated with autism were advanced parental age at birth, maternal prenatal medication use, bleeding, gestational diabetes, being first-\u00ad born vs. third or later, and having a mother born abroad. Factors in which there was strong evidence against the risk of autism included previous fetal loss and maternal hypertension, proteinuria, pre-\u00ad eclampsia and swelling.96 In another case-\u00adcontrol matched study, the 33 prenatal factors that occurred significantly more often among children with ASD than those without were advanced maternal age and parity. There was a small but statistically significant increased duration of educa tion among mothers of children with ASD than those without. Significant perinatal factors associated with ASD were breech presentation and primary caesarean delivery. When corrected for breech presentation which is a known indication for caesarean delivery, the association between primary caesarean delivery and ASD was eliminated. No significant associations were found between ASD and neona tal factors.97 7.3 Lack of role of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine Multiple epidemiologic98-\u00ad104 as well as popu lation-\u00adbased studies conduc ted in Finland, Denmark, United States, Japan, Sweden and Great Britain had confirmed that no association existed between MMR vaccines and the development of autism or gastrointestinal symptoms in children with ASD.105-\u00ad108 The link between the MMR vaccine and gastro-\u00adintestinal lymphoid hype rplasia was first sugge sted in 1998 in 12 children who had autistic regression and chronic diarrhoea. This association was criticised on ground s that the symptoms were based on parental memory of onset of behav ioural problems after the MMR vaccine and likely related to recall bias.109 This was followed by the isolation of measles RNA fragments from intestinal material.110 Subsequen tly, many of the original authors questioned the proposed relationship between gastro-\u00adintestinal lymphoid hype rplasia and autism, since the reported ileal inflammation was non-\u00adspecific.111,112The British Medical Research Counc il,113 World Health Organization114 and American Medical Association115 announced that there was no evidence to link MMR vaccines with inflammatory bowel disease or autism. It is a well-\u00adknown fact that children who are not immunized and subsequen tly become infected with the measles virus may develop encepha litis leading to autistic regression. The risk of autistic regression following measles encepha litis is abou t 1 in 1,000 to 10,000 cases. Vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella 34 infections therefore remains vital in preven tion of these highly contagious childhood infections. B Parents should be educa ted to proceed with their child's vaccination schedu le, including the MMR vaccine. Grade B, Level 2+ 7.4 Lack of role of thimerosal -\u00ad containing vaccines Many studies found no consistent association between thimerosal-\u00ad containing vaccines and autism.116-\u00ad120 Thimerosal preservative in vaccines has been proposed as a reason for an increased prevalence of autism, becau se thimerosal contains 50% ethylmercury and mercury is known to be neuro-\u00adtoxic. This was based on 3 epidemiologic studies that showed an association between thimerosal expo sure and neuro-\u00ad deve lopmental delay, including autism.121-\u00ad123 These studies were later criticised becau se they contained serious methodo logical flaws and used non-\u00adtransparent analytical methods.124 Several retrospective and well-\u00addesigned prospective coho rt studies confirmed that the incidence of autism increased throughou t the study period and continues to increase,116, 117 even though thimerosal had been removed as a preservative in vaccines since 2001 .125 The 2004 Immunization Safety Review Committee of the Institute of Medicine124 as well as a well-\u00ad conduc ted systematic review126 separately conc luded that there is insufficient evidence for a causal relationship between expo sure to thimerosal and neuro-\u00addeve lopmental disorders. B Parents should be reassured that ASD is not associated with thimerosal-\u00adcontaining vaccines. Grade B, Level 2+ 7.5 Lack of role of inflammation and infection No neuro-\u00adimaging studies demonstrated inflammatory chan ges to the brain, meninges or vasculature of the brain to suppo rt an obvious inflammatory process within the central nervous system as a cause of autism.127 Similarly, there is no conc lusive evidence of a specific infectious agen t that could trigger the deve lopment of autism.128, 129 35 8 Investigations The aims of investigating children with ASD are to: a) diagno se associated syndromes, such as Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, fetal alcoho l syndrome and Prader-\u00ad Willi/Angelman syndrome; (Refer to Chapter 7). b) diagno se an unde rlying disorder that requires treatment such as an inborn error of metabolism; c) confirm the presence of a co-\u00admorbidity that requires early treatment such as seizures. In most children with ASD, the cause is idiopathic. Only a minority of children with ASD (abou t 6-\u00ad15%) has an associated medical cond ition. The proportion with an associated medical cond ition varies, depend ing on how extensively the child is investigated and the severity of learning disability.130-\u00ad134 The majority of children with ASD do not require extensive investigation. Excessive investigation subjects the child to procedu res that may cause unnece ssary pain and/or discomfort, and results in increased costs to the parent/caregiver. D The pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD may require specific medical investigations based on history and clinical examination. Grade D, Level 4 8.1 Hearing evaluation Diagno sis of ASD in a child does not exclude diagno sis of hearing loss. Studies showed that conduc tive, sensori-\u00adneural or mixed hearing loss can co-\u00adoccu r with ASD and that some children with ASD may be incorrectly though t to have peripheral hearing loss.135-\u00ad138 Hearing loss in children may deve lop later on in childhood , even if the hearing screen was docu mented to have been normal at birth. C Children with ASD should have a complete audiologic assessment to obtain comprehen sive information on their hearing status including middle ear function. Grade C, Level 2+ 36 Hearing thresholds may be established using age-\u00adappropriate behav ioural tests such as visual reinforcement audiometry, play audiometry or pure tone audiometry. If reliable hearing thresholds canno t be obtained, electro-\u00adphysiological response (ASSR) are the gold standards and at least provide an accurate estimate of hearing and auditory nerve function. Since electro-\u00adphysiological tests are time-\u00adconsuming, the child with ASD may require sedation or even general anesthesiae for the test to be completed. Click-\u00adevoked ABR measurements are attempted first as they are a quick method to obtain hearing thresholds at 2-4 KHz, especially for sensori-\u00adneural hearing loss. If the child is suspected with hearing loss (ABR threshold > 20dB nHL), frequenc y-\u00adspecific ABR will confirm the diagno sis.139-\u00ad142 C Where the hearing status of a child canno t be determined by age-\u00ad appropriate behav tests such as OAE, ABR or ASSR is recommended to at least provide good estimates of hearing thresholds. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.2 Genetic evaluation Given the strong role of genetics in the aetiology of ASD, children with features sugge stive of chromosomal abno rmality should be investigated. (Refer to Chapter 7). D Children with ASD with the following features should have a genetic evaluation: a) microcepha ly or macrocepha ly b) a positive family history (of a genetic syndrome) c) dysmorphic features Grade D, Level 3 Studies reported that about 5% of children with ASD have Fragile X syndrome,69-\u00ad71 while 30-\u00ad50% of individuals with Fragile X syndrome have characteristics of ASD.77-\u00ad80 Diagno sis of Fragile X syndrome is important for genetic coun selling purposes, since it has implications for family members.13, 143-\u00ad146 37 In Singapore, it is estimated that genetic evaluation of children diagnosed with ASD may detect 5% with Fragile X syndrome (through DNA analysis) and 5% with chromosomal abnormalities (through high-\u00adresolution chromosomal analysis).69,70Tests for the MECP2 and PTEN gene mutations are not available in Singapore at the time of writing this guideline. D Children with ASD may be offered high-\u00adresolution chromosomal studies and DNA analysis to look for an associated medical condition following diagnosis. Grade D, Level 3 8.3 Metabolic testing Less than 1% of children with ASD have an inborn error of metabolism.132 Clinical findings suggestive of an inborn metabolic error include lethargy, cyclic vomiting, encephalopathy, seizures, dysmorphic features and intellectual impairment. Diagnosis of an inborn metabolic error may be important for treatment and genetic counselling purposes, since most have Mendelian inheritance.147-\u00ad149 C Children with ASD may be offered selective metabolic testing when an inborn error of metabolism is suspected. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.4 Brain imaging Although brain abnormalities have been reported in ASD, these were inconsistent and no pattern of localization was found. Brain imaging may be considered in children with ASD who have clinical neurological abnormalities.150-\u00ad153 C Brain imaging is not routinely recommended in children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.5 Electro-\u00adencephalography (EEG) The prevalence of epilepsy in children with ASD has been estimated at 7-\u00ad14%. Seizure onset has 2 peaks: at less than 5 years old and again in adolescence. Mental retardation, with or without motor 38 abno rmalities and family history of epilepsy, was a significant risk factor for the deve lopment of seizures in individuals with ASD.154-\u00ad158 C Electro-\u00adencepha lography (EEG) is not routinely recommende d in children with ASD but should be considered if any of the following are present: a) clinical seizures b) symptoms sugge stive of sub-\u00adclinical seizures such as staring spells c) a history of deve lopmental regression. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.6 Lead screening Serum lead levels in children with ASD are typically not in the toxic range . However, children with deve lopmental delays may spend an extended period of time in the oral-motor deve lopmental stage. It has been sugge sted that deve lopmentally delayed children be screened for lead, a treatable neuro-\u00adtoxin particularly if pica is suspected.159 D Serum lead screening is not routinely indicated in children with ASD but may be considered where there is clinical suspicion of pica. Grade D, Level 4 8.7 Food allergy screening Several studies confirmed that most children with ASD do not have associated atopy, asthma, food allergy and primary immunode ficiency . The innate immunity of children with ASD is not different from that of normally deve loping children.160, 161 C Food allergy tests are not recommended in the routine assessment of children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.8 Hair mineral analysis In a case controlled study, no difference in concen tration of calcium, magne sium, zinc, coppe r, lead and cadmium in scalp hair samples was found between children with and without ASD. No evidence of 39 toxicity or deficiency of minerals was found and hair mineral analysis had no impact on manage ment.162-\u00ad166 C Hair mineral analysis is not recommended in the evaluation of children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.9 Immunologic evaluation A study showed that children with ASD have normal immune function.167 Immunologic evaluation of children with ASD may be indicated in the presence of recurrent infections. C Immunologic investigation is not routinely indicated in children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.10 Assay of vitamin B6 and magnesium A Cochrane systematic review on the efficacy of vitamin B6 and magne sium (B6-\u00adMg) for treating social, communication, and behav ioural responses of children and adults with ASD conc luded that no recommenda tion could be made regarding the use of B6-\u00adMg as treatment for autism due to the small number of studies.168 C Assay of vitamin B6 and magne sium levels is not recommended in children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 8.11 Assay for yeast overgrowth in stools Yeast is a normal commensal in the bowel and stool of normal children. Candidial overgrowth has not been docu mented by endo scopy in the bowel of children with ASD.109 C Investigations to identify yeast over-\u00adgrowth in the gastro-\u00adintestinal tract are not recommended in children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 40 9 Management: Intervention The objectives of intervention are to promote child health and well-\u00ad being, enha nce emerging competencies, minimize deve lopmental delay, remediate disabilities, preven t functional deterioration, promote adaptive parenting and overall family functioning. These goals are acco mplished by providing individualized deve lopmental, educa tional and behav ioral intervention services for children in conjunction with mutually planned suppo rt for their families.169 Interventions may be regarded as either mainstream or alternative (Refer to Chapter 12). The range of activities that constitute intervention should be viewed holistically, and includes the child's involvement in structured centre-\u00ad based activities, as well as parent-\u00admediated intervention and structured positive engage ment with parents/caregivers at home. A wide range of interventions is increasingly available in Singapo re. Some professionals offer a combination of interventions that utilize various elements of different methods when providing intervention for a particular child. The efficacy and safety of any intervention must be validated through well-\u00addesigned research. At the time of publication of this guideline, available literature on interventional studies was often found to be neither of high quality nor rigorously planne d. Intervention is best planned and carried out by professionals together with the child's parents and caregivers. Skills can be deve loped and practiced in a range of settings, for example, centre-\u00adbased programmes, home-\u00adbased programmes or parent-\u00admediated intervention. Parent-\u00admediated intervention is a source of quality intervention for the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD, and should be considered as part of the child's total intervention plan, along with attendance at structured centre-\u00adbased intervention programmes. Intervention may be provided by different professionals who are each able to teach the same behav iour or skill set. For example, psycho logists, teache rs and speech and language therapists in partnership with parents and caregivers often provide interventions for social communication skills becau se deve loping recep tive and expressive skills are funda mental to the ability to perform in a class. Similarly, teache rs, psycho logists and occupa tional therapists in partnership with parents and caregivers may address challenging behav iours in the child with ASD. It is crucial to formulate an 41 individualized plan with input from a variety of specialists, in response to the shifting deve lopmental need s of the child with ASD. D Every pre-\u00adschoo l child diagno sed with ASD should have an individualised intervention plan that sets out the goals, type(s), frequency and intensity of intervention, in order to address particular deve lopmental and educa tional need s. Grade D, Level 4 D An individualised intervention plan should consist of a variety of quality programmes and activities. This includes attendance in comprehen sive early intervention programmes, programmes targeting specific need s and also positive engage ment with parents and/or caregivers. Grade D, Level 4 Timing and intensity of intervention Most children with ASD show marked progress during the period they receive early intervention (two to six years) and nearly all children with ASD show some bene fit.51, 170-\u00ad172 However, there are no studies to suppo rt claims of recove ry from ASD as a consequence of early intervention. There is no evidence to sugge st that any single type of intervention is effective for all children with ASD.51, 170 C All pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should unde rgo early intervention as soon as significant deve lopmental need is recogn ized by a trained professional becau se outcomes improve with early intervention. Grade C, Level 2++ The intensity of early intervention required in order to effect positive change is highly variable.51, 170 While some studies reported a need for an intervention duration of 40 hours a week173, others sugge sted that an hour a week of parent training could result in positive outcomes.174 The National Acade my of Science s sugge sted that intervention should be on-\u00adgoing and \"include a minimum of 25 hours a week, 12 months a year, in which the child is engaged in systemically planned , and deve lopmentally appropriate educa tional activity toward identified objectives. What constitutes these hours, however, will vary, acco rding to a child's chronological age, deve lopmental level, specific strengths and weakne sses, and family need s.\"51 42 D The intensity of intervention should be continually monitored and varied acco rding to the child's chang ing need s. Grade D, Level 4 Intervention programmes for the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD may be divided into: % Comprehen sive Early Intervention Programmes % Interventions addressing specific need s % Intervention models or approache s 9.1 Comprehensive early intervention programmes It is difficult to define a comprehen sive early intervention programme for the child with ASD. No outcome studies have so far been published in a peer-\u00adreviewed journal to suppo rt the superiority of one programme over another.51, 170 , 171 Selection of a comprehen sive early intervention programme is based on the following: a) engage ment of the child in a systematically planned , and deve lopmentally appropriate intervention activity with clear objectives b) provision of sufficient individualised attention on a daily basis; c) intervention that is targeted for the specific need s of the child and delivered in a variety of settings, including functional spontaneou s communication, social instruction, cogn itive skills; d) utilisation of s for the manage ment of challenging behav iour; e) inclusion of occasional activities that would enab le planned interactions to occu r with typically deve loping children. In Singapo re, services that contain elements of comprehen sive early intervention programmes are typically provided by, but not restricted to, the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC)iii administered by the National Council of Social Service iii Information on EIPIC can be acce ssed at www .cel.sg 43 (NCSS) unde r the purview of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS). 9.2 Interventions addressing specific needs These include: 9.2.1 Interventions for communication impairments 9.2.2 Interventions for impairments 9.2.3 Interventions for challenging behav iours 9.2.4 Interventions for associated difficulties 9.2.1 Interventions for communication impairments The process of deve loping communication skills is a complex one requiring the acqu isition of funda mental skills, such as joint attention, auditory processing, unde rstanding of symbols (e.g. interpretation of gestures, use of everyday objects) and social cues (e.g. facial expression, intonation, volume of voice). Such skills are crucial for the typically deve loping child to develop comprehen sion and expressive skills. These skills, in turn, are vital when language is utilized for building and maintaining relationships, solving problems and learning new concep ts. Impairment in communication is a core issue in all children with ASD. Comprehen sive assessment of communication ability by a speech and language therapist is essential prior to formulation of intervention plans. D Interventions for impaired communication should address the deve lopment of pivotal skills such as spontaneity, initiation, motivation and self-\u00adregulation.175 Grade D, Level 4 A Interventions for impaired communication should aim to increase joint attention and symbolic play in order to improve expressive language deve lopment.176 Grade A, Level 1+ 44 D There is no single language or communication intervention method that is appropriate for all children with ASD. The optimal communication intervention for an individual child with ASD depend s on the need s of that particular child.177 Grade D, Level 4 Interventions for impaired communication may utilize verbalization, alternative-\u00adaugmentative communication (AAC ) systems and/or visual strategies. AAC systems allow communication skills to be maximized in children who have not yet deve loped speech or have poor verbal communication. AAC systems match the visual processing strengths and cogn itive profile of children with ASD. Some methods of providing AAC involve supplementation or replacement of speech and/or writing with photographs, line drawings (as in Picture Exchange Communication System, PECS), tangible objects and symbols (such as manua l signs, gestures and finger spelling). AAC systems may be categorized as low-\u00adtech (not requiring batteries, electricity or electronics) or high-\u00adtech (requiring electronic devices to store/retrieve messages, which can be connec ted to voice output).178 The choice between low or high-\u00adtech AAC systems depend s on unde rstanding the communicative need s, cogn itive ability and learning style of the child. Studies over the past 30 yea rs demonstrated that AAC intervention resulted in a modest increase in speech produc tion.179 Nevertheless, functional speech may not always be stimulated in non-\u00adverbal children, since 5 of 6 participants using AAC remained at zero speech produc tion in the systematic review.179 A Alternative-\u00adaugmentative communication (AAC ) systems may be recommended for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD becau se they expand (spoken or written) communication, may stimulate speech acqu isition in non-\u00adverbal children and enhance expression in verbal children. Grade A, Level 1+ Visual strategies (including the use of photographs, line drawings, written words used singly or as part of schedu les) are often used becau se these strategies capitalize on the comparatively stronge r visual and spatial skills of the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD. They provide structure and increase predictability, giving the child more time to process verbal instructions. Children diagno sed with Asperger 45 syndrome who have weak visual-\u00adperceptual skills may prefer written schedu les. A Visual strategies are useful interventions for children with ASD becau se they offer visual suppo rt to communication, increase spontaneou s imitation and socially communicative behav iour.180, 181 Grade A, Level 1+ D Parent/caregivers should be educa ted that the use of AAC systems or visual strategies neither inhibits speech nor replaces the deve lopment of expressive spoke n language skills.182 Grade D, Level 4 9.2.2 Interventions for social skill impairments Social interaction difficulties are a core impairment of ASD, appea r early, continue to manifest as the child grows and may be evident across different settings.183 They are often the result of a lack of social awareness and limitation in social skills. Social skills may be directly and explicitly taugh t to the child with ASD through modeling and feedback or reinforcement.184-\u00ad187 Modeling is practiced when an adult or peer demonstrates the skill in real life or through video.188 Feedback or reinforcement requires that the child with ASD is taugh t a specific behav iour (such as regulating voice volume) and given positive feedback (or other forms of reinforcement) when the behav iour is elicited in the appropriate situation. D Social skills are best taugh t explicitly through modeling and feedback . Grade D, Level 3 The goal of a social skills or social deve lopment programme is to help individuals with ASD to function as independe ntly and socially effectively as possible.183 Depend ing on the functioning level of the child, social skills programmes could include more able children with ASD, activities or programmes may need to teach the child how to attend to the interest and needs of others, instead of self.51 Over time, the child with ASD learns to seek out information about interests of other children and develops group camaraderie.191 D Social skills programmes depend on the functioning level of the preschool child with ASD and may include -\u00ad Assessment and teaching of social skills interaction in natural settings -\u00ad Provision of structure, visual cues and predictability -\u00ad Making abstract concepts more \"concrete\". -\u00ad Activities that enable purposeful and appropriate interaction with typically developing peers. -\u00ad Goals focusing on fostering self-\u00adappreciation and self esteem Grade D, Level 4 9.2.3 Interventions for challenging behaviours Challenging behaviours usually have an underlying function or motive, including: a means of communicating needs more effectively; seeking social attention or preferred activities; avoiding difficult tasks and aversive situations; or the generation of sensory reinforcement in the form of auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory stimulation.192,193Examples of challenging behaviours include tantrums (crying), shouting, aggression, stereotypic behaviour and self-\u00adinjury.194 Functional analysis of the challenging behaviour should be conducted to develop alternative appropriate behaviours. These alternative behaviours serve the same function as the challenging behaviour.194 Where a challenging behaviour is related to a lack of skills, intervention targeted at developing those deficit skills should be provided. B Interventions for children with ASD with challenging behaviours based on functional behavioural assessment are recommended. Grade B, Level 1+ While behavioural intervention using applied behaviour analysis methods was shown to be effective in reducing or eliminating specific challenging behaviours and teaching new skills to children and adults with autism or other developmental disorders,172,195 no single 48 intervention has been shown to deal effectively with problem behav iours for all children with ASD. Positive behav ioural interventions and suppo rt strategies may not be very effective for up to one-\u00adthird of challenging behav iours which are related to sensory stimulation/issues. In these cases, different or additional strategies may be required. 9.2.4 Interventions for associated difficulties Some children with ASD may expe rience associated difficulties such as: % Perceptual and motor difficulties % Nutrition and feeding difficulties % Unusual sensory responses 9.2.4.1 Interventions for perceptual and motor difficulties As children grow they master various deve lopmental tasks in the gross and fine motor, perceptual and adap tive domains. Children occupy their time playing and learning as well as eating, getting dressed and grooming. In the process of learning these new skills they also learn to attend and self regulate. Children with ASD are often impaired in these tasks. B Children with ASD who present with perceptual distortions, fine and gross motor co-\u00adordination difficulties, impaired play skills and impaired self-\u00adcare and adap tability may bene fit from consultation with appropriate specialists such as occupa tional therapists and/or physiotherapists. Grade B, Level 2++ 9.2.4.2 Interventions for nutrition and feeding difficulties Children with ASD may present with feeding difficulties, often eating a narrow range of foods that may be nutritionally inapp ropriate. Such difficulties may be attributed to rigidity, sensory difficulties, and deficits in social, communciation and execu tive delay.196, 197 Rigidity in perception, planning and sequenc ing difficulties may lead to insistence on the same food at each meal, specific preparation methods, insistence on using a specific utensil and/or following extensive rituals 49 at mealtimes.198-\u00ad200 Fear responses in children with ASD are difficult to decipher as they may be irrational or unrelated to chok ing or vomiting. Assessment of feeding difficulties in children with ASD are best carried out through in-\u00addepth caregiver interview and observation across meals (e.g. snack s, lunch ) and settings (e.g. home, schoo l).197 GPP In the assessment and manage ment of feeding difficulties in children with ASD, the healthcare professional need s to consider challenge s in execu tive functioning, fears, sensory processing, social and language skills. GPP Presentation of gastrointestinal disorders in children with ASD may manifest as behav ioural change s, making the diagno stic evaluation complex. Behav ioural manage ment may need to be initiated concu rrently while medical investigations for gastrointestinal disorders are ongo ing.201 D Manage ment of gastro-\u00adintestinal disorders and feeding difficulties in children with ASD may require collaboration between healthcare professionals such as primary care doctors, paediatricians, gastro-\u00ad enterologists, dietitians and therapists. Grade D, Level 4 9.2.4.3 Interventions for unu sual sensory responses 45% to 95% of individuals with ASD present with significant and unique sensory behav iours such as extreme aversion to or exce ssive seeking of sensory stimuli.202 This results in increased stereotypic, rigid and repetitive behav iours203 and impacts on the ability to participate in daily life activities.204 Children with ASD having unusual sensory responses may benefit from assessment and intervention based on occupa tional therapy, sensory integration and/or sensory-\u00adbased interventions.205 Occupa tional therapists may modify the social and physical environment to manage sensory characteristics. Such suppo rt may reduc e problem behav iours in children with ASD.205 50 D Environment, tasks and timing of activities of children with ASD should be adap ted to minimize nega tive sensory reactions and meet their sensory need s. Grade D, Level 4 Sensory integration intervention206 uses child-\u00addirected and therapist-\u00ad guided activities to challenge the child to actively participate in sensory activities and produce adap tive interaction and response.206 While sensory integration intervention may enhance the ability to modulate behav iour and improve social interaction responses, the evidence for its efficacy is inconc lusive.204, 205 Sensory-\u00adbased intervention or sensory-\u00adstimulation intervention involves providing directly to the child, some form of sensory input (usually one type of sensation at a time) in expec tation of a better modulated behav ioural response. The child is usually a passive recipient of the sensory-\u00adstimulation e.g. touch , music, brushing (Refer to chap ter 12). D \"Sensory integration\" intervention is not recommended as standa rd therapy in manage ment of children with ASD but may be considered where the child has sensory difficulties that affect daily functioning. Grade D, Level 3 9.3 Specific intervention models Several intervention models were deve loped based on specific psycho-\u00addeve lopmental approache s. While some approache s are more estasblished than others, there are no studies to suppo rt the superiority of one intervention model over another.51, 170 It is important to note that the features of and approache s used in many of the specific intervention package s discussed in this CPG can also be found in a variety of intervention progammes. The need s of the child, family preference s and availability of resources should be discussed when any specific intervention model or combination of approache s are considered. 9.3.1 Early Intensive Behaviour Interve ntion (EIBI) Early Intensive Behav iour Intervention (EIBI) behaviour 51 programme lasted intervention.207Recent systematic reviews showed that EIBI was efficacious but had variable outcomes, sugge sting that EIBI was not effective for all children with ASD.208, 209 No studies replicated the magnitude of efficacy reported by Lovaas (i.e., .173Parents should be informed that EIBI, in its original form, is an expen sive intervention that may place significant financial strain on families. A Early Intensive Behavior Intervention (EIBI) can be recommended as an intervention option for children with ASD. Grade A, Level 1++ 9.3.2 Structured Teaching Structured Teaching is the approach developed by the Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-\u00adhand icapped CHildren (TEACCH ) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the educa tion of individuals with ASD.183 Structured Teaching proposes that children with ASD learn better when provided with visual information to supplement auditory input and external organizational suppo rt. Evidence for Structured Teaching came from studies on child progress,210, 211 parent teaching skills,212 as well as the feedback of parents, trainees, and replication sites.213 Recent studies in Hong Kong and Italy reported gains across a wide variety of adaptive domains.214, 215 C Structured Teaching can be recommended as an intervention option for children with ASD. Grade C, Level 2+ 9.3.3 Hanen \"More Than Words\u00ae\" programme The Words\u00ae\" programme was developed by the Hanen Centre in Canada for families of children with ASD and related social communication difficulties. It aims to teach parents to build communication and social interaction skills with their child through enhanc ing the parents' ability to observe, create structured routines with oppo rtunities to initiate and respond and use naturally occurring 52 situations such as household tasks for joint attention. Research on the efficacy of the Hanen programme was limited. In one study, parents learnt interaction strategies that were likely to facilitate their child's deve lopment of communication.216 D The Hanen \"More Than Words\u00ae\" programme may be considered as an intervention option for children with ASD. Grade D, level 3 9.3.4 Developmental models Developmental-\u00ad or relationship-\u00adbased interventions focus on the child's ability to form positive, meaningful relationships with other peop le. Two deve lopmental models available in Relationship-\u00adbased (DIR) or ch ief activities of the DIR/Floortime model occu r during play ('floortime') sessions where interactive expe rience s are child-\u00ad directed and occu r in a low stimulus environment. The interactions aim to deve lop social relationships and socio-\u00ad emotional growth.217 b. Relationship Development Interve ntion (RDI) RDI focuses on increasing the motivation and interest in social relationships in children with autism. In RDI, the child is engaged in various activities with the aim of increasing social competence and enjoyment in social relationships.218 Studies examining the effectivene ss of deve lopmental interventions in children with ASD remained inconc lusive.171 D Developmental models such as Developmental, Individual-\u00ad difference , Relationship-\u00adbased (DIR)/Floortime and Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) models may be considered as intervention options for children with ASD. Grade D, Level 3 53 10 Family and caregiver support Parents of children with ASD were reported to expe rience greater level of psycho-\u00adsocial and econo mic stressors relative to those with other disabilities.219-\u00ad222 Hence , manage ment of the pre-\u00adschoo l with ASD should include a family-\u00adcentred perspective, focusing on the need s of the family, not only the child with ASD. Sources of information and support for careg ivers and the family Parents and caregivers of children with ASD require on-\u00adgoing information to help them unde rstand the diagno sis and make informed choices for intervention. In addition to gene ral information abou t the nature of ASD, parents need information that is specific to the manifestations of ASD in their child, as well as up-\u00adto-\u00addate information abou t the intervention, educa tional and suppo rt options available.223, 224 Other than suppo rt from the immediate or extended families (e.g. grandpa rents, domestic help) parents and caregivers may seek suppo rt from external sources within the community. For example, \"Parent suppo rt groups\" are voluntary organizations whose goals are to provide social suppo rt and information and to foster advocacy in a positive manne r. Parent suppo rt groups may help parents deal with the issues they are facing following a diagno sis, enab le them to feel less isolated and have better access to information.175, 225, 226 When parents receive suppo rt from their families and the community, caregiving stress may be relieved. In Singapo re, more formalised psycho-\u00ademotional and financ ial suppo rt for families is often provided through social workers based in clinics, hospitals, Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) or Family Service Centres (FSC). Whilst these services do not cater exclusively to children with ASD, the professionals (social workers, or coun sellors) would be able to direct them to appropriate services within the community (See Append ix C). D Parents and caregivers should be encou raged to discuss the need for practical emotional suppo rt. This enab les information to be provided, referrals made and suppo rt services made available. Grade D, Level 3 54 Parent education Parent educa tion is the process of systematically providing parents and other primary caregivers with specific knowledge and child-\u00ad rearing skills to promote their children's deve lopment and competence.227 For parents of young children newly diagno sed with ASD, parent educa tion and skills training programme results in significant improvements in parental mental health and adjustment.228 Parent educa tion has been found to work in: i) improving the social and communication skills of the children; and ii) produc ing a positive effect on children's social and communication behav iour, parental performance and parent-\u00adchild interactions.229, 230 A Parents and caregivers of pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD are recommende d to attend parent educa tion programmes. Grade A, Level 1+ Transition planning and educational placement When children with ASD reach schoo l-\u00adgoing age, appropriate schoo l placement is often a priority. Educa tional placement should be determined in consultation with appropriate professionals such as therapists who provide intervention for the child. In Singapo re, there is a variety of educa tional options for children with ASD. These range from full inclusion in mainstream, to special educa tion (SPED) schoo ls offering mainstream or specialised curriculum. As the diversity of provisions evolves with time, parents and caregivers should be provided with comprehen sive current information abou t the different types of educa tional placements available so that they can make informed decisions. Information abou t local schoo ls can be found at the following websites: a) Mainstream schoo ls : http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/index and caregivers are recommende d to consult appropriate professionals when considering educa tional placement for their child with ASD, e.g. child and educa tional psycho logists who are informed of the special educa tional provisions in Singapo re. GPP Transition planning from preschoo l settings to primary or SPED schoo ls can result in quicker and more succe ssful adjustments, leading to less disruption to teach ing and learning. Effective transition planning requires collaboration amongst parents, caregivers and professionals. This involves teach ing relevan t skills to the child to function as independen tly as possible in the new setting, as well as assisting the professionals, teache rs and staff in the new educa tional setting to unde rstand the child's need s. Involving peers in the transition suppo rt process often leads to positive peer relationships in schoo l.231-\u00ad233 D Parents and caregivers are recommended to actively collaborate with professionals and teache rs in preparing the child with ASD for the new educa tional setting, as well as modifying the new setting to acco mmodate the need s of the child. Grade D, Level 4 Studen ts with ASD attending mainstream schoo ls may require special educa tional acco mmodation and suppo rt such as provision of explicit directions, specific curriculum or testing acco mmodations. Decisions on provisions and acco mmodations should be made in consultation with schoo l personne l. Parents and teache rs should seek input from relevan t professionals (psycho logists or therapists who provided intervention) to ascertain the individual child's specific educa tional need s. GPP Parents and caregivers should be encou raged to give consent for information abou t special educa tional need s to be shared with schoo l personne l for better planning of intervention and suppo rt. GPP 56 11 Management: Pharmacological treatment In pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD, manage ment of mental health and behav iour issues should be multi-\u00admodal and addressed in a multi-\u00ad disciplinary setting. Manage ment of the environment, behav ioural and psycho logical strategies should be considered together with pharmacotherapy as complementary aspects of a complete manage ment plan for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD. Treatment follows a contextual and functional analysis of behav iour, where attention must be given to the child's language ability and deve lopmental level. The child's deve lopmental level may be affected by medical disorders and life even ts.234 ASD canno t be cured with medication but pharmacological agen ts may be efficacious in treating dysfunctional behav ioural symptoms that interfere with rehab ilitative efforts and cause impairment or distress to the child with ASD.235 Examples of mental health and dysfunctional behav ioural symptoms include aggressive and tics, ractivity and sleep disturbance s. Pharmacological manage ment of mental health disorders and dysfunctional behav iours in ASD should only be unde rtaken by doctors with appropriate training in mental health. Doctors who prescribe more than one medication should be vigilant abou t the possibility of drug interactions and monitor for possible side effects. D Pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD are best managed by a multi-\u00admodal approach . Grade D, Level 4 D Pharmacological treatment does not cure ASD. It may be considered when specific indications are present, such as aggressive and self-\u00adinjurious behav iour, anxiety, depression, tics, obsessive-\u00ad compulsive behav iours, hype ractivity and sleep disturbance s. Grade D, Level 4 D Pharmacological treatment should be given by doctors with appropriate training in mental health.

While the tricyclic antidepressants were the drugs of choice for manage ment of depression in the 1980 s, their nonselective action on cholinergic, histaminergic, and presynap tic adrenergic receptors have resulted in adve rse effects. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that may reduce irritability and stereotypical behav iour in children with autism. In a doub le-\u00adblind comparison study, clomipramine was shown to be superior to placebo and desipramine in improving autistic symptoms, ange r, compulsive and ritualized behav iour in children aged 6 to 18 years old.236 Children and adults who were given clomipramine and haloperidol demonstrated comparable improvements in irritability and stereotypy.237, 238 However, clomipramine was poorly tolerated and associated with serious, untoward effects.237, 239 B Clomipramine may be considered for reduc ing irritability and stereotypical behav iour in children with ASD. Monitoring for tolerance and side-\u00adeffects to clomipramine is recommended . Grade B, Level Selective serotonin re-\u00aduptake inhibitors (SSRI) Selective Serotonin increase level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by inhibiting reuptake into the presynap tic cell, increasing the level of serotonin available to bind to the postsynap tic receptor. They are typically used in the manage ment of depression, anxiety and obsessive-\u00adcompulsive disorders. Selective serotonin re-\u00aduptake escitalopram and sertraline. Fluvoxa mine was repetitive though t patterns, maladap tive behav iour and repetitive languag e in a rando mized controlled trial of adults with autistic disorders. When fluvoxa mine was administered to children and adolescents with pervasive deve lopmental disorders, the medication had limited efficacy and the children tolerated it poorly.240-\u00ad244 59 D Fluvoxa mine may be considered for repetitive though t and maladap tive behav iour but should be used with caution in children with ASD becau se of limited efficacy and poor tolerance . Grade D, Level 3 Fluoxe tine has been examined in a placeb o-\u00adcontrolled crossover trial in children and adolescents with ASD and found to result in significant reduc tion in repetitive behav iour as compared to placebo , with no difference in side effects.245 In an open-\u00adlabel study of fluoxe tine in ASD children aged 2 to 8 years, improvements were evident in the behav ioural, language , cogn itive, affective and social domains. However, side effects were reported, including hype ractivity, agitation, lethargy, rash and diarrhea.246 Two further studies conduc ted in older children and adults reported overall improvement in behav iour.247, 248 B Fluoxe tine may be considered for the reduc tion of repetitive behav iours in children and adolescents with ASD. Monitoring for the side effects of fluoxe tine is recommended . Grade B, Level 1+ There is insufficient evidence for a recommenda tion regarding the use of citalopram,249 escitalopram250 and sertraline251-\u00ad253 for children with ASD. 11.3 Typical anti-\u00adpsychotics: Haloperidol Typical anti-\u00adpsycho tics (sometimes referred to as first gene ration anti-\u00ad psycho tics, conven tional anti-\u00adpsycho tics, or major tranqu a class of anti-\u00adpsycho tic drugs first deve loped in the 1950 s and used to treat psycho sis. Typical anti-\u00adpsycho tics may also be used for the treatment of acute mania, agitation, aggression, and other conditions. The therapeu tic actions of typical anti-\u00adpsycho tics lie in their antagon ism of dopamine recep tors, particularly the D2 recep tors. They may produce extra-\u00adpyramidal symptoms, such as Parkinsonism, dystonia, concen tration. Haloperidol is one of the most studied typical anti-\u00adpsycho tics in the manage ment of autistic spectrum disorders. Two doub le-\u00adblind placeb o-\u00adcontrolled cross-\u00adover trials conc luded that the of 60 haloperidol in children with ASD significantly reduc ed maladap iour. However, abov e therapeu tic doses, associated with significant side effects, including exce ssive sedation, acute dystonic reactions and increased irritability. The side effects of haloperidol can be minimized at therapeu tic doses through careful monitoring.254-\u00ad258 B Haloperidol may be considered in the manage ment of temper tantrums, aggression, hype ractivity, withdrawal and stereotypical behav iour in children with ASD, but careful monitoring of side effects is required. Grade B, Level 1+ 11.4 Atypical anti-\u00adpsychotics Atypical anti-\u00adpsycho secon d-\u00adgene ration anti-\u00ad psycho tics. They may be used for treatment of psycho tic cond itions, mania, agitation, aggression and other cond itions. Their therapeu tic action is characterized by lower D2 antagon ism with a broade r spectrum of pharmacologic properties, including 5-\u00adHT2A antagon ism. Thus, the atypical anti-\u00adpsycho tics have a reduced propen sity to produce extra-\u00adpyramidal symptoms, less prolactin elevation and a wider spectrum of therapeu tic efficacy . However, secon d-\u00adgene ration anti-\u00adpsycho tic medications have recen tly been associated with potential adve rse metabolic effects, such as weight gain, insulin resistance , dyslipidaemia and hype rglycemia.259, 260 A Atypical (secon d-\u00adgene ration) anti-\u00adpsycho tic medications are associated with potentially adve rse metabolic effects, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hype rglycemia. Taking a thorough medical history and monitoring of body weight and blood sugar levels is recommended when atypical anti-\u00adpsycho tic medications are administered. Grade A, Level 1++ Two iours when used as short-\u00adterm manage ment in children with ASD who were over 5 years old.261, 262 The Research Units on Pediatric Psycho-\u00adpharmacology (RUPP) Autism Network showed that 61 there was high efficacy and good tolerability when risperidone was used for intermediate-\u00adlength treatment of autistic children who displayed tantrums, aggression and self-\u00adinjurious behav iour.263 In terms of the core symptom domains of autism, the RUPP Autism Network demonstrated that the use of risperidone in children with autism resulted in significant improvement in restricted, repetitive and stereotypic behav iours, but did not significantly change the deficits in social interaction and communication skills.264 A Risperidone is recommended for the manage ment of irritability, hype ractivity and stereotypic behav iour when used as short term treatment for children with ASD. Grade A, Level 1++ 11.4.2 Olanzapine In a small case series, olanzap ine was reported to significantly improve overall symptoms of autism including motor restlessness, social relatedne ss, affectional reactions, sensory responses, language usage, self-\u00adinjurious behav iour, aggression, irritability, anxiety and depressive symptoms when given to children, adolescents and adults with ASD.265 In an open pilot study of individuals with ASD from 7.8 to 21 years, 5 of 6 subjects in the olanzap ine group and 3 of 6 in the haloperidol group were rated as responde rs.266 An open-\u00adlabel study of olanzap ine in 25 children with PDD found that 3 had improved CGI scores, including improvements in hype ractivity, excessive speech and irritability.267 A small double-\u00adblind placebo-\u00adcontrolled study of olanzap ine in children and adolescents concluded that it improved global functioning of PDDs.268 Weight gain was shown to be the most prominent adve rse effect of olanzap ine in 2 studies reported. 265, 268 D Olanzap ine may be considered in the manage ment of motor restlessness, self-\u00adinjurious behav iour, aggression and irritability in children with ASD. Grade D, Level 3 A Olanzap ine administered to children with ASD may result in significant weight gain and healthcare professionals should monitor the child's weight closely. Grade A, Level 1+ 62 11.4.3 Quetiapine, Ziprasidone, Aripiprazole and Clozapine There is insufficient evidence a recommenda tion regarding the use of quetiapine,269-\u00ad272 ziprasidone,273, 274 aripiprazole275-\u00ad277 and clozap ine278-\u00ad281 for children with ASD. 11.5 Stimulant medication: Methylphenidate Stimulant medication has been found to be an effective treatment strategy in children and youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In Singapo re, methylphen idate is the most commonly used stimulant medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is a potent central nervous system stimulant derived from amphetamine and is though t to exert its effect by enhanc ing dopa minergic transmission in the brain. A rando mized controlled crossover trial of methylphen idate in to 14 years old conc luded that methylphen idate was often efficacious in treating hype ractivity associated with PDD, althoug h the magnitude of response was often less than that seen in typically deve loping children with attention deficit hype ractivity disorder.282 In the trial, adverse effects were more frequen tly seen in children with PDD than in those without.282 In a small trial, 8 of 13 children (aged 5.6-\u00ad 11.2 years) with autism and symptoms of attention deficit hype ractivity disorder had a 50% decrease in Conne r's Hyperactivity Index .283 Another small randomized trial of children aged 7-\u00ad11 years with autistic disorder treated with methylphen idate found that there was significant improvement in irritability and hype ractivity.284 Adverse effects such as irritability and social withdrawal were common in those treated with methylphen idate.283 A Methylphen idate may be considered for treating hype ractivity in children with ASD, although the magnitude of response is often less than that seen in typically deve loping children with attention deficit hype ractivity disorder. Grade A, Level 1++ 63 GPP Pre-\u00adschool children with ASD receiving methylphenidate should be monitored for adverse effects. GPP 11.6 Other medications 11.6.1 Alpha-\u00ad2 adrenergic agonist Alpha-\u00ad2 adrenergic agents have been used in the management of hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The alpha-\u00ad2 adrenergic agonists used in children with ASD are clonidine and guanfacine. There is insufficient evidence for a recommendation regarding use of clonidine285, 286 in pre-\u00adschool children with ASD. Studies suggest that Guanfacine287, 288 is promising in management of hyperactivity in children with ASD but is associated with side effects such as irritabioity, sedation, sleep disturbance and constipation 11.6.2 Anti-\u00adconvulsant Medication Some anti-\u00adconvulsant medications such as divalproex, lithium and oxcarbazepine have been used in the management of mood disorders, impulsivity and aggression in general. There is insufficient evidence for a recommendation regarding use of divalproex sodium,289-\u00ad291 lithium,292,293and oxcarbazepine294 in children with ASD. 11.6.3 Atomoxetine Atomoxetine is a non-\u00adstimulant drug approved for the treatment of attention-\u00addeficit hyperactivity disorder. It is a selective nor-\u00ad epinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Several retrospective and open-\u00adlabel trials reported that atomoxetine improved symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents with ASD.295, 296 A small double-\u00adblind placebo-\u00adcontrolled cross-\u00adover trial of 16 children aged 5 to 15 years concluded that atomoxetine improved hyperactivity but not inattention.297 Althoug h one author found that atomoxetine was associated with gastro-\u00adintestinal side effects, fatigue and appetite change,298 others reported that the adverse events were tolerable.297 64 D Atomoxetine may be considered for manag ing attention deficit hype ractivity disorder-\u00adlike symptoms in children with ASD. Grade D, Level 11.6.4 Glutamatergic mpetitive N-\u00admethyl-\u00adD-\u00adaspartate used for treatment of influenza , herpes zoster and Parkinson disease. Memantine is a glutamatergic antagonist used in treating Alzheimer's disease. There is insufficient evidence for a recommenda tion regarding use of amantadine299 in children with ASD. Studies sugge st memantine300-\u00ad302 shows promise in manage ing symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention in children with ASD. 11.6.5 Melatonin Melatonin is a naturally occu rring hormone that is important in the regulation of the circadian rhythms of biological functions, including sleep. Two rando mized controlled303, 304 and three open-\u00adlabel trials305-\u00ad307 reported on the usefulness of melatonin for children and adolescents with ASD who expe rience sleep disorders and poor sleep maintenance . B Melatonin may be considered in the manage ment of the disturbed sleep patterns of children with ASD. Grade B, Level naltrexone in young (2.9 to 8.3 years) children with autism conc luded that naltrexone reduced irritability and hype ractivity in the children.308-\u00ad310 However, in studies investigating naltrexone on communication skills and learning in children with autism,311-\u00ad314 there was no effect on social behav iour, communication, stereotypic beha viour308, 311 and discrimination learning.310 65 12 Management: Complementary alternative therapies Introduction Complementary and alternative therapies refer to a wide range of interventions that augment mainstream interventions. Use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAT) is prevalent, more so among children with ASD than the gene ral paed iatric popu lation, and likely to increase.315-\u00ad318 This may be due to the pervasive nature of ASD, easy acce ss to health information, claims of cure by practitioners of alternative therapies as well as the long time-\u00adframe for improvement to be seen when mainstream intervention is practised. Intervention should be based on evidence from well-\u00addesigned research and be part of standa rd practice. While sufficient intensity (duration) of intervention is desirable (refer to chap ter 9), it is equa lly important to ensure quality of intervention by achieving a balance of various interventions that address the core deficits of ASD. Parents and caregivers should be encou raged not to replace traditional, mainstream interventions with CAT. Decisions to use CAT must take into consideration several factors, including: a. How the CAT adds value to an existing mainstream programme; b. Implications on investing limited resources (i.e., time, money and manpo wer) on interventions that may not produce desired results and detract caregivers from evidenc e-\u00adbased interventions; c. The potential for harm, disability or medical illness, especially in the young growing child who has vulnerable neurological and physiological systems. GPP Parents and caregivers should not replace mainstream interventions for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD with complementary and alternative therapies. GPP Becau se of the plethora of CAT used in children with ASD, it is neither practical nor feasible to review evidence for all CAT and this guideline only reviewed therapies/interventions frequen tly discussed in clinical settings or associated with extensive research. Since research into CAT is ongo ing, this workgroup reviewed evidence that was available up to the time of publication of the gu ideline. In general, 66 evidence for the efficacy of CAT remained limited with none meeting criteria for effective intervention. When professionals discuss the use of CAT with parents of children with ASD, it is important to explain potential harms and bene fits associated with CAT. The workgroup committee recommends that the decision to use CAT be guided by evidence of its efficacy and safety in scientific studies employing adequa te research design. Therefore, healthcare professionals should keep themselves upda ted on developments in the field of CAT. GPP Healthcare professionals caring for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should advise and counsel parents and caregivers abou t relevan t, safe and effective health services and therapies regardless of whether the therapies are mainstream or CAT.319 GPP Complementary alternative therapies (CAT) were divided into: 12.1 CAT with insufficient or conflicting evidence of efficacy ; 12.2 CAT with sufficient evidence that the therapy was ineffective; 12.3 CAT with potential for harm 12.1 CAT with insufficient , conflicting or inconclusive evidence These complementary alternative therapies (CAT) had insufficient, conflicting or inconc lusive evidence for efficacy at the time of writing. Until further evidence of efficacy beco mes available, healthcare professionals caring for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should exercise prudence when advising parents or caregivers who are keen to consider using these CATs. The following CATs are not reco mmended for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD becau se of insufficient, conflicting or inconc lusive evidence -\u00ad Sound therapies (Samonas Sound Therapy and the Listening Programme) 67 -\u00ad Massage and other sensory-\u00adbased interventions acid supplementation Amino acid supplementation in children with ASD was based on the role of amino acids in neuro-\u00adtransmission and metabolism.320 The efficacy of amino acid supplementation in children with ASD has not been rigorously investigated in large controlled trials. In an eight-\u00ad week small doub le-\u00adblinded study of children with ASD, a daily dose of 800mg carnosine compared to placebo resulted in improvement in the Gillian Autism Rating Scale and Receptive One-\u00adWord Picture Vocabu lary test, although the mechan ism of action was ill unde rstood.321 High doses of amino acids (especially methionine, isoleucine, threonine and tryptophan ) administered to children may result in nausea, appetite suppression and liver dysfunction.322 The uppe r limit of amino acid intake is not established. D High dose amino acid supplementation is not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy. Grade D, Level 3 12.1.2 Animal-\u00adassisted therapy Animal-\u00adassisted therapy refers to interventions in which animals, such as dolphins, horses (hippotherapy) or dogs, are employed in the suppo rt of individuals with ASD.323-\u00ad327 Animals are used in a variety of ways ranging from being a daily life assistant to a therapeu tic tool. Evidence for efficacy of animal-\u00adassisted therapy for children with ASD was insufficient.326 Employment of animals raised concerns of harm to the child and/or animal when an initially tame animal may be provoked by a volatile child, when a child may unexpec tedly react aggressively to the animal or when there is zoonotic disease transmission to the child from an animal.328 D Animal-\u00adassisted therapy is not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy. Grade D, Level 3 68 12.1.3 Behavioural optometry Behav ioural optometry employs behav ioural vision therapy to train visual processing skills, visual motor integration and learning efficiency . Studies of behav ioural optometry in children with ASD were largely uncon trolled, few in number and produced incon sistent results.329, 330 The conc lusion of systematic reviews as well as the consensus of ophthalmologists, orthoptists and pediatricians was that there was a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of behav ioural optometry in remediation of learning problems associated with ASD.331-\u00ad336 D Behav ioural optometry is not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of conflicting evidence . Grade D, Level 3 12.1.4 Expressive psychotherapy Expressive psycho therapy includes art therapy, play therapy, drama therapy and sand-\u00adtray therapy.337, 338 ASD is not associated with psychodyna mic factors or poor parenting (refer to chap ter 7); therefore, there is no biological basis for the use of expressive psycho therapy as a form of therapy for ASD. D Expressive psycho therapy is not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy . Grade D, casein-\u00adfree (GFCF) with ASD was based on the hypo thesis that children with autism had abno rmal intestinal digestive ability and permeability, itive Immune allergy to gluten and casein was implicated.342 These hypo theses remain unsubstantiated by rigorous scientific data.348 Clinical trials with opiate antagon ists were not consistently bene ficial.308, 309 69 Systematic reviews had studied the effectiveness of GFCF diets for treating ASD.144,349,350In a Cochrane review of 2 randomised controlled trials that studied the effectiveness of GFCF diets in children with ASD, results were contradictory and meta-\u00adanalysis could not be performed because of the heterogeneity of data.347,351The reviewers concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the GFCF diet in ASD. There are practical difficulties in keeping strictly to a GFCF diet, including difficulty in ensuring compliance as well as the extra cost and preparation time required. Furthermore, there are concerns of dietary restriction in children who may already have rigidity and sensory limitations in feeding (refer to chapter 9). One study found that compared to matched controls, children with autism on strict GFCF diets showed a trend towards increased prevalence of essential amino acid deficiency and lower plasma levels of essential amino acids including the neurotransmitter precursors tyrosine and tryptophan.352 In another study, children with autism on GFCF diets were shown to have lower bone cortical thickness compared to controls.353 Parents and/or caregivers must ensure that the pre-\u00adschool child receives adequate calcium, vitamin D and protein intake for optimal growth. D Gluten-\u00adfree casein-\u00adfree diets are not recommended in the routine management of children with ASD because of conflicting evidence. Grade D, Level 3 12.1.6 Sound therapies (Samonas or The Listening Program\u00ae) Sound therapy may be provided as Auditory Integration Therapy (refer to 12.3.4 for Auditory Integration Therapy), Samonas or The Listening Program\u00ae. Samonas is based on listening to CD classical music. It was reported to improve psychological and physiological conditions, such as hearing, learning difficulties, voice problems and behaviour disturbances. Another form of listening therapy called the Listening Programme consisted of reproduced filtered music available in CDs. A Cochrane review in 2004 found no trials that assessed Samonas or The Listening Programme in children with ASD.354 70 D Sound therapies (either as Samonas or the Listening Programme\u00ae) are not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy. Grade D, Level 3 12.1.7 Massage and other sensory-\u00adbased interve ntions Massage is the passive application of controlled sensory stimulation. It includes applying deep pressure, tension, motion or vibration to the skin, muscles or other soft tissues of the body . Other sensory-\u00adbased interventions include brushing and rubbing of the body , touch therapy, deep pressure and compression of joints. Use of massage was sugge sted as a means to reduce social and attentive behav iour issues, anxiety issues, sleep and bowel movement problems in children with ASD.355-\u00ad364 However, these studies had weak methodo logy and evidence was inconc lusive. D Massage and other sensory-\u00adbased interventions are not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy. Grade D, Level 3 12.1.8 Music therapy Music therapy is a specific intervention using music communication and expression, including free and structured improvisation, songs and listening to music. This is based on the premise that musical interaction and improvisation may be considered a type of non-\u00adverbal and pre-\u00adverbal language training.365, 366 Systematic reviews of music therapy for ASD produced contradictory conc lusions. A meta-\u00adanalysis concluded that all music intervention was effective for children and adolescents with autism.367 While one review found a gene rally positive effect of music therapy,368 another review was unab le to identify possibly relevan t studies of music therapy and conc luded that its effects were unclear.369 In a Cochrane review of 3 studies that examined the short-\u00adterm effect of brief music therapy for autistic children, the reviewers conc luded that music therapy was superior to placebo with respect to verbal and gestural communication, but had insignificant effect on behav ioural problems.370 Of note, the reportedly positive effect of music therapy was based on using highly structured receptive techn iques. This may 71 have limited clinical applicability because in practice, music therapy tends to be associated with less structure and the use of improvisational techniques. When applying the results of the review to practice, it is important to note that application of music therapy require specialised academic and clinical training. In a recent small randomized controlled trial that used improvisational techniques, music therapy was found beneficial in promoting the social, emotional and motivational development of children with autism.371, 372 D Music therapy is not recommended in the routine management of children with ASD because of inconclusive evidence. Grade D, Level 3 12.1.9 Omega-\u00ad3 fatty acid acid (O3FA) supplementation in ASD individuals was conflicting. While observational data suggested that levels of O3FA in ASD individuals was lower compared to controls and may be improved through supplementation,373-\u00ad376 others failed to detect O3FA deficiency or demonstrate benefits of O3FA supplementation.377,378A systematic review identified only 1 randomized controlled trial and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of O3FA supplementation in children with ASD.379 Adverse effects reported with O3FA supplementation included gastro-\u00ad intestinal complaints (diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, and abdominal bloating), fever, increased hyperactivity and behavioural problems.379 At high doses, drug interactions may occur, such as with anti-\u00ad coag ulant and anti-\u00adhypertensive medication.264 The advice of the Australian National Health and Medical Research is that the upper limit of O3FA intake in children, adolescents and adults should not excee d 3 grams per day. D High dose omega-\u00ad3 fatty acid supplementation is not recommended in the routine manag ement of children with ASD because of inconclusive evidence for efficacy. Grade D, Level 3 72 12.2 CAT with sufficient evidence that the therapy was ineffective The following complementary alternative therapies are not recommended in the routine manage ment of children with ASD becau se of evidence that they are related to neurotransmitter glycine with the potential to cross the blood-\u00adbrain barrier and influence the overall balance of inhibitory versus excitatory neurotransmitters. Evidence for the effects of DMG supplementation in ASD comes from anecdoc tal reports and case series.380, 381 In two small doub le-\u00adblind placeb o-\u00adcontrolled trials of DMG, no improvement was reported in the treatment groups as compared to controls.382, 383 One child who was given DMG supplements was reported by the parents to have been more 'edgy '.382, 383 D Dimethylglycine supplementation is not recommended for pre-\u00ad schoo l children with ASD becau se it is ineffective. Grade D, Level 3 12.2.2 Patterning therapy without masking Patterning therapies constitute a class of interventions based on the belief that autism is one of many disorders caused by some form of brain injury. It includes the Doman-\u00adDelecato or Glenn Doman programme, autism rehab ilitation therapy, psycho motor patterning and deve lopmental reflexive rehab ilitation.384-\u00ad387 Patterning therapy involves a series of bodily exercises and other activities designed to \"rewire\" the brain in individuals with autism and other disorders.262, 388 In a full treatment programme, exercises are combined with sensory stimulation, breathing exercises termed \"masking\" and a programme of restriction and facilitation designed to promote hemispheric dominance .389 73 A review of patterning therapies by professional organizations384-\u00ad387 since the 1960 s, including the American Acade my for Cerebral Palsy, American Acade my of Neurology and American Acade my of Pediatrics384-\u00ad387 conc luded that \"this treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of brain deve lopment. Current information does not suppo rt the claims of proponen ts that this treatment is efficacious, and its use continues to be unwarranted\". There are conce rns of harm for patterning with masking, which is discussed separately in section 12.3.3. D Patterning without masking is not recommended for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD becau se it is ineffective. Grade D, Level 4 12.3 CAT with potential for harm Potential for harm was evaluated in terms of the risk of death, disability and medical or psycho logical disorders. The impact of interventions was considered in the context of the child's growth and deve lopment, especially during the vulnerable pre-\u00adschoo l years. Healthcare professionals caring for pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD should advise parents and caregivers to avoid using any of these CATs in view of the potential for harm. The following complementary alternative therapies are not recommended in pre-\u00adschoo l children with ASD becau se of potential for harm or adve rse Acupunc ture -\u00ad integral part of traditional Chinese medicine, acupunc ture involves the insertion of metallic need le(s) into the skin for 3-\u00ad5mm. It is sometimes used in combination with moxibustion and electrical stimulation. Methods of acupunc ture electro-\u00ad acupunc A Cochrane systematic review of acupunc ture for ASD is ongo ing. There was insufficient evidence for efficacy due to a paucity of studies and poor quality of research.390 It was difficult to relate the bene ficial outcomes reported in children with ASD to acupunc ture alone becau se of poor study design or publication bias.390, 391 Adverse effects of acupunc ture are rare when it is appropriately administered. However, cases of infection (from inadequa te need le sterilization), haemorrhage , need ling pain, organ punc ture and symptom aggravation had been reported following acupunc ture.392-\u00ad395 D Acupunc ture is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and the potential for harm. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.2 Antibiotics and anti-\u00adyeast medications Intestinal dysbiosis and immune dysregulation in children with ASD was sugge sted to contribute to autism symptoms. However, intestinal cand idial over-\u00adgrowth was not observed during endo scopy in children with ASD.109 Rather, an overgrowth of yeast and pathogen ic bacteria may result from freque nt prolonged courses of antibiotic treatment. Evidence on the efficacy of vanco mycin in children with ASD was inconc lusive.396 There are serious adve rse effects associated with indiscriminate use of antibiotics, including the emergence of antibiotic-\u00adresistant bacteria such as vanco mycin-resistant spp. Chronic use of anti-\u00adfunga l is associated with hepa totoxicity 75 and exfoliative dermatitis, while nystatin is associated with diarrhoea .397 D Antibiotic and anti-\u00adyeast therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and the potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.3 Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) supplementation The pharmacologic effect of ascorbic acid was postulated to be similar to that of conven tional neuroleptics, especially blockade of dopa mine recep tors. A doub le blind, placeb o-\u00adcontrolled trial exploring the effects of ascorbic acid supplementation in 18 children in residential treatment reported a reduc tion of autistic symptoms in selected individuals but findings were preliminary.398 Adverse effects of exce ssive ascorbic acid consumption include osmotic diarrhoea , nausea and abdo minal cramps. Although other adve rse effects, such as kidney stone formation, exce ss iron absorption, reduced vitamin B12 and coppe r levels, increased oxygen demand, systemic cond itioning, pro-\u00adoxidant effects, dental enamel erosion, or delayed-\u00adtype allergic response had been observed before, in vivo data did not demonstrate a clear causal relationship.250 The National Acade my of Science s defined uppe r tolerable limits of ascorbic acid as 400 mg/day in children 1-\u00ad3 years old and 650 mg/day in children 4-\u00ad8 years old respectively.250 D High dose ascorbic acid supplementation is not recommended for ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and the potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.4 Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) (Refer to 12.1.6) Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) includes the \"Berard\" method and \"Tomatis and Clarke\" method. An AIT programme consists of listening to music that has been computer-\u00admodified to remove frequenc ies to which the listener demonstrates hype rsensitivity and reduce the predictability of auditory patterns. A Cochrane review conc luded that studies of auditory integration therapy showed 76 significant methodo logical weakne sses and meta-\u00adanalysis was not possible due to very high level of heterogene ity and unusable presentation of data.354 There was conce rn with quality control of the equipment and potentially unsafe sound levels produced .399 Hearing damage due to the volume and sound pressure used during treatment was reported.60, 400 A&D Auditory Integration Therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and the potential for damage to hearing. *Grade A, Level 1++ Grade D, Level 3 12.3.5 Chelation therapy Chelation therapy, through intravenou s, subcu taneou s, oral and topical routes, was proposed as a solution to address childhood expo sure to environmental neurotoxins, such as mercury and lead, that had been sugge sted as a possible cause for ASD (refer to Chapter 7). There were no studies showing that mercury expo sure was the cause for the deve lopment of ASD or that children with ASD had greater expo sure to mercury than unaffected children. There was no evidence confirming that the chelation of heavy metals would improve the deve lopmental skills of children with ASD. Furthermore, chelation therapy is known to be associated with adve rse effects such as , a 5-\u00adyear old child with autism was reported to have died during chelation therapy.405 D Chelation therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence of efficacy* and the potential for harm including death. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.6 Chiropractic Chiropractic involves spinal adjustment, manua l therapy on other joints, soft-\u00adtissue manipulation and sometimes exercises, massage and lifestyle coun selling to restore health.406 Results of research on the efficacy of chiropractic treatment was conflicting.407, 408 There is little evidence to suppo rt use of chiropractic in ASD.409 77 Chiropractic care is gene rally regarded as safe when used appropriately. However, there were reports of adve rse effects associated with spinal manipulation,410 including subarachno id haemorrhage , paraplegia, such as X ray and CT scan may expo se the child to risks of radiation expo sure.412, 413 D Chiropractic is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of conflicting evidence of efficacy* and the potential for harm. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.7 Cranio-\u00adsacral therapy Cranio-\u00adsacral therapy is based on the theory that gentle manipulation of the spine, skull and related soft tissues restores dysfunction in the rhythmic fluctuations of the cerebro-\u00adspinal fluid, soft tissue and cranium. There was no study to show that cranio-\u00adsacral therapy was efficacious in ASD.380, 414 Side effects from cranio-\u00adsacral therapy had been reported, including depression, confusion, headache s, diplopia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, trigeminal nerve damage, hypop ituitarism, brainstem dysfunction and opisthotonus.414 D Cranio-\u00adsacral therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and the potential for harm. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.8 Digestive enzymes Use of digestive enzy mes was based on the disproven theory that ASD is caused by intestinal dysfunction and opioid exce ss from exorphins (pre-\u00adopioid compound s). Digestive enzy me therapy was proposed as a way to remove exorphins from the body . No controlled trials were published regarding efficacy of digestive enzy mes for treating ASD in children.380, 397, 415 Digestive enzy mes were associated with adve rse effects in one study, including hype ractivity, aggression, diarrhoea and poor appe tite.415 78 D Digestive enzy me therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence of efficacy* and the potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.9 Facilitated communication Facilitated communication is a techn ique' that involves a facilitator physically suppo rting the child's arm or hand to type or point at pictures, symbols, letters and/or words. Systematic reviews conc luded that facilitated communication was not effective for children with ASD.400, 416-\u00ad418 The authenticity of facilitated communication outputs by ASD individuals had been questioned ,418-\u00ad428 and conce rns had been raised regarding the potential for abuse. For example, false reports pertaining to personal preference s, family relations and psycho social health were made. False allegations of abuse led to legal, psycho logical and financ ial problems for affected families.429-\u00ad431 Information obtained through , or based on facilitated communication should not form the sole basis for making any diagno stic or treatment decisions for the pre-\u00adschoo l child with ASD.397, 400 , 416 , 417 , 432 , 433 A&D Facilitated communication is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of lack of efficacy* and the potential for abuse. *Grade A, Level 1+ Grade D, Level 3 12.3.10 Folate supplementation It was hypo thesized that oxidative stress led to neuronal insult and regression seen in some children with autism.434 Although some autistic individuals were observed to have decreased methylation capac ity that improved with methylcoba lamin and folinic acid treatment, metabolic change s were not correlated with clinical symptoms.435-\u00ad437 There was no evidence for the efficacy of folate supplementation in children with ASD. Excessive folate supplementation may mask vitamin B12 deficiency and result in unrecogn ized neurological damage. The National Acade my of Science s defined uppe r tolerable limits of folate from fortified foods or supplements as 300 \u00b5g/day for children 1-\u00ad3 years old and 400 \u00b5g/day for children 4-\u00ad8 years old respectively.267 79 D High dose folate supplementation is not recommended for children with ASD because of insufficient evidence of efficacy* and the potential for adverse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.11 Holding therapy Holding therapy evolved over the years and had been named variously as rebirthing, compression therapy, the \"Evergreen model\", rage-\u00ad reduction, corrective attachment therapy, Coercive Restraint Therapy, hug therapy, holding time, cuddle time, gentle containment, holding-\u00ad nurturing process, prolonged parent-\u00adchild embrace therapy and attachment therapy. Efficacy of Holding therapy in autism remains unsubstantiated by rigorous scientific evidence. The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) Task Force report stated that \"A central feature of many of these therapies is the use of psychological, physical, or aggressive means to provoke the child to catharsis, ventilation of rage, or other sorts of acute emotional discharge. To do this, a variety of coercive techniques are used... so they can be forced to engage in prolonged eye contact... Similar but less physically coercive approaches may involve holding the child and psychologically enco uraging the child to vent anger toward her or his biological parent.\"438 These methods are potentially abusive and resulted in tragic outcomes for children, including death.439 D Holding therapy is not recommended for children with ASD because of lack of efficacy* and the potential for harm, including death. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.12 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was proposed as a way to increase the oxygen supply to the brain of individuals with autism, thereby reducing inflammation and mobilizing stem cells from human bone marrow to aid in neuroregeneration.440,441A multicentre randomized double-\u00adblind controlled trial concluded that HBOT may improve symptoms in children with ASD, but did not calculate the sample size of the primary outcome.442-\u00ad444 Reported adverse effects of 80 HBO T included ear pneu Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence of efficacy* and the potential for harm. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.13 Intravenous immunog lobulin therapy There is no evidence that ASD is related to brain/meningea l inflammation or caused by specific infectious agen ts (refer to chap ter 7). In a placeb o-\u00adcontrolled trial of oral human immunog lobulin used for 12 weeks to treat gastro-\u00adintestinal dysfunction in children aged 2-\u00ad17 years with autistic disorder, human immunog lobulin treatment was not found to be superior to placebo in reduc ing autistic symptoms.128 Use of immunog lobulin may be associated with common side effects such as headache , nausea, malaise, fever, urticaria, arthralgia and myalgia. Less common but potentially fatal side effects include anaphy laxis, aseptic meningitis, complications.446 D Immunog lobulin therapy is not recommended for children with ASD becau se it is ineffective* and there is potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 12.3.14 Patterning with (Refer for Patterning therapy without masking) Patterning with Masking aims to increase the carbon dioxide level in re-\u00adbreathed air, so that the child with ASD would deve lop cerebral vasodilatation as a result of inhaling the carbon dioxide-\u00adrich air and indirectly promote oxygen delivery to the brain.389 Inhaling re-\u00ad breathed air that is carbon dioxide-\u00adrich but depleted of oxygen is potentially dange rous to the child. Long-\u00adterm effects on the deve loping brains of young children are unknown.384-\u00ad387 81 D Patterning with masking is not recommended for children with ASD becau se it is ineffective* and there is potential for harm to the child's deve loping brain. *Grade D, Level 4 12.3.15 Secretin therapy Secretin is a hormone currently approved for the diagno stic evaluation of panc reatic and intestinal function. Use of intravenou s secretin in children with ASD was based on anecdo tal expe rience in 1998 .447 Extensive research over the past decade has since shown that secretin was ineffective for the treatment of ASD.448-\u00ad453 A Cochrane review in 2005 conc luded that there was no evidence for the efficacy of secretin in the treatment of ASD, whether in single or multiple doses.448 Adverse effects of secretin include increased tantrums, aggression, hype ractivity, raised liver function test, stomachache , emotional lability, fractures, seizures, vomiting, fever tachyca rdia and flushing.448 A&D Intravenou s secretin is not recommended for children with ASD becau se it is ineffective* and there is potential for serious adve rse effects. *Grade A, Level 1++ Grade D, Level 4 12.3.16 Vitamin B6 - Magnesium supplementation A Cochrane systematic review included 3 small rando mized controlled trials of vitamin B6-\u00adMagne sium in ASD but was unab le to perform meta-\u00adanalysis becau se of heterogene ity of data. Of the 3 trials, one reported improvement in verbal intelligence in the treatment group,454 while the other 2 found no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups.455,456 The reviewers were unab le to recommend vitamin B6 and magne sium as treatment options for autism due to the small number of studies, poor methodo logical quality and small sample size.457 Another study had similar methodo logical issues.458 Whilst vitamin B6 and magne sium obtained from food sources had not been reported to cause adve rse effects, high doses of vitamin B6 supplementation were associated with side effects, including peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, hype rsensitivity to sound , irritability, depression, photosensitivity and enuresis.235, 267 , 294 dose vitamin B6 -\u00ad magne sium supplementation is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of conflicting evidence* and the potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.17 Weighted vests The wearing of a weighted vest or straps with even ly distributed weights, was used to reduce a range of problems, especially inattention and stereotypical behav iours. The weight prescribed and duration of use varied widely.460 Evidence on efficacy of weighted vests on ASD was limited.460 Wearing of a vest that includes weights beyond the prescribed weight limit and for a duration beyond the prescribed length of time may potentially affect the musculo-\u00adskeletal deve lopment of the growing child.460 D Wearing of weighted vests is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence of efficacy* and potentially adve rse effects on the deve loping spine. *Grade D, Level 3 Grade D, Level 4 12.3.18 Zinc supplementation Zinc plays a role in the immune response, neurotransmitter produc tion and anti-\u00adoxidant property. Various studies did not consistently prove that children with ASD are deficient in zinc.461, 462,463 There were no controlled studies that examined the efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation for children with ASD.464 Chronic intake of supplemental zinc resulted in immune suppression, a decrease in high-\u00ad density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower coppe r status. Acute side effects of zinc supplementation included epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appe tite, abdo minal cramps, diarrhoea and headache .465 D Zinc supplementation is not recommended for children with ASD becau se of insufficient evidence for efficacy* and potential for adve rse effects. *Grade D, level 4 83 13 Clinical quality improvement This CPG for Autism Spectrum Disorder in pre-\u00adschoo l children was formulated to assist local practitioners in the areas of surveillance screening, early idenitification, referral, diagnosis and intervention. It aims to encou rage a change in mindset and practice. The importance of equiping primary care doctors in early identification of ASD canno t be over-\u00ademphasised. The following two clinical quality indicators in the areas of surveillance are important measures of Clinical Quality Improvement for care of children with ASD. 1. All professionals who deal with pre-\u00adschoo l children, whether in health care services or early childhood educa tion centres, should receive training on the \"key signs\" that sugge st a diagno sis of ASD. Clinical Quality Indicator Training in 'key signs' of ASD and MCHA T provided through the College of Paediatric and Child Health, Singapo re (Acade my of Medicine, Singapo re), and College of Family Physicians, Singapo re, to primary care doctors (i.e. General practitioners, polyclinic doctors and private paed iatricians). To achieve -\u00ad 20% of all primary care doctors trained in year 1 -\u00ad 40% of all primary care doctors trained in year 2 -\u00ad 50% of all primary care doctors trained in year 3 2. Professionals should aim to identify ASD early. Early identification provides oppo rtunity for early referral and intervention, so that the child with ASD may have improved functioning in later life. Clinical Quality Indicator Decreasing age at referral/diagno sis of ASD over the next 3 years. 84 14 Cost-\u00adeffectiveness issues The increase in the number of children diagno sed with ASD has resulted in a growing demand for current estimates of econo mic costs associated with ASD. In addition, children with ASD are more likely than others to have a number of medical cond itions, resulting in the potential for greater use of health services.466 No cost-\u00adeffectivene ss comparisons between different interventions for ASD appea r to have been conduc ted. Four recen t studies reported consistent medical expend iture estimates for children with ASD in the US. On average, medical expend itures for children with ASD were 3-\u00ad9 times greater than for those without becau se of increased costs for hospitalisations, medications, and out-\u00ad patient clinic visits.466-\u00ad469 In addition, a US study470 estimated that the average loss of annua l income associated with having a child with ASD was 14% of annua l income, sugge sting significant burden for families. Two cost-\u00adbene fit studies of the early intensive behav iour intervention programme for young children in the US indicated that the implementation of early intervention for children with ASD would gene rate cost savings to the gove rnment, compared with no early intervention.471,472 This was primarily due to a reduc tion in years of special educa tion. These studies sugge st that early intervention could improve functioning and quality of life for children with ASD as well as gene rate cost savings for the gove rnment. Although results from other coun tries may not be gene ralised to the local context due to different health care systems and cost estimates, these studies add to our unde rstanding of the health-\u00adrelated econo mic impact of ASD. 85 Annex A DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR and ICD -\u00ad10 Diagnostic Criteria for Autism DSM-\u00adIV -\u00adTR Criteria for Autistic Disorderiv A.
