But one modification from an earlier plan says other information can shape arbiters' determinations of an out-of-network rate. [ Axios: Surprise Billing Rule Gets New Rules For Working Out Disputes ](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/22/surprise-billing-rule-out-disputes) A year and a half after Congress protected patients from surprise medical bills, the Biden administration has finalized the process for deciding who'll actually pick up the tab.

(Reed and Bettelheim, 8/22) [ Stat: Biden Admin Stands Firm On Method For Resolving Surprise Billing Disputes ](https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/19/medicare-surprise-billing-final-rule/) In a final rule published late Friday, the government said the entities that are meant to settle disputes between insurance companies and out-of-network providers must start their considerations with the median in-network payment rate for the service in question. Many providers don't want the arbiters to rely on the median in-network payment rates, because they'll get paid less if those in-network charges are taken into account. Already eight provider groups have sued the government on this point.

Assistant Attorney General Beau Roysden said the judge's role is simple: now that the high court has overturned Roe v.

The abortion ban is set to go into effect on Aug. 26. The Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo is seeking a preliminary injunction as part of a lawsuit that says the ban violates the state constitution.

Wade in June, anti-abortion activists are pushing for a long-held and more absolute goal: laws that grant fetuses the same legal rights and protections as any person. So-called fetal personhood laws would make abortion murder, ruling out all or most of the exceptions for abortion allowed in states that already ban it.

Finance reports filed by 40 groups and individuals with the state as of this week showed that abortion rights supporters spent $11.3 million on their campaign to defeat a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion.

After the decision, Democratic nominee Pat Ryan unveiled new campaign signs, white on pink, that read \"CHOICE IS ON THE BALLOT.\" The state Democratic Party's own signs show a red slash over \"Roe v.

Dozens of websites state they ship abortion drugs anywhere in the U.S. without a prescription, which violates Food and Drug Administration rules. Most of the sites don't clearly state who operates them or where they get the pills. The operator of one website said demand for abortion pills has surged since the Supreme Court removed constitutional protection for abortion in June. (Mosbergen and Agarwal, 8/21) [ KHN: Policies To Roll Back Abortion Rights Will Hit Incarcerated People Particularly Hard ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/abortion-rights-policies-incarcerated-prison-jail/) Policies governing abortion and reproductive health care services in U.S. prisons and jails were restrictive and often hostile even before the Supreme Court removed Roe v. Wade's constitutional protections for abortions. After the June ruling, many reproductive services stand to be prohibited altogether, putting the health of incarcerated women who are pregnant at risk. That threat is particularly urgent in states where lawmakers have made clear their intentions to roll back abortion rights.

That begs an important question: Who's going to be eligible to get them? The short answer: Anyone ages 12 and up who has completed a primary vaccination series, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson tells CNBC Make It.

By now, much of the population has either been vaccinated or infected with an earlier variant of SARS-CoV-2. The immune system has been trained to remember this variant \u2014 and a dose of vaccine, even one with Omicron-specific components, will tend to boost those earlier immunological memories.
