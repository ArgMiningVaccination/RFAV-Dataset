Examples of these indications are enumerated individually below. 1. Indications for a CBC generally include the evaluation of bone marrow dysfunction as a result of neoplasms, therapeutic agents, exposure to toxic substances, or pregnancy. The CBC is also useful in assessing peripheral destruction of blood cells, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or lymphoproliferative processes, and immune disorders. 2. Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with anemia or other red blood cell disorder (e.g., pallor, weakness, fati gue, weight loss, bleeding, acute injury associated with blood loss or suspected blood loss, abnormal menstrual bleeding, hematuria, hematemesis, hematochezia, positive fecal occult blood test, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, malabsorption, neuropathy, k nown malignancy, presence of acute or chronic disease that may have associated anemia, coagulation or hemostatic disorders, postural dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chronic marrow hypoplasia or decreased RBC production, tachycar dia, systolic heart murmur, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, the lower extremities). 3. Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RB C) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with polycythemia (for example, fever, chills, ruddy skin, conjunctival redness, cough, wheezing, cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, orthopnea, heart murmur, headache, vague cognitive changes including memory changes, sleep apnea, weakness, pruritus, dizziness, excessive sweating, visual symptoms, weight loss, 2 massive obesity, gastrointestinal bleeding, paresthesias, dyspnea, joint symptoms, epiga stric distress, pain and erythema or myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, congenital heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increased erythropoietin p roduction associated with neoplastic, renal or hepatic disorders, androgen or diuretic use, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, diastolic hypertension.) 4. Specific indications for CBC with differential count related to the WBC include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with leukemia, infections or inflammatory processes, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic or lymphoproliferative disorder, use of drugs that may cause leukopen ia, and immune disorders (e.g., fever, chills, sweats, shock, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, tachypnea, heart murmur, seizures, alterations of consciousness, meningismus, pain such as headache, abdominal pain, arthralgia, odynophagia, or dysuria, redness o r swelling of skin, soft tissue bone, or joint, ulcers of the skin or mucous membranes, gangrene, mucous membrane discharge, bleeding, thrombosis, jaundice, diarrhea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphade nopathy, opportunistic infection such as oral candidiasis.) 5. Specific indications for CBC related to the platelet count include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with increased or decreased platelet production and destruction, or platelet dysfunction(e.g., pre - eclampsia, neonate with maternal ITP, massive transfusion, recent platelet transfusion, renal diseases, lymphadenopathy, , or lymphoproliferative disorder, thrombosis, exposure to toxic agents, excessive alcohol ingestion, autoimmune disorders (SLE, RA and other). 6. Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include, in addition to tho se already listed, thalassemia, suspected hemoglobinopathy, lead poisoning, arsenic poisoning, and spherocytosis. 7. Specific indications for CBC with differential count related to the WBC include, in addition to those already listed, storage diseases/mucopol ysaccharidoses, and use of drugs that cause leukocytosis such as G -CSF or GM -CSF. 8. Specific indications for CBC related to platelet count include, in addition to those already listed, May - Hegglin syndrome and Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome. Limitations 1. Testing of patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have a condition that could be expected to result in a hematological abnormality, is screening and is not a covered service. 2. In some circumstances it may be appropriate to perform only a h emoglobin or hematocrit to assess the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. When the ordering provider requests only a hemoglobin or hematocrit, the remaining components of the CBC should not be ordered . 3. In some patients presenting with certain signs, symptoms or diseases, a single CBC may be appropriate. Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found, or unless there is a change in clinical condition. If repeat testing is performed, a more descriptive diagnosis code (e.g., anemia) should be reported to support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions where there is a continued risk for the development of hematologic abnormality. Thyroid Testing Indications Thyroid function tests are used to define hyper function, euthyroidism, or hypofunction of thyroid disease. Thyroid testing may be reasonable and necessary to: Distinguish between primary and secondary hypothyroidism; Confirm or rule out primary hypothyro idism; Monitor thyroid hormone levels (for example, patients with goiter, thyroid nodules, or thyroid cancer); Monitor drug therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism; 3 Confirm or rule out primary hyperthyroidism; and Monitor therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function testing may be medically necessary in patients with disease or neoplasm of the thyroid and other endocrine glands. Thyroid function testing may also be medically necessary in patients with metabolic disorder s; malnutrition; hyperlipidemia; certain types of disorders; unexplained depression; of menstruation; skin conditions; myalgias; and a wide arr ay of signs and symptoms, including alterations in consciousness; malaise; hypothermia; symptoms of the nervous and integumentary system; nutrition and metabolism; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal system ; and pregnancy . It may be medically necessary to do follow -up thyroid testing in patients with a personal history of malignant neoplasm of the endocrine system and in patients on long -term thyroid drug therapy. Testing of patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have a condition that could be expected to result in thyroid dysfunction is screening and is not a covered service. Urine Culture, Bacterial Urine culture is a test that helps to detect the presence of microorganisms in a urine sample. It can be used to help diagnose urinary tract infection as well as to guide the selection of antibiotics for treatment of urinary tract infection. Indications A bacterial urine culture is a laboratory procedure performed on a urine specimen to establish the probable etiology of a presumed urinary tract infection. It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar -based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantification of types present based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols. 1. A patient's urinalysis is abnormal suggesting urinary tract infection, for example, positive for s; positive bacteriuria screen by a non -culture technique; or other significant abnormality of a urinalysis. While it is not essential to evaluate a urine specimen by one of these methods before a urine culture is performed, certain clinical presentations with highly suggestive signs and symptoms may lend themselves to an antecedent urinalysis procedure where follow -up culture depends upon an initial positive or abnormal test result. 2. A patient has clinical signs and symptoms indicative of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute lower UTI may present with urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, discharge or incontinence. These findings may also be noted in upper UTI with additional systemic symptoms (for example, fever, chills, lethargy); or pain in th e costovertebral, abdominal, or pelvic areas. Signs and symptoms may overlap considerably with other inflammatory conditions of the genitourinary tract (for example, prostatitis, urethritis, vaginitis, or cervicitis). Elderly or immunocompromised patients , or patients with neurologic disorders may present atypically (for example, general debility, acute mental status changes, declining functional status). 3. The patient is being evaluated for suspected urosepsis, fever of unknown origin, or other systemic manifestations of infection but without a known source. Signs and symptoms used to define sepsis have been well established. 4. A test -of cure is generally not indicated in an uncomplicated infection. However, it may be indicated if the patient is being evaluate d for response to therapy and there is a complicating co -existing urinary abnormality including structural or functional abnormalities, calculi, foreign bodies, or ureteral/renal 4 stents or there is clinical or laboratory evidence of failure to respond as d escribed in Indications 1 and 2. 5. In surgical procedures involving major manipulations of the genitourinary tract, preoperative examination to detect occult infection may be indicated in selected cases (for example, prior to renal transplantation, manipulat ion or removal of kidney stones, or transurethral surgery of the bladder or prostate). 6. Urine culture may be indicated to detect occult infection in renal transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy. Limitations Routine screening of patients who are asymptomatic is not a covered service. Prothrombin Time (PT) Prothrombin Time is used to detect bleeding or clotting disorders and is also used to calculate the International Normalized Ratio (INR) . Indications Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few simple laboratory tests: the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), PT, thrombin time (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test is one in -vitro laboratory test used to assess coagulation. While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system, the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the reactions that occur aft er the activation of factor X. Extrinsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies of factors may be related to decreased production or increased consumption of coagulation factors. The PT/INR is most commonl y used to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic pathway factors. A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the PT ratio that would result if the WHO reference thromboplastin had been used in performing the test. Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT testing in patients who are self- monitoring . Therefore, the indications for testing apply regardless of whether or not the patient is also PT self-testing. 1. A PT may be used to assess patients taking warfarin. The prothrombin time is generally not useful in monitoring patients receiving heparin wh o are not taking warfarin. 2. A PT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis. For example: swollen extremity with or without prior trauma; unexplained bruising; abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage or hematoma; petechia e or other signs of thrombocytopenia that could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. 3. A PT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a condition known to be associated with the risk of bleeding or thrombosis that is related to the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquired. For example: dysfibrinogenemia; afibrinogenemia (complete); acute or chronic liver dysfunction or disease and Hemochromatosis; disseminated intrav ascular coagulation (DIC); congenital and acquired deficiencies pulmonary emboli or myocardial patients with bleeding or clotting tendencies; organ transplantation; presence of circulating coagulation inhibitors. 4. A PT may be used to assess the risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis in patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. For 5 example: evaluation prior to invasive procedures or operations of patients with personal history of bleeding or a condition associated with coagulopathy prior to the use of thrombolytic medicati on. Limitations 1. The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the underlying medical condition and/or the dosing of warfarin. In a patient on stable warfarin therapy, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing more than every two to three weeks. When testing is performed to evaluate a patient with signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis and the initial test result is normal, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing unless there is a change in the patient's medical status. 2. Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of bleeding and thrombosis (other than thrombolytic therapy) will generally be c onsidered medically necessary only where there are signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombotic abnormality or a personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated with a coagulopathy. Hospital/clinic -specific policies, protocols, etc., in and of themselves, cannot alone justify coverage. 3. Routine screening of patients who are asymptomatic is not a covered service . Serum Iron Studies Serum iron studies include the following lab tests: ferritin, iron, iron binding capacity and transferrin. These tests are used in the evaluation of patients with anemia and iron disorders. Indications Serum iron studies are useful in the evaluation of disorders of iron metabolism, particularly iron deficiency and iron excess. Iron studies are best performed when the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstaine d from medications that may influence iron balance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency. In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to dietary deficiency or malabsorption. Following major surgery, the patient may have iron deficient erythropoiesis for months or years if adequate iron replacement has not been given. High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated. Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflamma tory and neoplastic conditions. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of transferrin, a protein that binds and transports iron. TIBC quantifies transferrin by the amount of iron that it can bind. TIBC and transferrin are elevated in iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy. TIBC and transferrin may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases. The percent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC. Assays for ferritin are also useful in assessing iron balance. Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific. High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromatosis (iron ov erload with associated tissue injury). In these conditions the iron is elevated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated. Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monitoring treatme nt for iron overload. Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, tra uma or necrosis. Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be difficult to interpret. 1. Ferritin, iron and either iron binding capacity or transferrin are useful in the differential diagnosis of iron deficiency , anemia, and for iron overload conditions. 6 2. The following presentations are examples that may support the use of these studies for evaluating iron deficiency: certain abnormal blood count values (i.e., decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit when the MCV is low or normal, or increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and low or normal MCV); abnormal appetite (pica); acute or chronic gastrointestinal blood collection(s); malignant, chronic inflammatory and infectious conditions associated with an emia which may present in a similar manner to iron deficiency anemia; following a significant surgical procedure where blood loss had occurred and had not been repaired with adequate iron replacement. 3. The following presentations are examples that may supp ort the use of these studies for evaluating iron cardiac dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances. 4. Follow -up testing may be appropriate to monitor response to therapy, e.g., oral or parenteral iron, ascorbic acid, and erythropoietin. 5. Iron studies may be appropriate in patients after treatment for other nutritional deficiency anemias, such as folate and vitamin B12, because iron deficiency may not be revealed until such a nutritional deficiency is treated. 6. Serum ferritin may be appropriate for monitoring iron status in patients with chronic renal disease with or without dialysis. 7. Serum iron may also be indicated for evaluation of toxic effects of iron and other metals (e.g., nickel, cadmium, aluminum, lead) whether due to accidental, intentional exposure or metabolic causes. Limitations 1. Iron studies should be used to diagnose and manage iron deficiency or iron overload states. These tests are not to be used solely to assess acute phase reactants where disease management will be unchanged. For example, infections and m alignancies are associated with elevations in acute phase reactants such as ferritin, and decreases in serum iron concentration, but iron studies would only be medically necessary if results of iron studies might alter the management of the primary diagnos is or might warrant direct treatment of an iron disorder or condition. 2. If a normal serum ferritin level is documented, repeat testing would not ordinarily be medically necessary unless there is a change in the patient's condition, and ferritin assessmen t is needed for the ongoing management of the patient. For example, a patient presents with new onset insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and has a serum ferritin level performed for the suspicion of hemochromatosis. If the ferritin level is normal, the re peat ferritin for diabetes mellitus would not be medically necessary. 3. It is ordinarily not necessary to measure both transferrin and TIBC at the same time because TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin. When transferrin is ordered as part of the nutritional assessment for evaluating malnutrition, it is not necessary to order other iron studies unless iron deficiency or iron overload is suspected as well. 4. It is not ordinarily necessary to measure both iron/TIBC (or transferrin) and ferritin in initial patient testing. If clinically indicated after evaluation of the initial iron studies, it may be appropriate to perform additional iron studies either on the initial specimen or on a subsequently obtained specimen. After a diagnosis of iron deficiency or iron over load is established, either iron/TIBC (or transferrin) or ferritin may be medically necessary for monitoring, but not both. 5. It would not ordinarily be considered medically necessary to do a ferritin as a preoperative test except in the presence of anemi a or recent autologous blood collections prior to the surgery. 6. Routine screening of patients who are asymptomatic is not a covered service . Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel Acute Hepatitis Panel includes all of the following tests: Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM antibody (86709) Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb ), IgM antibody (86705) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (87340) Hepatitis C antibody (86803). 7 Indications This panel consists of the following tests: Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM Antibody; Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM Antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); and Hepatitis C antibody. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologie s. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Most cases are caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV is the most common cause of hepatiti s in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti -HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti -HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appea rance. IgG anti -HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates prior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal -oral exposure, parenteral infection is possible during the acute viremia stage of the disease. After exposure, standard immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis. HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -IgM antib ody, HBsAg is the earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, this indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb , in the form of both IgG and IgM antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable two to three months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usu ally remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a much higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum four to six months following exposure, remains positive indefinitely, and confers immunity. HBV is spread exclusively by exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infection. The diagnosis of acute HBV infe ction is best established by documentation of a positive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifyi ng a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgG). Additional tests such as Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and ant ibody, are not included in the Hepatitis Panel, but may be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result i s obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response. HCV is the most common cause of post -transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is responsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti -HCV result. For t his reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When the time of exposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative Hepatitis Panel may need a repeat panel approximately 8 two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the disease. 1. To detect viral hepatitis infection when there are abnormal liver function test results, with or witho ut signs or symptoms of hepatitis. 2. Prior to and subsequent to liver transplantation. Limitations After a hepatitis diagnosis has been established, only individual tests, rather than the entire panel, are needed. This panel is not indicated as a screening test for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C, nor is it indicated as a test to assess for prior vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B.

These include primary disorders such as anemia, leukemia, polycythemia, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Many other conditions secondarily affect the bloo d or bone marrow, including reaction to inflammation and infections, coagulopathies, neoplasms and exposure to toxic substances. Many treatments and therapies affect the blood or bone marrow, and blood counts may be used to monitor treatment effects. The complete blood count (CBC) includes a hemogram and differential white blood count (WBC). The hemogram includes enumeration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as the determination of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and indices. The sympt oms of hematological disorders are often nonspecific and are commonly encountered in patients who may or may not prove to have a disorder of the blood or bone marrow. Furthermore, many medical conditions that are not primarily due to abnormalities of blood or bone marrow may have hematological manifestations that result from the disease or its treatment. As a result, the CBC is one of the most commonly indicated laboratory tests. In patients with possible hematological abnormalities, it may be necessary to determine the hemoglobin and hematocrit, to calculate the red cell indices, and to measure the concentration of white blood cells and platelets. These measurements are usually performed on a multichannel analyzer that measures all of the parameters on eve ry sample. Therefore, laboratory assessments routinely include these measurements. Thyroid Testing : Thyroid function studies are used to delineate the presence or absence of hormonal abnormalities of the thyroid and pituitary glands. These abnormalities may be either primary or secondary and often but not always accompany clinically defined signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more scientifically defined. Tests can be don e with increased specificity, thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by determination of thyroid hormone evels (T3) uptake] are used for diagnosis and follow -up of patients with thyroid disorders. Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex diagnostic problems or on hospit alized patients, where many circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed, calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for abnormal results for eithe r total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein binding effects. Urine Culture, Bacterial : A bacterial urine culture is a laboratory procedure performed on a urine specimen to establish the probable etiology of a presumed urinary tract infection. It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and 15 management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar -based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantification of types present based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols. Prothrombin Time (PT): Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few simple laboratory tests: the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), PT, thrombin time (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test is one in -vitro laboratory test used to assess coagu lation. While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system, the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the reactions that occur after the activati on of factor X. Extrinsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies of factors may be related to decreased production or increased consumption of coagulation factors. The PT/IN R is most commonly used to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic pathway factors. A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an international normalized ratio (INR). T he INR is the PT ratio that would result if the WHO reference thromboplastin had been used in performing the test. Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT testing in patients who are self - monitoring. Therefore, the indications for testing apply regardless of whether or not the patient is also PT self-testing. Serum Iron Studies: Serum ir on studies are useful in the evaluation of disorders of iron metabolism, particularly iron deficiency and iron excess. Iron studies are best performed when the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstained from medications that may influence iron ba lance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency. In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to d ietary deficiency or malabsorption. Following major surgery, the patient may have iron deficient erythropoiesis for months or years if adequate iron replacement has not been given. High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated. Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of transferrin, a protein that binds and transports iron. TIBC quantifies transferrin by the amount of iron that it can bind. TIBC and transferrin are elevated in iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy. TIBC and transferrin may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases. The p ercent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC. Assays for ferritin are also useful in assessing iron balance. Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific. High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromatosis (iron overload with associated tissue injury). In these conditions the iron is elevated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated. Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monitoring treatment for iron overload. Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, trauma or necrosis. Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be di fficult to interpret. 16 Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Most cases are caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti -HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti -HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appearance. IgG anti -HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates prior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal -oral exposure, parenteral infection is possible during the acute viremia stage of the disease. After exposure, standard immune g lobulin may be effective as a prophylaxis. HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -IgM antibody, HBsAg is the earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exp osure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, this indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typical ly becoming detectable two to three months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usually remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a much higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum four to six months following exposure, remains positive indefinitely, and confers immunity. HBV is spread excl usively by exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infection. The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by documentation of a positive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG a ntibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgG). Additional tests such as Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and antibody, are not included in the Hepatitis Panel, but may be of importance in assess ing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result is obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response. HCV is the most common cause of post -transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is responsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti -HCV result. For this reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When t he time of exposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative Hepatitis Panel may need a repeat panel approximately two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the disease.
