I work at a retail store in Springfield, and we have frequent instances of shoplifting. Corporate policy prevents us from reporting it or reacting to it. The reality is that inventory shrinkage due to shoplifting is paid for by all law-abiding customers. Tolerance to shoplifting affects the middle- and working-class residents who live near our store. I guarantee the perpetrators are just as likely to steal from hard-working individuals as they are to steal from our large company.

James Manning's proposal coddles young criminals and tolerates their actions. There is a price to pay for breaking the law and violating property rights. Theft is illegal and unethical, and there must be penalties, however inconvenient, to child and parent. Seth P. Shenker, Eugene Natural gas infrastructure is our bridge to sustainability Laura Allen suggests (Guest View, Feb. 9) that natural gas is a bridge to nowhere. I disagree. Laura Allen: [A bridge fuel to nowhere](https://www.registerguard.com/story/opinion/columns/2021/02/09/guest-view-bridge-fuel-nowhere/4411266001/) The natural gas distribution system can be converted to handle hydrogen, a non-toxic energy gas that can be produced via wind/solar power by dissociation of water. When it burns, it produces water vapor. It can be stored in tanks to provide power when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. The distribution system installed for natural gas is a possible pathway to renewable hydrogen energy distribution. Tom Mossberg, Springfield Free-speech defense is absurd How disgusting it is to see Republicans abandoning their consciences en masse to defend the ex-president! The simple truth is former President Donald Trump deserves prison time as well as impeachment for prodding his followers to invade the Capitol. The claim that he is allowed to say anything by \"free speech\" is absurd. As we were told in high school, freedom of speech does not include yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater. This is worse than that. As a result of the Capitol riots, Trump has the blood of five people on his hands. Lee Rothrock, Springfield Take a page from Idaho One way the city of Eugene can easily guard against more financial crises is to avoid a lawsuit like the one reported in today's Register-Guard about Boise, Idaho. Boise recently lost the settlement against the unhoused, costing it $1.8 million. With few sanctioned sites available to our thousands of unhoused during severe winter weather and the pandemic, it behooves the city of Eugene and Lane County to identify more sanctioned locations and provide sanitation and trash collection. Setting aside ordinances 4.815 (prohibiting camping for resting in public places) and 2.019 (violation of park rules for resting anywhere in the thousands of acres of park land throughout Eugene) also would protect Eugene from a class-action lawsuit similar to the one in Boise. In addition, it would save city money in the $9 million municipal court operating budget by halting sweeps and \"quality of life\" citations. Susie Andrist, Eugene Seek leadership or shelter Watching the impeachment proceedings, I am impressed by the presentation from the House managers. Commentators wonder if they are doing enough and have said that beyond Trump's lack of timely action, the prosecution needs to convince Republicans that Trump incited the violence. Do they really? Or do they need to provide another option that offers coverage for cowardly, self-serving Republicans? Today, the prosecution said that the White House had routinely monitored dark websites and knew what groups like the Proud Boys were planning. The defense will respond that there's no proof Trump knew, so you cannot convict. The follow-up response is this: The White House and Trump should have known. The FBI knew. Surely, it communicated this information to Trump, and if not, the White House should have asked. If Trump didn't know, this in itself is clear evidence that he is unfit for office due to incompetence and willful, partisan ignorance that resulted in the attack on the Capitol. Either he was complicit or incompetent. Republicans can choose to show leadership, or seek shelter. Otherwise, they will go down in history as co-conspirators in the Big Lie of the century that is destroying our republic. Michael Stasack, Eugene Look beyond the mainstream Ubiquitous front-page, above-the-fold COVID-19 vaccination stories now proclaim those 80 and older newly \"eligible\" for this dubious privilege. Moving in the opposite direction, [Italy](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/sdHzCYEY1vFDkxnWWc2x_-M?domain=thelocal.it), [Germany ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/oFTuCZ6G2Vi7PNkqqsJM0gq?domain=cnn.com)and [France ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/OIVmCPNKOZS0vxj11S1hyf5?domain=bbc.com)have simultaneously decided to exclude the older age range \u2014 even those above 55 or 65 \u2014 from these \"novel-technology\" SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations due to lack of data on serious risks in these more vulnerable populations. To protect massive Big Pharma profits from bad press, this data paucity may not be accidental. Especially worrisome in the U.S., the [manufacturers ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/2RrOCQWKP0IXBW211hkubDa?domain=law.cornell.edu)and [government ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-eEHCR6KQoiGnLMDDhqiC92?domain=phe.gov)are immunized from liability for vaccine damages. Thus, we should attend closely to our own post-vaccination \"adverse events\" tracked weekly on the CDC website. Its Jan. 29 Vaccine Adverse Events Reports had [registered ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/XdCTCVO2XPh20AWnnuk9qqF?domain=openvaers.com)11,249 events following COVID-19 vaccinations, including 501 deaths, 1,066 hospitalizations, 147 anaphylaxis shock reactions and 2,447 urgent care visits. These alarming data are 37% of events reported, not even including 1,447 office visits for symptoms of unknown severity. And these document only immediate reactions, ignoring long-term dangers [predicted ](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LJyACW6KY7i6zBMLLs187T5?domain=bitchute.com/)such as [pathogenic priming](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/uZcoCXDXZof4BY8PPsMB5JT?domain=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Why are these essential data absent from our mainstream news? And are vaccination providers obtaining fully informed consent, including advice of [VAERS ](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)data, future risks and liability immunity? Jack Dresser, Springfield Reducing, reusing, (re-thinking) recycling State Senator Lee Beyer's proposed Senate Bill 14 would create a Proposed Stewardship Program placing responsibility for recycling on manufacturers. Related: [Proposed legislation aims to put more recycling responsibility on manufacturers](https://www.registerguard.com/story/news/2021/02/08/proposed-legislation-aims-put-more-recycling-responsibility-manufacturers-oregon-legislature/4364686001/) The onus for recycling has for too long been disproportionately placed on the consumer, resulting in end-of-line disposal rather than front-of-line materials reduction. Plastics and Styrofoam, for example, much of which are non-recyclable, non-biodegradable and/or toxic, are particularly problematic. The conscientious consumer faces a dilemma: cease buying goods packaged in plastic, or buy them and send the plastic waste to the landfill. I opt not to buy non-recyclable plastic or Styrofoam-packaged goods whenever possible. It's difficult, but I'm willing to make the concession. Recently, I mentioned my concern about the overwhelming amount of plastic packaging at Trader Joe's and was met with a shrug and the comment, \"There's nothing we can do about it.\" There is, I contend, but it takes courage and a bit of sacrifice. Retailers, stiffen your backs and tell your suppliers you are phasing out products packaged in non-recyclable containers. Stick to your guns and force manufacturers into compliance. Reduce, reuse, recycle. We all need to practice this directive, but the effort should begin at the top where goods are produced. A. Lynn Ash, Eugene Want to submit a letter to the editor?
