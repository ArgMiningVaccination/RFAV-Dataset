Agenda Item 2 - Review/Ja nuary 18, 2008 Meeting Minutes Dr. Culbert asked to know the status of the continuing education fee project. Ms. Forrest informed the Board that the Divis ion has approved the fee project and has put it out for public notice. She stated that if t he Board adopts the regulations befor e the Board at the June 27, 2008 meeting, those fees wil l also be put in place. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 2 of 22 Dr. Culbert also asked about the late filing fee project that the Board requested. Ms. Forrest stated that the Board c ould ask Ms. Wyatt about this fee project as she will have better information to provide the Board. Dr. Zimmerman commended Ms. Forre st for her thoroughness in wr iting the Board minutes. Ms. Forrest thanked Dr. Zimmerman for this compliment. Dr. Culbert asked about any follow-up done on the license definitions and where in the regulations those definitions would go. Ms . Forrest stated that she had spoken with Jun Maiquis, Regulations Specialis t and that he had stat ed that if the Boar d wishes to further define the licenses it would be appropriate to add that language to the sections regarding the license requirements. Dr. Culber t asked if the Board should put defining license definitions in the Board's Goal's and Objectives. Ms. Forre st stated that this would be appropriate. Dr. Mulholland stated that it was his recollection that the Boar d had put in a regulation project for defining the locum tenens permit. Ms. Forrest stated that this wa s correct, but that the Board had pulled out that section prior to putting the proposed regulations out to public notice. Ms. Forrest stated that Mr. Maiqui s suggested that the Board work on statutory changes prior to trying to further define the curr ent license types as the Board's statutes are very limiting. The Board made no changes to the minutes. Upon a motion by Zimmerman, seconded by Mulholland and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to approve the January 18, 2008 meeting minutes as presented. Agenda Item 3 - Board Business Introduce New Member Dr. Culbert introduced Dr. James Heston, DC to the Board.

Board members agreed that Dr. Culbert should maintain his pos ition of Chair of the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Ethics Reporting There were no ethics violations r eported. Ms. Forrest asked the B oard if it would like to have formal ethics training, offered by the Department of Administration, at t he next meeting. Dr. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 3 of 22 Culbert agreed that this training would be beneficial to have on the agenda if time allows. Ms. Forrest agreed to look further into the ethics training for the Board.

After discussing license renewal and the continui ng education audit procedures, the Board tentatively scheduled the following meeting fo r February 6, 2009 in Anchorage, Alaska. Ratification of New Licensees Dr. Culbert asked Ms. Forrest why the Board was ratifying these licenses and why the Board had never done this before. Ms . Forrest stated she was uns ure why the Board had never ratified new licenses in the past, but that ratifica tion of the new licensees is official recognition by the Board that the licensee has successfully passed the exam and is now licensed. She noted that the mail ballots the Board currently re view are for an applicant to sit for the exam and licensure upon successful completion. She st ated that it is important to have this recognition in a centralized record available to the public, in addition to the individual's licensing file. Upon a motion by Zimmerman, seconded by Mulholland and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to ratify the licenses of William Roesler Tomcykoski Taylor 473, Arnoldo Moran #474, Bobbie Jean Emond Frisk #475, Jennifer Cook #476, James Zielinski #478, Sarah Elizabeth Allen #479, and Jai D Tomlin #480. Expenditure report Chris Wyatt, Administrative Officer for the Divisi on of Corporations, Busi ness, and Professional Licensing joined the meeting at 8:50 a.m. to discuss the Board's expenditure report. Dr. Culbert stated that the current expendit ure report looks as though Board expenses are going down, and asked if license fees will be going down. Ms. Wyatt stated that the Board is doing an excellent job in keeping its expenditures down. Ms. Wy att noted that she had done a quick fee analysis and it appears that the Board may be able to lower its licensing fees by $100-$150 per biennial licensing peri od. Ms. Wyatt stated that she will do an official fee analysis in the near future as the Board will be going through renewals this fall. Ms. Wyatt stated that she would like the Board to have a fee that will remain constant for several licensing cycles and if the Board knows of any r egulations or other lar ge projects, the Board can include those anticipated costs when reviewin g the licensing fees. Ms. Wyatt noted that the Board must cover its costs by statute. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 4 of 22 Agenda Item 4 - Review of FY08/FY09 Budget Information The Board continued its discussion with Ms. Wyatt regarding the Boards budget. Dr. Culbert asked if going thr ough statutory changes would increas e Board expenditures. Ms. Wyatt stated that expenditures would increase as the Department of Law would be involved in reviewing statute changes and those charges would go directly to t he Board. Dr. Culbert noted that the contractual services for Departm ent of Law appeared to be one of the largest expenses to the Board. Dr. Heston asked how the late lic ense filing fee would work. Ms . Forrest explained that the late filing fee is an additional penalty for chiropr actors who submit the renewal application after 60 days past the license expiration date. Dr. Hest on asked how this filing fee is different from a fine for failing to submit cont inuing professional education (CPE). Dr. Culbert stated that the CPE fine can be imposed upon anyone who does not provide the required documentation for CPE on the renewal or during audit. Ms. Wyatt noted that fines imposed through a memorandum of agreement, or consent agreemen t, go into the general fund and not back to the Board. Dr. Culbert asked about travel and the third party reimbursem ents the Board is supposed to receive from the national organizations. Dr. Cu lbert stated that he know s that Board members cannot receive honorariums or receive money fr om the national organizations, but he wanted to verify that the money being received is going back to the Board. Ms . Wyatt stated that she recently found out that these reimbursements ar e not going back to the Board, but are being put in the general fund. Ms. Wyat t stated that this is an accountin g problem that the Division is trying to fix. Dr. Culbert asked where the cont inuing education application fees would go. Ms. Wyatt stated that these fees are consider ed program fees and would go dire ctly to the Board and would appear under the revenue section of the expenditure report. Ms. Wyatt offered to provide the Board with different possibl e fee schedules prior to the Division setting the renewal fee. The Board st ated that lowering the f ee to $630 per renewal cycle was very reasonable. Ms. Forrest stated t hat she will send this information out via mail ballot once it is received by the Division. Ms. Wyatt left the meeting at 9:15 a.m. Agenda Item 5 - FCLB/NBCE/ABCA Report Dr. Zimmerman and Ms. Forrest thanked th e Board for sending them to the FCLB/NBCE/ABCA National meetings. Ms. Forre st stated that the s peakers and subjects covered were exceptional. Dr . Zimmerman noted that issues co vered at the meeting were governmental issues and the effe cts on the discipline process, open government and sunshine laws, regulatory considerati on in worldwide mobility, t he Food and Drug Administration investigatory databases, web casts of board meetings to reduce paperwork and increase board transparency, informed consent, and establis hing positive media relations to educate the public about regulation. Ms. Forre st stated that the discussions on the sunshine laws of other states and live web casting of Board meeting were very interesting and provided good ideas for how to move the Board forward in this new technology era. Dr. Heston asked if the web Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 5 of 22 casts were interactive. Ms. Forrest stated t hat they were in some cases. Dr. Zimmerman stated that the web cast ing leads to better Board transparen cy. Ms. Forrest stated that web casting could allow for greater public interacti on with the Board as many people are not able to travel to Anchorage or Juneau to attend a meeting. Dr. Zimmerman informed the Board that CIN-BAD is going international and that there are a few countries that are already reporting to CIN- BAD. Dr. Heston asked if CIN-BAD is different from the discussion he had read in the previous Board Packet regarding fingerprinting a background checks. Dr. Zimmerm an stated that CIN-BAD only co ntains information regarding a person's chiropractic license an d any regulatory actions taken against that license. Ms. Forrest stated that all member Boards of the Federation of Chiropracti c Licensing Boards are required to submit any actions taken against a license. Ms. Forrest stated that one of t he things she learned at the ACBA meeting is that many other states are going to online rene wals. Ms. Forrest noted that she would like to see the Chiropractic Board have online renewals for the 2011 biennial renewal. She stated that the Division is starting this year to do online r enewals for smaller programs that do not have continuing education requirements. The Board st ated that they would lik e to be one of State Boards who allow licensees to renew online and that this w ould be a good item to add to the Board's Goals and Objectives. Dr. Mulholland asked Ms. Forrest to describe what a 'sunshine' law is. Ms. Forrest stated that this term came from the Florida laws where Boards actions and meetings must be transparent and available and easily accessible to the public. She stated that Alaska's equivalent law for Board and Commissions is the Open Meetings Act. Dr. Zimmerman noted that she had attended the NBCE Part IV Examination Review Committee meeting in Greely, Colorado on June 20-21, 2008, and the Part IV Exam Administration in Portland, OR in May of 2008. Dr. Zimmerman stated that she was impressed with the level of education and under standing of the material that the students demonstrate at these exams. Dr. Zimmerm an stated that she feels t he future of chiropractic is in good hands. Dr. Zimmerman reported that she had donated diagn ostic imaging films to the NBCE received from the Alaska Spine Institut e and Alaska Regional Hospital for future use in the Part IV Exams. Dr. Zimmerman stated that the NBCE accepts the hard copies of x-ray films and MRIs, but unfortunately cannot accept the digital r enditions of these images at this time due to the costs involved with changing the exam . Dr. Culbert thanked Dr. Zimmerman for representing the Board at the Part IV Exam Administration and the Part IV Examination Review Committee. Dr. Zimmerman expressed her opinion that the potential for growth in the chiropractic field is limitless. Dr. Heston asked if chiropractors are being held accountable for interpreting MRI films. Dr. Zimmerman confirm ed that the national board exams are testing on MRI knowledge. Dr. Zimmerman stated t hat the medical boards, doctors of osteopathy, and physical therapists do not have an equivalent exam to the Part IV Exam. Dr. Zimmerman st ated that the Part IV exam integrates physical, orthopedic a nd neurological assessment in combination with radiology studies to insure a more representat ive examination of the chiropractic clinical experience in practice. Dr. Mulholland stated that the American Medica l Association had been present when he previously participated in t he administration of the Part IV Exam. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 6 of 22 Agenda Item 4 - Review of FY08/FY09 Budget Information Ms. Wyatt rejoined the meeting at 9:30 a.m. to discuss a late f iling fee for the Board. Dr. Culbert asked Ms. Wyatt if other programs have late filing fees. Ms. Wyatt replied that there are other Boards that have this type of fee, but she is unsur e of the fee amount. Ms. Wyatt stated that the late filin g fee is unlikely to change the licensing fees. Dr. Culbert stated that the Board's intent when creating a late renewal fee was to penalize those who do not renew timely and are practicing without a license fo r more than sixty days. Ms. Fo rrest clarified that the late renewal fee would go directly to the Board. Ms. Wyatt confirmed t hat this fee would be receipted directly to the Boar d. Ms. Wyatt stated that s he would do some research and provide the Board with the fees other Boards are imposing for renewing sixty days past the license expiration date. The Board thanked Ms. Wy att for her time. Ms. Wyatt left the meeting at 9:40 a.m. Mr. Garness asked if there were any other ra mifications for licensees who do not renew on time. Mr. Garness stated that in his profession as an engineer, any documents he signs off on while his license is expired can be considered nu ll and void. Dr. Culbert stated that insurance companies would be interested in knowing if a chiropractor's license is expired. Dr. Culbert also stated that insurance companies could c onsider billing while a license is expired as insurance fraud. Dr. Mulholland stated that it also depends on the circumstances, if a license becomes expired because the c ontinuing education courses ta ken were not approved by the Board, or if it is sheer negli gence or unwillingness to comply wit h the statutes and regulations. Dr. Mulholland stated that the Bo ard does not have a history of re viewing the actions taken by chiropractors while a license has been lapsed or expired. Dr. Heston asked for clarificati on about the continuing applicat ion fee and if providers would still have to submit the application in advance. Dr. Culbert confirmed that continuing education applications should be received pr ior to the course being offer ed but that the Board has the mechanism through regulation to post approve courses that are su bmitted after the course or seminar has been offered. Dr. Culbert also not ed that Alaska accepts courses approved by the Providers of Approved Contin uing Education (PACE) in additi on to any courses submitted for approval to the Board. Dr. Culbert noted his concern that smaller pr oviders of continuing education would not have financia l ability to go through PACE to become continuing education providers in Alaska. Dr. Mulholland stated that the Board still has regulations that allow for these smaller providers to subm it applications for course approv al. Dr. Heston clarified that the Board accepts both PACE and can approve courses offered by smaller providers. Drs. Culbert and Mulholland stated that this is the case. Dr. Mulholland clarified that PACE is simple an approval body for continuing education. The purpose of PACE is to verify the c ontent of a course, classify the course as a specific type of course, ensure that the instruct or are qualified, and make sure the course meets specific standards. Ms. Forrest stated t hat the Board still has the aut hority to deny a PACE approved course if the course does not meet the requi rements to become approved in Alaska. Dr. Mulholland agreed and stated that although PACE may approve practice management courses, and Alaska licensees may take those courses, practice management courses cannot be applied to Alaska's requireme nt to obtain a minimum number of clinical and diagnostic imaging continuing education credi ts. Dr. Mulholland noted that currently, Dr. Fred Risch, past Board Member, is designated by the Board to veri fy the content of the course and ensure that Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 7 of 22 the instructors are qualified inst ructors, prior to the Board re ceiving the continuing education course approvals. Dr. Heston asked what information Dr. Risch rece ives in addition to what the Board members receive. Ms. Forrest stated that Dr. Risch receives the entire application packet received from the providers, this includes the application, the syllabus or course outline, curriculum vitaes or instructor resumes, information on how attendanc e is monitored, cover letters from the providers, and any other information sent with the application. Ms. Forrest clarified that it is her duty to make sure the application is comple te and all required materials are sent to the Board, Dr. Risch verifies that the courses meet the requir ements of 12 AAC 16.330 and looks for any irregularities or potential problems, and t he Board is responsible for approving courses that meet 12 AAC 16.320. Agenda Item 6 - Application Review The Board reviewed the changes made by Ms. Forrest to the chiropractic licensure applications. Ms. Forrest noted that she had worked with Ms. Jenna Conley, Assistant Attorney General, on creating app lications and worksheets that match the existing regulations. Ms. Forrest noted that on the worksheets she had included the statutory and regulatory citations for each licensure requirement. Ms. Forrest also noted that Ms. Conley had suggested decreasing the number of professional references down from six to three. Dr. Heston asked if anyone ever called these referenc es. Ms. Forrest stated that she does not call the references on a regular basis, but if Board members have any questions regarding an application, either she or the invest igator can contact those references. Dr. Culbert asked why question 24 of the discip linary/investigation/practice questions, \"Within the past five years have you ever had any action reported to the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards' national licensee database? \", is only on the licensure by credentials application and not on any of the other applications. Ms. Forrest replied that the questions come out of the statutes and regulations that provide the Board with grounds for refusing a license, but that question 24 should be on at leas t the locum tenens application if not also the licensure by exami nation application. Dr. Heston asked about the examinations port ion of the worksheet and what the SPEC Exam is. Ms. Forrest replied that she has a di fficult understanding the r egulations surrounding the required National Board of Chiropractic Exam iners (NBCE) exams because the different regulations have different requirements for the same license. Ms. Forrest st ated that if any of the Board members read the regulations differ ently than she does to please let her know and she will update the worksheet acco rdingly. Dr. Mulholland explai ned that the Special Purposes Examination for Chiropractic (SPEC) and Ethics and Boundary (E&B) Exams are post licensure exams that the Board can use to di scipline licensees who have caused harm to a patient, have had to enter an agreement with the Boar d, or to make up for not having a specific NBCE exam as required for licensure. Dr. Zi mmerman explained that the SPEC Exam is used to test the clinical competency of a licensee, while the E&B is used for assessing a licensees understanding of ethical and sexu al misconduct. Dr. Culbert asked Dr. Zimmerman how often these exams are used by other Boards. Dr. Zimmerman stated that she was unsure of the exact numbers, but that the exams were frequently used by other states. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 8 of 22 Dr. Mulholland noted that the Board can us e the SPEC or E&B Exams in memoranda of agreements with licensees but has not chosen to do so in the past. Dr. Mulholland also noted that the SPEC and E&B Exams ar e more for rehabilitative use opposed for punitive use. Dr. Culbert stated that he w ould like to speak with Susan Winton, Investigator, about integrating these exams into Board agreem ents with licensees. Dr. Mu lholland suggested requiring, through regulation, license reinstatement applicants to take the SPEC Exam. Break, off record 10:02 am. Back on Record 10:17 am. Agenda Item 7 - Correspondence 1. Esthetician services - Robert Wheeler, DC The Board discussed the letter from Robert W heeler regarding a chiropractors' ability to provide esthetician services and use the Pa lomar StarLux 500 device in an office of chiropractic. Dr. Zimmerman noted concern that the procedures Dr. Wheeler described were for beautification purposes and not necessarily in line with the practice of chiropractic as defined in AS 08.20.230. Dr. Mulholland agreed and questioned w hether or not the techniques Dr. Wheeler was inquiring about are for the treat ment of the chiroprac tic condition under AS 08.20.100. Dr. Culbert noted that the treatment services Dr. Wheeler was inquiring about did not break the skin and used modalities t hat are regulated by the Board. Dr. Mulholland noted that there di d not appear to be any research to show that the devices Dr. Wheeler was inquiring about caused harm to t he public. Dr. Heston noted concern that esthetician and beautification servic es begins to move away from the subluxation complex and the laws governing chiropractic in Alaska. Dr. Zimmerman noted that t he device Dr. Wheeler inquired about is marketed to estheticians, no t chiropractors, and that she is concerned that the device is being used for an off-label use. Dr. Culbert noted that chiropr actors are trying to affect health from a chiropractic standpoint, but that estheticians are trying to affect health from appearance standpoint. Upon review of the statutes and regulations the Board determined t hat esthetician services can be provided in an office of chiropractic, how ever, the services and device Dr. Wheeler presented to the Board did not appear to treat the chiropractic condition as defined by AS 08.20.100, and any person providing those services must first contact the Board of Barbers and Hairdressers to inquire about required li censure or permitting. Dr. Mulholland was assigned to respond to Dr. Wheeler. 2. Chiropractors using Osteopathic Manipulati ve Therapy CPT Codes - Robert Martinez, DC Dr. Culbert informed the Board t hat he had received an email from Robert Martinez of Premera Blue Cross regarding an Alaskan chiropractors' ability to use Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) Codes and had forwarded the email to Ms. Forrest for the Board to discuss. Dr. Culbert noted that his firs t thoughts were that chirop ractors are supposed to use chiropractic CPT codes and osteopaths use osteopat h codes. Dr. Culber t noted that the way Dr. Martinez phrased his question, it appeared that chiropractors may be able to bill to OMT codes as they are considered physicians un der Alaska law. Dr. Culbert noted that chiropractors treat up to five regions, whereas osteopaths treat up to nine regions, and that many of the treatment regions overlap. Dr. Mulholland stated that in his opinion OMT codes are fundamentally different from chiropractic codes and the use of OMT codes implies that a Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 9 of 22 physician is an osteopath. Dr. Culbert argued t hat according to the wording of the CPT provided by Dr. Martinez, use of OMT codes onl y implies that a person is a physician, not specifically a chiropractor or osteopath, but agreed that the use of OMT codes by a chiropractor is misleading to the public and to insurance companies. Dr. Zimmerman noted that in her opinion, using the current codes , and the definition provided by Dr. Martinez, chiropractors can use OMT billing codes. Dr. Mulholland stated that Board statutes and regulations do not address billing issues. Dr. He ston noted that physicians get reimbursed at a higher rate for using OMT co des opposed to chiropractic codes. The Board determined that Alaska law cons iders chiropractors as physici ans, there are no chiropractic statutes or regulations that prohibit a chiropractor from usi ng OMT codes but that the Board does not endorse such action, and that a chiropr actic physician must be meeting the minimal professional standards of 12 AAC 16.920. Dr. Culbert was assigned to respond to Dr. Martinez 3. Colorado PowerPoll - Scope of Practice - Disabled Person Parking Permits Ms. Forrest informed the Board that she had re ceived a PowerPoll from the FCLB regarding Alaskan chiropractors' ability to issue disabled person parking permi ts. Ms. Forrest stated that it is her understanding that chir opractors can issue the disabilit y rating for the DMV to issue this type of parking permit. The Board stated that Ms. Forrest is correct and that the statutory authority to do so is AS 08.20. 100(b)(7) and AS 08.20.100(b)(8). 4. Croft Guidelines - Alex Campell Ms. Forrest informed the Board that she had received an email regarding the Board's recognition of the Croft Guide lines. Ms. Forrest stated that she unsure of where to find the information regarding Board review of the Croft Guidelines. Dr. Culbert stated t hat the Board had reviewed the Croft Guidelines in a meeting prio r to his appointment to the Board in 2001 or 2002 and suggested that she review those meeting minutes. Dr. Culbert also suggested that Ms. Forrest contact past Board Chair, Dr. Caro l Davis, to obtain further information on Board actions regarding these Guidelines. Dr. Mulholland asked what the Croft Guidelines are. Dr. Culbert stated that the Croft Guidelines are guidelines or appr oximate number of visits a ch iropractor can anticipate giving treatment to a patient for different diagnoses. Dr. Mulholland asked if the guidelines are technique specific, Dr. Culbert rep lied that the guidelines are not technique s pecific, but that if a chiropractors treatment of a diagnoses falls substantially outside of the guidelines that chiropractor may want to reev aluate their technique. Mr. Garness asked if the Board were to adopt in regulation the Croft Guidelines, could insurance companies then use the guidelines to limit treatment. Dr. Zimmerman answered that insurance companies could use these guide lines to limit treatmen t. Mr. Garness asked how this would benefit the public if insuranc e companies cut off patients who needed extended treatment. Dr. Culbert stated t hat the Croft Guidelines, as fa r as he knows, have not been used in such a manner to prevent necessary tr eatment. Ms. Forrest was assigned to review Board actions further and to respond to Mr. Campbell. 5. Montana - Change in processing CE Application Ms. Forrest informed the Board that Dr. Zi mmerman had requested the Montana Board of Chiropractic Examiners to provide this letter to the Board. Ms. Forr est stated that when the Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 10 of 22 continuing education applic ation fee is put into regulation she would be sending out a similar letter to the continuing education providers. Dr. Culbert agreed t hat this is a good idea. There was no further discussion. 6. FCLB/NBCE General Correspondence Dr. Zimmerman informed the Boar d that she had received severa l emails of correspondence from the FCLB and NBCE thanki ng her and the Board for Dr. Zimm erman's participation in the meetings she had attended in the spring of 2 008. Dr. Zimmerman stat ed that she simply wanted to share this correspondence with the Board. Agenda Item 8 - Future Board Travel Plans The Board discussed future travel plans. It was determined that at the January 18, 2008 meeting, the Board approved Dr. Zimmerman to attend the FCLB Regional meeting in Nevada, October 2-5, 2008, and Dr. Mulholland to parti cipate in the Part IV Clinical Exams in Davenport, IO, in November. Dr. Culbert stated t hat it is important for Dr. Heston to attend a Part IV Clinical Exam administration as soon as possible. Dr. He ston stated that he will be available for the May 2009 Part IV Exam and would like to know the locations where he can participate. Ms. Forrest stated th at she would get this information to him as soon as possible. Upon a motion by Mulholland, seconded by Zimmerman and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to send Dr. Heston to th e NBCE Part IV Exams in May 2009. Ms. Forrest informed the Board that there is a conference offered by t he Council on Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation (CLEAR) that the Divis ion may be willing to send her to if she has the Board's support. Ms. Forrest stated that this conference is educational in nature and will cover a variety of administrative and regulatory i ssues that are pertinent to all Boards. She stated that attendance at this will help her to understand her ro le as a licensing examiner better. The Board agreed that Ms. Forrest's attendance at the CLEAR Conference is necessary. Ms. Forrest stated that the Divisi on is also willing to send one Board member to attend the conference, which includes a session on Wednesday September 24 for Board Member training. Upon a motion by Mulholland, seconded by Zi mmerman, and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to send Ms. Veida Forrest to the CLEAR Conference in Anchorage, Alaska, on September 25-27, 2008. Upon a motion by Mulholland, seconded by Zi mmerman, and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to send Dr. James Heston to the CLEAR Conference in Anchorage, Alaska, on September 25-27, 2008 and to the Board Member Training on September 24, 2008. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 11 of 22 Lunch break, off record 11:38 a.m. Back on record 1:15 p.m. Agenda Item 9 - Regulations The Board reviewed the regulations put out for public comment on May 23, 2008. Ms. Forrest noted that there were no public comments received by the Division. Ms. Forrest also noted that there were a few friendly suggestions that were made regarding the regulations and provided the Board with those suggestions as a dr aft dated June 25, 2008. She noted that the first suggestion is to change proposed regulat ion 12 AAC 16.290(e)(2) to read 'title and description of the course' in or der to create consistency within the application process. The Board approved this change. Ms. Forrest directed the Board's attention to 12 AAC 16.340(a)(1) and 12 AAC 16.390(a)(3) and 12 AAC 16.390(b)(3) of the J une 25, 2008 revision. Ms. Forrest informed the Board that these proposed regulations refer enced regulations that were bei ng repealed or changed in the public notice and that the June 25, 2008 revision co rrects these mistakes. She noted that the suggested changes to those sections are c onsidered conforming amendments. She also noted that there were no substantive change s made between the May 23, 2008 version and the June 25, 2008 revision. The Board approved these changes. Ms. Forrest noted that the last fr iendly suggestion is to strike par t of the lead in language of 12 AAC 16.410(a) so that it r eads 'Members of the peer revi ew committee are appointed for staggered terms of two years.' The Board approved this change. The Board made no other changes to the proposed regulations. Upon a motion by Zimmerman, seconded by Mul holland, and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to adopt the proposed regulat ions with revision date June 25, 2008 and presented to the Board by the Di vision of Corporations, Business & Professional Licensing on June 27, 2008. The Board reviewed the Peer Review Committee legislative research conducted and provided to the Board by Gayle Horetski, AAG with the Department of Law.

Executive session, off record 1: 30 p.m. Back on record 1:45 p.m. Dr. Culbert asked if it would be possible to add a scope of practice clause to the omnibus bill that Ms. Winton is working on. Dr. Culbert stat ed that he envisioned such a clause to allow a healthcare provider to use the procedures, skills and training received in school or through continuing education. Dr. Culber t noted that he is asking for th is type of clause because at the previous Board meeting the Department of Law had stated t hat chiropractors cannot do diagnostic testing such as blood analysis, urinalysi s or take tissue samples as these types of diagnostics are not explicitly in cluded in the chiropractic scope of practice laws. Ms. Winton stated that the interpretation t hat the Department of Law had offe red is not the same as her interpretation. Ms. Winton stat ed that when speaking to the pub lic or a complainant she will often note that if an action is not explicitly prohibited by statut e or regulation an d the healthcare provider is meeting the minimum professional standards of practice t hen that action is not illegal. Dr. Culbert noted that he would also like to see clauses on good moral character, background checks and fingerprinting. Ms. Wi nton stated that she had written into the omnibus bill the authority for Boards to reques t criminal history checks and background checks through the use of fingerprinting. Ms. Winton stated that if this por tion passes, it would give all Boards the ability to write into regulation the requirement to submit fi ngerprints for criminal history check as a condition of licensure. Ms. Wi nton also noted that the draft omnibus bill also gives Boards authority to determine continui ng education requirement s and preceptorship and internship requirements. Ms. Winton suggested that Dr. Culbert work with her on the omnibus bill. Ms. Winton asked that if Board members have suggestions for the omnibus bill to please send those suggestions to Ms. Forrest w ho will forward them to Ms. Winton. Upon a motion by Mulholland, seconded by Hest on, and approved unanimously, it was: Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 13 of 22 RESOLVED to appoint Dr. Culbert as Boar d liaison to Susan Winton, Investigator, for work on the omnibus bill. Dr. Culbert asked Ms. Winton if it would be possible to use the NBCE's SPEC and E&B exam as part of the rehabilitative process in an MOA. Ms. Winton stated that the use of these exams is possible but that she needs more information. Dr. Zimme rman offered to provide Ms. Winton with additional information on the SPEC and E&B Exams. Ms. Wint on stated that she will add these exams to her list of possible re quirements for licensee compliance in an MOA with the Board. Dr. Culbert asked Ms. Winton if she would be willing to review the correspondence received from Dr. Wheeler regarding esthet icians. Ms. Winton stated that she would review the letter on an inquiry basis as well as the Board of Ba rbers and Hairdressers regulations to asses whether or not the licensee is infringing on the regulatory authority of that Board. Ms. Winton left the me eting at 2:05 p.m. Upon a motion by Mulholland, seconded by Zi mmerman, and approved unanimously, it was: RESOLVED to accept the investigative report provided by Susan Winton, Investigator. Dr. Culbert urged the Board member s to send their suggestions to Ms. Forrest. Dr. Mulholland suggested giving Boards the ability to write po sition papers. Dr. Mulholland asked if Dr. Culbert would discuss Independent Medical Evaluat ors and their liability for their evaluations with Ms. Winton. Dr. Mulholl and also suggested that Dr. Cul bert speak with Ms. Winton about giving healthcare providers the ability provide t he services and procedures they were trained in. Dr. Heston asked about the stat utes and regulations concerning the chiropractic treatment of animals. Drs. Culbert and Zimmerm an stated that currently only veterinarians can charge for adjusting animals. Dr. Culbert noted that veterinar ians do not refer animals to chiropractors in Alaska at the present time. Agenda Item 11 - Continuing Education Application Review The Board discussed the conti nuing education applications batc hed on February 26, 2008 and June 10, 2008. Dr. Mulholland asked to see the entire file of the cour se \"The Masters Circle - New Patients\" as he had tabled the course for t he entire Board to review. Upon further review of the course, Dr. Mulholland stated that the syllabus, in his opinion, did not meet the requirements of 12 AAC 16.320, as the course appear ed to focus on interpersonal relationship building. Upon a motion by Culbert, seconded by Mulho lland, and approved unanimously, it was: Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 14 of 22 RESOLVED to deny the course \"The Master s Circle - New Patients\" provided by Life Chiropractic College West as it does not meet the requirements 12 AAC 16.320.

Western States Chiropractic College 9th Annual Northwest Chiropractic Symposium Agenda Item 12 - Goals & Objectives Work Session The Board discussed the current goals and objectives, the italiciz ed goals and objectives were added at the June 2008 Board Meeting. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 17 of 22 Dr. Mulholland asked Ms. Forrest if it would be possible for the Board to move to paperless, or online, renewals and to add that to the Goals & Objectives. Ms. Fo rrest stated that it would not be possible for the 2009-2010 renewal per iod, but that the Division as a whole is moving in that direction. Ms. Forrest also st ated that the Division is moving programs and Boards that do not have continuing education require ments to online renewals bef ore moving smaller programs with continuing education to an online renewal program. Th e Board agreed to adding online renewals to the Fiscal Year 2009 (FY09) Goals and Objectives Dr. Culbert stated the he would like to add the utilizatio n of the SPEC and E&B Exams in memoranda of agreements with licensees as par t of the rehabilitation requirements. Dr. Culbert suggested reviewi ng the continuing education r equirements and not ed that the FCLB suggests requiring licensees to take c ourses in documentation and record keeping for license renewal. Dr. Heston noted that when reviewing the cont inuing education regulations he would like to see Alaska require more hours of continuing education and possibly a professional boundaries training. Dr. Mulholland noted that in creasing the number of hours required may force some chiroprac tors to travel in order to meet the continuing education requirements. Ms. Forrest noted that currently the Board allows licensee to obtain up to one- third of the required hours through correspondence or onlin e and increasing the number of hours may not necessarily negativel y affect a chiropractors' abilit y to earn continuing education credits.

Ms. Forrest stated that she is responsible for formatting and compiling the A nnual Report, the Statistical Overview, and typing up the Goals and Objectives. Ms. Forrest also noted that Ms. Winton is responsible for the Investigative Report, Ms. Wyatt is respons ible for the Expenditure Report, and Ms. Karen Wilke, Paralegal, is responsible for the Continuing Education Report. The Board discussed the Narrative Statement and made necessary changes to reflect the accomplishments of the Board in Fiscal Ye ar 2008. The Board discussed the Sunset Performance Audit Recommendations and made chan ges to reflect how the Board met these recommendations in Fiscal Year 2008. T he Board discussed the Budget and Travel Recommendations but did not ma ke any significant changes. The Board discussed its Recommendations for Propos ed Legislation. Ms. Fo rrest stated that this would be an appropriate place for the Board to put in its request for legislation change. Ms. Forrest pointed out to the Board that und er AS 08.20.163 an unlicense d chiropractor can obtain a Locum Tenens Permit in Alaska. The Boar d stated that this is not the intent of the statute but agreed with Ms. Forrest upon review of this statute. The Board stated that the way the statute is written puts the public at risk by potent ially allowing an unlicensed and Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 20 of 22 unsupervised chiropractor to work in Alaska. T he Board agreed that this must be fixed and put it in the Recommendations for Pr oposed Legislation. The Board al so stated that it would like to update some of the antiquat ed language. Dr. Mulholland wa s assigned to write the Board Legislative Recommendations. The Board asked Ms. Forrest what the proc edures are when requesti ng statutory changes. Ms. Forrest stated that she has spoken with Judy Weske, Licensing Supervisor, about how the Board should go about changing its statutes. Mrs. Weske had stat ed that the Board should put its recommendations into the Annual Report. Ms . Forrest also report ed the Mrs. Weske had noted that legislative recommendat ions that are labeled as prot ecting public health are more likely to be taken up by the Depar tment. Ms. Forrest noted that Mrs. Weske had also stated that the Department is limited to the number of bills that it can bring to the Legisl ature and that the Commissioner is ultimately responsible for prio ritizing any legislative requests. Ms. Forrest noted that if the Board's reques t for statutory changes is approved then the Board and Division would work with the Departm ent of Law to write the bill for s ubmission to the Governor's office prior to being introduced to the legislature. Ms. Forrest stated that if the Department does not take up the Board's request for statutory changes then it would be up to the chiropractors in Alaska to lobby their legislator s for statute change. Ms. Forrest stated that it would also be helpful to get the Alaska Chiropractic Society involved. Dr. Culbert thanked Ms. Forrest for including a Goals and Objectives and Annual Report work session on the agenda and thanked all the B oard Members for providing input. Agenda Item 14 - New Business Dr. Culbert asked if any Boar d members had new business they would like to present to the Board. Dr. Mulholland st ated that he had done some re search and found a private investigation business that does background checks on individuals for $50. Ms. Forrest noted that all of the information provided in the backg round check offered by this company is public information and easily available to the public. Dr. Heston noted that the ap plicants still are not fingerprinted and information can still be missed, par ticularly if a person has changed names. Dr. Culbert noted that this ty pe of background check is not as thorough as fingerprinting and criminal history checks, but t hat for the purposes of the Boar d, this level of check may be appropriate. Dr. Mulholland stated that he is concerned about applicants lying on the application. Dr. Zimmerman noted that this type of check, or notification that Alaska may perform this type of check, may help prev ent applicants for lying on the application. The Board discussed preceptors and whether or not they can adjus t in Alaska. Ms. Forrest asked for clarification of a preceptor. Dr. Mu lholland stated that prec eptors are chiropractic students who work in a chiropractic office under the direct supervision of a licensed chiropractor. Dr. Mulholland stated that in order for a lic ensed chiropractor to have a preceptor, that chiropractor must be approved by the school. Dr. Mulholland noted that many preceptors have not taken the NB CE Part IV Exam required fo r licensure in Alaska. Dr. Culbert stated that hi s understanding was that a preceptor is only an exam doctor, not an adjusting doctor. Dr. Mulholland stated that this is not necessa rily the case. Ms. Forrest stated that the current statutes do not allow an unlicense d person to adjust using chiropractic core methodology and the only way she can see allo wing a preceptor to practice in Alaska is if that person is in the process of applying for full licensure and requests a temporary permit. Dr. Board of Chiropractic Examiners June 27, 2008 Page 21 of 22 Mulholland asked if the Board woul d be willing to look further into this type of permitting. Dr. Zimmerman stated that she would like to see how other states regulate preceptors before working on preceptorship regulat ions. Dr. Culbert suggested that the Board add the review and possible writing of prec eptorship regulations to the Fiscal Year 2009 Goals and Objectives. The Board agreed to this suggesti on. Dr. Mulholland wa s assigned to bring additional information on other Stat es' preceptorship programs or laws to the next meeting. Dr. Culbert suggested that the Bo ard table this discussion Agenda Item 15 - Public Comment There were no visitors for public comment.
