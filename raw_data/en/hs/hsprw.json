Last week, we started to delve into the Holistic Health Movement of the 1970's as an extension of American preoccupation with alternative healing. As you learned in those readings, the Holistic Health Movement and New Age religious values are so entangled as to be inseparable. This week, we'll be exploring more about what informs New Age and American Metaphysical understandings of the world, common orientations despite the vast number of practices that fit under the umbrella of New Age practices, and some common criticisms aimed at the movement. A few themes that begin in these readings and continue throughout the semester include: questions of re-interpretation and continuity, issues of appropriation and syncretism, and the evolution of the New Age and Holistic Health movements in relation to the spiritual and medical marketplace. CHOICE PROJECTS: Last week, part of your assignment was to: - - Review the [assignment details for the Choice Project](https://sites.gsu.edu/rels3700cam/choice-project/)(and the [videos](https://sites.gsu.edu/rels3700cam/choice-project-videos/)where I describe my expectations more in depth) and - Update the notes [Project Progress googlesheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LBmwqVc13GZv26ses9muDlfNovBptK_6jAraGXnXh0/edit?usp=sharing) - Review the If you haven't already, do that IMMEDIATELY. Next, [create a page](https://help.edublogs.org/pages/#Create_New_Page) on your EduBlogs and title it the name of the first project you are going to tackle. In this page, I want you to give me as many detail as you can about what project you've chosen - what's the project, what's the topic or healer or modality you'll cover, etc. If you're attending a healing session or interviewing someone, post that information here and wait for approval from me before you reach out to the healer. I'll communicate with you via comments, so make sure to respond promptly to my comments. This is also a space where you'll post drafts of the materials, so I can keep track of your progress. Again, it's important that you promptly respond to any comments or advice I post in the comments. I'll also ask you to make adjustments or turn something in; these individual due dates are always on Sunday evenings, unless otherwise negotiated with me.

For both the oppressed and oppressor in varying ways. It causes mental, physical, emotional and spiritual harm. It is a sickness. A dis-ease that results in people of color, especially Black and Indigenous womxn, enduring violence - physical or otherwise - day in and day out. It disconnects while people from their heart space + robs them of inner peace. As Toni Morrison said \"if I take your race away, and there you are, all strung out. And all you got is your little self, and what is that? What are you without racism? Are you any good? Are you still strong? Are you still smart? Do you still like yourself? I mean, these are the questions. Part of it is, 'yes, the victim. How terrible it's been for Black people.' I'm not a victim. I refuse to be one... if you can only be tall because somebody is on their knees, then you have a serious problem. And my feeling is that white people have a very, very serious problem...\" This is a POTENT time my bbs. We are ALL being called upon to step the fuck up and wake ourselves from slumber. We are undergoing an intense re-activation. Are you ready? Are you working with the energy, or straining against it? Are you committed to healing the trauma that is white supremacy and creating an entirely new reality? I sure as hell am.
